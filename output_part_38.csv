THIS POT IS TINY AND HAS THE MOST INCONVENIENT PLACE FOR AN ON/OFF BUTTON/ IN ADDITION THE SPILLING OF THE COFFEE POT IS ALMOST UNAVOICABLE AS YOU HAVE TO BE SURE AND OPEN THE LID SO WHY IS THERE A LID IF IT HAS TO BE OPEN. THERE ARE NO OTHER GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT AND OVERPRICED FOR WHAT IT IS. THE #1 POINT IS THAT IT WORKS
"It was good while it lasted in good condition. However, within less than one year the enamel of the base started peeling off and getting rusty. When I contacted customer service asking if it was normal it took them a month to get back to me (they say they have a high volume of claims, already a red flag). Their answer was for me to cut off of the cord and send them a picture so they would send me a new body (not a whole unit, just the body). Given their promptness in answering me, I would’ve had to buy a coffee machine in the meantime, so I ended up just getting a new one myself. Amazon did offer me a refund given the circumstances."
"Water passes thru filter way to fast to develop flavor, resulting in watery coffee.Coffee is not hot after brewingThe measurements on the carafe and tank don't match up.Measurements on carafe are not 180° across Making it harder to tell the level when water is not still."
"Wasn't super impressed with this coffee maker, a lot of water evaporated during the brewing process and it stopped working after 3 months."
"The unit is cheap. After 2.5 months, it stopped working. The ""on"" switch lights up, but does not brew, nor does the carafe get warm. That is a rude awakening, in the early hours."
"I wanted a small coffee maker that was simple. This one fits the bill but when you pour the coffee out the carafe dribbles almost every time. At first I would hold it over the sink when I poured the coffee into my cup but then I had to wipe the coffee off the carafe. Now I hold a napkin against the carafe when I pour but the hot coffee gets on my hands sometimes and while it doesn’t burn me it is still uncomfortable. I’m not returning it because the dollar amount is too small and I don’t want to ship it somewhere it will just be thrown out. I’ve had my fair share of coffee makers in my life but I have never had one with this problem. I’d like to apologize to Mr. Coffee. I’m sorry I didn’t stick with you, sir. If you will have me I’d like to give you back your spot on the kitchen counter, it can be just like old times."
Had this coffee maker just a little over a month and it stopped working all together. So now I have to buy another coffee maker. Not happy about having to buy another one so soon. Do not buy this coffee maker.
"Pretty small, but good if you live alone"
"received this coffee maker on 12/30/2023. Stopped working  on 03/6/2024. Didn't work very well when it worked. You could get a cup of coffee, but to get it started again, I had to bang it. Permanent coffee grounds place is a joke. Had coffee grounds all over, including my coffee. Buy a better machine"
It doesn’t get as hot as i like it. Always have to microwave coffee after brewing
This coffee maker is at a good price but it has it's own problems . It leaks under the bottom and also the coffee canister and the reservoir does not match 3 cups in the coffee canister is 2 cups in the output of coffee maybe that's the leak at the bottom
very flimsy. I should have gone to Walmart.
Cheap quality!
Makes good coffee but does not have auto shutoff feature.This is not safe.
works great for small counter space. Get two cups per pot.
"I contacted them because right after I started using the maker, the heating element coating started coming off. They said it wasn’t covered by their warranty. Pathetic."
"Stopped working after one pot of coffee. Like many products today, this one is garbage. Do not waste your money chasing a deal, this product is cosplaying as a coffee maker, but is actually trash."
"Small and doesn't take up much space.  Quick brewing. Basket wobbles slightly and will sit in the brewing area with a lean unless you press down well.  Lid lifts to the left so for left handed people, that sucks.  Heats up very well.  Has a strange popping noise whilst brewing that can be loudly annoying.  Cleaning is not too bad and quite easy to get into the water well area.  Seems to drip water onto the hot plate a lot especially when the basket isn't perfectly level.  No auto off or timer; just on and off.  That's it.  It works well, a little loud, and no auto off.  Do not get this one if you have anxiety about forgetting things!"
"Nothing to get excited about. If you need a cheap drip coffee maker, here you go. Mine arrived with one of the tiny hinge pins on the lid broken and no instructions. It seemed new, not used or returned, but who knows? I can still use the lid carefully, just a bit wobbly. It makes a fast cup of coffee and keeps the pot warm. It takes whatever paper filters I have on hand even though they are for a larger size. The plasticky feel and low quality does not bode well for long life. It works okay and it would be cheap to replace. You get what you pay for."
"First of all, the basket is too small for the filters, so you have to insert the filter carefully, push it down on the bottom, and lift the water arm over the filter - otherwise, the filter will collapse and water goes between the filter and basket instead of over the coffee.  Secondly, the water in the filter drains very slowly and if you use too many grounds it overflows.  Finally, the water levels on the glass pot are not equal to the ones on the fill line on the side of the coffee maker (e.g., level ""3"" on the pot = about 2-1/2 on the water tank.)  Oh, one more annoyance - the fill numbers on the tank are difficult to read.  It amazes me that a company that just makes coffee machines can't get the basics right."
"Pros - It brews a good, hot cup of coffee and keeps the coffee hot on the heating plate. Also like that it’s simple and easy to use.Cons - The pour spout on the pot is TERRIBLE. You have to pour it at just the right speed and angle, otherwise it spills everywhere. Also, brews slightly less than the amount you put in the water tank. I usually have to fill it up past the 5 for it to brew the full 5 cups."
"I bought this coffee pot primarily because I wanted one with automatic shut off which the description of this one said it had.  I accidentally left it on and when I came home from work nine hours later it had not shut off and the bottom was burnt.  It is a nice machine and makes good coffee, but the description needs to be changed because it is misleading advertising."
"It worked to make coffee, but when I removed the pot mid way of coffee brewing, the coffee continued to flow and it made a mess. I reseated the basket and checked the spring, but the same thing happened on the subsequent pot. I sent it back."
"Saving about $10 on two seemed to be a a good bet. One came almost as if new with the booklet, plastic around it and clean. It looked to be unused. It works great. Other one came with no internal packing and dried coffee grounds fell off the coffee maker when I removed the coffee maker from the box. Grimy around the heating element per image. Also; piece of plastic in box. As image shows . . . it was part of the water tank. This one is useless. The Amazon quality control was; to be polite,"" less than average"" this time around. Anything that is food or beverage related I will most likely buy new in the future. Returning defective one."
"I loved this little coffee maker until it stop working. Warranty lusts for 12 months, but after 17 month on/off switch broke.BTW average coffee maker life span is 5 years"
"Before you crack the carafe by leaving it on by mistake, get and use a timer to shut it off after and hour or two.  Not as good as my previous ""5 cup"" Mr. Coffee, sometimes the coffee grounds get past the filter and into the coffee, no matter how careful I am using the small size filter and straightening it up when inserting it, if needed.  The carafe does normally pour without spilling the coffee like my old one often did, so it has a better shape.  The warmer is rusting after one year of normally making one pot of coffee a day. It does make tasty coffee for my non-picky palate and keeps it hot.  So not bad, but it could be better."
"I've used this coffee maker for YEARS....never had a problem with them....till now, only had it a couple weeks & the ""arm"" stopped working!!!!  Have to move it by hand so it'll make the coffee!!!  And, it cost $5.00  more than the last one!!!"
"This seems fine for what it is, but the description says it has a 2-hour automatic shutoff feature -- it does not."
"This coffee pot was good while it lasted. Unfortunately that was almost exactly 3 years total before it gave out on me. It didn’t show any signs of issues, it just suddenly didn’t work at all. I’ll give it one star for each year it worked."
"Bought this last December. Has worked well, but no matter if I fill to 5 cups or 4 it only brews one cup less than that! Don't know where the water goes. Seems kind of flimsy too.  Will have to try another brand."
"Replacing my beloved Mr Coffee 4 cup when it's carafe was broken.  Cheaper to just but new unit.  Unfortunately, new one has been one step forward, and two steps back. It is slower, noisier and cannot pour a cup w/o making a mess all over.  Wish I had bought a different unit.  Live and learn"
For the price
Product description was incorrect. Start with no reusable filter came with maker luckily the old one fits. Next shutoff is not a 2 hour haven’t left it in long enough to find out past 2.5.
"I purchased this coffee pot for a trip I was taking to someone's home who didn't have a coffee pot. I needed something small for myself that wouldn't take up a lot of room. I set up the product but was unable to use it at first because it did not have a filter. I guess I misread the listing and the removable filter was not included. I got paper filters and used those, but I had to be careful when closing the lid. The water arm is supposed to swing over the basket on it's own when closing, but it always caused the filter to fold down and grounds to come into the pot.But the weirdest thing is that it is impossible to make a full 5 cups with this machine. I would fill up the water reservoir with a full five cups, turn the machine on to brew, and end up with 4 cups of coffee. I still cannot figure out where that 5th cup of water goes! Overall, this machine was a great disappointment."
"Put water into the reservoir and some leaks out onto the plate.Pour coffee into the cup and the ""lips"" on the top of the pot cause water/coffee to dribble onto the counter/table.The designer must have been drunk! I thought with the brand name ""Mr. Coffee"", they would have perfected such mistakes!!!"
"The lid opens to the right making it very awkward for left hand users. No one wants to be fumbling around at 5am with the coffee maker. That's said it was a decent cup of coffee. Please consider correcting this flaw.  AS a left handed person I have to adjust and adapt to the right handed world all day long, I don't want to start adjusting to it at 5am. Thanks."
"I love this little Mr Coffee, but could have saved money getting it at Target!  Trusting Amazon to be the best price didn’t pay this time!🥴"
It takes a long time to brew the coffee. Sometimes the filter gets clogged.
"I'm writing this review about 7 months after I bought it. If you are looking for an inexpensive coffee maker with nothing fancy, this will work very well for you. That's what I thought I wanted. But there are some things about that just don't work for me. Note that I bought this one after my 4-cup Mr Coffee coffeemaker stopped heating up.  They stopped selling that one so I thought this one would be an acceptable alternative. It isn't.One of the bigger annoyances for me is the location of the power switch in the front.  It's set up just so that if anything is pushed up against it, it will turn on.  I set up my coffee the night before so I can just turn it on the next morning and have coffee.  I didn't need it to be on a timer. But my roommates, making stuff after I go to bed, have accidentally turned it on, on more than one occasion.  I've also accidentally turned it on when it wasn't prepped and ready to go, causing it to have issues since it's heating up with no water in it.  It wasn't until started making noises that I realized it was on.  Thus, when I'm not using it, I have to unplug it, every time.The top part opens up like most normal coffee makers, but any condensed water is going to spill right out of it. If you don't have the decanter on the base, it will  very often just pour straight down there. It's at least a couple of tablespoons of water.My last main complaint is with the decanter itself. It's very easy to spill the coffee while pouring. I haven't found out ""the trick"", it doesn't matter if you pour it slow or fast. At some point, some coffee is going to spill out.If you can endure the above, then it does the job it was intended to do. I just feel like it could have gone through QA a few more times."
I was surprised that this coffee maker doesn't shut off automatically. I  didn't know they still made them like that.
"This coffeemaker worked just fine…..until it didn’t.  I ordered this in Oct of 2023 and it is now Sept of 2024. The on/off switch has broken. Tried getting into the bottom to see if I could somehow repair the switch. The screws have a shape that would not allow any of our  screwdrivers to attach. I have had coffeemakers that last for many years, therefore will not buy this one again and perhaps not even this brand."
"Great product, does its job.  Only problem is it almost burned my house down.  Make sure you are aware that it doesn’t auto shut off."
It's okay I like the older stuff style pots better. But it's okay.
This maker pops as much as my cheap one did and it burns coffee if you leave it for 30 minutes.
The capacity was smaller than expected - this is truly a mini coffee maker! It makes two average size mugs of coffee. The heating element doesn't keep the coffee very hot.
"I bought this as a replacement for a older Mr. Coffee 5-cup maker but never realized how important the small details were. This unit's lid has a hinge on the left, instead of the back, and does not flop very far. I am forever knocking into it and causing it to close unexpectedly. Also, although this has a little window that lets you see the water level, it is on the back of the machine?! Finally, many grocery stores do not carry small-sized filters. The regular-sized ones worked fine in the old machine, but the ""shower head"" in the new one swings sideways out of the way when you are loading the grounds basket. If you let the ramp on the lid self-close it, the top of the filter bunches up and the water runs around it, not through it. Unless you want a very weak cup of coffee, you MUST swing the nozzle back manually, instead. Sadly, I think I am going to have to chuck this machine."
"This is is a 5 cup coffee maker and the coffee does  taste fine.  However, it is very light weight. flimsey and noisey.  The quality is not like Mr Coffee products I have purchased in the past, Maybe I just got what I paid for.  I'll not buy another coffee pot sight unseen."
It's a fine coffee maker.  It works.  But it seems the designers worked overtime trying to make a coffee maker optimally fit for right-handed people and equally (un)optimally not fit for left-handers.
"Easy to use just by adding water, a filter, and grounds then hitting the power switch.  Cleans easily too.  I only have two issues.1 - put in 5 cups of water but get back 4 cups of coffee -okay and understandable.  The carafe is for 5 cups asa five cup coffee maker though and you cannot add more water to the reservoir due to the oveeflow cut out in the back thatw would just spill the water all over the counter.2 - the heating element under the pot is too hot.  It is so hot, when I originally pour it into my travel tumbler,  I have to add a couple ice cubes to keep from burning my lips.  If I don't use all the coffee right away, I have to turn off the machine otherwise it will scorch the coffee.  If I leave 2 cups in the carafe and come back and hour later to refill my cup, it will have reduced down to a little less than a cup and a half and smell slightly burnt.  Leave it for 2 hours and you'll have a scorched dry coffee crust in your pot and a fire hazard.  I now fill my cup and turn it off.  When I want a refill, I put the remaining coffee I. The microwave to heat it back up instead of leaving the pot on.If you want a Large cup of coffee i. The morning and then are done.  This is great.  Want to refill through the morning, get a pot with better temp control instead."
"Got up. Pushed the ON button. Green light came on. Sat down with newspaper. After 15 mnutes went to get my first cup and . . .  NO COFFEE! Water heating element and pump are shot. I can repair most anything, but access screws are security tri-wing type.Not worth the effort anyway.  Instead of research, I bought the unit on advice from a neighbor. It's a cheap piece of junk. $25 price tag should have been a telling sign."
"Bought Mr. Coffee machine after trying Keurig, but wasn't satisfied with the coffee taste. The coffee tasted much better in the Mr. Coffee.  Unfortunately this one died 6 months after using. The on/off switch won't  work. Seems we say all too often, ""They just don't make things like they used to.""!!!  Trying a Black & Decker this time. Fingers crossed!"
Every time I get one of these (cause I'm an idiot but I love them and most places sell just 1 brewers that die just as fast) it gets too about 3-6 months then you can hear the gnomes banging around in it to make it work! Can we fire them please?! They are noisy neighbors...
"I just reordered this coffee maker to replace the one I purchased only 16 months ago, which stopped working."
"Today, our coffeemaker stopped working. We bought this last Nov 2023. We loved it bec it was just the right size for our kitchen area and we use it when we want to brew 2 big cups of coffee instead of the single cup keurig we have. But now the switch stopped working. It won't click as if something was loose inside. We couldnt open it so we just have to throw it away."
"This appears to be a product designed by marketing people who do not actually use the product.  Here are some of the issues with this new but not improved design.Difficult to measure water:As you you fill the glass carafe, your finger or thumb is close to the fill level marks so it is difficult to measure how much water is in the carafe compared to the previous design which is apparently not available for purchase.Difficult to insert paper filters:When you insert a paper 4-cup filter, the plastic holder is too small and tends to distort the paper filter requiring extra time to position and shape the filter so it fits.  It is important to position the filter properly to prevent the edges folding over and allowing water to flow behind the filter paper which can create a mess.  Quite annoying that the new design makes this simple step difficult.Difficult to gauge water level:When you add water to the reservoir, the view window is quite small and difficult to see compared to the previous design.  Mr Coffee makes the incorrect and misleading claim that it is easy to read the water level window.Difficult to clean glass carafe in a dishwasher:The carafe lid does not flip back all the way which makes it very awkward to place in a dishwasher."
"I got this Mr. Coffee 5 cup to replace a 4 cup Mr. Coffee that I liked but eventually, stopped working well. This one does not make good coffee, it overflows and doesn't get hot enough. Also, it is very slow, and you cannot get a cup until it's finished because if you lift the pot, it keeps dripping! I'm very disappointed!"
It came broken.
"Worked fine for about 1 1/2 years and then quit working. The button to turn on and off doesn’t work, so I had to toss it in the trash. Not built to last. I’d recommend buying one with a more traditional switch that won’t malfunction rather than a button to start brewing"
"In general I like Mr. Coffees.  I ordered this one to replace my old one.  If I had realized how extremely right-handed the new design was, I would have ordered a different product.  The top opens to the left (instead of to the back like my old one), and in order to fill the water reservoir I have to either fill it right-handed or turn the unit completely around to use my left hand to pour.  Similar but not as extreme an issue for the coffee grounds. The designers did not at all take into account that 10 to 12% of the population is left-handed.  They could have easily kept their old design that didn't favor either direction."
"The 2 hour cut off feature doesn't work, I forgot to turn it off before work and came home 6 hours later on my lunch break and it was still on. That was one of the main reasons I purchased this. The Coffee doesn't stay hot and if you leave it in the coffee pot for longer than 10-15 minutes before pouring a cup it tastes burnt. When pouring into cup you have to he careful it's at a certain angle and pour really slow, if not it spills everywhere which I found to be weird. Also some reviews say you can use the larger coffee filters 8-12 cup if you fold over the edge of basket but that's a bad idea. It has a swing design thing inside and when you close the lid it closes that also and it will snag the filter and makes a huge mess so I advise to use the small filters. I only used the larger ones because that's what I had already opened. I went back to using my old coffee maker because of all the issues. Also this said it was a 2 day Amazon Prime delivery but I bought it on April 3rd and it wasn't scheduled to arrive until April 9th. Then I received a notification saying delayed and didn't get it until April 11th."
After one year the heating element takes nearlyone hour to brew 5 cups. Ive cleaned several times but wouldn’t buy it again!
"I love Mr Coffee and have used them for years. I needed and ordered new one and the base was so hot that it evaporated/burned up the coffee left in the pot after about an hour. I returned that one and ordered another which does the same thing. So I have to keep the pot turned off and heat my cup in the microwave. Not good.**** I wanted to add, because I see a lot of people are complaining about the filter, that I bought the reusable filter so no paper filter required. I have been using reusable for years in my coffee pots. They work great. No paper waste and some paper filters are bleached."
I used this machine in an airbnb and loved it so got one but it was a mess. The carafe leaked no matter how carefully I poured it. The water didn’t dispense fully from the heat chamber to the filter/carafe. I returned it.
It said had a two hour timer and does not!
"My new coffee pot top opens from the right, you can only pour water into it from the right, and you can only put the basket into it from the right. I’ll be putting it on the curb for free as soon as its replacement arrives. The replacement opens towards the back and can be used from any direction."
"It made it about a year of almost daily use before it just started to get very slow in heating up the water. What once took less than 5 minutes to get a small pot of coffee now takes nearly 20. Tried decalcifying and all that, no improvement. Will try purchasing a different brand for replacement, but it was great while it lasted."
No auto shut off is a huge negative. Didn’t realize until after I bought it. But just a warning if you want auto shut off. Stays on until you shut off. Not a fan
"I've been using Mr. Coffee makers for decades.  I stick with something if I like it, so when my last one finally stopped working I ordered a new one.  I couldn't find the exact one anymore but I ordered the most similar one.  It has a wand inside that moves over the grinds to add the water as it brews. I have to move this wand out the way when adding the coffee and I find this annoying.  If this was the only issue I would still be okay with it; however, I have a much more annoying issue.  I'm older now and my eyesight is not as good as it used to be and I can barely see the measurement lines. I have to use a flashlight to know exactly how much water I have added.  I did not have this problem with my last Mr. Coffee. This won't be a problem for everyone but it is a major one for me!"
"I liked this coffee maker for the first few months.  I clean it by using a wet paper towel and dry it off with a dry paper towel.  I use no chemicals or cleaning products on this product.  The plate where the coffee urn sits is actually rusting!  I've had it for 7 months, so based on this defect, I would not recommend this coffee maker."
"The coffee maker works fine but it forces you to do everything right handed.1. The measurement markings on the pot only show when you hold it with your right hand.2. The lid of the machine opens with a hinge on the left side making it impossible to pour using your left hand.3. …also adding in the coffee grounds must be done with your right hand due to the lid.The coffee maker works, but it’s pretty annoying as a left hander"
Product worked as described for a few months but then just stopped working. Will give the green light indicating it is getting power but will not brew or heat. It’s a “Meh” product. Not bad for the price though…
"First, I tired to use THEIR contact site but there's NO PLACE to write anything in. Apparently you submit your info and they call you?I had a Mr Coffee for YEARS. It was my moms and worked perfect. However the warmer was rusting, so I bought a new one and donated the old one to the Salvation Army.BIG MISTAKEI thought, at first, the new one was ok but noticed a few things:FIrst, the plastic grounds cup was redesigned with LESS PLASTIC... it's just slightly smaller.So, guess what happens and happens ALL THE TIME. The standard paper filter FOLDS INTO ITSELF about every third time and you get a POT O GROUNDS. Great!Next... they've used a CHEAPER spring valve system so EACH TIME I remove the pot, you get COFFEE dripping on the warmer! Wonderful!Finally - they also redesigned how the hot water is dripped into the grounds. Now it's swivel bracket instead of being BUILT IN to the lid. CHEAPER TO MAKE.I wasn't going to write this review initially but since the Mr. Coffee contact system won't actually let you CONTACT them with a message, I decided to go ahead and write a scathing review of this USELESS ANNOYING and HORRIBLE DESIGNED product.So, again about every third pot, I get a folded over wet filter where the grounds have spilled out to the lower part of the plastic cup, to the coffee pot itself, and into MY COFFEE CUP. I've included two photos. One shows the filter collapsed into itself where the grounds now freely flow OUT of the filter and IN my coffee.  As STRAIGHT AS I CAN MAKE, it still folds IN frequently because of the NEW DESIGN OF THIS CUP. Since they wanted to save a few cents in plastic, it's smaller and the walls are steeper which allows the paper to fold into itself.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. LOOK FOR A QUALITY PRODUCT.IT'S A SHAME THEY'VE DONE THIS BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT SAVING A FEW PENNIES TO PAD THE POCKETS OF THE CORPORATION."
"I just hate it when i buy something and it is quickly apparent it will go to a landfill. Mr. Coffee re-worked the original ""switch"" appliance and what while the ""switch"" is still there (albeit smaller and with a tiny little LED to show power) - just about everything else for this 5 cup coffee maker is poorly designed.The water level window. Obviously this little window was never to be used to actually show water level. The marks are unreadable - and I have to turn the whole coffee maker 90° to actually see the window. Oh - and it does help to rub your finger over the inside of the clear plastic to see the levels.From the first batch to the current batch the coffee produced has been weak. Too make two 13 oz cups of coffee, I use 4+tablespoons of Starbucks medium roast House Blend.  What comes out of this thing is something far less than medium anything.I don't like sending back a product that i have used for a refund. However, this thing has got so many things just wrong there is little other choice."
"Every morning I wake up and look forward to my 1st cup of coffee. I stumbled to the kitchen where I load up my coffee maker only to have a warm cup of coffee. After adding my creamer, it is not that warm at all. I have to use the microwave for about 30 seconds. Yes I use creamer, I don’t drink my coffee black. If you drink your coffee, Black, please just tell me who hurt you."
"Problems, from top to bottom - there are so many that i hope i dont miss amy.1. The lid flips up to the side instead of straight back. Unusable by lefties.2. The lid condenses the steam like any other coffee pot, but the shape of the lid forces water into the caraffe/hotplate side when opened. Because the shape of the lid holds water while open, it also does this when closed.3. The lid (yes, we havent gotten past lid problems yet) has a pokey bit that looks like it is supposed to swing the terrible shower arm forward, but it is too far forward - it doesnt work and prevents the lid from closing if the shower arm is pushed back.4. The shower arm is manually swung off or over the basket instead of it happening automatically. Because it also isnt stable after swing, it requires holding in the back position whenever there is coffee basket business to take care of.5. The shower arm blocks some of the reservoir when pushed back6. The basket is slightly too small when you get ~1/4 of the way through the stack of filters. This causes the filter to bend inwards and makes it difficult to pour in the grounds.7. The basket stopper is off-center & closer to the back. Initially i didnt think this was an issue, but when combined with problems 1-6, it makes for an extremely specific order of operations for the coffee pot; you cant just make coffee how you always have.8. The caraffe has flat walls instead of tapered ones that makes it difficult to clean9. The caraffe drips down the front of itself when pouring and coffee drips off the bottom corner10. The on/off toggle doesnt have auto-off. It just stays on if you forget.11. The heating element isnt strong enough to make coffee, so you have to fill the reservoir with hot water.I have had this coffee pot for about 4 months, and i now hate mornings thanks to mr. coffee."
"Bought this for my mother and the size is just about perfect, the coffee is brewed well (personal preference would be for it to drip just a bit slower to pull more flavor, but that's just my opinion). Simple, no-frills coffee maker that would get 5 stars if it had an auto shut-off. Didn't even realize they still made coffee makers without, so now am off in search of another for her."
I used to have another Mr. Coffee maker that lasted 20 years. This unit is designed a little different you need to make sure the arm will not move the filter. The basket is a little on the small size for the filters. It also fits one way.  I like that I can open the lid while the unit is brewing and add more water if I want more coffee.
"This is a very simple, basic, small coffee pot. It does not have automatic shut off, clock, or timer. It is very affordable. When you lift the top up after brewing,  the design allows residual water to flow back into the open basket area and drip onto the hot plate which will cause the coating on the hot plate to erode if you don't wipe the water up quickly. It also seems to take excessive time to brew 2-3 cups. if you're looking for an inexpensive, no frills coffee pot, this is a satisfactory choice."
"I have use Mr. Coffee 4 or 5 cup coffee makers every morning for the past 40 years.  This latest design is inferior to the design of the model previously made.1) The fill lid now is hinged on the left side instead of at the rear as the prior model.  I am right-handed so that doesn't inconvenience me.  But for left-handed persons it would be very inconvenient to pour water into it.2) The ""shower head"" than drips the heated water over the coffee grounds no longer flips back to expose its underside when you open the lid.  That is very inconvenient for cleaning since the underside gets coffee grounds deposited on it during the brewing of every pot.3) The water-fill level is now more difficult to read with accuracy.  It is now extremely narrow and the plastic is somewhat clouded, not clear.  Since the unit is black, there is dark background when viewing through the plastic.  I have to shine a flashlight in top just to see the water level.The only improvement is the decanter.  In the previous design, the decanter narrowed substantially to a very small diameter opening.  That made cleaning the decanter very inconvenient.  This decanter does not narrow at all....it is full diameter at the top so cleaning is very easy (I wish it did narrow a little like larger Mr. Coffee makers do since that would make pouring more secure).  I also think the glass is a bit thicker."
"works good but while it's perking, it has a constant ""clicking"" sound!  I had the same coffeemaker before (but a different ""on/off"" switch) and it didn't ""click""?!"
"Worked well for one year.  I bought it Feb of last year,  and it was good,  until yesterday when it just stopped working.  Green light comes on,  but water doesn't come through the grounds,  and doesn't heat.  I cleaned it to make sure not clogged with grounds,  but still nothing.  Guess it only lasts a year."
"Don't waste your time.  The dripper portion is a lever that one must swing back and forth in order to access the filter basket.  The basket has ridges all the way around.  I always wet the basket and press the sides of the filter against the wet portion to hold it in place during the drip.  With all the ridges on this filter cup, the filter sides wouldn't stick to the cup  Hence, the filter folded over placing grounds into the coffee.  Also, the drip lever is slightly in the way when one tries to remove and replace the filter cup.  There isn't much to say in favor of this unit.  I returned it and purchased a Black & Decker 5-cup unit, which has none of these problems.  For $5 extra, go with the Black & Decker."
"I dislike this coffee maker with every fiber of my being. Absolutely LOVED my pevious Mr Coffee 4 cup that I had for over 10 years. This one is SO TERRIBLE! I have no idea why they thought changing the design was a good idea and there is absolutely no way this product went through any kind of testing because, I will say it again my friends, IT IS TERRIBLE.I had to buy a tea strainer to pour the brewed coffee through to filter out the grounds because it constantly folds over the filter once started. The measurement indicator is on the side, not the front so it is utterly useless.I've used this thing for he last 2 months because I was trying to be loyal to the brand that served me well for my entire coffee drinking life but I can't use these piece of trash any longer.Want more proof? I went to a thrift store the other day and found this exact product in its orignal box with a note saying ""used 3 times"". I'd take mine to the thrift but I don't want to plague anyone else with this hot garbage of a product. I am one mouth full of grounds away from losing my sanity.Please don't buy this."
"I bought it for the auto shutoff feature, but wasn’t aware it required filters. I thought I read specs thoroughly and didn’t see this. Would not have bought it if I had."
Old model had the glass on both sides so you could see how much water you put in. This new that replaced it only has the glass on one side. I had to rearrange things because of this.
Product was great but the switch broke in less than a year.
"Good coffee maker, very quiet."
What I did not like was how tiny it was which made dealing with it difficult. And the reason I stopped using it was it did not turn off automatically and it took forever to make a pot of coffee. The upside was it made enough for me and I had no leftovers.
Nice basic coffee maker. The only bad thing is the power switch on the bottom.  Sometimes placing something on the counter bumps the switch and turns it on. Now I have to unplug it after finding it on all night a few times.
"I had a Mr Coffee 12 cup programmable with strong brew for more than 7 years and loved it.  It finally gave up.  Since it’s just me in the house now I thought I would get a smaller coffee maker.  I’ve always had a good experience with Mr Coffee, so I bought this 5 cup machine.It works, and is fairly fast.  However, the coffee produced isn’t hot; more like a shade above warm.  For me the flavor just isn’t there, compared to what I was used to and loved in the other Mr Coffee.  Tastes weak and rather blah.  I prefer rich coffee and this little guy doesn’t deliver.I"
"As usual in this world, left-handed people are not considered in the design of things. This coffee pot works well so far, but due to it's lid, which is hinged on it's left side rather than in back, makes it very difficult to fill with water using one's left hand. I've had to set the pot up facing to the left so that the lid opens toward the back of the counter in order to allow me to fill it with my left hand. If you would find this to be a nuisance then look for a different pot with a lid that is hinged on the back."
My previous small Mr Coffee had an auto shut off. This one does not. I didn’t realize it until the coffee had burned onto the glass pot. You must removed to turn burner off.
"After 30 years of use my original 5 cup Mr. coffee maker sprang a leak And I began looking for a replacement. The low price of the current model attracted me.  When it arrived and I had a chance to inspect it I was surprised by the left side hinged cover,  a design clearly favoring right handers. And when I opened the cover I was further dismayed by the complex, swiveling, twisting, design of the interior water spout and the fragile linkage connecting it to the cover  - evidently designed to cause the spout to relocate itself when the cover was opened or closed. The fragile hinge mechanism linking the cover to the body of the system tends to become unlatched, and it requires a good deal of adjustment in order to get the lid to close tightly once the system has been charged with water, filter, and ground coffee.In the systems design business, systems that are simple and workable are described as elegant. This is not an elegant system. It is overengineered. But it was cheap and it makes good coffee. I just don’t expect it to last for 30 years."
I have had many mr coffee makers.  This one the flavor was very weak even when I increased amount of coffee.  Too bad because the size is great.
"So, I had a different style 5 cup mr coffee pot. Loved it. Was older though..square like.. boyfriend dropped the carafe and shattered. Got this one to replace it. However… I don’t care for it. No timer, no auto shut off, the carafe leaks when pouring, and water always drips out the top onto the hot plate when you go to pour a cup  It’s annoying..I did buy knowing no auto program or auto shut off. So I didn’t take stars off for that. The difference in basket is better. My filter doesn’t fall down and get grounds everywhere. I will be trashing is now. Only have been using since July and it’s annoying."
"We got this coffee maker for our camper a little less than a year ago. The first month or so of use was just fine. Then it started dripping too much water at one time into the coffee grounds toward the last 3 cups of coffee. Well, actually it’s more of a hard spit, not a drip. Anyway the end result now is always coffee grounds in our coffee because it overflows and the spitting water splashes grounds outside of the coffee basket into every other cavity of the coffee maker.We have cleaned it. We have tried using less grounds, but if we want to make a 4 or 5 cup pot of coffee the only way we can get one without grounds is to leave the lid up and constantly monitor it, we have to turn off the power switch when the water starts getting too high, let it drip until most of the water has dropped into the carafe, and then turn it back on. Lather rinse and repeat 5 times and then you can have a nice cup of ground-free coffee.It’s a bummer… I’ve had Mr. Coffee brand most of my adult life and it has worked great. But this little coffee maker sadly isn’t great, we are ordering a different brand for our camper."
"Makes good coffee for 1 or 2 people, but, it's a hot mess to clean up after every use. No matter what we do coffee grinds are in the bottom of the basket under neath the coffee filter. And if you don't take the whole plastic basket of that the coffee sits in every time you have a counter and machine a hot mess of coffee grounds,"
"I've been buying Mr. Coffee makers for years, and this machine is the worst they've offered.I hate this machine so much that I'm trashing it after less than two months.The design makes it miserable to use, and the grade of plastic is very cheap.Heavy condensate collects on the inside of the lid, and upon opening it that water spills past the ground's basket and into the area beneath the basket.  The only way to advert that is being ready with a paper towel that has to be folded like a pointer, and quickly blot lid.The area beneath the basket has a multiple of tall ridges that make it difficult to clean between them.  You would have to use a Q-Tip to effectively clean that area.The lid and basket assembly are held in place by an arm attached to the lid.  And along with the basket assembly, it's all a loose fit and can be annoying to get the lid closed.Overall, it's an awkward machine to use.  And it's just Chinese junk to me.During the second week the machine started popping like an old dirty coffee maker.  I have no idea why. It shouldn't have required cleaning in that short of a time.Mr. Coffee use to make really nice machines.  I remember unwrapping my first one and being impressed with the build quality and the high grade of plastics.  But they've been going downhill for the past years and after this machine, I'm not wasting any more money on what they make.Write down the model number below so that you don't buy one.  And if you must have a Mr. Coffee, I suggest that you try a different model.This is the full model number for the machine that I'm writing about.BVMC-SC0WH2-1Bear in mind the entire model number isn't necessarily used by sellers.  It may be used in-part.  But check the model of the one that you're considering, and if it has the elements of the full-model number above, I wouldn't chance it.As well, there may be a slightly different model if the machine is available in another color or if it has a clock.  Mine is white, without a clock."
"Poorly made, coffee isn’t hot enough to taste good"
"This looks ok and I wanted something small, but this is wayyyyy too small. It says 5 cups of coffee but we can only get 3 small cups of coffee out of it. I would say this is good for 2 people only. compact size is great, but we need one to be useable for atleast 4 people so we are returning it and getting a bigger one."
"Was a decent little coffee maker, just the basics, no whistles and bells, until it wasn’t. Only lasted me 5 months using it twice a day, and then the power switch no longer worked. So dead in the water with no way to turn it on. All my other coffee makers lasted about 2 years, including my first Mr. Coffee, except my cuisinart, which lasted 8 years."
"Makes good coffee, but can be very dangerous if you forget to shut off. Bought this maker because of the shut off feature. Mr. Coffee customer support doesn't respond to inquiries about this. Other reviewers mentioned this problem....I should have believed them."
Haven't used it yet. Because it's cracked where the wiring is located.
"I was up at 4:15am this AM and hit the button and no green light nothing!! I bought this coffee maker last October so it lasted 10 months. I just went and purchased the Black & Decker as many reviews said it did not have the same ""button failure"" problem as the ""other"" coffee maker does! Gave this one a 2 Star because it did get nice and hot!"
"I have purchased several coffee makers over the years including a Mr. Coffee pot I had for 7 years. Sadly, this one is not up to the quality of previous models. It leaks all over the countertop while pouring into my cup. It dosen't need a fancy spout it needs a spout that is practical. The simpler the better. It also leaks water onto the hot plate before you can get the pot under it. On top of that a one year warranty? Yeah, right. The coffee this morning was lukewarm. I have had this pot for a week. Get someone to fix the design of this pot. WOULD NOT RECCOMMEND."
This is probably about my fourth or fifth “mini” Mr Coffee. Just the right size for my daily 2 mugs of Coffee. I learned that the price and guessing factor of replacing the glass pot when it breaks is not worth the time lost searching. I always buy them at the grocery stores for about $17-$20. Not this time. No mini pots in stock-broken supply chain? Not enough sales? Whatever. It works  But there is no auto turn off. I am so used to auto turn off that I forget and the heat is on for hours and the coffee burns.  The water pump is different and there are often many grains in the bottom inch of the pot. Small filters that fit properly non-existent. Will probably be last pot. Sort of a piece of junk and was an Amazon Choice. Really Amazon?!?! Really?!?!?  Too much trouble to get a decent cup of coffee. Goodbye Mr Coffee 4-8 cup Pot.
"Update 10-15-2023.  4 cup coffee maker delivered 2May 2023.  Today it is dead.  All the water leaks out the bottom of it.  Had to order a new one. DID NOT REORDER this brand.  Thank goodness I put a baking tray and coffee absorbing pad underneath it.  Made it easy to clean up. (Twice).Changed from 5 stars to 1 star.  Even $21USD coffee makers should work for several years.  Quality, people.  We work hard for this money.  Will see if the company will take it back directly with them.  It's ridiculous not to get a year to 5 out of it!Got this as an inexpensive alternative for a fancy coffee maker.  We have calcium build up in all appliances, hard water.  I could not get the old one cleaned and working.  The footprint is small.The negative review from a left handed person was the lid hinged the wrong direction to poor water in.  Dad is left handed, and the coffee drinker.  I told him about the review, and just advised:  turn the coffee pot so the lid is in the back!  Its cylindrical, and weighs about 2#.  So its not hard to rotate the machine.  Or, pour with your right hand.  (I can pour left or right handed, I don't think I am magic.). LOL!He said it worked fine.  It is a slower brew than a 1 cup at a time keurig, but costs $20, and is by far better for the environment than those plastic cups!  Review is for 4 cup Mr. Coffee, 5-2023, paid approx $20."
This coffee maker came without a filter basket which was a big disappointment. The coffee tastes rather blah.
"Works fine, cute, fits perfectly in a small space. But the coffee it makes is weak and doesn’t taste good. It doesn’t get hot enough to brew right. I am boiling the water separately and using this machine as a pour-over coffee pot which defeats the purpose. Wish I’d returned it in time"
"Brewed nicely only problem is the entire thing is created for a right handed person.  The lid opens to the left forcing me to move the coffee maker around to pour the water in with my left hand.  The pot only has numbers on the left side of the handle, making it difficult to see when filling it with water.  Not sure why there cant be numbers on both side of the handle for the pot and the lid opens from the back like previous models but searching for something different.  Making coffee shouldnt be difficult first thing in the morning."
"This is the noisiest and slowest coffee pot I've ever purchased.  I have a 10 cup pot I use when I have visitors and it finishes ""dripping"" in half the time as this 5 cup pot.  It does what it is supposed to, but very slowly."
"It’s a great little machine, but it says it’s got auto off after 2 hrs, even the included paperwork says that, and it doesn’t. Still burning brightly 6 hours later. I’m too hooked on my coffee to send it back, but do make sure you check yours."
"update 8/2/2024.  I ordered 1/2/2024.  Today 8/2/2024 the on button doesn’t do anything.  Wont brew or heat, nothing.  Broke.  Now have to deal with trying to get refund thru Mr Coffee.  At the Mr Coffee warranty website they want uploaded photos, model number etc, then ask me what replacement model I want then website says none of the replacements are available.  Called Mr Coffee twice today -recording “extended wait times exceed 20 minutes”. couldn’t get anyone to answer the phone.  This is under warrenty but they make is impossible.  Fraud.Done with brand Mr Coffee.  Coffee was subpar and it started leaking while brewing .original reviewnothing special.  doesnt spill coffee on counter when i pour into a cup.  this one will work until I find one I really like that has a water filter and strong brew option which will cost more and make better coffee.  works as described, not disappointed."
Cheaply made. Annoying to adjust filter basket. Seems loose and ill fitting. Filters don't fit great basket too small. Not easy to read cup amounts on water filler. Like shape of  coffee pot. Coffee OK. Last Mr. coffee was better quality all around. Wish spent more money on better one. May suit some people but I do not recommend.
"Did it’s job great for a small basic coffee pot for about 11 months. Then it would no longer power on. This coffee pot does feel/look cheaply made. Compared to my last small coffee pot this probably shouldn’t even get two stars, but it did do what it was made to do for a short period of time."
Bought to replace same coffee maker. New carafe does not have cup markings on one side and new handle doesn’t have open bottom. Not good for larger hands. Used my old carafe with new machine.
"This is a nice little coffee pot I use in my camper when I travel. It brews fast and it is a good cup but preparing it is very awkward as the lid only opens one way so either you pour the water in with your right hand or the pot needs to be turned backward. I took off 2 stars for that. Products must be friendly to all handed people! Not just the righties.In conclusion, this is a decent pot but I wouldn't buy it again. I'd find one I can use comfortably left handed as well."
"After unboxing and using several times, I can safely positively say, I do NOT like the grounds basket that comes with this.  It's messy.  Even though the mouth is wide enough for my scrubbrush to fit in it to clean it, there are the plastic separator parts that the grinds gather around, so it makes it hard to get it out initially.  I have to use a spoon instead of just knocking it on the inside side of the garbage can.  An extra step.  It's just annoying and extra time and extra work.  If you don't mind that, this might be the coffee maker for you.  Also, when making the coffee, it starts a weird wooom woooooooooooom sound, not like any other coffee maker I've ever owned.  It sounds sickly, like it's saying ""ooooh gooooooood, I have coffeeeeeeee coming ouuuuut of meeeeeeee woOOOooom"".  It's a sad sickly sound.  Kind of like a deep grinding whine.  There's also the issue with the water measurements.  I can't find consistency.  I measure out 12 oz. water in a measure cup, pour it in, and I understand the grinds will take up some of the water, so I should get less out, but in fact, it puts out MORE than 12 oz.!!!  I get a 14 oz. cup of coffee...but here's the catch, ....it's only SOMETIMES.  Other times I've put in a measured 12 oz. and get 12 oz. out.  I just don't understand what's going on with that.  And random times, the display will beep at me to ""add water"" to the reservoir.  I don't get it.  Wondering if we got a lemon.....one that doesn't work right?  I just didn't want to send it back for exchange, I guess I'm being lazy about it.  So I will keep it and use it till it breaks or doesn't work properly anymore.  I used the frother, and it does whip my heavy cream & sugar to make sweetened frothy milk, but it doesn't whip it into whipped cream, just frothy milk, like it's supposed to do. The frother is easy to clean.  The reservoir is somewhat easy to clean other than some little silicon dome at the very bottom that seems to hold about a teaspoon of water, so you can never really get all water out.  I don't like that.  Stale water in the reservoir is nasty.  And if you use soap, like Dawn dish detergent, inside the reservoir, plan on having soap remaining in that silicon dome at the bottom unless you stand there and rinse until the cows come home.  Again, annoying and time consuming, but job gets done.  I think Ninja could've and should've addressed these concerns/issues when designing this thing.  I really like the Ninja brand manufacturer, and other appliances they make, but this coffee maker is just adequate.  I absolutely LOOOOOVE the color though.  I got Glacier Blue.  It's so pretty!!  My boyfriend is the one who uses this thing several times a day, daily.  I get only some use out of it.  My next use will be to make an iced coffee.  That should be interesting!!!!!  I'm just really frustrated with the inconsistency of the measurement of water, and the cleaning of the grounds basket.  We don't do the pods thing in our household, too much plastic waste.  I guess this is the trade-off."
"First off, I had to return my first attempt at this machine.  The motor made the most awful grinding noises and even after running it around 20 times it never got better and we finally decided to stop wasting water and exchange it.  I considered just replacing it but finding a decent machine for single serve coffee that utilizes loose grounds instead of pods is like searching for the holy grail.The new machine still makes the noise but it began to lessen pretty quickly as we used it so we've decided to keep it.  Now the noise is very short and only on the initial brew for the regular basket or at the very end for the pods.The only other real flaw is the non-pod coffee basket is difficult to dump the grounds from because the of the 'lid'.I like everything else about it.  Hopefully the noise will go completely away over time but it honestly makes me wonder if this machine will last very long, especially for the price.  Not sure I'd rebuy this."
"I've been using an Aeropress for years and have wanted to be able to push a button instead of crafting and timing my coffee. This Ninja promised that so I gave it an honest try.I used the basket for fresh ground coffee as usual. There is no paper filter, but the mesh is fine enough that I didn't notice any sediment in my cup. I grind at a medium setting in my old Braun burr grinder. I make a 12 oz cup with 12 grams of coffee which is plenty flavorful for me. This appliance had 200-205 degree water/coffee coming out of the spout which is perfect! The coffee tasted a little sharper with higher notes than my Aeropress probably because there is no paper filter to absorb the oils. I was fine with that and the overall flavor profile of my cup.The downside, was that the 16-17"" height made it necessary to pull it away from the wall under the upper cabinet  to have access to the basket to put the coffee in. Filling the water was the same issue, but I could get 3 - 4 cups from the 56 oz tank when full. So already, I was juggling things to make my coffee. Pull the grinder out to get a scoopful. Then pull out the coffeemaker, fill the basket (maybe the water tank too). Push the button and wait 3 and a half minutes for my coffee. Then pull out the basket, empty and wash it for the next cup.By contrast, The electric kettle my spouse uses will boil water in the time it takes for me to put a filter into my aeropress and put in the coffee. I pour the water over the coffee, wait 2 and a half minutes and plunge the water through the coffee. Empty the aeropress and rinse. It turns out a few less steps so I wasn't very happy with it.I returned this coffee maker and reclaimed quite a bit of my counter space and still have a really good cup of coffee in the same amount of time with a few less steps.Maybe if I used pods, but then there is all that plastic going into the waste stream..."
"I normally don't write reviews, but I will say that Ninja support is lacking in satisfaction.  After owning this product for 4 months, the pod sensor malfunctioned on the main unit and you could no longer brew with pods.  After calling support and getting a message saying there was higher numbers of call volume, I selected the option to have a call back.  After an hour or so I did get a call back and support determined that the product was probably defective.  At first they said that the pod unit would need to be replace because that was the problem and we would have to pay for that because all the removable parts were not included in the warranty.  When I questioned why it was the pod insert that was defective as it didn't have any of the electronic sensors, they then said it was probably the main unit and that was covered under warranty. Of course, shipping was not included and that was going to cost me $17.  The order was placed for the replacement and I received a ""good news"" email that my order way ready to ship with Fed-X with a warning that because of ""shipper delays"" it may not depart for 24-48 hours.  Two weeks later the status was the same.  I tried to get updates via support email, but to no avail.  I tried to call support but was just put into a queue for over 20 minutes.  In my opinion the Ninja has some of the poorest support phone and websites I have ever dealt with which is such a shame seeing that they have some very well designed products.  At this point, I would be hard pressed to buy from Ninja or Shark which I believe is the parent company.  So, if the product stays working you will probably be happy, but if it doesn't and you need support, please beware!Updated 11/10/23 - I happened to find a chat support on their website and explained that the replacement never shipped.  They offered to send me a brand new unit because of the trouble if I cut the power cord on the original unit.  I declined, because it still made coffee with grounds attachment and I didn't want to be without a coffee maker, so they said they would just send me the base unit replacement.  That arrived within a week, but to my surprise it had the same issue with the k-cup attachment.  I got in touch with them again and they are send a brand new complete unit.  They did make me cut the power cord of the unit I just got, but at least I will have my original unit in the meantime.  Hopefully the new unit will work correctly and last longer than a few months.  Raised my opinion one star, because the support seamed to get better with my 2nd and 3rd dealings."
"There are absolutely no instructions provided with this product on how to make any of the specialty coffees pictured on the website and on the box that so appealed to me.So, while attempting to make iced coffee, I didn't know how many grams of coffee grounds to use or the ounce size glass/cup to select, so I  chose the 4oz Specialty option.  Also not knowing that the coffee maker would sound upon completion, I added additional 4oz servings thinking the serving was too small and I nearly overflowed my glass.Needless to say, I am now left searching for recipes on the internet to help me figure out how to make specialty drinks using my new Ninja Coffee Maker, as I am not a barista.  I just want to enjoy some great restaurant quality coffee at home for what I consider a reasonable price, and for me, a $300 Keurig is not reasonable.  Is that what I have to pay for a recipe book to be included?  Other than that, I am only mildly happy with my purchase, and definitely not excited.  To me, not much different than using a traditional coffee maker."
"Really liked the compact design, concept  and functionality of this coffee machine. It fit my tiny space well, wonderful features, no spillage and worked per instructions but so very disappointed in that the brewed “hot” coffee was lukewarm. I like a very hot cup of coffee. Returned. Bought a mini brew 5 cup Mr. Coffee for much less money which lacks the design and features but makes hot coffee."
"Got the Ninja PB051 Single Serve Pods and Grounds Specialty Coffee Maker for Christmas last year.  I absolutely loved this coffee maker for the first 10 months.  It made a cup of coffee super-fast, much faster than the Keurig's I owned in the past.  This coffee maker was great in the beginning but now my coffee has grounds in every cup.  When I open the top to retrieve the spent k-cup, it looks as if my k-cup exploded with grounds all over the top of the k-cup.  I assume water is flowing faster than the k-cup can handle causing the grounds to spill out the top.  I would expect a Ninja product to last longer than 10 months.  Very disappointed!"
"I’m not a huge coffee drinker, so didn’t need anything super fancy.  I prefer boiling water in my glass electric kettle as well.  Plastic parts aside, I have to say, this Ninja does a great job with making hot beverages - be it hot water for tea or hot coffee, very quickly.  Temperature is very hot and I even tested out the side frother and must say, was very impressed. It did a great job and I’m glad to have it for occasional use or guests.  It seems very well thought out and I hope it lasts for many years.  I cannot give it 5 or even 4 stars because it comes with a Prop65-potential cancer and reproductive harm warning on the bottom of the box."
"I love the product itself, only complaint is that I was sent a used, broken one and had to go through ninja's warranty process to get it replaced piece by piece. Pain in the butt."
"We loved this coffee maker for 9 months, but then it quit.  Probably going back to Keurig as they lasted us years at a time."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I’m all about the rich flavor of coffee. So I always use that setting, along with fresh grounds. The problem is I’m old and I can’t wait as long as it takes to get a cup of Joe out of this thing. It takes almost 4 minutes for 12oz! So it’s not fast. Even on the normal setting it’s not as quick as a K-Cup but, like I said, I prefer good coffee. The frothing wand, storage, water tank and form factor are a plus. However slow brewing handicaps this from being better than average."
"I like this machine or the concept of it, but they seem to have a lot of bugs to figure out. My first one leaked all over the counter and my replacement tells me I need to add water every time even though it's full.I had to pay $3 to print a label to return this thing because Amazon(?) didn't send me a label that they could scan. Idk who to blame for that but I know it's not UPS.Anyways, I should not have to troubleshoot a brand new machine and if it's this buggy, fix it."
Lasted a year and now as of today stops pumping water 🤷 I've had actual Keurig brands last longer than this Ninja
"Bought this so my wife can have decaf and I can have regular coffee but we've both found the coffee to be weaker than we like, even on the 'rich brew' setting. We purchased refillable pods to use our own ground coffee. Thinking it might be our coffee or the pods didn't hold enough grounds, we tried commercially available disposable pods from the supermarket and yes - weak coffee. We like the style of the unit, the large reservoir to hold water, the speed of brewing, the temperature of the coffee. We don't like all the plastic parts to disassemble each time to wash or the brew strength. I tried the milk frother and it makes a nice foam if you use cream and not regular milk. I've used the over ice setting as well and again, I feel like it was a very weak brew. If I want a very strong cup I'll pull out the french press, just have to adjust my taste when I want a fast easy morning cup."
"I read other reviews about the pods not working well and spilling over.  I wonder if those people know that you put the pod in. Then push it down to puncture the bottom. Then close the lid which punctures the top. Mine works great. I like how hot the water is, the variety of settings and that my tall travel mugs fit under it. I also like that I can use grounds or pods and it makes good coffee. The holder for the either the pods or ground coffee store nicely in it The water reservoir is really easy to access and clean and it has a fairly small footprint.  There is so much i love about it. The cons are that you can't use a filter for the ground coffee so it's a pain to clean  out  or use reusable single serve pods. . It can make 24 oz at once so I thought I could make a pot of coffee by running a few of those in succession but I haven't found any container that I can fit under it that will hold that much.  So I love it but sadly probably wouldn't have bought it if I had considered those things."
Everything here lately has been delivered in damaged boxes and missing parts
hi! my lid won’t close. any suggestions? 🥺
"I mean it does its main job, making coffee but it takes longer than I expected for just a cup of coffee and it's loud i think it's the pump that's makes a loud sound. Not having to add water everytime is nice too and the frother is okay it feels weak. The size of the machine is not wide but longer than my other coffee maker it replaced"
"When my K multistream broke after maybe 4 years I thought I’d give this Ninja a try. I like coffee with rich flavor and body but no bitterness. I couldn’t pull it off with this machine as well as I could the multistream. The “rich” setting on this machine doesn’t slow the rate of brewing, or if it does it isn’t by much. On the multistream it takes probably 50% longer to  brew when using the medium strength setting, giving better extraction of flavor without having to use a higher temperature. Faster brew time is a trade off, I’m willing to give up a minute more for a better cup. I chose to return this one and buy another multistream instead and now I’m enjoying the morning coffee better again."
"I ordered this machine Ninja coffee maker on Oct 7, which arrived the next day.  The package had already been opened and when I opened it, you could see it had been used.  I returned the next day and it is now Oct 22 and I still have not received my refund."
It was great for a year.  Now it’s junk.  It won’t pump the water out of the reservoir and just makes a grinding noise.  No coffee.
I absolutely love this coffee maker and use it several times a day. I got it for the foaming milk for Arthur and it’s wonderful. I wish it moved a tad bit faster but everything is perfect on it.
"UPDATE, 11 months later the pod adapter failed. We use this for grounds 90% of the time but had some hot cocoa pods we wanted to use. The machine would not recognize the adapter. We tried different types of pods, did 2 full cleaning cycles, unplugged let sit. Finally called customer service. They said the adapter went bad. OK it's under warranty. Ninja considers the adapter an accessory and it's not covered under warranty. They wanted $15.99+ tax and $10.99 shipping. I told the rep this is not an accessory, it's an adapter necessary for the function of the machine. Her manager said to send me one for free but I had to pay shipping, I was fine with that. Unit now works again but beware of the adapter problem. The adapter isn't available anywhere else than their website.I absolutely love this coffee maker. The biggest selling points for me were the larger basket for grounds, ability to make larger portions of coffee and the rich(bold) feature. The large basket allows for more grounds for a stronger, larger portion of coffee on the go compared to other brands. Keurigs only have that little grounds holder so getting a stronger cup of coffee was difficult. Makes great coffee using either the pods or grounds. The milk frother is a nice treat on the weekends. Machine is easy to use and looks great. Has a built in storage compatment for the basket and pod holder when not in use. A scoop for measuring grounds as well. I highly recommend this coffee maker. Ninja nailed it on this one."
"Though I like the machine,  it doesn’t brew K-cups very well.  About every 4th k-cup, the pressure blows out the cup and sends coffee grounds out the sides making a mess. (See attached photos). The coffee ground brewing works great.  And the attached creamer frother is excellent."
"We recently purchased an RV and as many of you may know, counter space is at a premium. So the slim design of this machine was quite attractive. I also liked the fact that I could use my disposable K-pods or a reusable one or even loose grounds for larger cups of coffee. However, when we woke up that 1st morning at our campsite, excited to use our new coffee maker that's when it happened. The frother, I realized, doesn't steam the milk. What a huge let down! I had to microwave my milk then froth it to add it to my coffee. What's the point of a frother if you can't steam the milk? I am returning the machine.  It worked fine. Just didn't live up to my expectations."
"In theory, this machine is great for a small space, so you don't have to own multiple coffee makers. The main reason I purchased it was because of the option to brew both drip coffee and use a KCup, since occasionally I have guests who drink decaf. However, after using the KCup feature about 5 times, it stopped working--when I put in the KCup ""basket,"" both the KCup light and brew light flash, and you're unable to proceed with brewing (I followed the directions for cleaning and making sure there were no obstructions). I contacted Ninja, and since I had registered the warranty, they sent me a new body free of charge, but after getting it all hooked up, the same thing happened when I tested it. So I'm not sure what the problem is, given the same thing happened with 2 different machine bodies."
Item was supposed to be Sage Green. I received black. Item also arrived three days late. Currently debating whether to keep it or send it back. Short cord. May not even work for my space.
"The good: the coffee maker gets the water HOT - I mean actually 200+ degrees - which is rare in a cheap coffeemaker (unless you shell out extra for an SCA-certified brewer, anyways). The maker gets a fair amount of ground fines into your coffee, but you can use the smallest size Kalita Wave filters (155s) inside this without any adjustment - I wouldn't recommend it if you're brewing more than 2 cups of coffee since it will slow down the flow rate, but for 10-24 oz it's probably fine.The bad: I can't in good conscience recommend it due to a major design flaw in the brew basket and atrocious support from SharkNinja: the thin and brittle tabs to remove the baskets and inserts just aren't strong enough considering how tightly seated the parts are (see photo for the consequence just one month and a few dozen cups of coffee into things).SharkNinja unfortunately considers the brew basket a ""normal wear and tear replacement"" part, meaning even within the warranty period you're on your own to replace it. Except that1) the part is out of stock and backordered2) even when it does eventually come back in stock they want $25 to ship a new one, which is a quarter of the cost of the entire coffeemaker brand newSo my advice isa) don't buy this given that design flaw, the atrocious support policy, and highway-robbery replacement part pricing/shipping pricing.b) if you do buy it, treat the brew baskets like you'd treat a fragile baby and remove the parts by wiggling from the side rather than using the tabs for leverage when they stickReally too bad."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The coffee maker works fine, coffee taste great, it’s fast and very pretty but it takes so much pressure to open it that it lifts the entire maker off the counter. I think this has to be some sort of malfunction it the particular one that I received since I don’t see anything about it in other’s reviews. I contacted ninja and they said to use it for a week then call back if it doesn’t stop but I guess I’ll just be returning. It’s very frustration to have to pry it open and your hand just the setting buttons while doing so and changes the settings or accidentally starts a new brew. I suppose I’m just disappointed because I wanted something different than a Keurig but I don’t know about this."
"I loved the look of this machine when it arrived. We had Keurig for a lot of years, but decided to try a new brewer when it was time to replace. We used this Ninja for a week, then it started bursting steam from the top and getting grounds all over inside the brewed coffee and the machine. (Yes, I performed needle cleaning and bottom needle cleaning, as well as thoroughly cleaned the grinds from the machine several times). Being pod brewers for 20 years, we know how to use a machine and how to maintain it. After reading the entire manual and researching online to see what could be causing the issue, I decided the machine must be defective and ordered a second one. I primed the machine before the first brew, per instructions, carefully nested the K-Cup, gently closed the lid and chose an 8 oz classic brew. When the Ninja beeped 3 times to announce the finished cup, (our first brewed cup with this machine) I raised the lid to remove the pod, and the machine exploded the K-Cup, steam and hot water at me, burning my neck and chest while spraying coffee and grinds over my entire kitchen. First. Brew. I'm boxing up both units and returning them because I don't want to risk further injury. BEWARE! I was not able to locate anything online about why this is happening and I'm a little surprised that there doesn't seem to be mention of it from reviewers. Sad, because it's a great looking machine."
"This unit worked great for about 6 months. For some reason the unit no longer recognizes the grounds insert basket. It works perfectly fine with K-cups. It is clearly a problem with the sensor.I searched and searched online and could not find any good information on how the sensor functions to recognize the different insert baskets. Online, Ninja has no email for customer service so I called.After waiting on hold for a half an hour, I spoke with a 'technical support specialist' who was clearly reading from a script and has no knowledge of how the machine works. We had a lengthy video phone call where I read serial numbers, gave personal info, and went through a tedious and pointless troubleshooting process.At the conclusion, she wanted to sell me a new grounds basket insert for $15 plus shipping. There is nothing seemingly wrong with the basket insert itself, as its just a piece of plastic and mesh. The 'specialist' could not tell me where the sensor was located or how it functioned. She said she 'did not have access to that information' and no one else there did. They wanted to sell me a part that would surely not fix the problem. And the part was not covered under me 'limited warranty'. Scam of a company. I wasted a bunch of time this morning and will never buy another ninja product."
"For the most part, the review is based on my customer service experience with Ninja.I usually only drink 1 cup of coffee a day and had used a Keurig for about 5 years. When it wore down, I decided to switch to this coffee maker because I wanted to drink fresh ground coffee in addition to the K-cups. However, the K-cup portion of the coffee maker broke about 3 weeks after purchase.I spoke with customer service to arrange for a replacement to be sent. The ground part of the coffee maker still worked, so I was told by the rep that they would ship a replacement and I could keep the old one and then ship it back when the replacement was received. I confirmed 2 additional times that I didn't need to ship the broken one back until after I received the replacement, which he told me I would receive in 5-10 business days.About a week later, I checked the status of the replacement and was told that it would ship once they received the broken one. I was then told to provide proof of purchase, as well as proof of registration, which I had already given to the rep the week before, but they had no record of them. They eventually emailed me a shipping label and I was told that once they received the broken one, they would immediately ship the replacement.I checked the tracking number and once it was delivered, I followed up with an email and screenshot of the delivery. I was then told it would take 3-5 business days to ship and another 3-5 business days for me to receive. I finally received it about a 1-1/2 weeks after they received the broken coffee maker.The review of the coffee maker itself gets about 3, mostly based on the fact it broke 3 weeks after purchase. The K-cup part is no different than a Keurig, but the grounds portion I like because it makes the coffee taste better and richer than putting grounds in a K-cup adapter, which I used in the Keurig.The customer service experience I had with Ninja is what drops this to a 1 star, but if I could knock it down to a 1/2-star, I would. I don't like being mis-lead or lied to, and the fact that I was given different information from different reps is poor customer service. I have a Ninja air fryer, toaster oven, and knife set, which all work really well. However, because of my negative customer service experience, I won't be purchasing any more Ninja products."
I bought this coffee maker to replace the Nepresso Vertuo one that I loved but drove me crazy cleaning it.  I tried different strong dark coffee pods that sill did not seem strong enough for my taste. Maybe I was spoiled by the Nepresso? I gave it away and bought a Keurig coffee maker that enabled me to make a stronger coffee.
"I don't understand the issues with these. I want to love it and know that Ninja is a good namebrand. I just can't figure out why I've given it 3 tries and now given up. Each one has had issues with the k-cup. It starts steaming and just explodes coffee grounds everywhere. I open up the top, full of grounds. In my cup of coffee, coffee grounds. I am so disappointed.  The color is beautiful, and it seems to be okay with just grounds, but for whatever reason the k-cup explodes everytime. 😟😓"
"We love everything about the product. As a sleek design with multifunctions to meet all of our needs. You can’t beat the ease of use. Everything was perfect except the color. We really wanted and ordered the glacier blue, but received black. No time to do a return so we’re stuck with black. Shipping did come earlier than anticipated."
"My single cup Keurig finally died after 10 years so I went on the hunt for a new coffee maker. This Ninja had solid reviews, I absolutely love the brew options and the sleek design is perfect. I was excited once it arrived….set up was easy. The next morning, the first brew was easy-it was quiet and quick. But after drinking most of my coffee I realized there was a large amount of grounds  in the bottom of my cup! I thought, maybe the first cup- no big deal. Well, I’m now 5 days in and on my 5th morning cup of coffee and there are at least a tsp or more of grounds in the bottom of every cup. Disappointed— I’m now seeing reviews noting this is an issue with the brand. This would be a 5 star rating otherwise. Calling support- likely returning the coffee maker!"
"I owned a Ninja drip coffee maker for years and I loved it because it was so simple to use. It made great coffee.  I'm sorry I bought this high-rise coffee pot that barely fits under the cabinets.  And there are so many parts to wash after using.  I don't like the gold filter.  I prefer paper that I can dispose of withouthaving to empty the grounds and washing the parts.  Yes, it is a versatile coffee maker but it is a case of overkill.  There is a lot to be said for simplicity. And I have to use twice as much coffee to produce a good cup. Back to the drawing board."
"We ordered this coffee maker to replace our Keurig. It has some really nice features, like a larger water tank, a built in frother, and a filter so you can use pods or grounds. You can brew any size from 6-24 Oz. HOWEVER, when we use pods, they explode about half of the time. I read reviews and searched for solutions - all I found was maybe the bottom needle was clogged, so I made sure it was clean. It still explodes. We have tried several different brands of pods and haven't found any that are completely trustworthy. It's disappointing. I hate going to make myself a cup of coffee in the morning and then finding out I have a 10 minute clean up before I can get started. I would not buy this model again."
"This coffee maker worked well for about 2 weeks, then we started getting coffee grounds in every cup.  We have cleaned the system and it will run okay for a day or two and then grounds again.  Today coffee and grounds began squirting out the side of the machine spraying the wall.  I do not recommend buying this.  It's is no Keurig, and we will be switching back the our old Keurig"
"I've tried many single-serve coffee makers on the market and I've only had the Ninja Pods and Grounds for a few months so it's worth reviewing. Overall, it gets an 7 out of 10 . The coffee it brews from the k-cups is excellent and the coffee it brews from the drip basket is almost as good as a traditional pour-over. But there's one ""flaw"". The residual steam left over after brewing from the basket forces the user to wipe down the basket area with a towel every single time it's used. It's irritating. So...as my headline reads, good coffee but has a design flaw. If you can deal with wiping down the residual steam every time after brewing from the basket, it's tough to find a better single-serve coffee maker."
"I lived this until I didn't.  Had the machine for 35 days and was loving it!  Then, it stopped pulling in water.  I couldn't even run a clean because it wouldn't pull.  I only used it 1 time a daySince I was past my return limit on Amazon went through Shark Ninja for warranty claim.  The hoops they make you go through, you have to do a video call with them to show its not working and what is wrong, I can understand that.  Then you have to ship the broke product back (they pay shipping) but they won't ship your new product until return is received and it will be shipped within 10 days.  So I have been without coffee maker for 9 days now.To me, this is bad business.  They saw it was broke, why make people wait.I am hopeful this second one is better but after doing a deeper dive this seems to be a ongoing problem."
"My husband bought me this Ninja coffee maker PB040 from Amazon on Nov 11, 2023 for Christmas and on Feb 14th, 2024 it broke. The numbers on top was jumping around and reading size not shown on the regular display. I called and spoke to Amazon and was told that it was passed the 3 month mark and that they would charge me a restocking fee of $16.00. Are they going to restock a broken machine?So I called Ninja to get them to take care of their broken machine after two months. They told me that it's within the warranty so they would replace the base with a NEW base not the attachments. I asked the C/S dept twice if it will be a NEW base? They told me ""YES""! But when I received it a few days later and opened it, it was wet, had coffee grounds and smelled very bad like mildew. I was totally upset! I called them back and requested a brand new in a box one but they wanted to charge me shipping and handling. I refused to pay for shipping because I already paid money for a new one and it broke soon after receiving it. The C/S dept at Ninja was very nice but I wasn't pleased and had concerns about the new one. They were kind and they sent me a brand new one as requested. But the problem was with the new warranty. They would only honor the old warranty on the old and first coffee maker I received which means that if something happened to this coffee maker anytime after November 11th of 2024, I would basically be screwed. Which means that this product would not even if last me a full year as far as the new replacement one is concerned. So I have to say that I will never order anything again from Ninja. As far as coffee makers I'm concern I will stick to Keurig because the Keurig machine that I had bought almost 15 years ago it's still in good condition and still works fine. I just wanted something new in the end it was not worth all the headache. So ""NO""! I do not recommend this product to anyone because it may break soon after receiving it because the quality of the product. But this is just my experience. I'm sure others have had better."
"We got this less than a year ago and have absolutely loved it.  Size selection, built in frother thing, grind basket to switch it up from kcups.  And now all of a sudden it sounds like it’s trying to eat itself.  Tried descaling and troubleshooting for past two days as it’s been spitting coffee everywhere and finally it seems like the pump has gone out on it and it won’t brew at all anymore.  It’s a shame bc the days of Keurig and other kcup machines lasting years like they used to are long gone.  I love Ninja products which is why I bought this one bc the others we have are great. But this is pretty disappointing.  Amazon is great about returns or replacing stuff but in this case there’s only a 90 day warranty through Ninja.  Again, this one was great while it lasted, just wish it lasted more than a year."
"Disregard everything on original review.  This unit did make great coffee however two months  and it's dead.  Ninja does not respond and all I get from amazon is ""we'll be in touch"".  That hasn't happened and probably won't.  My wife and I are going out the door now, headed to Walmart to get a coffee maker that I can return without a hassle if it dies in two months.  Won't be a ninja.Our forth Keurig just died so went in search of another.  Discovered this on the day it was released for sale.  With no reviews yet I did a lot of reading on other ninja coffee makers and compared features.  Took a chance and ordered it.  Second day with it and I've lost tract of the cups I've ran.  This is the most well thought out, most user friendly coffee maker I've ever seen.  Every attachment stores right on or in the machine.  Cleaning is so easy it's amazing.  Now for the coffee.  I am in my young seventies and my wife and I are coffee fanatics morning, noon and evening.  We choose our restaurants with coffee quality in mind.  First cup from this ninja and we were both in love.  The flavor is beyond comparison. The temperature is perfect, not moderately warm and it's ready in just about sixty seconds with no preheating. I've tried the classic, rich, iced, and frothed.  Loved them all.  My wife thumbed down the iced but all others she raved about.  So easy to use it's crazy simple.  I honestly thought Keurig was tops but it just fell to second place.  If you like coffee get this new ninja.  Forgot to mention it comes on automatically when you raise the lid and goes off in about two minutes when your coffee has brewed.  I have yet to touch the power button."
3 stars late by 3 days ..when I opened the box the inside was wet . Leads me to believe this was a refurbished NOT the NEW I payed for . All 3 Boxes were  dry but inside was wet . Would like to know why.Will update after 2 weeks of use.
"Update  to the Update; STILL WAITING Apparently they still do not care about customer service or making good on their products!  I was a loyal referring customer their products but no more!!!! Update; STILL WAITING!!  The coffee maker lasted approximately 1 to 1 1/2 months ! 6 months waiting for a part! The first one they say they sent was sent to a wrong address . Then supposedly they sent out another one which has never been received! Disappointed in the customer service ! Two of these particular ninja coffee makers were bought. I bought one for my daughter and then a week or so later she bought me one because she liked it so much. I’ve always stood by the ninja/ shark products for various household departments. But her coffee maker didn’t last very long before it quit working. They did everything right. Then they request help in pinpointing what may be wrong did everything told. Nothing worked. So the company said they would be sending a part for them to replace, never received the part after several months went by!! So they call customer service back . They were told yet again they would receive a part ! This has now been at least 4 months again. I believe now in total around nine month since I bought it for her. First off nine months is ridiculous when it hasn’t been working and she had to invest in a different product. It’s aggravating to me that I wasted my money this way! Apparently they have no intention of replacing the coffee maker or the actual part ( of which making someone else fix their product is also ridiculous) !"
"We loved this little guy until it quit working because of a problem with the pod basket.  In order for the coffee maker to know whether the filter basket or the pod adapter is inserted there is a little magnet in one corner of the pod adapter.  In less than 6 months this magnet fell out.  Now the coffee maker doesn't recognize that the pod adapter is inserted and refuses to make coffee.  Contacting the manufacturer resulted in being hung up on, and then being told that this is considered a wearable part so would not be covered.  Hard plastic, no moving parts, holds a K cup.  When I told them I'd send the entire unit back to Amazon for my extended warranty protection they offered to send me one for the cost of shipping and taxes and shipping and handling fees.  These somehow nearly equalled the replacement cost for the part.When working this is a great unit.  It makes good coffee much faster than the Kuerigs do.  However if something is going to break every 5 months then why bother??"
I love all things Ninja. So to give this coffee maker anything less than 5 stars breaks my heart. The coffee was too hot at times smelling scorched. I loved the features like the attached milk frother. I just wasn’t happy with it.
"I own the CFP301, which is the flagship of Ninja's coffeemaker, but it is big, and I wanted something for every day when I just make coffee for myself, but can still use my own coffee ground. That's where the PB051 come in handy. I have used it three times since it was delivered yesterday, and I already love it. My CFP301 will remain in my house when I make coffee for a bigger crowd or when my husband's coffeemaker dies (which might be soon as it makes weird noises already). It is also nice to have small coffeemaker when you go on a trip and want to make your own coffee. You never know what coffeemakers you find in vacation places.UPDATE: 7 days and about 14 cups of coffee later and the pump died. It makes some very loud gurgling noises, but does not produce any coffee.I have removed the reservoir, refilled, unplugged and plugged the machine back in, that pump is screaming without making any coffee.I was unable to return it to Amazon, because I have not kept the box. I called customer service, the young lady was very helpful, she did a video evaluation with me, watched every move I made while she gave instructions, she listened to the weird noises the pump made and the different flashing numbers on the display. She determined quickly that this machine failed and started the return process. Ninja pays for the shipping, provide a shipping label via FedEx, I ship, when they receive my machine they send the new one to me for free. I found that very convenient. All I had to do was finding a box that was big enough and take it to a FedEx shop.By the way: This is the first Ninja appliance that has ever failed, and trust me - I have many."
"I love the compact style, the several coffee options however the coffee does not brew very hot, I have to microwave my coffee after five minutes and it doesn’t have an option to increase the heat. I can’t use this. My keurig never did this, brewed very hot coffee. This product stated it gets hot after you’ve turned on the coffee pot and after first cup of coffee. This is not true and the coffee pot doesn’t stay on. It turns off a few minutes if you don’t start brewing"
"I really loved this coffee maker when it arrived. It makes hot coffee, fast. I like being able to use pods or grounds, especially.  But my second time using pods I had a cup full of coffee grounds, YUK! I have tried several fixes, but none have stopped the issue. I purchased small #1 filters to put in the basket when I use pods, but it doesn't brew thru the filter and you end up with 1/4 of your coffee trapped in the filter. The most frustrating part is it will brew perfectly sometimes and not other. So I am at a loss as to what causes the mess. I am especially upset that trying to fix the issue (unsuccessfully) closed the window to return the coffee maker. If anyone out there suffered the same trouble and has a successful solution, PLEASE SHARE IT! This was so much better than my 3rd Keurig until it malfunctioned. Hoping to find the fix, but not hopeful...:("
For the most part it made decent coffee for the 3 months it worked. Called Ninja service desk and they said they would replace it for a shipping charge or for free if I let them video conference me showing them it did not work. Neither way I was going to get a cup of coffee today. Went out and got a new machine by a different maker.
"I had a keurig mini that I used for about a year before it died.  I've had some luck with Ninja products so I purchased this for $100 only to see it go on sale for $80 a couple days later.  Too bad, but having used it I can see why the price is dropping so quickly.  It doesn't make a decent cup of K-cup coffee.  It's watery and weak and just doesn't taste like a real cup of coffee.  I'm using the same pods the Keurig used, just getting a bad cup of coffee.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Get the Keurig mini instead if you're mostly making k-cup coffee."
Got this new Ninja coffee maker 2 days ago and using k cups it leaves coffee grounds in the coffee mug.  It does it with several different brands of k cups.
"beyond disgusted. a brand new product that doesn't cost just a few bucks should last LONGER than 3 weeks.  I take special care of things because I know how cheap everything is made nowdays.  The saddest thing about this is the fact that the design of this they thought of every feature to make it so useful.  The drawer on the side for either ground coffee or k cup choice and easy storage of whichever one wasn't in use.  The water got so nice and hot and it heated up so quickly.  Most of all, the flavor of the coffee was the best of any kcup maker I've ever tasted.  I use the same coffee and I could taste more in the extraction of each cup from other kcup coffeemakers.  One of the best features was being able to adjust the holder underneath to accommodate so many different cup sizes, including my Contigo tumbler that I use for work and travel.  The coffee came out of the spigot and went where it was supposed to; in the cup.  So what happened?  I had used it that morning, went to make another cup around noon and heard a bubbling like noise.  The water was not pumping into the unit but was pumping hot water into the holder cup.  Pump issue.  When I removed the water holder, the water was spirting out of the top of the unit instead of drawing it in.  I never even removed the water tank from the machine because I know that everything is made of cheap Chinese plastic and didn't want to break anything..  Piece of crap.  I am not returning it.  I am just done with kcup makers and will go back to pour over or french press.  It is in the garbage.  DON'T BUY"
"I was downsizing, and this Ninja had many more features than a Keurig with a similar footprint.  Nothing against the various Keurig's that I've had over the years, I just wanted something with a smaller footprint on the counter.  I'm so glad I took the chance and got the Ninja.  I like using grounds, customizing the brew and having more choices as to brew size.EDIT (after 5 months of daily use):  Rating reduced to 3 stars. I am really tired of cleaning the grounds basket after every brewing. It does not rinse clean, but requires soaking.  Would someone please make a disposable filter for this otherwise very useful product?  PLEASE????"
Works great but noticed it was used when I disassembled the parts to clean prior to first use. There were coffee grind dust in the pod cup and in the filter. So much for a “brand new” machine.Simple to use and gets the job done.
"This has an excellent attached frother, probably best I've ever used and it is attached to and nicely hides into the machine.  It makes excellent kcups and you can vary the intensity of the cup by increasing size or reducing it. Why do I give it two stars? Because it is NOT a real espresso maker on the level of a Nespresso or actual espresso machine. It can do an intense ""specialty"" shot that mimics and is very close to espresso but after many uses I could not get it to produce crema and the intensity is not the same as from an espresso machine - it feels like a strong drip coffee using espresso. I returned it for a real espresso machine that can also do kcups which was really what I wanted."
"(This is a review of Amazon, and not of the product I purchased. I've had a Ninja coffee maker for years. It makes great coffee and I've been completely satisfied with the product, but I wanted a new one.) The Ninja coffee maker that I purchased from Amazon was broken out of the box. I followed the instructions for preparing the coffee maker for high-altitude brewing (I'm in Colorado), but the machine just sat there and did absolutely nothing. To ensure I wasn't doing something wrong, I called Ninja tech support. The tech determined that the coffee maker was, indeed, non-functioning. He decided to send me a replacement, free of charge. However, I had to cut the power cord, which he photographed, so that the replacement would be approved. I also purchased an extended warranty from Amazon. I'm not sure I can get a refund, but I'll try."
"Noisy, slow, and a mess to clean when using ground coffee. It's a lot larger than it really needs to be. I was packing it to return for a refund and dropped it, breaking a piece off the base. I guess I have to eat it. :("
Coffee is good but we have to heat Coffee in microwave.  I would not recommend this product
"I love ninja products and have used them for a while so had high expectations when I saw this machine. However, the espresso quality was so bad there was no crème even though I tried many options the way they suggested. The frother is pretty useless since it doesnt steam (you are better off buy a 5$ frother from anywhere else). I must appreciate they design of the machine because its perfect for small spaces. Hope they can work on the actual coffee part!"
We could not make a cup without getting grounds from a kcup into the mug. At one point it also exploded coffee grounds while brewing and got them all over the kitchen. Sadly I returned this.
"Do you like wiping up coffee grounds after the pod explodes inside the machine, sending coffee all over your clothes and the kitchen? Do you want to hold a mesh strainer over your cup to keep out the coffee grounds? Do you expect to have a milk steamer that's really a weak mixer that barely whips the milk? If so, this is the coffee maker for you! I've adapted by standing next to the machine during brewing, holding a strainer over my cup to keep out the grounds, and then removing the pod immediately so it has no chance to explode. Do not walk away from this machine! You could come back to a real mess -- inside and outside of the machine.I never would have bought this if I'd known that I have to adapt in order to make up for the severe shortcomings of this coffee maker. I've read other reviews that say customer service is sorely lacking, so I don't know whether to trash this piece of junk or ask for my money back. I'm going back to Keurig. We never had these frustrating problems with that brand."
Love everything about it but wish it would make stronger coffee when I use grounds.
Unfortunately I wanted to keep this product so badly that I asked for a replacement and I found the same thing. Both times I found what I believe was water when I opened the k-pod dispenser. I’m not sure why both my first buy and the replacement had water if it’s supposed to be new? I was grossed out so I had to return it and get a refund.
"I am so disappointed. I loved this coffee maker. Reservoir was a nice size, coffee came out fast and hot. Never really used the frother. Not even 2 months later it started making a grinding sound. Called ninja support and they agreed the base was busted but wanted to charge me 20 bucks to ship me a new one. I argued and they agreed to ship it for free due to how new the thing was. Absolute disappoint though. I'm glad I bought the asurion protection for future issues. Giving it to stars because I love the coffee maker but it breaking this quickly is a huge let down.Update: ninja customer service is awful. They took down everything but my phone number that comes in on the caller ID wrong. I didn't get a confirmation email and the replacement went to the wrong address. Two weeks later and now I'm being escalated to a supervisor without asking because the rep didn't want to deal with it."
Really thought I had found the perfect coffee maker because it’s a Ninja.  Worked great for a few days albeit  a bit noisy.  Today I really needed a nice warm drink after delivering mail in a blizzard so I chose the size and hit brew.  It started up and then sounded worse than normal and I looked at the top and the sizes numbers were jumping from one to the next over and over.  I had to unplug to turn off.  Let it sit for a minute and tried again to no avail….it repeated the same issue again.  Should’ve stuck with my Bunn Mycafe….glad I didn’t throw that out because it just made me a great cup of coffee
"The 10 is actually an 8 oz.and the 12 oz is a 10 oz.  I have two another machines that put out 10 oz that I measured, and this one is off."
I have had so many problems with this since I got it. Leaking grounds into my coffee. It's only 3 months old and this time it blew up all over my wall.
"Loved this machine when it worked!! I had super high hopes for it, as I’m tired of buying Keurig machines that stop working. It brews the coffee quick, and the frother worked really well.However, after 5 months of daily usage, (I drink one cup a day, during the weekdays. I don’t use it on the weekends), the water started leaking everywhere. When I noticed it, I cleaned it all up, tried to make coffee again, but the machine no longer sucked the water from the reservoir. I ended up throwing it away unfortunately."
"The coffee maker is really great but I'm super disappointed with the milk frother.  I didn't realize it was a cold milk frother and it really does nothing. You can't even get a good foam.  The second the cold milk hits the hot coffee it just melts it all.  I would send it back if it wasn't on sale but again, the maker part of it is really great. / Do NOT buy.  It keeps saying no water, makes god awful noises and isn’t even a year old.  Can’t reset or clean, it just won’t brew. This was after only 7 months.  Calling customer service they determined it was the plastic part the K cup goes in.  I knew it wasn't and they waved a $16 fee.  They make you go on camera to verify what you are saying is actually broken which I was ok with.  So having to wait 3-5 days on this part. Had to get a small coffee maker to have coffee.  Part gets here and of course that wasn't the problem so again on camera had to cut the cord so they sent me a new machine.  They wanted to charge 17 shipping and I said fine but did tell them that I was very disappointed and won't be ordering another Ninja products.  They then reduced the shipping by half.  I'm suposto get the maker today.  Hope and pray it will last for another 6 months.  When this one goes bad I'll be going back to the Keurig."
"Overall I appreciated the product (the look, compact for a midsize countertop.  It worked well, but, after 6 months or so, it started making a loud noise.  I cleaned it as the instructions stated.  I only made three cups of coffee a day, most times two.  And this morning, I woke up and I couldn't make a cup of coffee because it just stopped.  If you purchase this product, I suggest getting insurance for a few years.  I need to go and purchase a new Keurig.  I know Ninja is a popular and dependable brand, so I was told and read reviews, but I'm very disappointed I didn't have a good experience.I will need to look for another one and soon, because I love my coffee in the morning."
I like to use this with cappuccino pods.  No way to clean out the inside unit.  Now I brew one and then run water thru .  Every time!  Kind of a pain.
The mixer stopped working after just ONE time of using it!
"I purchased in August 24 , it is now Sept 24 and this morning the brew basket failed . Tried to order parts to find out in Ninja site not available.. so have a worthless $80 si for coffee maker that is not usable . The spring and tip portion does not snap back in and cannot be re attached ... would not recommend.Post script . The company contacted me , however in my continued attempts to get the problem solved , was able to get the brew basket and other small parts back where they belonged. The unit is working , and I have asked company how to order small parts for this unit .Post script, 9/23/2024  I spoke with Customer Service at Ninja today , this product has no replacement parts available. Due to the fact it is not yet 3 months old and under factory warranty, they are sending me a new unit. Would recommend purchasing unit insurance Amazon offers. I was very"
Loved this product used daily until 26 days in makes horrific noise hot steam from the basket area won't brew says needs water with full container. Not good!
"I’ve had this for 3 days and have loved it so far. This morning I put a pod in - mid brew it made a strange grinding sound and exploded everywhere. I was glad no child was nearby because it burnt my hand. It seems ok with the mesh pods but did not like my Mauds pod at all. So disappointed because now I’m leery of it after being so psyched about its features (super intuitive to use, can make iced coffee, etc etc)"
"I purchased this through Amazon Resale in ""Like New Condition"".  It was basically new with all of the original packaging. I loved this cofee maker and used it nearly everyday.  Two days ago it suddenly started making this horrific noise screeching noise when trying to draw water from the tank to make a cup of coffee. I emptied the tank and ran it through a cleaning cycle with vingar. It didn't make it through the cleaning cycle; it barely drew any water from the tank.  Since it is passed the 30 day Amazon return window I can't get it replaced.  And because I bought it through Amazon Resale, there is no manufacturer's warrenty.  That means I can't get it repaired by Ninja.  Do yourself a favor.  Don't by this coffee maker and never ever by a small appliance from Amazon Resale."
"purchased new but received used product (as stated on box) Disposed of box before confirmed it would work longer than 30 days. After thorough cleaning & getting it to do more that sputter, then there were grounds at the bottom of cup. Never knowingly buy used products. Stopped working in less than 30 days. Love design & it worked briefly; but now I need to find a more reliable resource."
I use it when the kids come down from Pennsylvania to visit us and I purchased it at the end of September.  I. Tried making coffee today and it won’t pump the water up to make the coffee.  I followed the trouble shooter online on Amazon and it still won’t work!!! Help!!  I need a replacement NOW!!!!!
"Got this October 7. Loved the idea of using a k cup or my own grounds.But 9 times out of 10, it sprays coffee/grounds from under the lid, all over my unit and counter.I have followed all troubleshooting instructions online (descaler, cleaned the needles, etc)… even after a cleaning, it does this. My coffee cup ends up full of grounds.It’s not the seller’s fault at all.But I’m frustrated I can’t get a hold of a live Ninja person to help get a new unit or discuss options."
"Hot coffee , ease of operation , liked the features .but ,unfortunately within 1 month , stated  getting “ add water” error messages . Of course I tried all the troubleshooting methods , but still same issue.Thank God I was within the 30 return periodGot refund .  Trying a Keurig machine instead."
"I received the product, opened it, set it up, read the entire manual and ran the steam cycle it states to run of 24oz.I set it up for hubs to use the next day-PER INSTRUCTIONS. He was able to make one 18oz cup of coffee. I proceeded to use it, and it tells me to “add water.” I followed instructions on declogging-it didn’t work. I tried for over 45 minutes, I gave up and returned the product.Super disappointed. I really wanted it to work out."
"I switched to Ninja after replacing several Keurig.  Simply said, Ninja coffee brew system makes a much better brew than Keurig.  However, this is my third Ninja due to the fact when using the K-Cup feature, it left a good amount of grounds in the cup.  It didn't matter whether I used Keurig K-Cups or store brand.  Ninja has great custo.er service but seems unable to resolve this issue.  When brewing coffee using fresh grounds, you can't ask for a better cup of coffee.  Because of that, I will keep this and not use the pod brewing option."
"I usually only drink 1 cup of coffee a day and have had my Keurig for about 4 years. Keurig is still working fine, but I decided to switch to this coffee maker because I would some options such as the ground coffee . However, the water cup of the coffee maker had leaked too much after a few days of purchase.My overall experience is a cheap machine so the quality is very poor, the main material of the machine is plastic."
Loved the size and how it brewed the coffee but it completely died in only 4 months. I usually made 3 cups a day which I don’t feel is excessive. Very disappointed
The Ninja PB051 box was water damaged. The unit work great for one week and then refused to brew. After leaving it unplugged overnight it started working again. So I returned it for refund. Would have liked it to work as it has the ability to brew both pods and ground coffee
Not what I expected from Ninja. I makes a noise brewing the hot water and you can see the steam coming out while brewing your coffee. I'm glad I paid for it at $80 rather then the normal price of $130.
"Purchased Ninja single serve coffee maker, worked good about 6/7 weeks. Started making strange sounds and having trouble pumping water. Did lots of troubleshooting to figure out the problem and deep cleaning. Would brew one-two cups and stop again. Husband spent 45 mins on phone with customer serve to try and find answers. Only to hear...we can order and pay for this $26 part and install ourselves and it ""should"" take care of the problem. What about the one year warranty??? It only worked for 6/7 weeks! Told us the warranty doesn't cover this part. I'm sorry but that is just wrong. I thought we were purchasing a good product only to discover NINJA doesn't back their product. I personally will NOT recommend Ninja. Save your money and look for a different brand."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I read the reviews and knew that people had trouble with this unit but thought I would still give it a try. Well, LESS than 2 months after purchasing the mechanism that pulls water in from the reservoir stopped working. Clearly there are some design / quality issues that Ninja needs to work out. It’s a shame, as I thought it made a good cup of coffee while it was working (preferred over Keurig). Fortunately, Amazon still took it back"
Not thrilled. Have to push brew a couple of times to get a full 10 Oz cup of coffee.. not sure why?  Defective?  Or do they all work this way?  Disappointed.
Had to contact ninja and they made me paid $20 for shipping a replacement and it’s going on 4 months but it seems like the pump might go again.
I bought this machine and it looks very nice and easy to use. I had to return it due to all the plastic inside of it that is exposed to heat. If you don't care about hot plastic in your coffee then this one is a good purchase
"For a cooffe person this doesn't make a good quality cooffe no with the ground or kcup, I think the idea is there but they have to work how this can brew better ...It taste like water with a hint of cooffe..not even the specialty 4oz ..is just a good looking, expensive machine...This is my first review on Amazon because I went by reviews selecting this one but I think people that gave a good one doesn't even know what a good coffee supposed to taste like!So Maybe somebody else don't waste money :/That's why I did the rew."
"I loved my Ninja for 6 weeks until it didn’t work.  I think it was a computer chip problem.  It wouldn’t select brew nor size. I called Ninja.  They are sending out a replacement unit after I showed them the cut cord.  I love this unit.  It’s easy to use both with KCups and ground coffee.  The attached frothed is fun and very easy to use.  I’m hoping that my next one will last forever!  I’m very pleased with Ninja customer service!  I would have given it 5 stars, but it broke down.I have now had two replacement units  from Ninja for a total of 3 units.  The 2nd and 3rd units wouldn’t brew kcups but would work well with the basket and ground coffee from the time that I got them. Ninja would not let me keep a working machine until replacement arrived.  They wanted me to send them back the no working unit and then send the new unit. That takes even longer! Same problem with 2 & 3.  The panel wouldn’t light up with kcups to brew coffee.  I’m very disappointed with this wonderful coffee machine.****The 4th one they sent in 4 months died once again. I’m using filtered water from my fridge.  This time the water won’t pump into the unit.  Ninja is sending me a newer version.  I hope that this one works forever!"
Machine came broken. I am so upset and disappointed
"I won’t make excuses for the B&D. It lacks ability to make a truly hot pot of coffee.  Perhaps it’s a design flaw. But it raises questions about how it had such good reviews as is often the case with products that fail to meet the minimum expectations.  After brewing, and even if I leave it on the warmer a while after brewing.  The results are the same - temp is Just above warm.  I have bought many MANY coffee makers over the decades. Currently in use; (4i,e,) one 12 cup drop. One 5 cup drip 5-7 years old still works better than this. One Lrg & one small kcup. All of them are years old and all have traveled a few times for wrk or vacay.I bought this ANZN product to replace my small 5 cup that was about 7 yrs old at best.  Deapite routine cleaning n maintenance it was over due to replace. However, despite the over use, travel, and age of my old 5 cup, it still makes a better cup of coffee than the product I replaced it with - the product of this review.  I gave it a try and sadly I regret that I cannot recommend this product. Dear shoppers.  When it comes to this type of appliance, I suggest spending a few dollars more or buy products that allow more than 30 days to return or replace. THIS Amazon SELLER/PRODUCT DID NOT OFFER  ***EXTENDED WARANTYand I’ve often been disappointed to learn that the AMAZON WRTY SELLER*** Very often refuses to assist until MANUFACTURER WRTY is expired.  ITS OFTEN TO DISCOURAGE RETURNS OR REPAIR SERVICE REQUESTS.  HOWEVER, ***The way around that - PUT PRODUCT AWAY TILL MFTR WRTY EXPIRES.  Then SEEK assistance.This might be a FLUKE. But it’s definitely A HEADACHE and may also be A WASYE OF MY MONEY.  And that’s terrible at a time when price gouging is hitting consumers in every department- especially food and small appliances.  I remember these little machines often on sale for $10 - not just on Black Friday.  Now it’s not that low even on Black Friday. Many vendors once stood behind their products and priority was consumer satisfaction. Sadly, priorities have shifted elsewhere.  I’ll update this review with any changes in results of this product purchase. For now I’m looking for the current place to buy appliances with ease and confidence in transactions.  I hate writing a bad review.  I don’t avoid it. It’s consumers’ duty."
"Recently bought this coffee maker, I’m European, and I’m obsessed with coffee. I purchased another coffee maker months ago. But it only does 5 cups, and I like to drink more in the morning. So I decided to purchase another coffee maker, that has more cups of coffee. Saw this one and was like perfect! For some reason I go to brew coffee, it stops brewing, and then I have to lift the lit up, close it again all the way, and then it starts brewing again. I have to do this every time I make coffee. And it’s very annoying! I’ve never had a coffee maker stop halfway, then you got a lift the lid, close it again, and then it brews. So now I’ve reached out to the seller or the manufacturer and I’m hoping they can give me a replacement?! I shouldn’t have to lift the lid and then close it again in order to get the rest of my coffee. A coffee maker should brew all the way And it doesn’t matter how many cups you want."
"This is a coffee maker for a person who is not fussy. It is made of lower quality plastic with a glass carafe and easy use, easy clean. Coffee taste is meh because it drips too fast. If you are okay with grabbing a cup at MickyDs or the convenience/gas station store, this will work fine for you. I am a former coffee house owner so read this review with that in mind. It's a good coffee maker for the price if you are simply looking for a cuppa joe. Compared to Cuisinart or KitchenAid (both proceeded this one) this is a an average drip coffee maker. I'm keeping it and storing in case someone needs it at church and using the Bodum french press instead."
Makes good coffee.and doesn’t weigh a ton to scoot back and forth on the counter. But-The carafe measurement of water and the side window measurement on the pot do not agree how many cups of water is in the pot. And it needs a few extra seconds before you can pull the pot away for a pause and serve situation. Overall- it was inexpensive and does function as a coffeemaker.
"It's okay, it's a coffee maker, and it works. It's advertised as a 12 cup coffee maker, but that's if you only drink 6oz cups of coffee. I'm a bit of a coffee hound so this 12 cup (actually 8-8oz cup) coffee maker goes fast when you have more than one coffee drinker in the house or office like I do. Auto shut off isn't a big deal. It has a switch to turn it off and it works. The first couple of times using it, it smelled like burning plastic, but the smell has since gone away. I bought this to replace a Mr. Coffee machine that crapped out after about 6 months. I suspect I'll have to replace this one within a few months too. I guess you get what you pay for. However, I don't think a $100+ coffee maker makes coffee any better than this $25 one."
"I loved my basic Mr Coffee--good coffee, strong/regular switch, autoshut off, the basket came in and out easily, and the unit was heavy enough that it didn't slide around when you put the carafe in or took it out. These are not major issues, but it seemed Black and Decker's priority was to make it as cheaply as possible, even though this basic model cost more than my basic Mr. Coffee, which I only got rid of because I broke the carafe and didn't think it was worth replacing that for $15 when my Mr. Coffee was 10 years old. I also assumed because of the high ratings of this basic Black and Decker that it would somehow be better. I was wrong."
"Great coffee pot with one issue, there's NO automatic shut off... I'm shocked in 2024 this is not a standard feature... I think it should be clearly stated so customers know before buying...  That said it brews good and does a good job at having a no drip spout..."
"I noticed my coffee was not staying hot after two hours and so I thought it was a warranty issue.  Black and Decker warranty line for customer service told me NONE of their products will stay hot for longer than 2 hours.  This is a 12 cup coffee maker. We don’t go through 12 cups in two hours.  So that gets a 3 star from me.  The heating pad has to last longer than 4 hours to be useful for over 6 cups of coffee.  We just don’t drink 12 cups that fast.  EDIT:  Two days later the heating element has failed.  Now it won't even work for starting the brewing.  It is one year old.  This unit was not a programmable unit, but the simple manual on/off 12-cup.  It worked for a year, so I guess it was a cheap disposable?  My previous non-programmable coffee maker lasted almost 12 years."
"Very simple to use, but it makes my beloved locally roasted ""craft"" coffee (getting tired of that term) taste like basic diner/gas station/convenience store/hotel lobby coffee.I'm not a coffee snob - how could I be; I just bought a cheap hunk of mostly plastic coffee maker, but I am used to making pour-over coffee with ceramic, stainless steel and paper equipment (which I chose for its simplicity and minimal or lack of electricity, before I found out that coffee hipsters are into pour-over). My pour-over coffee is superior to this machine in aroma, flavor and body, but does take 15 minutes from start to first sip. I enjoyed drip coffee at two different vacation rentals that provided cheap plastic drip makers, and I thought I'd pick one up for convenience, on mornings where I needed to get moving faster, or if I had a guest, but I should have paid attention to the model of drip brewer at those rentals and just purchased one of them.Instead I have this one, which makes boring coffee out of really good beans. I tried to adjust the grind finer and use more beans to extract more flavors, but I just get the same bland result.The drip makers at the vacation rental properties were also cheap, just press one button machines (I think one of them was a Mr. Coffee, and the other a Cuisinart), but they made pre-ground grocery store brand coffee taste better than my locally roasted (and fabulously fresh) ""craft"" whole bean, freshly ground coffee tasted in this Black & Decker I'm now reviewing.The good news for normal pre-ground mainstream coffee drinkers (Folger's etc) though, is that I don't think this machine will alter your flavor one way or the other - it made my coffee taste like your coffee, so go for it, especially if you add cream and sugar (or whatever) anyway.Rather than add one more piece of plastic to the landfill of forever chemicals, I will try to re-home this as a gift (yes, where it will still eventually find its way to the landfill forever, just later rather than sooner, and who knows - maybe there will be a solution for that before this eventually gets tossed, but not likely)."
The wear on the burner is really looking used like I run it 24/7. I put on and it goes off within an hour daily. Surprise how it looks. Not about making coffee. Works great.....
"I should have read the description closer. There is no automatic turn off, and no pause feature. Both very annoying to me. Also very cheaply made. I can’t imagine it lasting long."
The power switch on these things break from basic use within a year of purchasing.This is the 2nd time it's happened on each of the units I have purchased
"Unit is small and was low in price, so I am somewhat satisfied but it steams out under the lid and runs water to the countertop. There is no stopper on drip point so it's open when you remove pot and drips onto hot plate. Pot fits tight  under drip, making it awkward to get it out for pouring. It does its job of brewing so I'll keep it until I find another small one."
"The description said ""removable coffee filter basket"". I opened the new box and the machine requires a filter. Just a misleading description I guess...."
"This product was purchased to replace an unacceptable used option. Unfortunately, this product did not last a full 2 months before it stopped working. The power light comes on but the machine will not brew. I just missed the return/refund window time frame of coarse so I guess I am going shopping in person for my next coffee maker and hopefully avoid a 3 for 3 outcome."
This coffee maker was supposed to be programmable but it is not
"I have been used to larger pot. That one had automatic shut off. I didn’t want to spend as much money on a new one but should have! Takes too long to brew, water still in ground basket, not hot enough. You get what you pay for."
"If you're looking for something really basic, then this is a good coffee maker—it's inexpensive (comparatively) and easy to use with only one button that turns it on and off. However, the overall quality of the machine and the coffee it makes are only okay.The bottom of the machine I received was uneven, so it wobbles on my kitchen counter instead of sitting steady, and one side of the plastic hinge on the top lid of the machine broke/snapped within the first couple uses. Neither issue prevents the coffee maker from working, but they are annoying to deal with on a daily basis. I might have just gotten a wonky/defective machine, but it seems more like a quality issue with the plastic. Maybe the plastic weakened/warped slightly out of shape from how they stored it before shipping? Not sure, but it's worth being aware before deciding to order one.Coffee wise, I brewed the coffee using the same amount of grounds and water that I normally do, but it came out with a stronger/heavier/darker roast flavor. Easy enough to adjust for (and maybe it has more to do with me than the coffee maker), but again it's worth noting so you know what to expect."
"Used to have another Black and Decker coffee pot.  Bought one for my son and for my visit from Thanksgiving to Christmas.  The coffeemaker appears ok, but when you fill it to whatever water level you want, the number of cups you pour in differs from what the side water level shows.  The water blows into the basket and blows the grounds into the coffee pot.  For some reason the basket that is activated by the coffee pot to drain the coffee into the pot stops working about half way through or the nozzle plugs so that all the water stays in the basket and unless you notice it it will overflow the basket.  And I do use a water filter.  Finally, the heating plate under the coffee pot does not keep the carafe hot, so even after pouring the first cup it is just warm and so needs to be put in the microwave or it will be cold in a few minutes.  Generally the price of the until is right, but the unit certainly doesn't function the way I expected.  I wouldn't buy it again. Very disappointing."
Basic for those who drink occasionally coffee
"The description states that there is a ""special permanent filter""  No, there is not. There is a removable filter basket, but no filter was included.The ""vortex technology"" is a bit misleading.The coffee maker will stay on until you remember to turn it off.I had to run 5 pots of plain water through the machine just to get the plastic smell out of it.As long as you remember to turn off the coffee maker after a few hours and you provide your own permanent filter, it should work well"
"Makes a  cup of coffee is just OK.  Does not have a grab-n-go (auto pause) to get a quick cup before brewing is done. Also, the brewing temperature does not get hot enough. The brewing temperature should be 195 degrees f  to 205 degrees f to make a good cup of coffee.  This coffee maker can only get up to 180 degrees f.  I will keep the coffee maker. Did not pay a lot for it. Use it for a backup."
"I tried and returned (4/5 cup) coffee makers Amazon Basics, and Krups.  And what a nuisance to have to box things back up and drive to the UPS dropoff, due to poor manufacturing standards/quality control!!  Amazon basics was too cheaply made of thin plastic, emitted a strong plastic smell when I ran clean water thru it, and had sharp edges on handle.  Krup was better, but had a few sharp spots on handle, and a lid that required 2 hands to open.  I was at first pleased with the B&D with all aspects, easy to fill, easy to clean, no strong plastic smell, solidly made -  till this morning when I removed the pot and there was still water in the basket - and coffee flowed everywhere, no auto close as even the cheaper brands had, and, my previous coffee maker.  so disappointed that this very basic feature wasn't incorporated by Black & Decker, and now I've used the coffee pot a few times, and  cant return it, and will live with this for the next few years.  Where is quality these days?"
"It makes good coffee, I don't like that it doesn't have a valve when you take the pot out so the coffee drips onto burner."
I don’t like how every time you open the top there is water dripping from under the lid.
"Re: 5 cup coffee makerBoth the box and instructions indicate that, in addition to the FILTER BASKET HOLDER, there is a REMOVABLE FILTER BASKET (see photo).The item appeared unused, but the tape on the packaging appeared to be resealed.  I will be requesting a replacement."
Smells like chemicals are burning in with your coffee
It's OK but slow making coffee.
I got this for a second home.  It works except for there is no automatic shutoff which is a bummer.  I guess that can't be expected for a lesser price point.  Otherwise it works well.
"Our heating element quite working on our old Black and Decker Coffeemaker.  I did not want a programmable or anything fancy.  I order this coffeemaker from Amazon and they were super quick on the delivery.  I cleaned it and had it working by the next day.  I do not like the carafe.  It is a poor design of lifting up the lid.  It hurts my thumb.  There is no need for this poor of a design.  I would not buy this again, but it does work fine!"
Does not have the valve to stop the coffee from dripping down from the basketwhen you pull out the pot. And I find the side mounted power button annoying.Was happier with my Mr Coffee.
"If you leave the house without turning it off, this coffee pot will eventually burn.  And your house?  Who knows. I can't believe I didn't notice there is no timed off button."
"The coffee maker itself is great however, only certain models include the removable and reusable coffee basket. This model did not, therefore, I had to order a basket before being able to use it."
Really is cheaply made despite reputable name. Lid falls off when pouring coffee. When you open unit to add water it will spit hot water at you if still plugged in.
carafe shattered after 3 months
"Purchased mine just over a month ago, and now it won't heat or run water through it at all. I can't leave a lower review because I don't think this model was meant to run continuously for multiple days in a row while you're writing a book.Make your morning brew, then turn off the machine, and it should last several months longer than mine. I just needed to invest in a higher quality machine (with auto off features)."
"Late delivery, lost in transit, then suddenly it was here. Seems to work okay so far. Managed to get my #4 cone filter to fit."
Pause feature does not always work  and you end up with coffee all over your counter.
Exactly what I ordered expectations meet  appearance function cleaning filter all so far so good.
"I wound up returning this due to the cheapness of it. Feels really cheaply made and is oddly too lightweight IMO. Seemed to work fine however I was a little leery about the longevity of this thing. On the plus side, it's really cheap so even if it did break a year or so down the road, not a huge loss."
"PROS:- 12 cups.- Good brew flavor.- Keeps warm until you turn it off.- Manual switch for smart plug compatibility.CONS:- Carries a high level of condensation. I’m not sure how this might be solved other than adding more room for steam to escape from the top lid somehow.- After 5 months of everyday use this coffee maker can’t seem to brew without dripping when you remove the pot. It’s as if the stopper no longer works so any water still left in the brew cup just pours out onto the hot plate.- Second to this, grinds are consistently overflowing into the pot during the drip cycle and this only started happening recently but it’s consistent about 6 out of 7 days per week.- That leads me to believe there is some fault with the drip stop mechanism on the basket that causes too much water to build up (or water is simply brewing too fast) causing grinds to overflow, which then interfere with the drip stop causing coffee to flow onto the hot plate as stated above.All in all manufacturer defects make this not recommended for purchase at this time.For this who love smart home functions – Unless a coffee maker has WiFi built in, the only other way to control it from an app on your own unpredictable schedule is by using a smart plug, and this among the few quality coffee maker options that exist to do it."
"Despite meticulous daily cleaning of the basket area this machine easily and frequently becomes jammed, overflows, and fails to smooth over our mornings with the delicious coffee experience we crave. Rather, nearly everyday I swear I'm going to smash this purchase into debris or simply launch it violently into the street... Next time I buy a coffee maker (which will be very soon or I fear for my sanity) I will pay a little more in hopes of better mornings ahead. A few dollars aren't not worth the suffering this machine has caused. Woe to you, shopper, if this is the machine you purchase!"
Are you a regular coffee drinker who wants to brew a pot at a time instead of a cup at a time?  Then plan to add a few bucks to your budget and buy a better coffee maker than this one.  You deserve it.
Will be used for an upcoming brunch.
"I did not like the big dispenser, It made the hot water bend the filter making a mess. I did like the speed  making the coffee. 12 cups in about 3 to 4 min"
"Coffee maker box was taped when it arrived. I don’t think I was sold a brand new unit. After I opened the box, I saw the coffee maker had scratches and dents on it. Disappointed."
"Trying it out right now. Hoping it shuts off automatically. Can with NO COFFEE BASKET WHICH SUCKS. If it doesn't turn off by itself, it's heading back. We'll see."
Appliance works well but it doesn't have an auto shutoff and it drips water all over the front part when changing the filter for a new brewed pot.
"Not a fan of having to open the whole top of the coffee maker to fill water.  After coffee brews, when you open to remove used coffee grounds the hot steam spits out randomly"
"This works great, it’s just that there are lesser priced makers out there with an ""stop drip"" feature when removing the pot. With this unit, you have to wait until it is COMPLETELY finished with the brewing process before removing the pot, as it will continue to flow out and onto the heating pad.The other option is to quickly transfer a cup while removing the pot, if you're wanting coffee soon than later."
"My normal coffee maker broke on me. I bought this as a temporary solution (because I could get it in one day) until my new coffee maker arrives.It makes coffee.  It’s super easy to use.There is a huge problem with the carafe though. Any time I pour with it, the coffee or water runs down the side.  I lose half the liquid.  At least my paper towels are getting cafeinated!"
"I drink a lot of coffee. I use my coffee maker all day long and all night. I have used Mr. Coffee for maybe 20+ years. That needs to get replaced every 3-4 years of heavy use. This one I got because it was priced better than the Mr. Coffee 12 cup on Amazon. I got this on May 22, 2024. On June 20, 2024, it stopped working. So I am getting another one today and will see how long that one lasts before making any long term conclusions."
"Sent back. It has no auto off timer, it should be a requirement in this day and age"
I expected more out of Black & Decker. I liked the price and the basic features but I am used to having more features with the same price for a coffee maker. I have only had this coffee maker for a couple weeks now and I'm already looking for another one I am definitely not satisfied with this machine. I personally need one that will make a darker coffee and not spill the grinds over into my carafe. This coffee maker only makes coffee that tastes like water or like I said the grinds will spill over into the carafe the jug. I think I'm going to clean this one up and give it to my friends that aren't doing so well financially and need a coffee maker but I'm definitely going to get me a better one. Black & Decker you let me down.
"Everything about this product is good EXCEPT that there is no pause button on filter basket. What this means that when you remove the pot, (even after brewing has stopped), coffee will drip from the basket on to the hot plate. You have to remove the basket, quickly, before removing the pot. Pretty inconvenient & never have seen this on any other small maker I have purchased. Would not recommend solely based on this."
OPENED ITEM BOX TO CHECK IT OUT AND I WAS MISSING MY FILTER BASKET.
"After two or three Mister Coffee coffee makers I tried Black & Decker and am disappointed. I did not realize that there is no flow interrupt and it's a long wait for all the drips to fall into the pot. The unit leaks underneath so I have to keep the coffee maker on a large plate in order for the liquid not to run onto my counter. When pouring from the carafe, the coffee spills out from the side of the spout. The quality of the coffee is not superior to the Mister Coffee's and the inconvenience of using this appliance makes me want to replace it right away. Money wasted."
"Similar to the one it replaced. The one big flaw is there is no shut off after a time. If you forget to turn it off it will stay on for days, or until it melts. I am installing a two hour timer in the receptacle that we plug it into"
"The ridiculously flimsy lid breaks off on your first heavy breath near the machine. Becomes difficult working with the basket, filter, or water after that. I had as a youth thought Black & Decker a strong name for sturdy, quality products that last; but after this mess, and two of their weed wackers, I will stay away from any of their products in the future."
The coffeemaker is nice but there was no coffee filter.
"It makes coffee, nothing special. It does not have an auto shutoff. Leaving a coffee maker on for a few hours will make coffee taste burnt. Eventually I suspect it would evaporate completely. I overlooked this feature when buying it. I’m keeping it but I would not purchase again."
Coffee pot looked nice but was missing the filter
"I moved into my travel trailer and needed a smaller coffee maker. I bought this one to replace an existing small one I had. The one I had didn't seem to make the coffee very hot anymore. Got this one, set it up, noticed two things: One, there is no filter. Two, there is no automatic stop-drip feature. In addition, the coffee is a little bit hotter, but not much. I bought this coffee maker based on reviews and as it turns out, it's basically what I already had minus some features. Would not purchase again."
I bought the coffee machine worked great 2 months later Bearly works at all. Shoot stream through the cap. I cleaned it still not working just makes noises and water vapor coming out.
"Decent tasting cup of coffee, simple one button operation. Downside is doesn't get hot, it's warm, easy to drink from the tap, but not ideal for a travel mug."
"The simplicity is wonderful.  The thing to be cautious about is that the coffee maker does NOT turn off by itself.I ran water through it to test if all things were functioning properly.  I set a 1 hour and then another hour. 2 hours total time and it never shut off.In a busy household things do get forgotten.  In my opinion only, I find this to be a possible fire hazard.Other than that, all worked well."
"First off, whoever designed this apparently never used it. The carafe is designed so it’s almost impossible to pour out all the water into the reservoir because of how the back is designed and gets in the way when you’re trying to fill.  Second, and most ridiculous, the 12 cup mark on the carafe is only 10 cups in the water reservoir and if you fill the tank up to the full 12 cup the carafe nearly overflows. For the price try another brand."
"Makes good coffee, but the unit is way too light.. need two hands to remove carafe from coffee pot. Need two hands to replace carafe on coffee pot.. need two hands to turn off or on.. coffee pot moves all over counter if not held with hand while doing anything coffee pot related.. Carafe is shaped to spill when trying to fill coffee pot or trying to put into coffee cup no matter the quantity of coffee in it."
"I purchased this coffee maker to replace a no longer working Cuisinart coffee maker. One would have ordinarily expected great coffee making technology in this day and age. With even the lower priced coffee making machines to perform as good if not better than their predecessors. The previous Cuisinart coffee machine stopped working after approx 18 months. Disappointing in it's longevity given how flavorsome the brewed coffee it produced. Sidestepping Cuisinart to choose another manufacturer seemed like a sensible option. After looking through many reviews on Amazon, the decision was made to go with the Black and Decker coffee maker. The order arrived yesterday and so next began the setup and preparation for the first inaugural coffee brew with quite strong dark roast coffee grinds. Upon starting the brew process, the first most obvious feature was how quickly the whole process took. Some doubts began to arise as to eventual quality of the coffee. Letting the machine complete the brewing process , I next grabbed my coffee mug  to access the first cup of coffee from this new machine. Suffice to say the results were underwhelming with an end product not even remotely close in flavor to my previous Cuisinart machine. The results were in fact night and day in direct comparison. For those who say the coffee flavor and aroma (really muted and faint) are really good, do yourself a favor and try the same coffee grinds in a coffee maker from Cuisinart for example. You will be happy you did and that is coming from real and verifiable experience."
"The coffee stays hot, but the pitcher is coffee maker produces 12 cups with a 10 cup pitcher. Made a big mess the first go around."
"I think it's a decent coffee pot. It does the job. What I don't like is that it says sneak a cup that's BS. It's about an 50/50 u can get a cup when it's brewing. I wake up in the morning, knowing I can't sneak a cup. It haunts me to where I'm gonna buy a different coffee pot. It does not let you sneak a cup. Some may laugh at my review. Don't sell me a lie. you should say sneak a cup maybe"
I ordered this because I thought it came with coffee filter. What happened to it? Could you send it please? The coffee grounds go into it.
"The carafe is so heavy when full of water, as the handle does not fit well with the size of the carafe. Very awkward to pour water into the reservoir.  Will keep it in the garage & use it if I have company. I purchased a smaller one."
This coffee maker was amazing at first. All of a sudden one day the power switch just broke. There was no way to put it back on. So disappointing and upsetting that I had to throw it in the trash after not even one month. Such bad quality.
"OK I’ve had it for eight or nine months but yesterday morning when I filled the carafe with water and picked it up to pour it into the coffee pot. The bottom fell out and water went everywhere. I then wasted a whole lot of time trying to find a replacement carafe which Black & Decker evidently does not make. I finally found a generic one and ordered it and it came today and it does fit although the top it has does not fit but fortunately I had saved the old lid, so I should be able to use this, I paid $18 just to replace the carafe and I think it’s weird that it would break like that. I have never left it on hot when empty and even with coffee in it I never left it on for very long at all. The only other thing is that it does not stop dripping if you try to pull the carafe out to pour a cup of coffee before it’s completely done brewing so I have had to put a paper towel under the drip for the time that I am pouring out my 1st cup of coffee."
"Price, quality of coffee but didn’t notice it doesn’t have an auto shut off. Just an observation."
This coffee pot is cheaply made nothing like Mr. coffee. MY doesn’t taste the same.
"I am a 2 cup coffee girl in the morning so never have a full pot. I give it 35 minutes to an hour for it to brew, pour myself all of its contents and then still come back at 30 minutes later and there’s more in the pot. It wastes coffee. It’s slow. I miss my old Mr. coffee that died. Might just have to go back to that."
"No stopper, must brew entire amount. Gets to about 155°F, not very hot."
it does not shut off automaticly in 10 min
"Just get the better maker. It's not worth the wasted coffee. It's a 50/50 shot that the maker will not clog up and overflow, even if the grounds are sized for drip coffee. This started happening pretty early into the purchase and now I have to set the maker juuuust right to brew a decent batch. Save yourself the money"
"Just on & off coffee maker... Very light weight... STOP pour does NOT work... I've yet to get a cup without coffee pouring out the top... I would return, but I have used it several times... Will definitely WAIT til coffee is DONE dripping....PS... the way I go thru coffee makers, glad it was inexpensive ...ThanksD"
"I always purchase the  Black and Decker 12 cup coffee maker, but this time i bought theone that ia 4 or 5 dollars cheaper, and it shows it.  Not put together very well and no automatic turn off."
"""Keep Hot Carafe Plate - The nonstick carafe plate keeps coffee warm for an hour after brewing is complete."" Quote reprinted from the Ad.Until the switch is turned off, the warmer plate stays hot forever."
"Not sure what’s with this coffee makerShould’ve believed the reviews noting it “leaks”.Had another one from 2021 that I honestly should have stuck with. Was still working 3 years later with no issues and was tossed because I thought this was an “upgrade”.Sadly mistaken :( thanks for the quick delivery, though, Amazon!"
We didn’t realize there isn’t an automatic shut off or we wouldn’t have purchased it. We have left it on all day several times and come home to a burnt smell and luckily no fire.
"I wanted something slightly bigger than my 4 cup coffee make and this seemed just right. It's good, but I notice the coffee is not quite as hot as I like it."
"Ugh! SOOO wanted to love this coffee maker, but there are a couple of annoying things about it. First, it doesn't auto-stop-dripping when you remove the glass decanter during brewing. Second, when pouring water into the receptacle prior to brewing, it doesn't completely empty without awkwardly flipping decanter further than you should have to. It's hard to explain, sorry! I probably won't buy this one again."
First order top was cracked at the hinge.  Not a good design.  I will say if you are careful it may last a year or so.  Second order plugged it in and after a first pot I smelled an electric burning smell. Will be returning.  No auto shut off so that is also an issue.  I feel like this could work for someone on really tight budget if they are very careful.
Stop and pour doesn't work while it is still brewing.  It is not the high quality of my previous Black and Decker coffee pots!
"Unless you are more coordinated than me (and I was a really good juggler in high school), you will make a mess. The carafe pouring spout (if that's what its called...the shaped glass part on the carages glass rim, that you aim for when pouring) is designed so that it drips some coffee, every single time, onto floor or counter or in sink. I have tried, fast, slow, in between, etc, and every time.Second mess is that the hole at bottom of brewing cup (?), ie the plastic thing the filter sits in, and the water drips into the coffee in, has a plain hole at the bottom to allow the coffee, that has now gone thru the ground coffee and filter, t drip into carafe. This means that when you go to empty it by grabbing the little handle that sticks out an inch, and lift it out to dump in garbage, it drips onto counter and/or floor. Every time, unless it's 10 minutes later and every molecule of coffee has dripped into carafe.  I got rid of my Mr Coffee because they have a spring loaded thing that closes this hole unless it's perfectly lined up with a protrusion above while brewing, and I was always thinking ""Who needs that...it's hard to line up and, sometimes it overflows the plastic brewing cup since it's not lined up so hole is not open below"". Well apologies to Mr. Coffee, since now I know why they have that spring loaded hole closer...so when you pull it out to dump filter and grinds in garbage, that hole is closed by the spring action.On the bright side I get extra stretching bending down to wipe my floor where it drips twice a day.Reading other reviews, or rather the fact that nobody elses seems to mention this, makes me think I am crazy...but my paper towel expenditures say otherwise."
"It works just fine. It will brew you're coffee quickly and effectively. But it's more expensive than other 5-cup models and has less basic features. My main gripe is that there's no stopper in the basket that regulates coffee flow. The coffee just drips straight through an open hole with nothing to stop it. Other cheaper models at least include a springed stopper in the basket so you can pour a cup while it's still brewing. With this model the coffee would just pour out. So you have to wait until all of the coffee has brewed, then wait for all of it to seep through the filter. Honestly it's super annoying."
"I accidentally ordered two, and missed the return window because I was busy, out of town, and procrastinated.  It leaks, like they all do. Didn't realize it didn't have an automatic shut off so it will basically stay on all day if you forget to turn it off like my teenager does all the time."
The coffee maker leaks. Has noauto stop when I remove the carafe causing the water to continue flowing onto the tray.
Disappointed on this machine purchase.  I have been brewing coffee for 50+ years and this goes down as worst machine.1. The volume of space for Grounds for the size pot is incorrect.  4 cup pot basket 10 cup pot.2. Brewing liquid will back flush into water tank.Find another if you like coffee and skip the frustration of this unit.
"I use this for hot water and after a week my tea still tastes like plastic. I make coffee in a press, and I didn't taste the plastic because the coffee covers it up. Totally drinking in toxins."
Good product but missing the bucket filter.
I used the coffee maker once to twice a day for two years.  The button to turn the coffee maker on and off broke.  The button physically stopped being able to move back and forth.
"Makes great coffee, the only issue I have is , it’s isn’t automatic shut off, so the power stays on, and the coffee keeps dripping when you remove the pot to fill your cup."
"UPDATED - MY THOUGHTS AFTER 9 MONTHS OF OWNERSHIP SO FARPros:-14 cup carafe is great for our household.-Removable water reservoir makes it easy to fill-Fantastic pouring spout; doesn't spill when you poor-Cone shaped filter allows you to use less coffee; basket filters tend to allow coffee to spread out in the filter if you don't use enough grounds.-The genius carafe spout actually funnels the entire brew to the bottom of the carafe.  It is such a great idea since the beginning of the cycle always produces stronger coffee that the end of the cycle.  It results in the batch to continually mix throughout the cycle so that the coffee at the top of the carafe has the same consistency as the coffee at the bottom.  It's amazing that feature is not more commonplace with auto-drip machines.-You can extend the warmer to up to 4 hours.-Delay start is also very nice.Cons:-The end of the brewing cycle is very loud; so, I wouldn't recommend this machine if you need it for a quiet setting.-It seems very cheaply made; although I had a lot of positive things to say, it does seem like Ninja went the ""Value Engineering"" route here...which I really, really, dislike.  I liked the good ole days before ""Value Engineering"" existed.  Since this is so common with products now, I always put the most weight on quality...which is why my rating on this product seems so low.  It seems to be engineered ok.  The downfall is going so cheap on the materials.  To me, anything that comes in contact with the ""hot"" coffee should not be made of plastic.  Although the picture has a nice looking ""stainless steel"" trim on the exterior, all the internals are just made from your run of the mill plastic materials.  With hot liquids, I would think it is probably leaching harmful plastics into the coffee.-Although the removable parts are dishwasher safe, I would not suggest cleaning them in the dishwasher.  After running them in the dishwasher for several months, I have noticed that the auto stop feature that allows you to pull the carafe out before it is done brewing to grab that first cup...well it kind of started leaking.  So now I have to wait for the entire cycle to finish.-If it doesn't end up surviving at least 5 years, I would say it's a bit pricey."
"This makes the best coffee I have ever brewed. It's the best brewer of coffee I have owned. Buuut... The carafe leaves a lot to be desired. Instead of a little pointed spout that can direct the coffee into the mug (cup), it has a wide square spout that drips (pours) coffee all over the counter. Even if you pour really really slowly into the mug (cup) when you pull the pot up and back from the mug (cup) it still drips (pours). It's even worse if the pot is full. Gets coffee all over instead of where it belongs, in my stomach. I give the coffee maker 5 stars 🤩! and the carafe 1 star 😒, thus the 3 star review."
We got this coffee maker March 2023 after it being recommended. We program this thing every night and clean it routinely with products specifically for coffee makers to keep it maintained. Also we only use filtered water to avoid hard scale issues. From day one the pot readily spills everywhere if you don’t pour it just right. And it now is leaking nearly the full contents of the water tank onto the counter when we run it and end up with a lake and a few cups of concentrated coffee. If you are a casual coffee maker it’s probably good. But it did not hold up to regular use and was a messy pot to use.
"The coffee this thing makes is awesome. It tastes way better than our previous two pots. I appreciate how everything comes apart for cleaning. Our last ninja lasted nearly 10 years. We’ve had this one for almost a year. We made a pot as normal, it brewed, and before we could pour the first cup, the carafe cracked and started leaking. I am disappointed that the glass wasn’t better quality. We were not rough with it. We did not knock it against something. Love the unit, just wish it was little more robust."
"I love the looks and the design of this coffee maker, especially the detachable water tank for easy filling and well shaped, heavy glass carafe. The trouble is that I could not get rid of the plastic taste in each brew. Washed it, did the cleansing technique, and brewed 4 weeks worth of coffee through this and the plastic taste did not go away. I’m returning this good looking coffee maker for that reason. Am switching to stainless steel percolator style. Here’s hoping."
"The coffee tastes good, the programming is easy, and it’s nice to have a coffee machine that brews 14 ounces.  But there’s a serious design flaw in the coffee pot.  EVERY time you go to pour a cup of coffee the pot leaks and you end up with coffee all over your counter."
"I like this coffee maker quite a bit. Except for one thing. It makes good coffee and it keeps it hot. BUT that one thing is this: it has a ""mid-brew pause"" function which works very badly. I NEED a coffee maker that allows you to take the pot out and pour some (strong) coffee before the whole pot has brewed. This is supposed to do that. One would expect that it would do that without dripping all over the hot plate (and evaporating instantly because of the heat and leaving residue on the hot plate. One wouldn't expect it to drip even a little. This doesn't do that without dripping, sometimes a lot, sometimes a little less.The issue is the plastic cone inside the body of the coffee maker (the cone inside of which you put either the permanent filter or a paper filter). That cone has a spring-loaded ""button"" at the bottom of it which releases the coffee into the carafe when the pot is in place -- and it stops (or is SUPPOSED to stop) the coffee when you pull the pot out. The spring on that cone obviously doesn't have the correct tension, so it causes leakage. I called Ninja/Shark about this. The call took a long time, and they wanted me to allow them to watch and listen to a live video on my cell phone while I made some coffee, etc., so they could ""troubleshoot."" That was going to take even longer. And not only did the person I talked with not believe that the cone spring is bad (they could have just sent me a new one very easily; end of story). But she actually suggested that a little dripping was to expected. Are you kidding me? I've had at least three Cuisinart coffeemakers and they never dripped when you took the pot out mid-brew. (I probably should have stuck with Cuisinart). I did not have time to go through what the customer service person wanted.So I returned the unit. I'm ordering a new one to see if that one is better/the way it's supposed to be. If it isn't, I'll assume that the Ninja has a manufacturing defect, and I'll turn to another brand (maybe Cuisinart again).Update: the second Ninja unit I ordered also dripped, so I returned that one too. (And I went back to using my old Cuisinart, which is still quite serviceable.)"
I don't think the brewing temperature is hot enough and the warming plate definitely is not hot enough I will probably be returning this coffee maker another One bites the dust now what am I going to try
"I have really liked this coffee maker, it just has one big flaw.  The removable water reservoir is great, it brews a great cup of coffee, easy to program and use but the carafe does not pour well.  It gets all over the counter and side of cup if you are not really careful.  And even then, it still happens.  Would love this even more with a redesigned carafe!"
"Because the spout is a terrible design and when you pour the coffee out 2 cups will end up on the counter.  We used this for a year, cleaning up the spills.  My new Mr. Coffee just arrived, 14 cups and it didn't spill one drop."
"Used daily for 1 month and got the ER11 code. Called ninja and they said the whole base unit must be replaced. I gave them the model number with CP at the end because I specifically ordered the copper unit and wanted the replacement to be the same to match my house. The replacement came today and it's silver. I know the Ninja rep heard the CP because she repeated it as she was ordering the replacement. If they couldn't give me a copper replacement I would have rather had my money back. Overall I like the coffee pot. It brewed fast and flavor was great.  I gave it three stars ONLY because of the customer service, even though it's the wrong color. Otherwise to pay so much for a coffee pot and it last a month is unacceptable and Ninja should do better. Buyer beware."
"Well, it brewed coffee great until it didn't. I only had this coffee pot for about 3 months and the filter fell apart. Unfortunately, no dealer has replacement parts for a 14-cup model other than going directly to Ninja's website which costs 17.99 plus shipping. I'd advise you not to buy this product until you can get replacement filters for it, or just buy one of the 12-cup models, or maybe just go with any other brand whose permanent filters don't fall apart after 3 months."
"This blends with our decor, it's nice looking, a bit slow on the brew, but I don't care since I'm still sleeping while its brewing. The biggest annoyance is that unless you are very precise on your aim, speed of pouring, and how you stop pouring, it can over-shoot the mug AND it dribbles on the counter. I'm not opposed to wipping up an occasional dribble once in awhile, buy not everytime I refill my mug. This would have probably gone to the Goodwill if I hadn't had a Cusinart carafe that was easily modifiable to end the dreaded dribble.So over all it's okay, but I'm not going to run around recommending it to my friends. I also expected a bit more from Ninja."
"Love all my Ninja's & loved this coffee maker, until the water reservoir started leaking, would wake up to 3/4 pot of coffee & a flooded counter top. I know Ninja is a good company, so I searched for a new replacement reservoir yeah! Saved from throwing a coffee pot away....BUT NO, new Ninja brand water tank is doing the exact same thing in less than a month of getting it! Buyers beware!"
"Love the removable water reservoir, the machines brews good, strong coffee albeit slow to brew. The downside is that you cannot pour the coffee without the spout spilling with each pour. Also, the reservoir leaks water (not a ton but enough that it takes a couple paper towels to dry it up)."
"I really like a lot of features about this coffee maker. I had a Bunn coffee maker previous to this one. The Bumm coffee maker started taking a long time to brew, and would leak coffee everytime you poured into a coffee cup. Something had to give!I got this coffee maker based on the NY Times review of being a good coffee maker on a budget price. However, after almost a month of using it I found these issues:* carafe leaks coffee if pot is 10-14 cups full of coffee. This is probably an understatement. At first it didn't leak at all, but then started leaking after about 2 weeks. I think this is a design flaw. There is a twist on top, and I think it must lose some tightness and the coffee leaks out from this part, and not just the spout.* coffee doesn't taste as good as our old coffee maker. I think it did make some fine coffee, but now it doesn't seem to taste as good. Not sure if this is really tangible, but the wife also says it's not as good as our previous coffee maker.What i love about this coffee maker is:* hot plate automatically turns off around 2 hours. No more burnt coffee to clean up in the morning.* just press a button and it does its thing* no leaking coffee when I take the carafe out* 14 cup carafe! I don't have to make coffee twice in one day* makes coffee in 13 mins, even faster than our previous Bunn CSB2B coffee maker* pull out coffee holder that doesn't leak. Can just dump into garbage, and put backI really wanted to love this coffee maker, but I don't think it's the right one for us. I'm kind of disturbed hearing about customer support issues with ninja. Anyways, I'll probably be sending this one back."
"Love the way it looks, very nice asthetic design. Like that the water tank can be removed to fill. Like the choices of control.Unfortunately, this coffee maker has many of the flaws of other popular coffee makers. It is almost like the designers have never really made coffee on a daily basis.The two major flaws of this are; The depth of the coffee basket or well, is about 1/2 inch too shallow to make 14 cups, let alone the 11 cups I make every day. You just can not put enough coffee in it to make a good full body cup of coffee and get the full use of the advertised amount you can make. The second flaw is that the water shower diameter is too small to drench the much larger diameter of the basket, thereby wasting the out edges of the coffee entirely, especially when the basket is full. (like when you are making 11 cups of coffee) The upside to this is if you are only making 4-6 cups of coffee, this is a fine machine. A minor flaw is water hides in the lid hinge, so you have to be patient drying it out, if for instance you make your coffee ahead of time and dont want it getting wet before you brew it. Overall I give this a C+ and would not buy again. Sorry Ninja, but maybe get some help from real people that make coffee every day during design. A couple of adjustments and you guys could be the coffee maker kings!"
"I finally broke down and purchased a new coffee pot, and based on the reviews and my experience with other Ninja products, I decided to splurge on this one.  I am SOOOOOOOOO disappointed with it.  For the first time in my 50+ years making coffee - I had actual MOLD grow on the top of the coffee within 36 hours!  I couldn't believe it - I've NEVER had that.In addition, the amount of sludge that is in the bottom of the pot is crazy!  I've tried adding a paper filter thinking our grounds were too fine (they are normal coffee grounds out of the container - we don't grind it) - it didn't help.  It makes the last few cups of coffee undrinkable - down the sink it goes.My husband is diabetic and drinking coffee is one of the quickest way to bring up his sugar when it drops - so we always have a pot made.  It's not abnormal for a pot of coffee to last a day and a half - and we've been doing this for YEARS.  I always remove the grinds after making the coffee and even elevate the lid so it 'airs' out and doesn't hold the moisture.  The mold grew on top of the coffee somewhere between 24-36 hours - I still can't believe it.I've tried making 12 cups vs. 14, then 10, then 8 - doesn't matter.  The sludge is always so much that the last few cups are not drinkable.  We've only had the mold twice - which is 2 times too many - I have no idea why.  I clean everything in-between pots.Unfortunately I went in for a hip replacement and the return window has closed - so I'm stuck with it.  I've had several coffee makers over the last 50+ years and I have NEVER had either of these issues.  I'm SO disappointed and frustrated that I wasted over $100 and now have to buy a new pot and throw this away.  I don't even feel comfortable donating it because whoever would have the same issue - it makes the unit unusable.I would NOT recommend this pot to anyone.  I thought having the water in a separate container and being able to make 14 cups would be really nice - however the sludge in the bottom of the pot, and the mold negates anything that I might like about it.  Don't buy this!"
"This model is quite a dud compared with all the other Ninja kitchen appliances and even other Ninja coffee makers over the years.  I never could figure out why it's so expensive compared to the lack of features. It's going to brew all the water that you put into the tank (much like all plain jane standard coffee makers).  The water tank is designed by engineers that never put a thought into how people would clean it, very deep and narrow layout, get a good bottle cleaning brush. My biggest hatred of this coffee maker is the randomness of the water tank leaking. Sometimes it's very very slow and just a few drops at the back of the coffee maker on the counter. Sometimes it will be a slow drizzle, and if you set it up at night to auto brew in the morning, you'll wake up to 14 cups of clean water all over the counter, in a drawer or two, down on the floor.  I've  cleaned the mating surfaces, checked all over with a bright light and still can't figure out why it leaks. Sometimes it leaks from the side edges of the tank, sometimes it will overflow and leak from the center where the spout it. Sometimes it's fine. The carafe is guaranteed to dribble and leak when pouring the first 2-3 cups out.  It's also the slowest 14 cup coffee maker I've ever had, brand new it was slow, after a proper descaling cleaning procedure it's over 25 minutes for a full pot, and that's not on the even slower, Rich brew option.  I'm so mad that the product box was recycled too soon, this should have been a returned product."
This is the machine for you!Spills with every single pour.Terrible design with a decent brand attached.Mr. coffee looks better every day.
"Hello, I have receive my coffee pot it was delivered on May 16th i opened it up everything looked packaged well the only concern I have is that when I pull the coffee cup away from the coffee maker while making coffee it’s supposed to stop mean while mine doesn’t and it made a mess when I first tried it. Also I tried the 14 cup setting and it says it’s supposed to hold all 14 cups in the coffee pot but when I had tried this the coffee started to overflow and made an even bigger mess everywhere. Though this coffee pot is very durable kinda tricky at first to figure it out but your in luck it comes with instructions and made everything more easy to understand."
"If I could return this product, I would.  This is a nice looking coffee pot that has a good reservoir size and reliable auto brew. We got the 14 cup size since there are 4 adults in the household drinking coffee throughout the day. It takes a little while to finish brewing the entire pot, but the coffee tastes fine. My biggest complaint about this coffee pot is that it spills coffee from the lip of the carafe every single time we pour a cup of coffee. It doesn’t matter if we have brewed all 14 cups of coffee or 5, or if we pour fast or slow…it dribbles coffee everywhere. We’ve even tried taking off the lid to the coffee pot to see if that fixes the problem, to no avail. Really disappointed in having to wipe up coffee from the counter after every pour because of a design flaw in the carafe."
I agree with the other reviews about the quality of coffee this machine makes. It’s top notch! However the design of the carafe is just awful. There is a dribble that pours everywhere but the cup. I’ve tried to contact Ninja to see if maybe we have a defective carafe but it’s impossible to get through. I sent an email with no reply so I’m not impressed by their support. The dribble was bad enough I’ve had to replace the coffee maker. If they replace the spout with a design that actually pours I would definitely recommend this.
"So as a whole this a great coffee maker. Makes ok coffee, zero complaints in that aspect. My complaint is that the carafe definitely leaked. Despite all attempts to find the sweet spot angle to pour from, after having this coffee maker for almost two years I still can’t find it. Just know that when you pour a cup of coffee you’ll be doing so over the sink, so keep it close."
"My coffee maker was taking 1/2 hour to make six cups, even after a recent cleaning; so I decided to look for something better. The copper color drew me in, but it was the reviews that convinced me. I took the plunge and every day I am very happy that I did. I have finally found a maker that makes a cup of coffee hot enough to suit me; and it stays hot enough to enjoy whole cup! The robust but smooth flavor is unmatched and it does it all super-fast! For the person that complained that the pot drips, you must have the top on wrong! This is the only coffee pot I have ever owned that doesn't drip, at all, but pours straight into the cup. I set my pot to keep hot for 4 hours. It keeps it just-brewed hot with just-brewed flavor the entire 4 hours. No murky coffee or burned taste; the last sip is just as delicious as the first! Fantastic design. Fantastic coffee. Fantastic coffee pot!I don't ever want to own a different one. Go ahead and buy one. You will be so happy you did!UPDATE:I am sad that after a year and half my coffee pot has begun profusely leaking! I resolved the dribbling coffee by discovering if I held the pot high and poured straight down, it would pour clean into the cup. However, now, ever since I started setting up my coffee the night before, to brew by timer, it has been leaking. I stopped putting water in it the night before but it still leaks a lot, some days all over the floor! I love my coffee pot and wish this wasn't so. It's the only pot I have ever had that keeps coffee super hot for hours without scorching or changing the taste. I paid $85 for it after tax and don't feel I got that value out of it. If you choose to take a chance and buy, I wouldn't go without buying the 3 year warranty. There have been too many unhappy customers with the same issue.Ninja fix this problem please, because otherwise you have a great coffee pot!"
"The machine is going to make a full pot if you fill the reservoir, even if you push the 1-4 cup.the coffee it brews is good but you must remember to only put 4 cups of water it that is all the coffee you want."
"I like everything about this coffee maker (large capacity, removable tank, 3-hr warming period, good brewing), but it's going in the garbage because it drips from below the spout every time you pour (doesn't matter what speed or angle you pour at). For something used multiple times a day, it's a dealbreaker and not worth the frustration.I tried filing down the plastic like another reviewer suggested but that didn't help. The problem only started after about 1 year. I'm not going to spend money on a replacement carafe because it's an obvious design flaw or manufacturing defect that the company hasn't addressed."
"Coffee makers of a size for large families are hard to come by, so I was excited to find this item.  However, as soon as we made our first pot, a few design flaws became apparent.  I will say that I loved the removeable tank for the water - that was genius - no more trying to pour water from a carafe into a little tank while un-caffeinated in the morning.  However, that leads to the first issue.There is a ""catcher"" where the tank is seated into the coffeemaker that fills completely and then overflows with every single pot.  I've done some research online and this is a common issue that folks have.  I am considering returning it for this major design flaw because the reason I got rid of my last coffeemaker is that it developed a leak and my counter was constantly wet.  (see picture)Second, there is literally zero way to silence the beep when the coffee is done.  My partner gets up at 4am to go to work.  I do not.  But I get up at 4:10 every morning now because the coffeemaker wakens me to the irritating sound of ""hey I'm done with your coffee"".  I do not need to know this and neither does my partner.  We are both assuming that the coffee will be done after some period of time after we start the confounded machine.  We do not need an alert to let us know.  After an exhaustive search online, I found one dude who literally performed surgery on his coffeemaker to remove the buzzer from the inside of the coffeemaker.  Well, if I do that, I cannot return it.Ninja, I hope you're listening to the pleas of your customers.  It took one google search to find hundreds of reddits, reviews, etc on BestBuy, Amazon, etc. to fix this buzzer issue.  It's as simple as a button push on most makers."
"I like the look of this I like the style with the cone shape filter it makes good coffee, but the carafe leaks terribly when you pour it. I bought two of these one for Camp and they both drip out the same."
"Overall this is a great coffee maker. However there is one major flaw.  You can NOT POUR A CUP OFF COFFEE WITH OUT SPILLING IT ALL OVER.  If the pot is full, and you try to put a cup, it's going to go all over.  I have tried to outsmart the pot, but to date, I have failed."
"Quick summary: The product failed after 5 weeks. If you claim a warranty from Ninja, you will be charged a fee by Ninja. I will never purchase an item from this company. Thankfully Amazon's great customer support has allowed the return of the item without the original box.After 5 weeks of brewing coffee, the feature for 1-4 Cups doesn't work. I'm passed the Amazon return window so I went on the company website to claim my warranty.I first had to register the item. When registering the model DCM201CP, their website indicated it was not a valid product. Amazon has the model listed as DCM201CP and the back of the coffee maker has the model listed as DCM201CP. Well, I had to go through Ninja's product website to find my product, they have the model listed as DCM201 on their website. After inputting the model# found on their website, I was able to register the product.I had to dig around to find out how and where to make the warranty claim. You cannot do this online. Their warranty guide is misleading with a link that takes you to a troubleshooting guide. Which is not what I want because I know my item is faulty, resource: I'm an engineer. You will have to call their support line to make the claim. I already had my doubts with this company so before I called I read through their warranty claim.From the website Ninja Warranty Information: ""SharkNinja will cover the cost for the customer to send in the unit to us for repair or replacement. A fee will be charged when SharkNinja ships the repaired or replacement unit.""Are you kidding me? The consumer will be charged a fee to ship a warranty claim back to the customer.Well, this is when I knew I would never purchase from this company again. Poor business ethic, poor quality and accountability, and poor customer support.I called Amazon and told them when I purchased the item, how long I had it, and that I didn't have the original manufacturer box. Without any fee or obstacles, they will accept the return and provide a full refund. Definitely not buying a Ninja ever again."
I bought this as a replacement for our k-cup maker. The reusable filler is nice and works well. The temperature is good when you first make it but the warmer does not last very long. It will start a cool down in about 30 mins. It is loud during the drip process. Theprice was ok.
"This coffee maker is for a family of 3 or more that drink coffee. Its huge! 14cups is a lot! So if youre only 1 person drinking coffee, wouldn't recommend this as it takes 4 cups of water either way to make 1 batch (waste of water). Its also a lot to clean. The glass jug part, the top of it, the filter part. Granted you can just rinse with water and wash a later time. But it's a lot if you don't have the time. I find it easier to make a keurig coffee. I have the Solby brand from Amazon and it makes 1 cup easily and less mess than the Ninja. It also comes with your own filter to brew your own coffee grounds instead of using the K-cups.I did like certain features on the Ninja such as the timer to set what time you want it to brew so its made before you even wake up. But my Solby takes less than 3 minutes to make 1 cup so it's not a huge pro for me. The ninja comes with a scooper for the coffee grounds which is very helpful actually. It sits right on top of the water resoviour. It also keeps your coffee warm for about 4 hours. After that it automatically shuts off. Great smart feature."
"The main reason I purchased this coffee maker was for the much touted ""brew selector"" function.  Which is absolutely useless as it doesn't actually exist. As per the small sheet of paper stuffed down in the bottom of the packaging, the coffee maker will always brew coffee according to the amount of water in the reservoir. It does not matter if you select 1 - 4 cups. If there is 8 cups of water in the reservoir, it will brew all 8 cups. It will always just run any and all water in the reservoir through. It is not a true brewing function or a useful reservoir.  Would absolutely not recommend. Just spend the $30 on a cheap B&D coffee maker from the housewares aisle at your local grocery store."
"I was very excited to begin using the Ninja XL-14 coffee maker.  I was able to enjoy it for 3 days and it gave me an ER 11 code and I could never get it to work.  I wanted to exchange it but returning was the only option.  I planned to reorder it in hopes that the next one will work great, but the price is higher now. We really hate that it didn't work right.  Hopefully, it will go on sale soon."
"AMAZON - DO NOT DELETE THIS REVIEW. I WANT A RESPONSE TO THE FOLLOWING CONCERN;I ordered a unit that was labeled ""USED"" for $20 less, and I thought how used can it be? It was probably one that someone returned after one use. So I ordered one as a test, just to see what a used unit would be like. It came in an amazon box, wrapped in plastic and surrounded by styrofoam, but no manufacturers box. It looked brand new, perfectly clean with no scratches. The one thing that caught my attention was a sticker on the owner’s guide that stated, ""Renewed Unit Warranty May be Different"". How different it didn’t say, but what I didn’t like was that there was no indication of this “may be different” warranty before I ordered it, which I thought was rather deceptive."
The coffee isn’t hot enough. I have it on the hottest setting and after I add milk or cream the coffees not hot anymore. I don’t even use that much milk or cream. Also it’s annoying that I can’t select the number of cups I want it to make so it would know how much water to use. You need to only fill it with enough water that you want to use because it will use all of the water in the reservoir.
"Loved the Ninja 12 cup coffee maker so we upgraded to the 14 oz. Since day one the carafe has leaked -every time, without fail- when pouring the coffee into your mug. We have to pour it over the sink or clean up the spilled coffee on the counter every time.Dealt with it daily until finally I just decided to purchase another 12 cup one this morning.Would be a great machine if it weren’t for this fatal flaw."
I was so excited about this coffee machine. I did my research and I discovered this model and adored the color. I am was disappointed to discover that the heating pad/element is already chipping. I have only been using this for a few weeks. I am diligent about cleaning this machine and being gentle with the heating pad. I had my last coffee machine for 5 years and this was something that happened as well over time. But to only have this for 2 weeks and it is already chipping is a let down. I will be returning this and trying something else.
"This coffee pot is easy to clean, brews a decent cup of coffee, and looks nice for such a high capacity, but the spout from the pot needs to be redesigned. I would gladly purchase a new pot, in order for it to not spill all over the counter when I pour my coffee."
There is no indication that the Silver band at the bottom of the coffee machine is hot. I burnt myself.  They should state in instructions as well as with a sticker
"Got this coffee maker because of the removable water tank. Which thankfully does work great! However there have been some problems. This coffee maker requires more grounds thank my old coffee maker to get the same flavor. Using the same amount of grounds resulted in watery coffee. Also I have had it for4 weeks and the pot itself is already staining. I wash it regularly and yes the glass is already turning brown. Again something that never happened to my Cuisinart after using it for 3 years. Finally, the plastic valve the is supposed to stop the coffee from running out of the filter when you remove the coffee pot, does not work. If you try to remove the coffee pot while the machine is brewing it will just start pouring coffee all over the hot plate. Over all very disappointed. I was excited to switch things up, but I should have stuck with the $80 Cuisinart."
"I ordered this product April 2023, and had to throw it out already.  The water reservoir continues to leak.  I will fill it and it will brew, but leaks water from the reservoir and all over my counter."
"We’ve had this coffee pot less than a year (maybe six months?). We should’ve returned it, but at this point, we didn’t return it, and we are tired of putting up with it and having to buy some thing else. We like the fact that it is copper and attractive, as well as the fact that the water reservoir comes off to fill. However, the thing takes forever to make coffee and it does not make the water hot enough. It gurgles like it’s struggling to get the water from the beginning of the brewing cycle, despite how many times we have cleaned it and run vinegar through it and we only use filtered water. On the strong setting, it takes a full 45 minutes to finish brewing - probably a half an hour on the classic setting. If you try to get a cup partway through the cycle, the drip stop does not work and it drips, and the coffee is not hot. It has to sit on the heating pad for a while to be very hot. We are so bummed out and disappointed in this coffee maker because it has the features we thought we wanted, but it is a dud."
"We had a Ninja coffee pot for years that we absolutely loved, so when it died and we couldn’t find the same model to replace it, we opted for another Ninja. The main unit of this coffee pot arrived with a scratched up hot plate so we returned it. The replacement arrived in perfect condition. It only took a few uses for the carafe to scratch up the hot plate. The new unit now looks worse than the model we returned.Also, we’re experienced coffee pourers in our household and the lip design on this pot is terrible. We thought we’d adapt quickly from the fast, no-spill-pour of our old pot, but several month into using this new one and we’re still spilling it all over. It’s become a game between me and my husband when we get our morning coffee: who can pour without making a mess. It’s a 14-cup capacity that you have to basically pour out one drop at a time.If you’re hoping to get a cup mid-brew there’s no drip-stop, so be aware of that when buying. I didn’t think to read for it in the description and assumed a newer model would have that feature.Not all Ninjas are built alike. We will continue our search for the old model Ninja. In the mean while, this one will get the job done."
"I really like this coffee pot for the most part. I love that it's 14 cups, that it's easy to clean. The removable water reservoir is a game changer! What I don't love is that the spout seems to be too short. It doesn't matter if we pour it quickly or pour it slowly it dribbles and excessive amount. It seems to happen most when we have made 14 cups and are doing an initial pour. But even when we've made a small pot of 8 to 10 cups the initial pour still dribbles."
"Pros:* design- the removable water tank is amazing* wire/reusable filter- less waste* warming feature* 1-4 cup featureCons:* durability- I've gone through 2 in 6 monthsThe first one I bought quit working after 1 use. Amazon was super great about replacing it for me with no issue. The second one I have had for just a few short months and has also quit working. It has been cleaned regularly and used properly. It got to a point where it was taking 1/2 hour to brew a half pot of coffee, then I got the dreaded 5 beeps which means something is wrong. I have gone through all the trouble shooting items with no luck. Last option is to work with customer service, which I'm debating on. There are a lot of pros to the design, just super disappointed in the overall quality. I thought the first was just a fluke but for it to happen twice in a row seems less likely to be a fluke."
"The coffee brewer was easy to use, and looks nice. My husband likes to bring me my coffee in the morning, but kept complaining that the pot spills while pouring the first 2 or 3 cups and when using the pot to refill the reservoir.I told him he needed to pour slower. He still complained. I went to show him the ""right"" way to pour. And wow. he was right. No matter how slowly and carefully you pour, there is something wrong with it, not a big enough lip? or something with the top?We can't figure this out so we are returning it. It's ashame, we like everything else about it."
"Delivered oct 5, today is Nov 28 and it quit working this morning- so much for Ninja- worked great until then- back to BUNN for me I guess"
"Love everything about this coffee pot except that the coffee pot has a design flaw.  When pouring your first couple of cups of coffee it spills on the counter...every time. They need to redesign the lip of the glass. Second, I would love it if you could fill the water container to full, and choose the amount of coffee you want to make.  Currently you have to fill it with the exact amount of water for the amount of cups you will be drinking.  Our old ninja gave you this option.  I think they should recall the carafe"
"This is closer to rose gold than copper or stainless with a copper hew.The pot itself is absolutely terrible! You can NOT pour coffee without it running down the pot and onto the counter.It does make a good cup of coffee, easy to program and it does have the removable water container which is a great feature and very convenient."
"Just bought a house, finally living without roommates, and I needed a coffee maker. I am used to using a Bunn, have had multiple ones over the years, but my co-workers gave high praise to Ninja devices. I liked the idea of trying something new, and the major selling point was that it has a permanent filter, which sounded great.I feel like the design of this ""permanent filter"" is bad. It is designed to hold coffee grounds, which is good, but that is the only thing it is designed to do. They didn't incorporate anything you would need to do with it into the design. Like, how do they want us to empty it? It is not the easiest to handle when emptying. They could have designed some texture onto the sides to give it some grip when clumping it out. Wet coffee grounds don't just fall out of it, though, you need to hit it against something, or hit something against it to get the grounds to come out. I use a wooden spoon. I think that this filter would benefit from having something at the sides that you could hold it and hit it against things. Also, you still need to use a paper filter if you don't want grounds in your coffee.This is also very slow. I returned mine."
"Not much of a coffee snob, usually just do Folgers in our house.  Really surprised that the taste of the coffee is so much effected by the coffee maker though.  When our Cuisinart went bad I bought this because we wanted a 14 cup but small in design - and the footprint and design of this one looked really nice and compact, which it is.  But the coffee it makes just wasn't tasting very good.  It was pretty bitter compared to the old one.  Thought maybe it was in my head but after a month we decided to just get another one like our old Cuisinart that died...and the coffee it produces is wonderful...so this item just doesn't make a good cup of coffee.  Sorry Ninja.  Not sure why, as it operates fine, but the coffee just isn't good."
"Brews a great cup of coffee consistently. A nice upgrade for us. But not without a big issue.After a couple of weeks, the carafe started dripping all over the counter while pouring. After the first couple of pours, it works great. But when you’re so ready to have that first cup of coffee in the morning, having to clean up the counter ruins the experience.I may try some sort of non-toxic sealer around the plastic rim of the pot, or I might just throw it out … very disappointing that a flaw like this in the carafe, which from a cost-basis is relatively low, would be allowed to ruin my morning coffee experience."
"Every compartment is nearly sealed, trapping moisture and requiring everything be opened/removed to prevent bacterial issues."
"The machine works great and has great features, but the carafe spills too easily and needs to be updated to include a curved top to allow for easier pouring (like the other carafe shown in this picture). It sounds like a user error, but I spilled this think like 30+ times before finally giving up and buying a new machine that pours without spilling and to change up to a different design. This product would deserve 5 stars if the carafe was improved."
"I’ve been using a Mr coffee espresso and same brand ice coffee deal. Made coffee with exact grinds I’ve been using, but felt 80 percent more energized, the taste didn’t even require cream … I’m not playing. My life has been elevated. Don’t doubt just do. I’ll update if I feel differently later….. 10/31/23So, dropped rating to three stars. 7/23/2024 Probably just me but doesn’t seem to make as good of pot anymore. I don’t know if it maybe doesn’t get as hot? Haven’t checked. But, when I rinse carafe out it stays moist unless I air dry it on counter and I hate that. Also if I’m not careful pouring it goes all over floor. I’d rather buy a fancy espresso maker next time. Or just different model."
I like the look but I do not like the coffee. The tank does not store water you must refill it every time. There is no pause feature. I've tried many different types of coffee in this maker does not make the best coffee.
"Purchased this coffee maker (Ninja DCM201) in February 2024.  It's now December 2, 2024 and it's now a piece of junk.A month ago I would have give this coffee maker good (not great) marks. It did everything it was supposed to do quite adequately.  However, a month ago the buttons on the control panel began to fail.  The Brew button went first.  I pushed it, and it stuck, and the coffee didn't brew.  Fortunately, I discovered that turning on the hot plate caused it to start.  But then, one by one the other buttons failed in the same way.  The only button that still works is the hot plate.  Product warranty is not specified in the literature.  Apparently there isn't one.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone and certainly won't buy again."
"I thought this would be a great coffee pot because of the brand.  It was 14 cups which was great.  But I expected this pot to last longer than 10 months.  We did periodically clean it. So, I would suggest not purchasing this pot if you expect it to last a year or more."
"It makes good coffee but, it takes a very long time to make it. I will have my cup of coffee already made and then the coffee maker will go off and sound that the coffee is ready. I'm not too happy with this coffee maker. I really don't like it"
"Ninja products are supposed to be good products.  This is not.  The base stopped working after 2 months.  Its too late to return to Amazon, so I called Ninja and they want to charge me tax and shipping for them to ship a new base.  Don't waste your time."
"This is a 12 cup machine, not a 14. We counted only 6 cups however. So I don’t know where they get 14 cup coffee maker at, maybe they’re using the size cups my kid plays with her in her little Susie homemaker doll set. It’s definitely not 14 cup capacity. It’s visibly a small carafe. We looked back at the older reviews and they’re all saying it’s a 12 cup machine. Also the coffee lacks robust flavor. I had returned a Ninja for this reason in the past so I’m guessing all Ninjas can’t make rich flavorful coffee. I am also getting a metal flavor and I’m drinking Starbucks French roast which I freshly grind for each pot. I’m careful not to grind it into powder since fine powder gives more of a bitter brew.I like how you can turn on the warmer after it shuts off after 4 hours. I’ve not been able to do that on any other coffee maker. The external reservoir of water is also attractive because you don’t have to spill water Into a hole.I’m unsure if I’m going to return it."
"The only issue I seem t6o have is that the spout is too flat and without using care, coffee will spill onto the counter."
"What l love is the style, and that you can remove the water reservoir, and it’s ease of use, and shower of hot water that comes out for even brewing.  Dislikes: spills every time I pour my first cup of coffee. If anyone can recommend another carafe that works with this coffee maker please let me know. Other dislikes include: no pause brew button, no water filter, no complete auto shutoff, no complete shutoff or off switch to shutdown even the clock without unpluging completely, and way to wide opening on carafe that makes pouring coffee a major mess and pain."
"Literally the WORST carafe ever. It runs down the side and off the back as you pour, not only making a giant mess anywhere you pour but it also burns your feet/legs if they're under the pour zone. I was planning to return this to Amazon because Ninja's replacement carafe is 'out of stock' under warranty but we enjoy having a removable water reservoir and 14 cup coffee maker. Ninja is the only brand who meets both of these things so I decided to try a replacement carafe by a different brand. ""Cuisinart 14-Cup Replacement Carafe for Coffee Maker, DCC-2200RC"" works with this coffee maker. This Cuisinart replacement carafe is WAY overpriced IMO at THIRTY-FIVE dollars (!!) but we got this coffee maker on sale and between the sale price and the price of the replacement carafe we are still just under the regular price of this Ninja coffee maker (Ninety-nine dollars as of 2/1/24). I'm going to email Ninja and see if they will reimburse for the carafe seeing as they don't have anything to replace their faulty/dangerous product with - so we'll see. Anyway... the coffee maker itself works as it should, carafe is a POS."
"Made coffee as usual (this is my 4th day of use) but I can see lines going across horizontally.  Definitely not there before, as I would have noticed.  I think this is cracking.  I reached out to Ninja/Shark and will see if they can offer replacement.  I will update this review then.Otherwise, it was working fine and I enjoyed the coffee.  But now..Update Dec 13:  So the vender link here in Amazon does nothing, I had to go to the Shark website.  Filled out a form online on December 5th.  Three days later someone sends me an email asking for more information (Phone number, Shipping address, Photo of the sticker with the model and serial number, Date of purchase, Proof of purchase, Date code).  I provided this information the next day, by the way.  So again, another FOUR days I get another email, which is today.  They are asking me now to call the Ninja customer service number.  I call and connect with an agent (after waiting several minutes on hold).  Guess what?  They are asking me to provide ALL THE INFORMATION AGAIN BUT OVER THE PHONE.  I provided her the account number for reference but she said ""that's a different department"".  Great, so I lost 7 days where I could have gotten a replacement through Amazon instead.  Anyways, the lady on the phone took my wrath (I know, big time warrior I am).  I gave her the information, and I should expect to see the replacement carafe soon.I DO NOT Recommend this product.  And if you buy it, and something is wrong, just go through Amazon."
I really like the coffee maker. It brews a much better tasting cup of coffee than my old traditional drip coffee maker.I hate the coffee pot. It would be nice to pour a cup without dribbling coffee all over my counter. I pour my coffee over the sink because this damned pot is awful.I bought the Ninja because some of my relatives have them and I really liked theirs. I guess I should have stayed with one of the models they had.
I’m a coffee snob and found that my last Cuisinart coffee maker made a better cup of coffee. I do like the water reservoir in the back as it makes it easier to fill but otherwise just “meh”
"nice compact size, and makes good coffee but its a slow brewer whether you choose classic or rich, seem to be the same."
Was great for the first month but now I keep getting grounds in my coffee carafe.  I have changed nothing about the way I brew it- same amount of grounds and water.  I don’t like this and I see no chat option to resolve the issue.  Obviously I didn’t keep the box a whole month later to send it back.
I’m a huge fan of Ninja products but this coffee maker leaks a lot .  The water reservoir leaks out the bottom all over your counter and the carafe leaks when you pour coffee into your cup.  Bought less than a year ago so I called Ninja customer support for the limited warranty.  Neither component was covered under warranty and they wanted $75 to replace the reservoir and the carafe.  75% of a new replacement.  My next coffee pot will not be a Ninja unfortunately and I don’t recommend anyone else purchase this unit either.
The #1 feature when looking for a new coffee pot is to purchase one that won’t drip or leak coffee all over the counter when filling my mug. I spent hours reading reviews and ratings and thought I found what I was looking for … another disappointment. Wouldn’t purchase again unless the carafe is redesigned. Should have returned it. We tried wiping the rim on the lid and plastic piece on the carafe and didn’t correct issue. Even tried drilling the air hole in the plastic lid slightly larger but no difference. This problem occurs 50% of the time.
"I have owned this coffee pot for almost exactly one year. It has been a major disappointment. The carafe dribbles all over the place no matter how slow or fast you pour it. And as of a few days ago, it now leaks water all over my counter when it is brewing. It’s coming from the bottoms somewhere."
"I like this coffee maker…. But about a month in it stopped working mid brew and gave error 11. The Amazon return window had closed so I called ninja support. (Register your product with them online) They had me cut the electric cord and sent me a new one. I was told it was on back order and could take 5 weeks… ok.It actually arrived in about a week but I guess it’s because they sent me a different color. Unfortunate, but not a big deal… we will see how long this one lasts.If I would’ve been able to return it, I would have so I could purchase a different product. It seems that it is a common problem with this model.Edit: The replacement stopped working after the first brew. It gave the same error 11. Ninja support had me cut the cord and are sending me an “upgraded” coffee maker (Model PB051). Seems very different from my original purchase, but hopefully it’s better."
"With coffee makers, it's the little things. This brews fine and has good features, but, it spills all over when you pour. And the water tank is removable, but you can't actually grab it by the indented part. You can do better than this one."
This is our second Ninja coffee pot. Loved the first one but this pot leaks so badly with every pour. Very disappointed. The paint on the warmer has also rubbed away very easily giving it a very worn appearance. After only a few months wear it looks older than our first one we used for 3 years.
Pretty surprising how such a simple appliance can be done so poorly. Makes some of the worst coffee I have ever had. Would return in a heartbeat if I could.
"This model disappointed me. The only saving grace us that it makes covfefe quickly. It's nice to have a timer to start your brew, but leaving water in the plastic reservoir overnight causes your morning coffee to taste like it's been infused with liquid plastic. The filter it comes with is not that great, lots of sediment ends up coming through in the coffee. Store bought filters don't fit properly because of the odd shape. The pot itself has a nice pour however. I think for the price of this model you would be able to find something much better without as many downsides."
"This is our second Ninja coffee pot and we love them. Our last one was the 12 cup but this time we decided to go for the 14 cup and love it just as much minus one thing, the pot itself leaks coffee everywhere when poured no matter how you poor. That part is awful, poor over sink always!"
"Its a bit more difficult to use than it should be. The water tank is removable which makes it easier to clean, but its a whole piece you gotta detach when refilling. The whole thing is a little too tall compared to competition so you gotta move it out from under the cabinet to open the top and refill. You gotta press a differnt button for 1-4 cups vs 4+ cups. These are just some examples of weird design choices made for this product.The coffee tastes great, but same with similarly priced competitors. It's not a bad coffee maker, but for the price range is has better competition."
Every feature of this coffee maker is excellent - except for the carafe. It is practically impossible to pour a cup of coffee without spilling and making a huge mess. The lip of the carafe causes the flow of coffee to wrap around and flow down the side instead of directing the flow outward to the cup. This would be a 5 star review if the carafe matched the quality of the coffee maker.Update: I contacted Ninja and they reluctantly sent a replacement (but I had to pay shipping). The new carafe started leaking after a few uses. It seems like the plastic rim is poorly adhered to the glass body of the carafe. Serious and disappointing design flaw. Customer service wasn't much better.
"This coffee pot is slow.  Even on ""bold"" setting and with how slow it is I expected it to brew stronger coffee.  My old black and decker pot brewed stronger coffee with fewer grounds.  It works well and all,  just let me down a bit."
Having owned 2 of the other style Ninja coffee makers we are extremely disappointed in this model.  It's fine if one makes 10 cupsnor less (of the 14 capacity).  But if one brews 12-14 cups it will spill no matter how slowly one pours it. The spot is simply too narrow for the angle it begins pouring. It is a simple design change that Ninja hasn't done.  It's ironic because the only reason to purchase this model vs the base model is the additional capacity.  We've had it just less than a year now and am already considering getting a different coffee maker whereas our previous Ninjas lasted for years
"I wish I would have read the reviews better.  When pouring, the carafe leaks all over the place: the counter top, floor, people, whatever you pour it over.  Learning to pour coffee over the kitchen sink to prevent massive, and I mean massive, clean up.  Besides that, it makes good coffee.  How to solve leaking issues under Support tab on Amazon is not helpful.  Doesn't address leaking carafe.  Read the reviews.  Many complain about this.  I threw away the box it came in right away or else I would return this product.  Disappointed.  Update:  One star added back.  They provided good customer service when I called them.  They are sending me a new carafe, complimentary.  We'll see if it leaks too...it did.  No different than the first.  This product should not be on the market.  So many have had this same problem.  Leakage, all over the place when you pour yourself a cup of fresh brewed coffee.  Do a search for the work leak in the reviews.  Buyer beware."
"I purchased this product because it had overall good reviews. What I failed to do was read the reviews of the customers who gave this product one star. A lot of these customers complained about receiving an error 11 message when attempting to brew coffee,. This is the exact same message that I received after using the product for two, count them 1…..2 days. My only advantage was I had only received the product two or three days prior to using it so I was within my Amazon return window. Even before returning, I attempted to try to clean the product as recommended but could not get it to brew due to receiving the error 11 message. I purchased this after receiving a gift card from my daughter for my birthday. Now I’m on the search for another coffee pot. In the meantime, I’ll continue to use my old “Mr. coffee” coffee pot."
Love the look and functions of my 14 cup Ninja. The carafe is awful. The design for the pour spout is not right. It doesn’t matter if I have 6 cups or 14 it pours coffee all over my counter.
"We purchased this a few months ago and we are very pleased with the coffee that is brewed, however we are very disappointed with the carafe design. When pouring coffee from the full carafe it spills quite a bit. We tried everything but couldn't find a way to pour those first few cups without a mess."
"It worked great until it didn’t. We used this coffee maker once a day and cleaned it regularly. It started glitching during the brew cycle (stopping and starting, beeping that brew cycle was done then starting up again, etc). This happened during months 5, 6 & 7. Then today ( month 8) we got the error 11 and  the heat element didn’t work. This is our 2nd Ninja coffee maker. The first one broke (electrical fire) after about 2 years, but we liked the style and functionality so we replaced it with this updated one that just broke.  Our first Braun coffee maker, when we married, lasted 10 years!  I’ll not buy Ninja again."
"Overall I was pleased with the Ninja coffeemaker.  My only issue is that when I try to pour coffee, it is impossible to pour without making a mess.  I believe that is in the design of the glass carafe."
"We've had this coffee maker for almost a year. Love everything about it except the carafe drips. Pour it fast, slow, full pot, empty pot, the darn thing just drips on the counter. We like the rest of the machine and have had it long enough to deal with it, but I wouldn't buy it again for that reason."
Didn't like it and gave it away.
"Love the features of this coffee pot but super bummed that no matter what we do, it leaks BAD the first 3 - 4 cups we pour out of every pot. Makes a huge mess. Sadly returning."
We have 3 coffee drinkers in our home so the extral large size is perfect for our busy mornings. Coffee is great. It takes longer to brew than our previous Ninja (even when we don't brew as much coffee). The carafe always leaks too.
"Really disappointed. We had the previous model CE250 and loved that one. The glass carafe broke and universal replacements did not fit and it was too expensive to replace through Ninja. The CE250 was 5 years old so we purchased the new 14-cup DCM 201 in copper color. After just 2 weeks of use the coffee pot it stained brown and can't be cleaned with a scrubber sponge. Chemicals could probably remove the brown but the coffee pot in the CE250 was 5 years old and had no stains. Clearly Ninja is using cheap glass/plastic in the new pots. Additionally, the hot plate surface peeled off during cleaning with a scratch safe sponge (surface was cold, not hot). Again, this never happened with the older model in 5 years. It brews fine or similar to the old one though so 3 stars for that. (Note the Coffee maker was packaged in a branded plain brown box, not the color box found on the store shelves)"
"Purchased on Amazon and within 2-weeks the product began malfunctioning. The warmer doesn’t work and every day there is a “Er-11” error code displayed shortly after brewing and the coffee maker turns off. Every. Day.I navigated through Ninjas troubleshooting guides as directed, but the product simply doesn’t work. Amazon refuses to allow a return, even though it was purchased less than 30-days ago.Even worse, Ninja DOES NOT WARRANTY items purchased on Amazon. They have a 60-day warranty on their website but say since it was not bought directly from them (even though it shows “Ninja” on Amazon as the seller), they will not honor the warranty.Maybe the malfunctioning was a one-off issue with the specific coffee maker I received, but for a company to not stand behind their product that was purchased new, regardless of where it was purchased, is an awful business practice and awful customer service.I will never purchase another product from SharkNinja again."
It worked all good until about 6 months. Now it leaks from underneath the unit and the water reservoir also won’t hold water
"Saw some angrier reviews about this and I will admit that I’m annoyed there isn’t a replacement 14 cup carafe to purchase separately. That may change down the line but at the time of writing I do not have an option and my coffee maker is essentially useless.My recommendation is, unless the extra two cups is extremely valuable to you, go with the 12 cup maker (I assume it’s as good as this one) as there is a replacement carafe for that. This way, if you’re in the same situation I’m in, you have a cheaper solution than buying a new coffee maker 45 days after buying this one.As a final note, this is a good coffee maker. It’s this one little thing that is a pretty big downfall."
"It does a pretty good job at making coffee. No complaints there. I would like to be able to replace the coffee grounds while filling the water tank but the lid over the coffee grounds overlaps the water tank when it's open. Not a big deal, just adds extra time to making coffee. But the biggest problem I have with this coffee pot is that if the carafe is even only 3/4 full then it drips all over the place when trying to pour. If I make a full pot of coffee then I have to get a bunch of paper towels ready before I can pour the first cup."
"We love our ninja coffee makers, but the carafe on this one spills every time you try to pour. I looked at getting a new carafe and they are unavailable."
"I got this Keurig from my kids for my birthday on September 9, 2023. It has worked pretty well for just under a year. descaling light only came on once. I did the descaling process, no problems. We have 5 people in our house, so we use it several times a day. But this morning, it died. While trying to make my coffee, it made some strange sputtering noises, emitted a burnt odor and shut off. I opened the top, took the pod out, put a new one in unplugged it, plugged it back in. Nothing. No light, no power. It’s like completely dead. If I wasn’t sure the outlet worked, I would think the cord had been cut. I googled some things about it. Seems a common problem, something with the internal thermostat. Some people try to “take it apart themselves and reset it,” but that type of project is not for me. Nice thing is, I was within the one year window. And even though I had not set up an account with Keurig when I bought the coffee machine or registered the product, they are still going to send me another one free of charge. All I need to do is send them proof of purchase and a picture of the serial number. Glad I got it on Amazon and could screen shot the order information to send them via email. They also want the broken coffee maker back, but they are sending me a label, so that’s fine too. It’s an aggravation that it didn’t even last a year, but admirable that they are standing behind their product. Hopefully this one will last longer."
"I got this model as a replacement for a Keurig I had for almost a decade that stopped working. It worked well for the first two years I had it but it no longer turns on. I’ve gone through all the troubleshooting and it never turns on. The warranty only lasts for 1 year so there isn’t anything that can be done other than purchase a new machine. Disappointed that the newer models don’t seem to last as long as the older ones and if this was a fluke, why there isn’t remedy for it.I would recommend going for the cheaper models that are going for $50 if it’s only going to last a couple years or going for a different higher-end brand name."
"Update: I submitted an exchange request via email. I had to add a screenshot of the serial number and my receipt to Keurig Customer Service. They sent me a new machine as well as a return label for the old within 5 days. I got a new machine and it seems to be working perfectly.I hope this new machine lasts longer than six months.Initial review:I have had this Keurig machine for a little over six months. I take excellent care of it and only use filtered water. The other day I was cleaning and descaling per the instructions in the manual. After the process was completed, and I did all of the clear water flushes, then it promptly died. This was the FIRST descaling done, based on number of brews.None of the buttons work, the power button or holding to do a cleaning cycle. I tried multiple plug outlets, and I waited between them.Then I tried later on, and it was still dead  Now I’m going to have to contact Keurig and see if they will replace it as it’s less than one year old. Before it died, it worked and makes good coffee. However, I have an old K-Select machine that’s at at least three years old (or more) and that that one still worksI’m not sure why this brand new machine has died so quickly. Sometimes speech to text comes out off a bit."
"Failed after a year and a half of use. Purchased in May of 2023, failed in December of 2024. Used in a two-person household with an average of 3 cups of coffee made per day. Water filters were used and changed regularly and a descale was performed each time the machine requested one. While it worked, we loved it. I would expect better quality from Keurig."
"This model just does not match the Keurig K-cup duo. The features on this model, I suppose, are a big plus if you feel that they work. I have not noticed a difference between a ""strong"" cup of coffee or a regular one on this machine. For the price point, I feel there is something missing. It saves time to be sure to use a Keurig but I think if I had to re-purchase this particular machine, I just wouldn't. I'd go with another model or slow-brew my coffee. I don't have anything horrible to say about this exact model, mind you. There are no leakage issues or other problems! I simply was not impressed and I feel that if I'm spending ""mid-quality"" level money that I should have a ""mid-quality"" level machine."
"Loved the handle on the water refill unit, and that it gave a passable cup of coffee very fast and consistently. However after six months it had the descale light which is obviously based on a timer as I always used distilled water (to try and avoid that). No problem - follow the instructions to descale, and then it still was set. Went through three more full tanks, and could never get the Descale to turn off, and support claims there is no way to turn it off. Worse, as long as the light is on, you can't get another cup brewed. So make sure you're comfortable paying the price for just six months or so of use."
"All was good for 4 months, then ‘descale’ light came on.  Tried to descale (per Keurig’s instructions) did not work so tried again, to no avail.  Then again and again.  Then one morning all electronics failed, no lights at all.  Was not impressed with the plastic construction.  Was easy to fill the reservoir.  Brewed good coffee, till the failure."
"I was so excited for our new kuerig, until I opened the box. The amazing white kuerig coffee maker has a black plug wire? Ridiculous, it should have a white cord. It sticks out like a sore thumb. Oh well I will return it and find one with a white cord."
"This is our second model of this type and thankfully we bought a warranty on the last one because the rubber gasket that seals the top of the reusable Keurig brand K-Cup got distorted over the last 2 years we have had it and it caused coffee grounds to spill out of the other holes from the K-Cup into my coffee while brewing (delicious..... not).The reason we bought another is because this unit is so fast to brew coffee, we absolutely love that feature, so as with the last one we purchased, I also bought a warranty for this one too.We brew about 3 coffees a day and it lasted 2 years so a 3 year warranty is worth it for $23 (super easy to do the claim).  Doesn't seem like they fixed the issue either because the rubber gasket looks the same as the old one.Also, there may not be a issue with the rubber gasket if you use one time use K-Cups since the foil top is more flexible.  We purchased the Keurig brand reusable K-Cups but you would think they would have tested those for wear on the machine."
"I have had a Keurig for years, this is the first time I have been disappointed! The flavor is still good, I like the white color, but the coffee is just luke warm, I’m very disappointed……. I’d send it back, but I already threw the box in the trash…….."
this is a great brewer if it works i’m in my third one the past have worked great initially  but then all at once with last two it just stops working and won’t do anything this one is 6 months old so it’s under warranty but it’s been a nightmare so far dealing with Keurig for a replacement i’ve sent the amazon receipt and picture of serial number of system so let’s see how long it takes to get a replacementmight be last Keurig I buy if I don’t get a replacement in a quick turnaround
the coffee selection is limited and even great coffee tastes like crap when using the reuseable k-cup.  i'd return it but the husband likez the ease of use of this machine.i'm sticking with pour-overs - this keurig is no bueno for me...
"Enjoyed using this machine for the year I've had it. Just seized up and the pump stopped working. Thought that based on how it looks it would have been built to last longer. Easy to use, looks great, small profile."
"This coffee pot makes a great cup of coffee. The problem is that it wears out and stops working quicker than it should, especially when only making one cup a day. I bought it in March 2021, and it finally died on me."
"This is cheaply made; I ma on my 3rd Keurig and the handle is flimsy. However, . The water pitcher is great as is the setup with multiple holes for water into the pod - better for brew but you need to buy new fillable inserts if you choose not to use store k cups.. It is easy to use, the coffee brew is good and I guess easy to clean - I have not had to yet. My poor rating is because the water dispensed is incorrect. I should NOT be able to do a 12 oz and a 6 oz = total 18 oz ) in one 15 oz mug. I can and I do. ... My old Keurig had 4/6/8/10 oz/ measures. A 10 oz  and a 4 ounce almost overflowed this mug. So, because of the water measurement, I give it 2 stars.EDIT: I have been using this for a couple of weeks. I’ve gotten used to the idea that the picture is very easy to use. I find it less wobbly than I did in the beginning. On the other hand, the water measurement hasn’t even doubt and does not fill, the amount that the ounces say it will. On the other hand, the strong setting does make me change my rating up one star to three stars. I am disappointed that you cannot get a really tall mug with ice under the coffee stream. I can get a tall mug, but I cannot get a very tall one. The very tall one that I could get under my old Keurig will not fit because this one has a lip on the bottom. My last Keurig, you could remove the whole area, but this one leaves you with enough so that it is not, easy to get a very large mug with ice underneath and you have the ice feature. It’s still one star for strength."
Had for about 9 months descale lifht came followed instructions. It stopped working. Is there a warranty on this product for under a year of use?
When I choose 12 ounces only 10 ounces is in the cup. The same thing happens regardless of the size I choose
Was used maximum of 50 tomes in 2 years. Overheated and stopped working.
"Eliminated the 4 ounce for coffee and the heat for making it hotter. This one is also very flimsy. I had one before and it was much stronger than this one. It’s just not made as good as the other one so sorry to say when you put something or push down on the top of the Coffee bar it’s kind of moves because it’s not very strong. I would buy another Keurig, but not this particular one."
"The Keurig K-Supreme has been a hit in our office. It brews quickly, has great flavor, and offers four brew sizes to suit everyone’s taste. Occasionally, though, it doesn’t recognize when the water tank is full, so we have to reattach it once or twice. Minor quirk aside, it’s a fantastic coffee maker for the workplace!"
"Love the coffee but, getting grounds all over including in the coffee and tray below the cup!Like the White, Size and coffee but?"
"PROS: The Keurig K-Supreme makes a cup of coffee very quickly, that's for sure! It super easy to use -- just fill the reservoir, insert the coffee pod (we use a reusable one), pick your cup size and hit start. It's so much faster and easier than brewing a pot of drip coffee. And the price is right (we got a great Black Friday deal).CONS: This Keurig does not make very good coffee. Even with the 5-hole ""multi-stream"" system and ""strong"" setting, the coffee comes out weak and slightly bitter. We've tried store-bought pods, different types of coffee, etc. and the results are never as full and robust as an old-school drip coffee maker (which itself is nothing special compared to other methods). We noticed only a slight improvement over our last Keurig, which was single stream and didn't have a ""strong"" setting. Also, the coffee comes out just barely hot enough -- it could definitely be a few degrees hotter.With that said, we decided to keep using the K-Supreme because we wanted a fast single-cup coffee maker that can use reusable pods. (We considered a Nespresso, but didn't want to deal with their proprietary pods and limited coffee selection.)I think if the K-Supreme was able to heat the water a few degrees hotter and add even 10-15 seconds to the brewing process, it could make a pretty good cup of coffee. Maybe they'll figure it out in a future model??"
"I’ve had this for several months now, and I am disappointed.  I should have sent it back before the time to return ran out, but I kept thinking I’ll just stick it out. If using store-bought pods, it seems to work fine but I grind my own coffee, and I set it to strong but it is not strong, but it seems to make no difference if I use the strong feature or not -- the coffee taste the same which is sort of watery.  In fact, you can see the coffee has 2 streams coming out into the cup -- one is just straight water in the other dribbles out the coffee. I purchased this will because I thought the stronger setting would give me stronger coffee, but it did not. The other thing that is annoying is the descaling light comes on quite often. My older brewers it hardly ever came on compared to this. Of course, they recommend you use their descaling solution but you can also use vinegar.  Maybe it is malfunctioning, but I have a feeling it’s just the way it is. If you grind your own coffee the directions indicate you need to run a cleansing brew after each brew a which I do otherwise it can clog. What like is it heats up quickly and you don’t have to wait long to get a cup of coffee. The first brew of the day seems like the temperature Is not hot enough, so I end up putting the coffee in the microwave. If you use store-bought pods is probably a great brewer, but not very good for using your own ground coffee, especially if you like strong coffee. I wish I had sent this back but it’s too late now. I’m going to dig up my older Keurig as it seems to work better."
Replaced my old one.  The quality is significantly less than the last. It’s very plasticy. More expensive. Desperate for a coffee maker when I bought it so I’m stuck with it now. Threw the box out before really looking at it.
LASTED FOR 8 MONTHS. EASY TO USE BUT IT STOPPED WORKING.
"EDIT 1/27/24 - Well, after happily purring along for three weeks, this new Keurig died. Stopped producing hot water, which, you know, is a problem if you want hot coffee. So, like the experience of many others here, it became useless. Thankfully, still within the return window. My previous Keurig Elite lasted nearly 10 years. Very disappointing. END EDITCouple of things from some other reviews I want to touch upon.Some guy posted a video comparison of this machine with a Keurig Elite machine. He said this machine doesn't have a 6oz setting. Wrong, it does. (It's even shown in the video!) He said there's nothing different about the coffee brewing process. Wrong again. This model uses the multi stream technology, the Elite uses a single stream. I had the Elite and enjoyed it very much, but when you post a video - and he's being paid to do so - at least get the comparison correct. Not too much to ask.To those that are getting grounds in your cup, thinking it's from the piercings of the multi stream technology - which it likely is - try gently shaking your K-Cup before insertion. I've done this for years with every K-Cup, as it was suggested to me many years ago when I was getting grounds from a single piercing machine. It works. (Unfortunately, you'll also run into some poorly manufactured K-Cups that will spill grounds into your cup no matter which machine is used.)I've not had this K-Supreme for long, so cannot comment on its durability and reliability just yet, but so far, it's making good coffee. I'm not going to claim its infinitely better than a single stream Keurig, but have been very pleased with each cup. I like a strong 8oz cup, my wife prefers a strong 12oz cup, and it's delivered on both fronts.The water tank redesign is outstanding. So much easier to remove and refill than previous models. Also like the overall smaller footprint. I will say, it doesn't feel nearly as robust as previous Keurigs I've owned. They had a heft to them, this is much lighter and feels more delicate. Will check back on reliability after I've owned it for a few months.Oh, got this on sale for $108, which is why I grabbed one. It had been priced between $140-$150 when I previously looked."
"Frankly, I'm not sure why I just bought yet another Keurig K-Supreme unit.I have had to buy 3 machines in just over 2 years. I just bought one earlier this year on Apr 25 2024 to replace one that I had purchased previously.  Both of the machines died almost the same way.  One morning, I woke up, popped a K-cup in, it the buttons to brew, and instead of hot coffee, I got a puff of smoke, the smell of fried electronics, and a dead machine.  The original Keurig we had lasted well over 10 years and was still alive when I replaced it a few years ago.  I'm done buying Keurig K-Supreme units.If this one dies, I'm moving on to another brand. So much for 'excellence.'"
It only lasted 11 months. Disappointing.
We didn't like the instructions on how to insert filter.  Why didn't you enclose a diagram?  I went to YouTube and was able to finish the assembly easily.  I also didn't know it would have to be cleaned after using it to make hot chocolate but was told in the instructions.  Flashing lite said add water i did it still wouldn't start. At the time it did have enough water for my coffee cup. So the third time i filled it to the very top unplugged it and replunged and it finally started.  This is day 3 of using it and this happens.  So this is why the low rating.  I expected to be sending it back if i have anymore problems.  Don't buy!
A bit of a love hate relationship with the brand. Seems like you either receive a good product or not. Will not be buying another on Keurig in the future.
I like Keurig brand and was looking for compact size. I don’t like having to press down on reservoir because light says no water when it isn’t empty.
Replaced my old Keurig with this sleek new model. The problem is that the machine pierces the pod in 5 places instead of one and grounds end up in your cup - very annoying. Otherwise the coffee itself tastes great and I love the front handle on the water carafe. Shame.
"As a long time Keurig owner, and after opening this new one up, I was shocked as to the quality or the lack there of in this coffee maker.  It’s very light weight (I guess that would make it portable—but exactly where would I be taking it??) and very small in height.  It’s so small in fact, that I have to BEND DOWN over the counter to put the K-cup in and select the brew.  Reminds me of the model you pour the water in and wait for it to heat and then it brews one cup at a time.  There are less settings-no clock-But—— this one is made totally of plastic—no mention of DPB, BHA, lead or other additives possibly in the plastic that the water is running slowly through as you brew.  No mention of the bacteria and slime that can more readily grow on this.  The time it takes to brew a cup of coffee is almost double time than my  last Keurig,  that just bit the dust.  I guess that’s the sacrifice for “multi stream technology.”I’m still shocked over the lack of quality-loss of features-wait time-oh, and I know you could say well I should’ve spent the extra $50 and purchased smart coffee maker, but at this point in my life, I’m trying to find ways to get away from my cell phone. I think I would have to really adjust my life  if I needed to get up and use my cell phone to make my coffee maker work.My next one (or I may just put this Keurig in the closet and forget about it, as I have already used it and am assuming can’t return it,) and buy a Nespresso or a Miele or quite honesty, a French press might be better."
I bought this six months ago and it worked great all of a sudden today it just stopped working
"I'm not happy with this particular purchase because the lid won't close all the way, and leaves coffee grounds in my coffee.  Spare yourself the trouble and get yourself a different model.  I threw out the box or I would have sent this back.  I'm going to order another Keurig, that was like my old one, and keep this as a spare.  I don't think you need the extra pins to put extra holes in the K-cup when you have a strong button.  All it does is make the grounds come out and land in your coffee.  Live and learn."
"This will be the last one I buy. They make good coffee and are easy to use, but that's not the issue. I have had three of these in the last two or two and half years. They just stop working. No warning that something is wrong, just stop. That equates to just renting a machine for about twelve to fifteen dollars a month with nothing to show for it at the end except a nice looking device that does absolutely nothing. I bought this one here because the price was the best I could find. We'll see how it goes this time."
3 stars....doesnt and cant brew a full 16 oz.  3 stars
"I have had multiple styles of the Keurig Coffee Makers. This one is the worst one I've encountered. I already have the one like this with the water reservoir on the back  and there are two raised pieces that hold the reservoir in place. I liked the idea of it on the side because it would take up less room on my RV counter. Well, the water reservoir on the side is a joke. There is nothing there to hold it in place, it just wobbles around. This is the cheapest piece of junk. I can't believe that Keurig would put something out like this. I guess they figure they have a strong following of customers who are HOOKED on their coffee makers and pods. Just like any company - they get a good product and then find ways to increase their bottom line by lowering the quality of the product and the parts they put in it. I still have a few of the older Keurig coffee makers that work great. When the last one wears out, I have my ""old style"" coffee makers. Maybe I'll get a French Press coffee maker, who knows. What I do know is that I won't be in a hurry to purchase another Keurig product. The quality of materials and workmanship is poor now. I'm happy I have three older ones with little or no use and can use them until they break. I know that I won't be getting any more new ones."
"It’s seems real lite, not heavy duty like others"
"The first 4 months I had it, it was amazing. I had that moment plenty of others have had of ""I get it!"". The machine was always there and ready to brew a cup for me, until it decided it was done and no longer wanted to work.Doing my research the product has a thermal switch that can overheat and trip in a variety of situations, particularly when it is in descaling mode, leading to a complete bricking of the machine requiring you to disassemble it to get it to function again. I have descaled it successfully without any issues, however, I still ran into the same set of symptoms without any explanation to as why.This isnt a new problem either, I am finding complaints and forum threads from 2021 about this issue. I cant believe they are selling this for $140. The least you could do is add a reset button to the outside so we can reset the thermal sensor WITHOUT disassembling, but I guess that means we wouldn't have to buy a new one when our second, or third warranty replacement bricks itself.Please avoid this machine, it may keep you happy while it works, but it is going to lead to sadness when you really are craving a cup of coffee, and find out your machine quit on you.As for me, I will be RMA'ing mine, and I will not take anything less than a revised, non defective model, or my money back."
"We are Keurig, but this one seem to leak. I didn’t like it. It would’ve been nice because it would be so easy to use. Take with you on trips and stuff, but it was a hassle."
"So, for bigger ticket items I normally go through Amazon as the seller. With all the third party shenanigans I have seen I rather not deal with something big I order to have issues. HOWEVER, I ordered this from Amazon as a new item, but instead was given a box for the machine that was one, obviously tampered with, and two what was inside was not the machine I ordered. Ok so that is odd, but Amazon has always taken care of things so I just got a replacement.The replacement was new in box sealed. So good on that part. I used it for almost 3 weeks about 3-4 times a day. I work from home about 12 hours a day. I assume I use the machine more often than most people in that short amount of time. So I was not to my surprised to see the descaler light be on. I followed the instructions to get the machine to descale and after complete, the descaler light didn't go away. So I tried it again. After the second time, the machine stopped turning on altogether.Tried all the troubleshooting steps I could find over a few days, and nothing. I gave up and just decided that the universe didn't want me to have this style of machine, and had to send it back. Bit unfortunate since I finally had the settings and cup stuff dialed in to get the flavor I wanted from the coffee.As far as the actual use, it was pretty simple to use. The only issue I had at times was when trying to clean the top part with the spikes that puncture the k-cups. I wish they included a little brush or something soft like that in order to get in there. I tried with a microfiber towel and it just would never be as clean as I would like."
"This is now our fourth Keurig. I don't mean that the product is so great and we are so happy that we upgrade our model whenever a new one comes out. I mean, this unmitigated piece of junk breaks all the time, usually juuuuust after the warranty expired. Also, I do mean 'break'; it doesn't require a special control-alt-delete, or a level 3 hazmat cleaning(*), it stubbornly refuses to turn on no matter what.Our first unit died 2 weeks after the 1 year warranty expired. We bought a replacement which died 6 months later, but that Keurig replaced. THAT one died 14 months later (1 year warranty remember?) and its replacement just now helpfully decided to save us all some time and die after 6 weeks, so at least it's considerate. Keurig is sending a replacement but I will just use it as a second/replacement brewer (or maybe use it as a Xmas gift for someone I don't like) and will buy from a different brand.(*) for extra points, there is a way to clean the unit but, even if you use the wildly overpriced brand name cleaning fluid, the cleaning process will overheat your unit and trip the safety, which you can (potentially) mcgyver back in if you like taking appliances apart and/or have a band-aid fetish, as getting the plastic housing off and back on will likely claim one or more of your fingers."
"Coffee maker works well however the size settings are not true to the actual size that is brewed. If you hit the 12 ounce setting, it only brews about an 8 ounce cup. Very disappointing, especially if you’re looking for a large cup of coffee."
"I upgraded to this machine from an older series Kcup that still worked but like the features and smaller footprint of this model. I  make 1 maybe 2 cups a day. Use the filters and filtered water. The machine is well kept.  At 12.5 months, over the holiday weekend I made a cup, then my father in law attempted to make a cup. He pressed brew and we heard a small pop and smelled an electrical burn. The machine had no power. Contacted support, they tried to troubleshoot, said the machine was dead and offered me 25% off a replacement and said if I called two weeks ago they would have replaced it at no charge. They said they’d email me the offer and have been peppering my email with spam bc you have to give them your info to request support online. It’s 9:50pm, I called them at 2:30 this afternoon, still no email with the offer. Agent was friendly but wasn’t able to help, pretty confident I was speaking with someone at a call center in the pacific islands that wasnt going to escalate my case to a KDP employee. Overall poor experience. I get the terms and am not someone that tries to game the system but this just doesn’t make me want to purchase a replacement. Plan on buying a new one every year must be their business model"
"Unknown to me it was revealed in this Keurig coffee maker required special k-cups. I have now 40 original k-cups that are now useless. I just received it and have not tried it yet so I really don't know if the old cups will work. Will try that now. Nope, didn't work. Then I had to order expensive special 4 hole kcups. So much for having pre-prepared coffee filled k cups ready to go and if these are tipped over coffee spills out After a few cups of coffee I also noticed coffee grounds floating in my cup. On the up side of this Keurig is the near instant on ready to brew and size selection is nicer than my old Keurig."
"This was purchased in January 2024.  I descaled it (for the second time) in July 2024.  The first time I descaled it I did not have any issues.  This time, the machine stopped working after descaling.  It does not power on.  However, Keurig Customer Service is sending me a replacement brewer.  I have owned many Keurigs over the years, and they all eventually stop working or have issues within a few years.  I think I may move to a regular drip coffee machine when the replacement stops working."
"I have had 2 of this type of Keurig.  I bought the first one in June 2023.  It stopped working in July of 2024.  Keurig refused to replace it.  I then bought the same brewer to replace it.  It stopped working in the middle of brewing my morning first cup of coffee.  After 1 month!  I used a cleansing pod once a week.  These things are expensive so I do the maintenance.  The 2 brewers had the same issue, stopped dead brewing a cup of coffee.  I am not a happy customer.  The ONLY reason I’ll try again is because the last brewer is under warranty.  Of course it is!  After a month!!  I miss the days when you actually got quality products that lasted years!  My first Keurig lasted 10 years!  Those days are gone.  Buyer beware."
"I have only had this brewer for four months and am already having an issue with it. I have clean this brewer every two months, as suggested by the manufacturer, and replaced the filter each time. Now the descale light is on and will not go out, or reset, even after cleaning it a third time. I would not recommend this brewer to anyone as my relatives are also having the same issue."
"While we did like the conpact design,  and multiple strength setting. The top had a defect. Some K-Cups would not close automatically and you would have to push down in order for it to lock in.And of course it breaks right after the 12-month mark. If you're still going to dive into a Keurig I would recommend getting the warranty. Good luck I am trying a ninja this time."
"The way this new unit dribbles out the coffee, tiny droplets splash up and out of the cup. This covers the countertop for 10 inches in every direction with spatter. So after spending $150 or more on a fancy coffee maker, you then need to start using tricks like brewing into a tall glass then pouring into your cup, buying a little stand that will raise your cup, or using some sort of small screen to stop the splash-back. It can be worked around, but it's preposterous after spending this much.I should also mention, the multistream tech brews a much stronger cup than older Keurigs. To someone who likes strong coffee, it's an objectively a better tasting cup. But to someone who likes their coffee weaker or whose stomach can't handle ""bold"" coffee, there's no option except to brew the largest size (and pour some of it down the sink if you didn't want a coffee that large). Wish there was a ""light"" setting in addition to a bold setting, which maybe reverted from multistream to a single-stream brew."
"After using this product for several days, I am disappointed with the end product. It makes a cup of coffee quickly, possibly too quickly. I like strong coffee and my old Keurig, very similar to this product, would make a strong cup with dark roast pods and pressing the strong button prior to brewing, Sadly, this coffee maker, when doing to same thing, makes a cup that is barely a standard cup. Using regular roast pods come out like colored water. This was not a cheap model and I expected better quality from a brand of coffee maker who is well know."
It has been working still after 3 or 4 months so that’s good. I use It everyday.  I like the white color so it’s easy to keep looking clean.  But materials used to make it just feel junky and cheap. The grey handle you pull down doesn’t stay all the way down. The removable stand for small or travel cups isn’t close enough to spout for small cups so coffee constantly splashes on panel and it’s a not quite tall enough when you remove stand to fit my travel cup.  Also it came with some kind of gadget that looks like it’s a filter of some sort that should go in your water reserve tank but it doesn’t lock down at all so it just leans over sideways floating in your tank. We have no idea what it for and there was no paperwork that came with it that has a picture or instructions as to what to do with it.  Strange.
"have had Keurig  K-Supreme w/Multi Stream Technology now for two months,overall has been OK. but now, seems coffee not as hot as when i first purchased it. it works well with k cups, but try using the reusable k-cups pods and the coffee maker spatters water all over the countertop and coffee cup making a mess. that's getting old, my previous Keurig 2.0 coffee maker was a good coffee maker,but it finally quit after 10 years of service. so I'm going to finish using up all the k-cups i have and going to throw this machine in the dumpster not going to bother with sending it back. already found a new coffee maker on line. going to get me a new Bunn coffee maker, a coffee maker i had before i got the first Keurig coffee maker. will probably save some since keurig coffee pods cost so much ,fresh ground coffee is the way to go in my opinion."
I am on my 2nd warranty replacement of this specific brewer. Be careful when descaling this brewer as the process has a very good chance of overheating the brewer. Supposedly if you take apart the whole brewer there is a reset but Keurig replaces the brewer for this specific issue. The only reason it’s not a 1 star is because it breaks before the 1 year warranty is up usually around the 3-4th descale process. Look at this as a brewer subscription as you will be replacing them with new ones from Keurig often.
"I disliked the fact that the kitchen led lights flicker as the water heats up and starts brewing.  I searched and found many have complained about this.  Is this a safety concern?  I don’t know, but the two times I have used it, soon after my garbage disposal popped and had to be reset."
"My sister has the smart version and convinced me to buy Kurig with the reusable cup. However I didn't need the ""Wifi"" option so I thought I would save a buck and get the supreme version.  Who would think there was such a large difference between the two models.  I thought the only difference between the two was the wifi...I was shocked by how wrong my understanding was despite reading the descriptions thoroughly and looking at comparison charts.  I drink strong coffee! My sister was able to make strong coffee with the smart version which has many more strength options then this. With the supreme version you only get the option for regular and strong.  There is NO way you can put this strong version of coffee over ice...Way to weak. looks like tea to me... I even tried grinding the beans for espresso with the hope of getting a stronger cup.  It did make the coffee darker, but not enough. Also the insert to use your own coffee leaked water around the edge.  My sister said this isn't right.  She asked if I packed the grounds too tight, so I made another cup and did not allow it to pack.  Still leaked in the top chamber.  I hope Amazon will take this back as a return. This was a lot of money for such disappointment.  The problem with buying coffee makers especially one cup deals is you don't have control over how dark your coffee is.  you can't buy every maker on the market to find the right one.  Based on my sisters report I thought this would work.  who would think the supreme version and smart version would be so different. This does not work for me. I wish there was a coffee expose where you could try out all the coffee makers on the market to find the right one for you, without having to invest so much money... only to end up with disappointment"
"This was a great machine with lots of features.  I love the water reservoir, much easier to fill with the water dispenser in our fridge door.  I love the different sizes, strong, and over ice options.Today when I went to poured myself a cup of coffee, it started then all of a sudden no power.  I thought it could of been a fuse - nope because other electronics work in the outlet.  We tried other options to get it to work again - we let it sit for a few hours, tapped it from the bottom, long pressed the power button, long pressed the power and size buttons together. Nothing seems to work.  It makes me feel frustrated as this wasn't a cheap machine for the price and we have only had it for 8 months. 😞UPDATE: Found out it was a temperature sensor where it triggers to shut off the machine.  This is inside the machine and can be a pain to fix. 😞"
"I purchased this coffee maker and thought it would be wonderful because of all the reviews I read about it. However, I find that the water sensor is very sensitive. Even though the container will be full, it will still say “add water,” so I have to empty it and carefully fill the reservoir again. I can only fill it  halfway, otherwise it continues to not work. I would not buy it again. In fact, I purchase a different Keurig coffee maker to replace this one."
"Beware of this model!  Bough the Keurig K-Supreme on 2/10/23 & about 1 1/2 years later had issues when selecting cup size, unit would shut down.  After a few tries, unit did not come on.  Totally lost power.  Contacted Keurig, through Amazon, spend 4 days going back & forth with Keurig, the best they could do was offer half price $84.99 on the same unit.  I figured, I need a coffee maker.  I'll take it.  Well they don't have the unit in stock & no date when it will be re-stocked.  Ended up buying up.  Coffee maker should not be dead after a year & a half!  Descaled it every 3-4 months! Not too happy!"
Keurig designers - I hope you're reading this....  I bought the nice white version to coordinate with my counters and backsplash.  Why did you put an ugly black cord on instead of nice white one?  It looks so ugly.
"The best part about this coffee maker is the handle on the water container.  Makes it much easier to refill.  However, unless it's completely full this water container is not 100% sturdy in the unit.  Additionally, when you close the lid after putting the pod in, the handle of the lid doesn't close all the way.Overall, it works and I'm using it.  It's a nice sleek look and doesn't take up a lot of room on the counter.  But, the lack of sturdiness and seal makes it seem a bit cheap.  It's something that needs to be fixed."
"I make one cup of coffee a day, and it's just me. Occasionally I use it more than once a day. I've had it since Feb 2024, but only started using it in April 2024. About a week ago the light indicator showing I need more water started flashing. It was full. So I jiggled around the filter holder and it would start to work. Next day the same. I changed filters and that did not help. Not happy at all."
"The other ~40% it will act like it's going to brew, spits out a small amount of water, and then stops like it's done it's job.  This thing also really loves being descaled, and the amount of water you run through it seems random each time.  Add to that the water level sensor is iffy at best, and you'll end up having to take it apart to reset the thermal fuse.On top of that, the wiring, like in many appliances, is very high gauge (tiny) and likely not the greatest quality.  Not a problem for most things, but the wires running to the 'lid closed' switch are in motion every time you move the lid.  Those wires end up work-hardening and breaking.To get the thing apart, there are three screws on the bottom.  Two behind rubber feet that just pop out, one behind the ""A"" piece that covers the alternate carafe location.  I find it easiest to pop the back piece out from the sides, slide out the rear top, and then the rest of the shell comes out with some tabs on the bottom."
"I had high hopes but after just a couple of brews the machine was dripping water from the k-cup holder and squishing the k-cup. The brew size was off as well , returning the unit. Stay with the old reliable Keurig's this is not worth the hassles."
"I was very happy with this purchase until 2 days ago when it mysteriously stopped working, and the light won't even turn on when plugged in. There is no way to fix it if there if its not getting any power! Also, one should note there were no instructions with this machine and evidently I was supposed to install the water filter, but did not know that! Its possible it broke because there was no water filter, but I doubt it bc we always use filtered water anyway, and that wouldn't explain why the power light does not go on when it is plugged in. I'm very disappointed because I really liked the machine."
"Although I like the size and the look of the unit, the coffee temperature is very inconsistent.  Sometimes I have to reheat the coffee in the microwave."
"I have loved this machine that I purchased on December 4, 2022. I received it a couple of days later, set it up and have loved it ever since. Today May 5, 2024 it just stopped working, 18 months to the day and just outside the manufactures warranty expiration, coincidence I think not!Naturally Amazon is telling me to contact the seller but no one knows how to contact them.My next coffee machine will not be a Keurig given the poor quality but thank you Keurig for pushing me to your competitors, I'm sure they thank you too!"
"It’s cheaply made plastic, don’t expect it to last long. The used to have some stainless steel."
Took awhile to realize the resuable pods need to be oriented in a specific direction; otherwise it doesn't close. Closing arm broke 1st week while wife was trying to close/bring the arm lever down :(Coffee drips out super slow and splatters all over counter
Everything wobbles it is not solid. My old one was more stable not sure if I should keep or get something else amd returm
"It worked for 4-6 cups of coffee per weekday in an office environment for 11 month.Then one morning, during brewing, there was a burned electrical smell and the power light went off.The right side of the machine was extremely hot.Every time it is plugged back in, the side of it gets VERY hot but the buttons do not come on, it no longer functions at all."
"Finally pulled the trigger and bought this model with its ""multi-stream technology"". My hesitation all along was the steep price Keurig commands for its products. I was using an off brand for years and just decided to step-up. Is it better than the original? I don't seem to notice any difference in taste, etc. (Honestly, more holes tend to make for more chance of coffee grounds in your cup.)It does function absolutely fine - I'm just very disappointed in the quality. Lifting and closing the lid, pressing the buttons and even handling the pitcher/water reservoir - everything about this unit feels really cheap! I did buy during a sale, but, if I had paid the full $160(!!) list price, I would have sent it back."
I really loved this kuerig. It had small footprint and brewed fast. However after 1.5 years it just quit working- light didn’t come on etc. I tried different outlets and checked circuit breaker but all fine. So maybe that’s all products last for these days - planned obsolescence??? Dunno.
"I have loved it UNTIL, at the first cleaning, the light never stopped blinking, telling me it needed to be cleaned, no matter how much water I ran through it.  And now after just a little over a year, it will NOT  turn on.  The power is dead.  Sad for me, I thought I purchased the warranty but apparently did not."
"Yes this is a very simple efficient delivery system.No measuring, filters, cleaning etcBut it does not taste like coffee. It is tea at its bestI have tried Starbucks at Strong and nothing...teaThank god I saved my old maker...Ahhh"
"I’ve had several good experiences buying things through Amazon than were  ‘used - like new’ or ‘used - very good’. But with this Keurig unit though, NOT a good experience! I unpacked it, plugged it in, and it wouldn’t even power on. I would think that the seller would at least make sure it would come to life before shipping to a customer - who just really needs a cup of coffee in the morning! I don’t really enjoy the return process.. especially when it’s something that never should have been sent. My time is too valuable - (at least to me) to be wasted like that..! Some of these ‘3rd party sellers’ (as Amazon calls them), are really not to be trusted. Amazon, please do a better job screening sellers like this. The rest of you, beware. I don’t know if their 3rd party sellers are rated (sure should be!), or how to check, but it’s something we all need to look into. (I don’t like doing that either - we should be able to trust Amazon..!)"
Absolutely love this coffee pot it was so nice. It is not durable it broke literally 6 months after having it and I was just out of the window for a return. It is absolutely expensive to only be able to use for not only a half a year. It doesn't take up too much room I like how it would sit up against the counter without being too bulky. But we had to push the pod in to pop it and then close the lid or otherwise it would not brew the coffee properly and it would back up and get everywhere it was a pain in the butt until we figured out that you have to push it in and pop it with the bottom needle then close the top for the top needle. I'm very disappointed in it I spent a lot a lot of money on it and it literally died after descaling it like it yelled at me too. You guys are better off getting the $50 ones then this stupid expensive one
"We purchased the Keurig® K-Supreme Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker, MultiStream Technology, in Gray on February 10, 2024.  It is now May 4, 2024 and we can say we are not fully pleased with this machine. It seems to malfunction every day, and it only gets light use and has been well cared for. We are past the point of being able to return it on Amazon, or we would do that. The  main issue is as follows: when we refill the machine with water, the next time that we try to use it, the light comes on that we need to refill the water, and it will not work until we play around with it for a few minutes....we turn it off and on, we put the arm up and down a few times and we lift off and replace the full water carafe a few times as well, before it will cooperate and work for us. This is totally unacceptable in our opinion, and for it to do this every day, especially first thing in the morning is even worse. The water and beverages from the machine also do not get hot enough, or as hot as our old Kuerig and we're constantly reheating our mugs in the microwave. We also think there's way too many coffee grounds/tea grounds in our mugs when we rinse after using it for the day. We tried contacting the seller, as Amazon recommended doing so, since it's past the return date, but two messages so far have been ignored. The next step may be recontacting Amazon, or contacting Kuerig directly. We have had Kuerig machines only for years, and never had such issues as we do with this machine.  This is totally unacceptable!"
Nothing wrong with the machine.
"My last Keurig lasted 3 years, that's about normal for them it seems. By the end I'd have to give it a bit of a  whap to get it out of being frozen on ""descale"", even after multiple descale cycles. I think something wasn't catching anymore, I blame our hard water.So I buy this one ... wow, um, utter junk. It's rickety and wobbly, and made of cheap brittle-feeling plastic - I'm afraid if I dropped the water reservoir it would crack. Just overall poor quality. I fully expect it to not last 6 months.I'll buy k-cups at the grocery store week-to-week after running out of the back up of 3-ish months of k-cups subscription I have right now.  I think if I kept up the subscription I'd end up with an expensive surplus of the things and no working Keurig.When this craps out in a few months I'm going back to a drip maker - better for the environment anyhow."
"Full disclosure - This review is actually for the last Keurig that failed and we just received its replacement, the Keurig K-Supreme shown here, from Amazon.We have been buying Keurig coffee makers for years. And by that I mean it seems like a new one every year.  Except for the one before the last one, which lasted almost three years.  That one, the Keurig K-Supreme Plus C which we bought from Costco in October of 2021 failed within five months.  It would still make a cup of coffee as long as you expected an 8-10 oz. cup and nothing else.  The ""descale"" light came on within about three days of first use and never went out regardless of how often it was descaled IAW the descaling instructions.  Last week it decided that it wouldn't make a cup greater than 8-10 oz. regardless of the setting programmed into the ""User 1, 2, 3"" feature.  The cold brew button would just dribble a bit into a cup and call it quits.I have come to the conclusion that Keurig has either wretched engineering or terrible QA process, or maybe both.  However, we keep buying the dang things because of the unmatched convenience, the enormous variety of available coffees and the speed of brew (when it brews).To prove how hooked we are, we just bought ANOTHER Keurig from Amazon, but this time it's the slightly more basic K-Supreme which lacks the ""sophistication"" of the programmable user selection.  Bottom line is that there is probably a reason people have been brewing coffee over fire for years.  But Keurig just makes it easier to do....  All you have to do is throw the old Keurig away and get a new one!Would I recommend Keurig to a friend?  Well, yes, actually.  With the caveats that they should not expect it to last, and that they'll get used to replacing them because it's such a convenience.  Weird, huh.UPDATE:  If I could give this thing ZERO stars I would.  The current Keurig was delivered to my door on March 12th, 2022.  This morning May 30th, 2022, this Keurig is DEAD.  They are simply trash, garbage, not worthy for commercial consideration, crap, NO LONGER RECOMMENDED unless it's to someone you really don't respect, DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS THING.  Shame one Amazon for even selling Keurig products.Whew, I feel better now.  Don't waste your money folks...."
"Read a few other reviews before, but went ahead with it.  When you register the product, you receive a 50% off coupon that apparently cannot be used. You pay good money for the appliance, you figure the company will eagerly reward you for your purchase.  I made a purchase with the coupon and a few hours later received an email stating ""order number XXXXX has successfully been canceled""  I called their customer service number and was told they did not know why since items I ordered were in stock and I would receive a call from them at 3PM the next day.. Call never came, coupon is no longer valid and no explanation.  I have emailed them multiple times and no response from Keurig.  Also informed them that their ""Email Us"" page on their site is broken since will not let me submit a question through it. Very frustrating dealing with Keurig.  A different company from  what it was 10 years back."
"In the past three years, I have purchased 5 Keurig machines.  4 of them are this model and one is the Smart Keurig.  ALL have died in less than a year with the last one, the Smart Keurig dying in LESS than 3 months.  ALL have the same defect which is the shutoff temperature gauge internal to the machine.  This is known problem & can be found on the internet yet Keurig has not addressed this issue.  Once that temperature gauge trips, there is nothing you can do.  So if you have experienced a loud popping noise followed by a burnt smell that is what has occurred.  My other issue with Keurig is they recently changed their warranty.  When I received the Smart Keurig, I registered it using Keurig’s app as recommended by Keurig.  When this machine failed, even though it was registered on March 7, 2024 and failed on May 27, 2024, they would not honor replacement as their new policy requires you keep the receipt.  Without the receipt there is no recourse.  There is NOTHING on the box or in the pamphlet that comes with the appliance this is a requirement although they do state there is a 1-year warranty, it is only good if you have the receipt.  Registration doesn’t count.  They might as well put on the box not-returnable.  I have written their CEO & contacted their support.  Their answer was to give me “MAYBE” and yes, that’s the word they used “MAYBE” 50% credit towards a machine I had purchased for $246 that lasted less than THREE MONTHS since I no longer had the receipt."
"Bought this to replace older series unit that had died. Out of box, it did not sense low water level. Usually this was a stuck sensor puck on my old unit. This model has no visible puck to unstick. So, no visible fix. Returned for refund. Looking for a different model."
Lid didn’t close properly out of the box. We had issues with the machine shutting off sporadically on its own which is odd. Also I’m not a fan of the replacable water filter as it’s just an unnecessary consumable that will continue to cost me money forever (I already use filtered water).
"After almost half a year of usage with the same ceramic cup fill dispensing is holding volume as desired and instead 12oz I'm getting between 9 and 10 oz, similar condition is at 8 and 10 oz desired volume that is not holding volume. I use the K-Cup original Kurig coffee. Secondly occasionally coffee maker just freezes and require power reset. Unit is clean, dispense nozzles are clean, nor residue of calcium. So, looks like some quality of the machine is questionable."
"New models have changed the hot water insert design. (First pict) Old one had single spike in center - always worked great. New one has a center spike and four spikes spaced around it. (4 new spikes appear to be solid so what’s their function??)  So, first problem is that the 5 spikes put to much pressure on “lid” of some K cups (particularly the “eco” cups from Gorilla - 2nd pict) result is that cover detaches from one edge and allows water to escape around the cup  (despite the rubber gasket around spikes) giving a weak cup of coffee as overflow does not go through grounds.  More serious is that new design is incompatible with reuseable cups as the 4 new spikes can’t penetrate the plastic lid.  (Or, maybe this is to prevent use of reuseable pods?) First issue might be solvable if the 4 spikes were razor sharp like the old single spike. But not sure if the reuseable cup issue is solveable. I may try drilling 4 holes but then there is alignment issue when installing cups (and become incompatible with older models); not sure that water under pressure won’t escape back through holes flowing over the lid and weakening coffee.  Another example of “If it ain’t broke, don’t FIX it!”  Also, I miss the 4 oz setting - used it to make great mocha coffee with hot chocolate pods.  Do the designers ever run these changes by a panel of actual product users?"
This keurig always leave grounds in my cup compared to keurig at home which is a different model.  What the problem?
It worked good for 11 months then it stopped working in the middle of a brew.  It will not power up.  Very disappointed. Not satisfied with it.
"Worked fine at first. Then maybe one cup out of four will be fine. Otherwise doesn't deliver the ounces selected, overflows, grit in coffee. Also is not heating as it should. Of course, it is just past the one month mark, and isn't returnable. Landfill here it comes."
"This is probably my 4th Keurig and every single one of them barely last 2 years before they die. The quality on them are awful. My latest Supreme didn't even make it 2 years. It overheated and now will not turn on, all because of the descaling problem that everyone is reporting on.When the descale light comes on you should descale. The problem is that the steps given by Keurig don't actually work (or are incorrect for the model). LIke others have complained, the descaling light refuses to turn off. I cannot remember how I got it off the last time but this time I followed the recommendation for another model to press and hold 8 and 12 oz buttons at the same time. I had already descaled and flushed at least 4 reservoirs. The reservoir was empty so I was expecting the ""add water"" light to turn on but instead after pressing the buttons and then the flashing Keurig button it started running anyway. Needless to say nothing came out. Then I smelled plastic burning and the machine turned off. Opening the cup lid and smoke is coming out. Now it is dead because descaling instructions don't work and evidently the ""add water"" detector is unreliable.I'm looking for a different manufacturer. 4 times is enough. A regular coffee machine is cheaper and more reliable."
"This was my first Keurig product and for the first 9 months, it performed beautifully.  Then yesterday it failed & had a terrible smell & would not brew, no lights, no warning - it was completely non functional. So disappointed! I should have read the all the reviews about the failure rate of this product.  Keurig used to have quite a respectable name in the industry, now I am not so sure..."
"There are some things you should know about the Keurig K-supreme. On the good side, it makes the coffee much more quickly that the older models and it has a water reservoir that eliminates the need to add water before each cup of coffee is made. On the bad side, unless you press the button for ""strong"", the coffee produced by multistream technology is weaker and less flavorful than older models. Pressing the ""strong"" button reproduces what you expect in a cup of coffee. (I had originally purchased the K-slim, which does not have a ""strong"" button. I returned it because the coffee was too weak. Hence, I felt forced to buy a more expensive model.) A second problem with the K-supreme is that the coffee produced is not as hot as produced by older models, maybe because of the high speed of production. I find it necessary to put my newly brewed cup in the microwave for 15 seconds. Conclusion: if you use the ""strong"" setting, and further heat your coffee, you can duplicate what older models produced in a bit less time."
It worked fine for a year but now it constantly leaks out of the bottom of the tank. Tried everything I could but can't remedy the problem.
"This is the second Keurig that I bought from Amazon that failed within the return period, so I guess I should consider myself lucky?  Better than it failing in six months then being stuck with a $150.00 broken coffee machine.It was fine for the three weeks. It had a small counter footprint and it heated the water very fast, which is what I wanted.  First sign of failure is when I tried to make a small, 8 oz cup, and it was full of coffee grounds.  Tried again and it was the same.  It wasn't the cups, because they were Duncan Donuts cups and they work fine with the old office Keurig.  A week later I set brew for 12 oz, and maybe 4 ozs came out and it was 50% coffee grounds.  So that's it, off to UPS for a return!As for the ""multistream"" tech, it's, in my opinion, la marketing gimmick to get you to ""upgrade"" to a new Keurig.  Couldn't taste the difference.  And if you are using big brand cups -- Duncan, Starbucks, Green Mountain, etc. -- you aren't going to taste any difference.  Never tried to the iced Coffee setting, never had it that long.Anyway, it's it for me and owning a Keurig.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.  Besides, the planet really doesn't need more plastic, especially when good old fashioned drip coffee makers with paper filters make better coffee."
"This was decent coffee maker, but nothing special. But with the price charged for a Keurig, it should last at least 4 or 5 years. About 10 months in, the ""Descale"" light refused to turn off, even after meticulous descaling the same day the light would come on.  Multiple descaling treatments/cycles did nothing to make the light turn off again. Then about a 2 months after descale light permanently came on, 1 year  to the day after I ordered it from Amazon, it made a faint little buzz and then died. And did so before I got my first cup of morning coffee. Unforgiveable timing. I live alone so it didn't get excessive use, about 2 to 3 cups of coffee in the morning and that's it, and only for brewing with K-cups.  In my humble opinion, for the money this is a piece of crappola. Won't be buying a Keurig coffeemaker again."
We have been using reusable cups to do our part to save the environment for a couple of years. We have tried two different styles which were said to be compatable with this coffee maker. Neither worked so we are back to using disposable cups but not happy. Considering sending this back and returning to the old style coffee maker.
"Bought this one in March 2024 and the motor blew out this morning. Hot to the touch with burning electrical smell. This is my second Keurig because the first one only lasted one year. We only brew two cups in the morning, so there is no way this should have burnt out this quickly.  Something is definitely amiss regarding Keurig's quality control and assurance departments. Or, maybe not."
"I thought it was just me - maybe I don’t know how to make coffee (even though I used to do it for a living), but thankfully, now reading all of the reviews, it’s not just me!I bought this coffee maker because of the front-fill design and the way my kitchen is set up. I thought it would be nice to not have to pull the coffee maker forwards/push it back all the time.My counter top where this sits is now stained with coffee after overflowing coffee grounds and coffee multiple times.If I only want to make 4 “cups” of coffee, I haven’t had a problem. Anything more than that is a roll of the dice if grounds will go all over the place. This past weekend, I actually had to pour the brewed coffee through another filter to catch a bunch of grounds. (Thankfully, I’ve since put a mat under the coffee maker itself, so none got on the counter this time…)If I put in the proper amount of coffee grounds and water for 12 cups, there will be coffee and grounds everywhere, but even if by some miracle there isn’t, it only fills up to about 10 cups in the carafe.For those wondering, I use properly ground beans (not too fine, not too coarse). I use 2 tablespoons per “cup” (a coffee “cup” isn’t a cup in the 8oz sense, hence the quotes). I use filtered water and I regularly clean the coffee maker.I haven’t been able to find anything that prevents it, short of only brewing 4-5 cups, which is not ideal if there are two of us.The coffee it brews is fine. I haven’t had any issues with the flavor, temperature, or anything else actually brew/taste wise.The coffee machine doesn’t beep (when done or when the hot plate shuts off), which some have complained about, but I don’t mind at all.The carafe does have the little plastic lip which does leave a small amount of coffee (or water, if rinsing/cleaning) in it. Isn’t the end of the world for me because I don’t need that thimble-full of coffee. It’s only very slightly annoying when washing - but I just dry it out with a paper towel and call it a day.I’ll keep using this machine until I either get sick of the coffee grounds spillage (at which time, this coffee maker will almost certainly be taken out back for the Office Space printer treatment) or until it breaks, mostly because I’m too lazy to buy another one unless it’s actively spewing grounds everywhere - and at the time, I’m too busy cleaning up a huge mess to order a new one in the moment."
"I had the previous generation of this model and liked it a lot, the 46201 - which has been discontinued: https://amzn.to/3W4u5lgThis new model is good... in some ways an improvement, but in other ways it is a step back and the annoying things annoy me every single time I use it. I'm sure I will get used to it.Here are the things that bother me about it:- When you're standing in front of it, the top of the LED clock is not visible, cutting off the top of the numbers.- The front pour container is very shallow, so you have to pour the water super slow or it will spill over the edges.- The temperature is too hot. I can't drink it right away. The previous generation had 3 levels of temperature you could set, this one does not. And the highest setting was the PERFECT temp. I really miss being able to select the temp.- The ""under cabinet"" fill is silly since I still have to pull it out from my cabinet to fill it - okay, maybe I pull it out 3-4 inches less but it's weird they brag on this as if it makes a difference.- The carafe can be difficult to get back in. The old model had this problem too. I know how to do it just right, but every guest I've had over can't do it and I have to help them.- CLEAN - the cleaning cycle is so annoying. The display will flash CLEAN. I am tired of my appliances telling me what to do and now that is just going to flash on the screen. I don't need more chores. At least let me turn it off!Did the manufacturer not try this out before shipping it?Things I like:- The removable basket is easier, more convenient than the previous model.- The look is better, imo. More open, clean."
"I recently bought this item for the second time, after it simply quit working, though it was perfectly operational for a few years and I was pretty happy with it so decided why go to a different, untried, coffee maker. REASONS I LIKE THIS ONE: you can decide just how much you want to make up to 12 cups, and adjust your coffee grounds (I find freshly ground medium roast coffee beansare my go-to favorites). It works quickly and does as described in their summary. WHAT I DON'T LIKE: The filter receptacle is a little tricky to get in once you take it out to clean, but not impossible; and the glass pot is ornery to get in place once you've poured water in and you're ready to perk, but wiggling around, it does go into it's proper place. During coffeemaking, I like to grab the pot and pour a cup as soon as it's in the pot, but it continues to drip on the base even when I turn it off before removing to pour. It makes great coffee, but I believe the great coffee depends on using whole beans, ground in your own grinder, and medium roast (not as oily and does  not clog the bean grinder-- this requires you to have a grinder, which is easy to use and well worth the cost). Also, if the coffee is left on the base - maybe you have houseguests and like a constant flow of coffee available, it gets acidic taste, but coffee left to sit heated gets that ""old coffee"" taste no matter what you make it in. Overall I give it three stars because it's fine for me. Do I love it? No, but I do like it."
I do not like this one as well as the one I purchased a few years ago -Some design feature changes. But I still like the front lid opening for water.
"The Bold setting stopped working after 4 days. Itsaid ""bold"" but reverted to regular. Probably a one off manufacturing error."
UPDATE...Hamelton Beach customer service does not work. They don't answer the calls. Just a recording to go to their website. I'm having issues with my email so I can't contact them. Now the return window has passed. I just need them to send me a new basket because it gets stuck open every time. I Like this coffee maker But the Sneak a cup valve gets stuck open. I have cleaned it-worked it Messed with it. But it keeps getting stuck open. Every time I get another cup it leaks down onto the hot plate making the house smell pike burnt coffee. Other than this issue. I like it. Another Issue that happens because of the sticky valve is. When I pull the pot out to pour another cup. The condensation from the basket pours down on to the hot plate. Making a loud noise because it sizzles the liquid pouring on it. and makes a sticky mess and the smell of burnt coffee. All I need is a New Basket. I'm going to be calling them AGAIN  this Morning. I will update about their customer service IF they ANSWER the phone. Last time. They didn't
"We purchased this unit from Amazon Warehouse. It arrived in the original packaging, looked great, and seemed to function okay. However, we almost immediately noticed that it seemed difficult, if not impossible, to slide the carafe into place onto the burner and under the pause and serve plunger.  It seemed like we had to reach a finger tip underneath and lift the plunger a bit in order for the lid of the carafe to move into place beneath it.  From what we can tell, our unit was not defective, rather this seems to be a design issue. (It seems like there needs to be shallower slope, or lead-in on where the bottom piece on the plunger meets the corresponding feature on the top of the carafe. They would then slide over each other more easily. The way it is, however, when the pot is slid into place on the burner, the top of the carafe lid hits the side of the plunger and doesn't lift it without the assistance of a finger tip.)We really wanted to like this coffee maker for its features.  However, we felt the issue with the pause and serve plunger would be a continual nuisance so therefore returned the unit."
The coffee maker looks good but has already started to leak from underneath.  Still trying to work out if it is user error or a defective machine.I recommend investing in the reusable filter that's sold separately.  The machine basket doesn't use the typical #4 filter size (which is what I'm using) so I get coffee grains in my cup towards the end of the pot.I love the convenient front placement of the water compartment.
"I have had the exact coffee maker for several years, loved it, and needed to replace it. So I got the same one but this one has been nothing but trouble and I started using it after the return window closed.The no drip pin won't stop the coffee coming out cause it sticks and the filters are falling over and filling the pot with grounds. Didn't have this issue with the old one. (same filters) Took the no drip pin out so now I have to wait till it's done to get a cup of coffee.*** just not happy with this one***"
"The Hamilton Beach Programmable Coffee Maker is a decent coffee maker that isn't too expensive.  Easy to program and the cleaning reminders are very helpful.  The programmable timer works great and is very convenient.  One negative is that it is sometimes difficult to put the pot back onto hot plate; you have to kind of wiggle it into place (it is easier to put back if the basket is open - would recommend doing that as there has been a couple of instances where the pot was not all the way in and coffee was spilled all over the counter). We have had the coffee maker for 1 year now and after 1 year of use, the hot plate is very worn looking.  If you are looking for a more affordable coffee maker, this one is good, but keep in mind how you have to make sure it is properly inserted."
"I used this machine daily for 17 months. Then, quite suddenly, it died: it wouldn't pump water or heat coffee. 17 months is a very short lifespan for a coffee machine. (Another of my Hamilton Beach machines also lasted a little less than 18 months. Perhaps the entire brand suffers from durability issues.)This machine's coffee is as good as the coffee I've had from $50 Hamilton Beach machines. But I regret buying this machine, and indeed, I am never going to buy another Hamilton Beach product. In so many ways, this machine's features are limited or poorly implemented:1) Extremely prone to spilling coffee all over your countertop. This is not a problem with the carafe; instead, it's a problem with the spring-loaded nozzle that transmits coffee from the machine to the carafe. About once every three months, this Hamilton Beach machine (and others that I've had) floods my countertop. Many other reviewers have detailed this problem: see ""Hamilton Beach strikes out again"" (which has the best detail), ""flow cutoff sucks, leaks"", ""Coffee Goes All Over the Counter"", and more. See also the picture at the bottom of this review.  A recommended solution is to use a little less ground coffee than you normally would, and then to use the machine's ""bold"" setting. But this hasn't stopped my machine from flooding on occasion.  This alone is a fatal or near-fatal flaw. But there is more...2) Water reservoir: not removable (and thus difficult to wash). Also, the water gauge, which lets you see how much water is in the reservoir, appears on only one side of the reservoir -- rather than both sides, as with many other machines. Depending on how you position this machine on your countertop, you may need to bend at an odd angle to see the gauge.3) Carafe: before making coffee, you push it into the machine so that it sits atop the holder, just as with most other coffee machines. But if you push it in as far as it can go, you have gone too far; the carafe won't be well positioned, and your coffee will spill outside the carafe. (But the carafe itself is better than the carafes from Hamilton Beach machines of a few years ago, because it's less likely to spill when pouring.)4) LED indicator lights: they're white, which makes it a little more difficult to see whether they're on during the daytime. Any other color would have been better.5) Power cord: not retractable, as it is on other low-cost coffee machines. As a result, the power cord will spill out over your countertop at least a little.6) Buttons: they are very shallow and stiff; they require too much force to press. Again, it's not a huge problem. But to press the power button or any other button when the carafe is less than half-full, you need to firmly hold the machine itself with one hand, while pressing the button with a finger of your other hand. If you just attempt to press a button without holding the machine in place or otherwise anchoring it, you'll simply tip the machine over onto its side.7) Battery backup: there is none. If you lose power for a second, or unplug your machine just for a moment, you will need to reset the current time, the time at which you want coffee-making to start (if you use that feature), and any special settings that you have. This isn't easy, as Hamilton Beach doesn't make it simple for you to set the time or, especially, the time at which you want coffee-making to start. The lack of a backup battery for these features seems like great cheapness on the part of Hamilton Beach, given that ordinary consumers can buy 3V lithium batteries for less than $1.8) Coffee-filter holder: it has no handle, and to use it, you must slide it into the machine just so. All of this makes it a little difficult to manipulate.9) As mentioned at the top of this review, the machine died in less than 18 months.This machine is worse than you would hope, even given the low price. And the flooding problem, while it happens to me only once every three months or so, is terrible when it does happen. Avoid Hamilton Beach."
the pot was cracked need a new one
The quality of this product is average. I’ve had better coffee makers.
The coffee maker functions alright but the spring on the filter basket doesn't work. So it keeps dripping if I move the carafe to pour coffee before it's finished brewing completely. That is annoying. It is just over a month and I can't return it either. Also there's no indication if the brewing is complete or not. I would not buy this again.
"Setting time is a pain! Pressing button as numbers zip by, trying to stop at correct hour, oif not have to start from beginning, but then it's asking for minutes.  Sneak a cup, keeps dripping.  Delay brew must be progmmed every time 🙄"
"I bought a Hamilton Beach 46205 five years ago and it was the best machine I'd ever owned. So when it gave out I tried to order the exact same thing or as close as I could get to it.This one is not it.Can't see where the 2 cup mark is on the water level. I actually do sometimes brew 2 cups. Yeah, I could measure water in the pot but sometimes I want the extra 2 cups to heat up what's still in the pot.The basket is the worst issue. There is not a true latch. So if you bump it, the basket swings out while it's still dripping and makes a mess all over your countertop.The old model was like the Jaguar of coffeemakers. This one is a Chrysler."
"Easy to use. Looks nice on the counter. After two months daily use, the coffee unfortunately still tastes like plastic. My return window has closed, so I'm hopeful the taste of the coffee imptoves."
"Hamilton Beach 12 cup front-fill coffee maker:  I had one of these for five years, purchased because of the front-fill feature.  I would not purchase again, because I  consider this unit a very poor value at the $49.95 price. The digital display, dim in any case, failed after about a year, making all control except off/on impossible, negating the time-to-clean feature, etc.  Design is such as to make re-inserting the plastic filter holder into the swinging drawer difficult.  An internal leak developed somewhere (possibly under the hot plate) and the carafe cracked on its own.  Carafe replacement costs about the same as a complete simpler, competing, front-fill coffee maker."
"Works okay, but would have thought that a basket to hold the filter would come with the order--but have to purchase that separately.Not as convenient as the one I was replacing, but on the whole, works okay."
Love how it brews fast. But the puase button sticks shut and coffee goes everywhere have to always pull the pause button down after I put my coffee carafe under it.( it's a pain to always make sure it's down)
"It's just an ok coffee maker. I initially had had to request a new carafe ( leaking from pour spout and glass). It makes good coffee, but after 2 years, here I am shoping for another one since this one quite working. I seem to issues with hamilton beach products more often than not. I do not recommend this one."
"It's fine as a coffee maker.  The program only allows for it to stay on for 2 hours after brewing, whereas other coffee makers cna be set to keep the coffee hot for 4 hours.My unit is  6 months old and the clock can't be set. The hours will set, but not the minutes. It sounds like a minor problem, but since I program coffee for each morning it is now a real hassle.It is a 1st world problem, I know."
"Love this coffee machine for ease of use, it’s truly a very nice machine. However, it refuses to keep time accurately so using the program feature for coffee in the morning is absolutely pointless. Very disappointed with that aspect."
"We have only had the coffee maker for 2 months and the screen quit working a few weeks ago.  It isn’t the end of the world but I can’t see to program the time, can’t see when it’s brewing, or if it’s strong.  Not sure if this one has a glitch or if they all do that.  I wouldn’t buy it again for that reason."
The product turned on it's on for some apparent reason and start giving off a burning plastic smell in my kitchen.  Tried running vinegar through it but would not remove the smell which is toxic.  Had the coffee maker since Novemeber 2023 and very disappointed because I really like it and cannot exchanged for a new one.
"It makes ok coffee but the coffee maker is light and moves when I put the pot on the coffee maker and it is somewhat difficult to put the pot under the drip.  Just yesterday, I thought it was square under the drip and came back to the room later to find coffee all over the counter and floor.  I also have to hold the coffee maker when places the pot under the drip to keep it from moving.  Just not a good designed coffee maker."
"I bough this in Dec 2022 and just this week the pump started going out.  It takes an hour to brew all the sudden.Is a year and a half of daily use a hood or bad thing?  I have no idea.  Google says 5 years is the average lifespan of a coffee maker with daily use.Before this week this thing was great.  Easy settings, plate could be hotter, fast drip typically.  It’s a good machine…for 17 months."
"When I first purchased this, I was completely in love.I was enamored with the swing-out basket, and being able to fill the reservoir from the front without having to pull the machine forward (cabinets just above.)The coffee it made was really good too.Fast forward not even 2 years... It died 2 weeks ago. Turn it on, and I can hear it trying to work, but nothing happens. The hot plate doesn't even warm.I wound up spending 23 bucks for a quick replacement (cause coffee, ya know) but am deeply unhappy for the wasted money."
"I love this except for a major design flaw. The pot does not slide smoothly back in place. To get it to set properly, I either have to jiggle it quite a bit or swing the basket open.But when I tried to put it back on while still brewing, the basket swung open, and wet grounds and water sprayed over the pot and the counter.I’ve not seen others write about this, so maybe it’s just mine. But I will be buying a different one."
"I'm coming from a Cuisinart that I'm tired of its heating plate rusting.  I want to like this Hamilton Beach.  Nice design.  Front access is a great idea and works well.  I'm not sure the ""optional"" charcoal filter is big enough to actually do anything.  Its like really?  Cuisinart's is also not that big and you have to change it regularly for it to be effective.  This one's charcoal ""filter"" is even smaller.  Not going to mess that that as an option.Does Hamilton Beach not understand the idea of HOT?  I have replacement coming and hoping the first one has some defect.  The water is not up to the recommended temperature for making coffee of 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit.  The temp is in the 160's.  Its fast to brew but given it doesn't heat the water up to the right high temp no wonder.Replacement here Sunday.  We'll see.  Might be going back for full refund.  Really wanted to like this thing.  Looks good, front fill design nicely done.  But appearance and design is quite useless if it doesn't make a good HOT cup of coffee!Edit:  New one arrived Sunday, yesterday.  Coffee this morning same problem.  Its not hot folks.  Sorry but when the coffee starts out warm by the time you get half way through the cup its cool.  Going back.  How hard is this Hamilton Beach?"
"I love the layout. Easy to put together, and super easy to access the water reservoir. Tested out a couple of coffee makers, and settled with this one due to convenience and taste of coffee. You’ll notice that I said I settled, and I did.To begin with if you are chemically sensitive use with caution. As we know everything is mostly plastic these days, and this coffee maker is no exception to that rule. For the first week or so you are going to smell the off gases of the plastic burning. You won’t taste it necessarily, but it’s not so exciting smelling chemicals and knowing that you are drinking them. I don’t know that coffee makers in this league are any different considering they are all made of plastic.Moving past the smell which did go away, I was really disappointed having only had the product for two weeks, and the glass just shattered as I went to go put it down on the counter. It’s not like I slammed it. I literally set it down, and it truly shattered all over my kitchen. Being that I’m still within the 30 day grace period, I was able to swap it out. Could it be there was a hairline crack originally and I didn’t see it, possibly… So for that reason I’m giving this coffee maker another shot because I haven’t found many out there that I feel works as well."
"There's so much to love about this coffeemaker!  Great price, HUGE pot, programmable timer, ""Bold"" setting for flavorful coffee, easy to use, attractive in the kitchen, AMAZING warming plate that actually keeps coffee hot rather than lukewarm... even the clock keeps perfect time!Except.  It's about that ""keeping coffee hot"" thing.  That only works when the coffeemaker is ON, naturally.  And this one shuts itself off after only 2 hours, no matter what.  Thus, I find myself having to turn it back on manually, or, as I've taken to doing, just shutting it off and immediately restarting it at random, to give myself another 2 hours.We're retired and home all day most of the time, and we enjoy drinking coffee in a leisurely way.  So this is a major pain in the... routine.  Did I know about the automatic shutoff when I bought this?  Yes, I certainly did.  But I assumed that it could be overridden if that was not a feature that was wanted or needed.  WRONG.  Or, at least, I have not figured out how to override it at this point.  (If anyone knows, please share your secret!!!)If it weren't for that one very, VERY annoying thing, I'd order another one of these right this minute to keep on hand in case this one goes down for any reason, because I like every other aspect of it far better than the $100+ Bunns we've used for years.  As it is, I'm going to give myself a bit more time to get in the habit of constantly restarting it.  If it becomes second nature, I might yet buy another one, because it truly is terrific in all other respects.  ::sigh::  So near to perfection... and yet so far.  LOLMemo to manufacturers:  Most of us are grownups and actually don't need babysitters every minute.  Maybe at least give us the OPTION to make a few decisions for ourselves--including the pace at which we drink our coffee...?  :-("
"THIS COFFEE MAKER WAS A REPLACEMENT.  IT'S TAKEN TIME  TO ASSESS  THE  BREWED  COFFEE STRENGTH:..FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS BY USING, 1 LEVEL TABLESPOON PER CUP & USING THE  BOLD SETTING, IN ORDER TO PRODUCE  A  MEDIUM  CUP OF COFFEE.  THE  RESULT  WAS A  VERY WEAK POT OF COFFEE.  I THOUGHT  IT WAS POSSIBLY,  BECAUSE,  THE UNIT WAS BRAND KNEW.  SO AFTER MAKING  MANY POTS OF COFFEE, I STARTED INCREASING MANY TIMES OVER, THE NORMAL RECOMMENDED  AMOUNT.  AFTER ABOUT 2 WEEKS  OF FINALLY USING  HEAPING TABLE SPOONS OF COFFEE,  IT SEEMS NOW IT'S PRODUCING A DECENT CUP OF COFFEE.  NOTE: I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED  THIS BEFORE.  I HAVE GONE THROUGH MANY COFFEE MAKERS, THROUGH THE YEARS, AND I DON'T LIKE EXTREMELY STRONG COFFEE., THIS  IS QUITE SOMETHING.  THIS IS GETTING  EXPENSIVE, SINCE I USE  ORGANIC COFFEE ALL THE TIME, AS WELL AS MY HUSBAND EVERY MORNING.AS FAR AS THE OTHER  FUNCTIONS OF THIS COFFEE MAKER,  IT PROVIDES  BASIC SETTINGS:  IT'S 12CUP PROGRAMMABLE, A FEATURE OF USING, 1-4 CUPS IF YOU WANT.  IT WILL PAUSE WHILE YOU POUR A CUP OF COFFEE MIDSTREAM.  THERE IS 2 SETTINGS FOR BOLD & NORMAL COFFEE.  THERE IS ALSO A CLEANING CYCLE, WHICH IS GREAT!!  HONESTLY, I BELIEVE IF THE COFFEE MAKER IS CLEANED AFTER 30 POTS OF COFFEE, (WHICH IS RECOMMENDED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS) AND AS LONG AS THE COFFEE PLUG STAYS PLUGGED INTO THE WALL, IT WILL LET YOU KNOW, IT'S TIME TO USE THE CYCLE. THIS IS ALSO IN THE INSTRUCTIONS.  FOR A BASIC COFFEE MAKER, IT ACCOMODATES THE NEEDS OF THE AVERAGE BUYER."
I liked the coffee machine  part.  The alexa part was hard to program and it took several tries.  I wish you could program it with your voice instead of going thru the app.  Also the programming part malfunctioned about a year later.  I replaced it with the same model without the alexa .
"The force required to place or remove the pot from the maker is too high. Pulling the pot drags the maker along with it, and you have to hold the maker to push the pot back into position. I've had a toothpick inside the coffee holder that raises the drip stop just enough to make this easier, but frustration forced me to remove the drip stop mechanism all together. It's much easier to use (one-handed) now and there is no resistance, but also no drip stop mechanism. So just wondering if anyone in the design team actually tested this thing before mass producing it?"
"My opinion is Hamilton Beach Model 46310 is a terrible product and do not recommend it. The glass used in the carafe is exceptionally fragile and thin. I placed it on my counter to wash and the bottom glass below the metal handle support cracked into 3 pieces. This left coffee all over the counter, and floor, and some tax documents on the counter I was reviewing. WARNING: Glass is not covered under the limited warranty. I found this out when I asked for a comp replacement as I bought it less than 1 year from the date of the disaster. Customer Service refused to comp it, but did offer as a courtesy a discount towards a future purchase with the code FALL15 for 15% off the next purchase on our website. BUT the replacement carafe is always out of stock. I suggested the HB engineering team look at improving the glass via tempering, thickness, polymer layers, silica vendors, etc. The reply: ‘Design suggestions and comments do not go unnoticed.’ It has brew options including “Bold” which I found nowhere near as strong as my Braun Model KF600, which just brews my coffee, the same each time. The glass carafe is a waste of time to keep the coffee hot all day. My Braun Model comes with a thermal carafe. So caveat emptor. The parent company's publicly traded common stock (NYSE: HBB)went public in August 2017; the stock hit a high of $39.89 per share. Today it trades for $12.28, so in 6 years the stock has lost 69.2% of its value. It started 2023 at $12.12 so a whopping gain of 12 cents or 1.8% annualized.  Only 6 of the 11 Board of Directors are independent (NYSE Section303A). Also, it may qualify as a “controlled company,” as defined in NYSESection 303A primarily on the ownership of Class A Common and Class B Common by the members of the Taplin and Rankin families. Under the listing standards of the NYSE, a controlled company is not required to comply with certain corporate governance requirements. 9 of the 11 Directors have been on the Boards since 2017. Time for a change in the Board."
"* the reusable coffee filter is NOT provided with this unit.  And they don’t even include a couple of sample paper coffee filters for you to get started.  Make sure you have your Mr. Coffee basket-style filters before you even begin to try out this headache of a coffee maker.N.B.:  There is supposed to be the option to remove the decanter while breeding so that you can pour yourself one cup. Every time I attempted to do that, the water kept pouring out of the coffee ground basket onto the hot plate.  It simply does NOT work.I consider myself fairly proficient at reading and following instructions for simple electronic devices.  A coffee maker, should not be as complicated as this one.  I followed all the instructions to brew 6 cups. I added precisely the amount of water advised.  That amount (6 cups on the decanter) went way above the 6 cup mark on the indicator.  I added exactly six level tablespoons of ground coffee.  I pressed start and the brewing began but it stopped after flowing after one cup. Where did the additional water go?  The coffee grounds were saturated with water.  The decanter only contained enough for one 8 ounce coffee mug.  The coffee was weak despite the amount of grounds I used.  Oh well.  Then I pressed the on off button and hot water started flowing everywhere.  Had to rush to unplug the machine and clean up.  Gave it a rest.  Plugged it in again.  OM goodness who wants to reset the time on a coffee maker every time you unplug it—and why does it have to be unplugged after each brew?  Okay.  Plugged it in and set the time again. Next, I attempted to program for a later brewing time.  That is a royal PIA. Make sure you’re wearing your magnifying glasses because you have to keep the program button depressed while pulsing the set-the-clock button for the hour and minutes you want the “automatic” brewing to begin. Don’t lift your finger off the program button until you’ve set hour and minutes. Then, you have to release your finger and press the program button once to get the “on” light lit.  Good luck setting the correct time for your morning or dinner coffee.  I tried the programming option three different times and only once did brewing start.  But, again, it didn’t use all the water in the reservoir to make the 4 cups I wanted.  Don’t bother with the “bold” setting unless you want to wait twenty minutes for your coffee.  Oh, that reminds me:  the clock on mine is a minute slow.  And you’re not done.  After you’ve had your coffee, unplug the machine. And when you want to use it for your next brew, start all over again setting the time etc.  No wonder I prefer a Keurig and my own ground coffee."
This was to replace my current coffee maker since it has started to leak. Ran some water through it to clean before first use as per the instructions. A few issues. The unit is light and the force of pushing the buttons makes it move around. I can live with that. The lid on the carafe doesn't move enough to stay open reliably when filling it. I can live with that.  The drip stop extends so far down that it is hard to replace the carafe and I believe it will eventually end up breaking. Can't live with that. Returned. Never actually made coffee in it.
"I really liked this coffee maker until about a month after we got it.  This morning, as usual, I took the coffee pot out of the maker to pause brewing as directed by the instructions and pour a cup before all brewing had completed.  Usually, when I do this the coffee stops and I can pour my cup.  This morning, however, the coffee did not stop flowing and dropped all over the hotplate - what a mess.  When I tried to contact Hamilton Beach to find out what to do is when the real problem started.  I looked up Customer Support and tried to call them - I got a voice telling me to go to the website.  When I did, I tried to find out what to do and got told to e-mail them.  I tried to get an e-mail address - nothing I could use.  All I needed was someone to tell me what I should do to correct the problem or have them send me a part that works properly.  I don't know what to do now - without some response soon, I will return it to Amazon for a replacement that I hope works better than this.  If this is customer service, I must be missing something!!!!"
carafe is very hard to put back in place on the warmer . most times i need to hands to place the carafe back in place  one to hold the coffee maker and one on the carafe
"I have been using this coffee maker for over a month.  The first two weeks, I kept trying to get it to work right and was becoming convinced I would have to return it, but it is mostly ok now.  Here's the deal:  I have had coffee makers for over 30 years, so it's not like I don't know how to use one.  The challenge here is the water marker on the carafe and on the coffee maker have different ideas of what constitutes 6 cups.  Also, I think there was an initial flaw that prevented the coffee from dripping out of the filter area into the pot.  I did a little work on it and it improved, but not until I have may situations in which A. only 1-2 cups of coffee made it to the carafe and it was mud; B. overflowed in the filter and burned.  It helped when I switched from the paper filter to the metal filter.  I still get grounds in the cup once in a while.  And I have good coffee--this isn't Folger's we're talking about.  I also permanently keep it on the 1-4 cup brew now instead of general.  I cannot think why that works better for brews of more than 6 cups.  Thing is a bit hinky, but I have learned to deal with it.  If it wasn't the pandemic and I don't want to go to the return center, I would have returned it.  But now it is going to be like a grumpy old friend that I get along with."
"I bought this coffee maker on January 31, 10 weeks ago. It had 4 stars and I figured all I wanted was a coffee maker, nothing fancy so it looked good. From the beginning the coffee came out weak (no matter how much coffee I used. It also had a plastic taste and smell. So bad I through out several pots and thought maybe I just had to run it a few times because it was new. I tried 3 different coffees thinking maybe it was the coffee. Finally after about a month it wasn't so bad. I ran it on the bold setting and extra coffee but still wasn't great. I only use it a few times a week.After 10 weeks the clock started blinking like it had a short. I forgot about it for a few hours and was putting something on the counter and felt heat coming from it. I looked at realized the clock was no longer displayed and picked up the glass pot and almost burnt myself before I realized it was hot. Even though I didn't use it that day it was on. I immediately unplugged it.  I called Amazon and they were willing to replace it for me and I asked if they knew of any problems like this and was told there were other complaints but not the same as mine.  So I had them send me the replacement. I looked at the complaints and found 1 that said the coffee tasted funny. I found a whole bunch that said it dripped and there were coffee grinds in the coffee, none of which happened to me so I was hoping I just had a lemon. Well round 2 with the new one, followed all the same instructions for prep of first use. Still the weakest coffee, looks like brown water and the smell and taste is definitely like there is plastic in it. I just threw the whole pot down the sink. If I could give this no stars I would. The fact that it has 4 stars worries me about trusting the rating system because unless you are selling different products to some people there is no way this is 4 stars to anyone.  I don't get many bad products when I research something and I was only looking for an OK coffee pot but this is bad. I'm just going to take the loss and throw this away. I am so disgusted. I didn't think you could make a bad drip coffee maker. I've had many over the years with different brand names. I picked this one and paid about $10 more that the Mr Coffee that I was going to buy because it was going under a cabinet and I liked the swing out coffee filter. Big mistake. I don't think I want to buy another here because I can't trust how they are rated. That's why I wrote this review, no way this deserves the rating on it."
"Bought this unit to replace the previous model which still worked, but the carafe broke and Hamilton Beach decided not to make a replacement carafe available anymore--only had it a couple years.  Thanks from me and the landfill, Hamilton Beach!Still decided to buy this one, and as others have noted, it does not have multiple warmer levels (which I never used), and no removable water reservoir which was easy to refill from our refrigerator water dispenser.  After using this one for the first time today, the front-access refill lid works well enough, and the coffee tastes fine.This also has the 1-4 cup mode like the previous model, which I use about 90% of the time since I'm the only coffee drinker in the house.  I subtracted another star from my rating because the top of the clock display is cut off from view for an average-sized adult (just fine for our 4 and 7 year old kids though)--not sure if we received a slightly defective unit, but not a big enough deal to return.Overall, a decent coffee maker which makes a decent cup of joe for the average Joe like me (I'll take Dunkin' Donuts coffee over Starbucks any day).  I'm a bit concerned about longevity though--I'll try to remember to update this review if I run into any issues down the road."
This machine can reasonably make 6-8 cups of coffee. However 2-4 the coffee is to weak (even with the proper amount of grounds) and 8-12 the machine leaks (with the required amount of grounds). Its not a good machine if you like alot of coffee or 1 or 2 more cups to top yourself off with.
"The first time I used it it leaked water really badly and we had to put a kitchen towel under it. It leaked from somewhere on the bottom.Also, a pice from the lid was broken off when I received it. It was very disappointing because we were very excited to use this pot. We are going to send it back and hopefully receive a capable machine. It was very convenient to load coffee and water in though. If you don’t feel like spending this much on a coffee pot.don’t. I hope to write a more favorable review in the future, but for now, just don’t risk it."
"It's slow brewing 15 minutes for a pot of coffee, the design of the carafe lid  isn't the greatest  which makes it difficult to put it back , I however do like the front fill feature and it's programmable!"
"Am very pleased with the coffee maker so far.  Makes a great cup of coffee and I really like that feature that lets  you select the coffee strength you want ... love that ""Bold"" setting!  Also, the coffee is nice and HOT when it's 1st brewed and the hot plate keeps it at a perfect drinking temperature for two hours.  Incidentally, if you need to reheat the coffee later in the day after it has been turned off or timed out, that hot plate works VERY fast to get it back to drinking temperature.  Think that I'll go get another cup now!UPDATE:  It is now September 16, 2022 and this Coffee Maker still makes a good cup of coffee.  HOWEVER, by the 2nd month the hot plate started to show signs of wear and the attached picture shows the current condition of that hot plate.  The black coating (whatever it was) is almost completely gone.  Seems that every coffee pot I have purchased recently (all apparently made in China) have had this problem.  I'm sorry, but I had to reduce my rating from 5 stars to 3 because of this."
Coffey come out to slow plus the pot does not set in it good.
"Update: We didn’t get a chance to buy a new coffee maker and used it this morning. The coffee somehow splashed out from the side of the basket and large amount of coffee ground was in the coffee. When I pulled out the coffee pot, the coffee started dripping down to the plate. What happen to the feature mentioned in the product description?!!———————————We got this to replace our broken Ninja. This coffee maker makes the worst coffee ever. The one star is for the nicely designed carafe. All we taste was milk because the Bold selection made no difference. We had to use a lot more coffee ground to have almost regular tasting coffee. We used 12 tablespoons Starbucks coffee ground for a full pot of coffee and will still need to increase the amount tomorrow to see if it’ll make a difference! This is ridiculous…even Mr. Coffee machine did much better for us years ago. We’re going to back to Ninja. This machine is a waste of money. Hamilton Beach products are disappointing…from blender to coffee maker. Let’s hope we don’t need to junk the air fryer that we got as a gift!"
"We owned this a year and retired it. Still brewed fine but we just hated it. Why? When removing or replacing the carraffe, the drip dimple would always stick so you have to jiggle to replace the carraffe. So annoying. What's the solution? Lube it with some WD-40? No thanks."
"I love it, it have front open that make easy access for water to pour in, you do not need to move it out under  cabinet. I order 1st one, the digital clock did not work properly, it will slowly few hours back, I return it and order another one, it work great."
It's a nice looking coffee maker but I don't care for the Clean alert that seems to go off every couple of weeks even after I put a filter in the water reservoir and it doesn't sit in on burner very easily without making the coffee basket holder to pop open. All in all I would not recommend this product. Will use this one until I can find one I like.
"replaced a Mr. Coffe maker that I liked but it quit after about a year, so I went with a different brand.PROS: The front water-filling area is very convenient, easy to use. The time is easy to set and re-set. Makes good coffee.CONS: super slow on the ""bold"" setting. No self-cleaning feature--basically, it tells you to clean after 30 pots, and you have to unplug it to re-set the counter, put vinegar in it, let it sit for 30 minutes and run it. Then you have to re-set the time and any brew timer you have. Biggest con for me--the mechanism to be able to pause the brewing and pour a cup, or even to get the pot in place for brewing, is incredibly annoying and I am not sure how much longer I can put up with it. There is a semi-rounded spring-loaded valve that is very difficult to get the pot underneath. The rounded spot on the lid of the carafe gets caught on this and it takes several tries to get it under there, every time. It is supposed to push up the valve, but that is not happening.  I would not purchase this again due to this feature alone."
"I ordered this particular coffee pot after failing to find a reasonably priced 5 cup.  What I found was a much larger product than necessary.  It also arrived with a broken element- it mostly works. I'm not returning it since my last coffee pot died, but a little more OA from the manufacturer might have helped."
"I like this machine except for a couple of misses.1) It says to clean it but there is no clean cycle.2)  Because the heating plate doesn't have options, the coffee gets too hot and a burned taste.  I fold a papertowel and place it under the pot to diffuse some of the heat.I will be ordering something else and keeping this as a back up machine."
"I've had this coffee maker about two months.  The coffee maker is pretty slick looking and easy to use; however there are some pretty major design flaws that make it largely useless for making coffee.By far the biggest issue is the little spring-loaded nozzle that lets the coffee flow from the basket into the carafe.  The idea is that when the carafe is in place, the spring is compressed and the coffee can flow freely and when the carafe is removed (to pour a cup) the spring closes the nozzle and no coffee comes out.  Neither of those two scenarios work as designed with any sort of regularity.First of all, when I remove the carafe, coffee continues to flow out onto the warming plate and my counter.  And I'm not talking about a drip here, I mean a veritable torrent of coffee comes out and can only be stopped by putting the carafe back.  This is annoying but not a deal breaker because I can, of course, still pour coffee after the entire brew cycle is complete.The second and more problematic issue is when the carafe is firmly in place and the nozzle does not let coffee flow out.  It either does not flow at all or flows too slowly to keep up with the brewing.  This results in the brew basket actually overflowing and spilling hot coffee AND grounds all over the machine and, worst of all, into the carafe.  There doesn't appear to be too much user intervention that I can do to prevent this.  I place the carafe directly under the nozzle and it still doesn't work.  If I don't pay close attention to the flow of coffee, I will end up with grounds in my beverage.  And the flow can change mid-cycle without any other input; it can be working just fine at the start and by the time the cycle is over, the basket has overflowed.The nozzle is one of the most important components to the process and it is concerning, though sadly not surprising, that Hamilton Beach put such little effort into the design and durability of it.  I am using the original carafe, a Hamilton Beach filter, and standard store-bought ground coffee.  Nothing is outside the specifications for this machine and yet it still fails me.  The next time I find coffee grounds in my morning beverage, I am throwing this out the window and buying a new maker from a different manufacturer; Hamilton Beach has failed me too many times over the years."
The carafe is difficult to remove and replace whole brewing or otherwise because the button at the base of the fter holder does not retract or recess when removing it replacing the carafe. A real problem never encounters in any other maker
"I'm not a fan of drip coffee but needed an automatic drip coffee maker for my household and this reasonably priced model makes a decent cup of coffee and is easy to use. A couple of caveats: one of the reasons I chose this model was because of the setting for brewing four cups. Supposedly this setting somehow works to optimize the flavor when making less than a full pot, but I didn't find that it made a difference. However, I do find that using the bold setting makes a better brew than the regular setting -- no matter how many cups. Also, if I had to buy a drip maker again, I would spend some extra $ to get a model with a thermal carafe. If you're wanting to make the 8 to 12 cups of coffee at a time that a drip maker makes, it's usually because you're either making it for numerous people, who are often arriving at the pot at different times, and/or for people who want more than one cup. Coffee in a basic glass pot gets cold mighty quick and a thermal carafe would go a long way in keeping what is only a meciocre cup of coffee from becoming a lukewarm-to-cold bad cup of coffee. All that being said, while I personally stick with my trusty Aeropress, if you're going to go with drip, and can't spend the extra cheddar for a thermal carafe, this is a fine choice."
Love the coffee maker but the warming plate rusted and it's not a year old.
"Water seems to run right through the middle of the filter, leaving the surrounding grounds almost untouched.  Fine ground beans seem to go though the filter adding sludge to the coffee.  I have to add a paper filter around the one provided, to strain iit better."
"Purchased Feb 2023. Pros: makes the hottest coffee I've had at home; easy to fill in water. Cons: difficult to place carafe onto hotplate when filter basket is closed which sits above the carafe. Carafe gets 'stuck' with filter basket or hits the bottom of the basket with the lid of the carafe. If you don't make sure the carafe is sitting flat on hotplate, you can end up with coffee spilling out instead of into the carafe when brewing."
"The spring in the stopper is too tight and doesn't allow the stopper to work properly so that you can pull the carafe out either during brewing or even after brewing has completed. It causes it to overflow the basket putting grounds in the carafe and makes a mess when you pull out the pot to pour a cup. I tried working with the manufacturer on getting a replacement basket, but they wanted to consider it a warranty claim and charge me shipping. I don't feel that's fair because this was defective from the start, not something that happened over time. I'm requesting a full refund from Amazon. Photo attached is after brewing only 2 cups because anymore than that and you're drinking coffee grounds. Such a hassle. Wish me luck!"
"Loved this coffeemaker, especially the front fill feature. Unfortunately,  it started leaking out the bottom after a few months."
"This coffee maker is made of cheap plastic. Control button feature with brew options is poorly designed. The most important flaw is the non conical shape of the filter cup which makes coffee filter from the sides of the filter, not the bottom. The result is a flavorless light brew. Even increasing the amount of coffee per cup of water, plus using the 2-4 cup option, did not give me a decent cup of coffee. I got a light color brown liquid with some tiny pieces of coffee grounds as a “bonus”."
"I was impressed with the looks, but it's cheap. The swing out basket is SMALL and liners don't fit properly. I purchased numerous types and i wake up to coffee everywhere other than the pot. And my cup of coffee always contains ""roughage""!I'm cutting liners!Plus it's in sale now...and I felt I didn't get my moneys worth. Though pulling youur range out at 6am wasn't disappointing enough!Plus there is no way to quickly sneak a cupWith as much coffee that's run over I don't expect the heating plate to last very long."
"Right from the start, the valve on the grounds basket did not work properly. About halfway through a brew cycle, the basket would over flow. We tried everything listed in the troubleshooting guide to resolve the problem; nothing worked. One needed to hold the decanter upward to force the valve open enough for coffee to drain.  Then, the valve would be stuck open on occasion, when pouring a cup before the brew cycle was complete. After weeks of ""babysitting"" the coffee maker; we returned it.The replacement worked well for two months, then just like before the valve began malfunctioning.  This is a defective design.  I continue to be disappointed with the quality of Hamilton Beach products; once a reliable brand."
We bought one of these back in feb 2024 and it has been working fine up until this morning. We program it to start making coffee during the week every morning at 6:30am and this morning my wife went downstairs to discover this coffee maker billowing smoke. The smoke smelled of burnt plastic so we threw it away. Mind you we regularly cleaned it and only use it about 5 days a week and make enough coffee for 2 cups each day we use it so it wasn’t being over used.
We’ve cleaned it regularly and still we get grounds in our coffee or it is watery. Has not held up well for the cost.
"I've had this coffee maker for a couple months and wanted to wait to review.  I can confidently say I am very tired of waking up to half a pot of fresh brewed coffee and half a pot of coffee all over my counter and floor.  At least once a week I wake up to this.  It is as if halfway through the brewing cycle, the coffee no longer trickles down from the grounds basket into the pot...the water then overflows the grounds basket and leaves coffee and grounds all over the place.  I don't overfill the grounds basket or use some weird coffee of something that would cause this issue.  And the auto-stop mechanism that should stop the coffee from flowing once the pot is removed does not reliably work.  More times than not, the coffee continues to pour out (during a brew cycle) if you remove the pot to get a cup of coffee while it is brewing.  And for those of you who are thinking that removing the pot during the brew cycle and replacing it is why the grounds basket overflows (such as pot not properly put back correctly), the overflow has never happened in that situation.  So maybe this is just a defective unit, I don't know...but it's a definite waste of money from my standpoint.  The coffee brewed well when it worked properly, but tired of dealing with the mess I wake up to at least once a week."
"We've had a Hamilton Beach coffee maker for over a decade.  Just replaced our old one with this new unit.  I AM NOT A FAN!!!  In the short time that we've owned it, it has leaked all over our counter on 3 occasions, and we've had to clean up grounds that go everywhere within the unit.  Not sure if we got a bad unit, or if it's a poor design, but the carafe has to be forced into place and catch just right, or the coffee leaks everywhere.  I have to double-check it multiple times to ensure that the carafe if rightly placed and not going to leak.  Definitely should be much easier to make coffee than what we've had to go through..."
"A decent product but I've had multiple occasions where only about half of the coffee makes it into the pot. For some reason the rest wound up all over the countertop, making quite a mess. After the first time this happened I now always ensure the pot is centered under the basket and the plunger is pushed up to allow for the brewed coffee to flow. Still overflowed though."
Unable to “sneak a cup” as the spring doesn’t close the basket when pulling the pot out.  This causes the coffee to leak all over.  I’ve tried to fix myself but no luck.  $20 coffee maker would work better.
A little disappointed in this one. The auto stop spring is tight and prevents being able to return the carafe to the hotplate in a graceful motion. I have to wiggle it in or hold the unit while replacing the carafe. I was hoping it would work itself a little loose but 3 weeks later it has not. Already threw out the box so returning doesn't seem viable. Will settle for it I suppose.
"I like the looks of this product, the coffee taste, great, BUT the glass carafe leaks coffee down the front side (from under the plastic rim) when you pour the coffee into your cup. Every time I pour a cup of coffee, I have to use a sponge to wipe coffee off the counter. It has done this from day one and is really irritating. Then, coffee doesn’t stay hot long enough in the cup, and I have to nuke it to heat it up. Another aggravating thing is that the coffee pot does not fit easily back onto the warming plate; I have to fight with the carafe to fit it under the drip basket. Hamilton Beach should send me a new replacement glass carafe for FREE. Actually, I think my particular coffee maker is defective in relation to the issues I mentioned."
"Don’t buy this POS! Unless you enjoy spending your mornings half awake  cleaning up a huge mess. If you get this machine also make sure that you have a tray underneath it so that you don’t flood your entire countertop!This worked just fine when I was using it to only make 7 cups of coffee. When I decided to start making a full pot (since it is a 12 cup coffee maker and all) it started flooding. At first we tried wetting the  paper filters and sticking them to the sides of the basket. We tried a larger grind. We bought a stainless steel  coffee filter . We started making only 10-11 Cups of coffee. Nothing works and of course it is past the window of returning it. If you don’t believe me and really want to try this garbage for yourself; purchase this coffee pot directly from the Hamilton Beach website so that you have some sort of recourse when you realize what a turd it is.If I could give it zero stars, I would. I have had Hamilton Beach coffee makers in the past. There was never anything super special about them but they worked and they did what they were supposed to do. Even though every coffee maker craps out after a year or two, this tops the list of duds.Companies like this should be embarrassed with their product! Imagine how much junk is going into the landfill every year that is just coffee pots that don’t do their job. It’s one of those items that is cheap enough so that when it freaks out on you most people aren’t going to go through the process of getting a replacement with a warranty. But I just wonder how many of these little bastards are going into the landfill every day. Make sure you have a warranty with this if you buy it.From now on I am buying this kind of stuff from Costco so I have a better return window and stop getting screwed out of my money."
"Y’all, I’ve had this coffeemaker less than a year…around 9 months. Within the last week it has started taking significantly longer to brew. I am just not patient enough to wait over 20 minutes for 10 cups of coffee to brew. It started out ok but is petering out. This is actually my second HB coffee maker. I broke the carafe on my other and just went ahead and bought a new one because it wasn’t much more than buying the replacement carafe. It brewed quickly. Idk if I got a dud or what. I contacted HB and they say it is normal for their makers to take 20 minutes to brew 10 cups. I’m going to have to move on to a brand with a little more pep. I need a coffee maker that is ready to perform."
"I had to replace my old coffee maker and decided to get on that wasn’t too cheap but not too expensive either.  I elected to buy this one because I had the brand before.  Overall, it’s pretty much like any other coffee maker.  It’s easy to use, about as easy to clean as any other coffee maker and makes coffee just fine.I am annoyed by few things though.  First, the carafe DOES NOT have markers to show how many cups of water or coffee are in the pot.  Markers show on the picture in the product page, but my pot does not have these markers.  Thus, I have to guess at how much water I am pouring in the coffee maker and have to be careful about it.  Not that big of a deal but a little annoying.The other annoying thing is the pot does not fit quite properly underneath the coffee maker.  I have to slightly force or cajole it in.  There must be a slight manufacturing defect in the one I have as none of the parts fit quite right.Otherwise, it works fine."
Do not buy this coffee maker it kept leaking which I don’t know why. It doesn’t make whole 12 cups of coffee. No good coffee maker I give it only two stars.
"I bought this in June and kept it as a backup until my other Hamilton coffee maker died. The old one finally gave up the ghost after 4 years!This new Hamilton worked well the first few days. Then one morning I noticed coffee grounds all over the machine and counter. The basket wasn't draining. It was over flowing and grounds were spilling out. We got that nightmare cleaned up, and brewed a pot this moring and the same thing happened! The basket not draining, coffee grounds going everywhere!I'm thinking this is a knockoff Hamilton Beach, not a true Hamilton Beach brand."
The first coffee maker I purchased from Amazon broke after two months. Hamilton was happy to send me a brand new replacement and this one brews tasting burnt 8x’s out of 10. It’s constantly saying to clean it but who has time to brew 4-5 pots of vinegar water every month for your coffee maker? I will not purchase this ever again and I do not recommend it. The only positive thing was the customer service for the company that’s why they’re getting two stars.
"You would think 'Hamilton Beach' and think quality and probably be correct most of the time.  I'm a repeat owner, but this one left me underwhelmed.  The spring/plug on the filter basket keeps getting stuff and the water ends up overflowing the filter and making a mess.  Figured this out and once coffee is made ready to program I have to use a knife of something similar to release the plug under the filter basked ready for the morning.  That works 80% of the time.  Still, for $50 I expected more."
"Bought this to replace my mr coffee maker that i had for around 10 years. What iDon't like about this is  you have to pull it forward  all the way to open the lid to the water reservoir. It's opens in the back of  the unit.  Also the front loading coffee filter door swings open unexpectedly  when you place the carafe ,sometimes. The removable  washable filter basket has to be aligned exactly right or it cannot be installed.  Wish I  had not bought this ."
"This is the 6th Hamilton Beach coffee maker I have owned and have been more than happy with the first five....However to say I am disappointed with this one is an understatement!!!  The coffee maker itself takes about 15-20 minutes to brew a full pot of coffee.  The area that holds the filter and grounds is quite small---a regular coffee filter is too large and the small ones have to be purchased...not to mention there is no adding an extra scoop of coffee for the stronger coffee lovers in our house unless, of course, you want coffee grounds in your pot....yuck!  At this point, I want to mention that I am using the same coffee grounds, filter and water as with my previous pot.  The pot itself will NOT come clean!!  After brewing one pot of coffee the pot has a brown film in it that will NOT come clean with hot water, soap and a dish cloth.  I am having to take the steel wool pad to it and still the pot will not come clean.  Hamilton Beach....POOR QUALITY AND DESIGN (typical China junk)."
"This is a pretty good pot. I bought this one because on the front fill feature and that is great!I have two complaints about this coffee pot 1- The basket drip stop is really hard to get the pot back in place. I have to hold the maker with one hand to get the pot back in place. I think it's because the warmer plate is deeply recessed  2- Warmer plate is way too hot, it will burn your coffee in less than an hour and you're dumping it out, if you drink fast, no problem. I can deal with problem one, but the burned coffee may be a deal breaker for me"
"Full disclosure, my review is single-issue agenda.  It's hard to find a coffee maker that doesn't do this, but this one's particularly bad.My persistent issue is this: when you're brewing and overflow the filter, the grounds cause the flow cutoff valve to jam open and spill coffee all over your hotplate and counter when you take the caraffe out.Obviously I shouldn't be overflowing the filter basket, I know.  But a few things:1) It will happen.  And when it does this unit handles it very very badly.2) I like lots of strong coffee, that's not misuse, call me a 'power user'.3) The tiniest bit of grounds cause total valve failure, and when it happens you sometimes can't even see any grounds in the filter carriage, but a rinse-out fixes it.4) There's a 'strong brew' setting, which I think should cause it to flow slower.  Maybe it does, but not slow enough.  I've even tried 3 different filter baskets to find the highest-flow option.  Stil overflows.5) I can make the problem go away with a very very very coarse grind.  Unacceptable.Bottom line: great machine for recovering mormons.  Single recovering mormons.UPDATED: I quickly learned to hate another thing: the shape of the flow-stop button-bobble is such a small orb that it _resists_ you pushing the caraffe back in place, the way small tires hit bumps harder.  This is a huge problem - it's easy to not notice your caraffe sticking out 1/2"".  But if that happens, your flow won't start again, but the maker will keep pumping water into the basket, and it will overflow the sides, with grounds.After a couple flow-overs, the whole thing shorted out - I smelled electrical smoke from the other room, possible fire hazzard.  Apparently the bottom isn't sealed against water.  In a device meant to boil water over an electrical plate.Trash trash trash trash trash."
"Wanted a basic coffee maker.  Got one.  However, every time we pour coffee from the carafe it leaks coffee onto the counter.  Not fun to have to clean a spill before you’ve even had your first morning sip!  Seems strange a coffee maker company hasn’t figured out how to manufacture a carafe with a pouring spout  that doesn’t spill.  Also, it takes approximately 8 minutes to brew 7 cups on regular.  If you want bold, then I suggest you walk your dog fast right after you start brewing, and it should be finished when you get back in 15 minutes.  Of course, I didn’t time the bold setting, I just realized it takes noticeably longer the 2 times I tried that setting.  It’s pretty, and keeps the coffee warm on the hot plate.  All warmers cook the coffee, so we pour it into an old glass lined carafe which keeps it warm.  For 40.00 not bad, but I would probably get a less expensive one next time.  My last coffee maker was 150.00–I didn’t feel it was worth making that kind of investment again."
"There are two screw holes in the reservoir that are covered by a small plastic cap roughly 1/4"" in diameter (see picture). One of these two caps came loose during shipping or unpacking and ended up wedged in the reservoir drain after a single use. The cap fit perfectly within the drain and could not be pulled out with needle nose pliers. The result is that water could not flow from the reservoir to the heating element and pump, and coffee would not brew.To fix it, I used a screwdriver and hammer to knock the cap through the water reservoir drain and into the plastic tube that runs to the heating element. I then had to use a small flathead screwdriver to unscrew the four screws at the base of the unit to expose the plastic tube, detach the tube from the drain, remove the cap from the tube, and then reassemble everything. Coffee maker is working now. Plastic caps went in the garbage.This is a serious design flaw and I would not be surprised if others encounter this exact issue. If those caps are dislodged, the only place they can go is down into the reservoir drain."
"I've ordered this same product twice.  both times the latch holding the water has failed.  The first time it failed about 2 weeks after purchase.  I ordered a replacement, thinking it was just a fluke.  The 2nd one failed just 10 days outside of my amazon return date.  It's too bad, because I love the front access and no one else is really making this."
"I've used worn out, broke machines that work better than this one. And it just keeps getting worse!!It worked fine for the first week (7-10 pots, all on regular brew), then it started to steam off the last cup or two of water. OK Fine, some machines do that. But it's major amounts of steam and no more water going into the carafe. It just progressively got worse! If I tried to make 6 cups of coffee, I'm lucky to get 3. If I make a full pot, I might get 6.  The rest of the water just steams off. I have to add more water during the brew cycle to get a full pot. Switched it to bold brew to see if the programming might be wrong. That worked for about 3 pots, then it started doing the same thing again.Now I have to turn the machine off half way through the cycle to let it cool down for about 10 minutes, then restart it, just to get about 10 cups of coffee. And it's making that gurgling noise that most machines make when it's making the last 1-2 cups of water at the START of the cycle. From when I turn it on and it's full.And this is just the most frustrating parts, not the only thing wrong with the machine. The hot plate can get so hot that the coffee starts to BOIL and there's about 4 cups of coffee in the pot! And if you don't have the carafe EXACTLY positioned, what water that does comes out, goes all over the counter.My biggest mistake, next to ordering this crappy maker, was not reading the reviews before I purchased it. I see it's now been marked down from the $45 I paid for it to $30+. Even at that price, it's still a waste. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. The only thing this maker is good for is target practice!!"
"It makes a decent batch of coffee but it does have some annoying features.The coffee maker has a 1-4 cup setting which is misleading into thinking that it will only brew a small batch for you but it won't stop at 4 cups, it brews all the water you have filled regardless of which setting you select.  The clock face will fog up while it is brewing, and the power cable is very short and may require a extension cable to have it where you like.If these annoyances don't bother you then it isn't a bad coffee maker for the price (Purchased on sale for 47.99USD)"
"First off, I love the Hamilton Beach brand. They have been my go to coffee makers for years (decades). After my last one died a few weeks ago, I automatically decided on the same brand. I really wanted to like this one.Pros: Front filling the water is amazing, and the filter holder seems ok (not sturdy, just ok).Cons: Too hot!! Both my wife and I noticed that the coffee was much hotter than the last one we owned. Scoured everywhere in the manual to see if that is adjustable, but couldn't find a way to do so. Second, the filter holder is not giving me much confidence that it will last. It fits firmly, but it's only got two notches it rests on and it seems like they could break off with the slightest added pressure. Hoping not!For the above reasons, (weighted more by how hot it is), I am dinging three stars."
This is your basic coffee maker. It has a clock and a timer and it makes coffee. The quality of the coffee is proportionate to the quality (and amount) of the coffee you put in the machine.The filter basket seems a bit small and sometimes folds over.It takes a good 20 minutes to brew a full (12-cup) pot.Would I buy it again? Not sure... I guess it's better than a thrift shop coffee maker.( oh I miss my Bunn commercial machine)
"It has a unique design with the front water fill and the swing out basket door, but if that basket door happens to swing out during brewing, you have one big mess, now going to see how long this one will last after the great flood of coffee. Don’t waste your money on this one. No safety feature to stop the water from flowing."
"I’ve owned two of these Hamilton Beach coffee pots. I do love the design with the basket that swings out and I love that I can fill the water from the front. That’s where the love ends. I bought this Hamilton beach coffee pot model a few years ago and we always use the bold setting because we like our coffee strong. Eventually, we found that the coffee pot, using the bold setting, would add too much water to the grounds, causing water and grounds to leak out the side and down the side of the coffee pot and all over the counter. As I had had the coffee pot for a while, I assumed it was just old and time for a new one. I purchased a second coffee pot in January 2022. By March the same thing was happening. Using the bold setting, where water needs to sit in the grounds a little longer to make the coffee strong, the system doesn’t know when to stop adding more water, and the grounds and water escape out the side of the basket. Unfortunately it’s too late to return this one. It’s a flaw in the design. I will have to find another coffee pot that’s capable of brewing a pot of stronger coffee."
"It is a nice idea for both filling up the reservoir and accessing coffee holder, but there were some issue which I didn't like. I used  the coffee maker once to brew 4  cups of coffee. It worked fine but issue that I faced were kinda dealbreaker for me:- it steams up under the swivel basket filter holder which eventually causes to drip inside the carafe housing (the accumulated water gathers around the housing for carafe and ends up sliding back to the warmer plate)- It also splashed some on the side while brewing. It wasn't much but I did not like it (especially since I did not have good like with my previous coffee maker that splashed around and made mess around the machine)- also since the digital control panel is right above the coffee holder basket, it fogs up during brewing coffee which made me worried that it is eventually going to damage the digital control panel (this might be the reason for as some other have mentioned it, the digital panel stops working after a while.I ended up returning it because I didn't want to end up with having a broken machine."
"I like the coffee maker design. Loading the water in the front is a bonus. We bought it in September 22, June 23 the clock would not change time and the auto shut off quit working. It still makes coffee but looking for a new one to avoid a fire hazard."
"I bought this coffee maker because the coffee grounds are put in the front.  If you usually make 4 cups, this is not the best choice.  You cannot pour water directly into the pot and measure it accurately.  You must first put water into the pot, measure,  and then pour it into the coffee maker.  The guide on the side of the pot starts at 4 cups and you cannot see the water rise on the guide.  The other issue --if you get impatient and want to pull out the pot before  it is finished, the coffee drips all over.  It does make a good cup of coffee."
My previous coffee maker (not a Hamilton Beach) lasted forever. This one has not even lasted a year. - bought in January and it’s now November.  I researched and read reviews and thought this would be great. It gave up on us the day after Thanksgiving when I have 4 adults wanting coffee. Very disappointed.
"2 years ago, I purchased a Hamilton Beach programmable coffee maker, and it worked great until It got old. I wanted to purchase the same kind, but was told that it had a defect before shipping. I have Prime and waited one week before I got that news. I had the choice for a refund or something else. I choose another Hamilton coffee maker and got it in 2 days, but it has a defect because the door won't stay shut and I have to tape it. This was during Prime day. I ordered the coffee pot on the 3rd of August, choose another coffee pot and got it on the 8th of August, and found out that it's defected too. I tape that coffee pot shut every time I want to use it now."
"The coffee maker makes coffee. No difference with any other coffee maker, really. My issue is the carafe. I have had a lot of coffee makers in my 50+ years and never had such an aggravating pot. Pouring coffee into a cup, make sure to have something underneath like a towel. By the time you get a cup-worth of coffee in the cup, you'll have a half cup on your counter. Pouring water from the carafe into the machine is the same; huge puddle of water on the counter from it running along to the bottom of the carafe. Places me in a foul mood before I get a cup of coffee to enjoy.This is not just me being a grumpy old man, however. Read any of my other reviews on Amazon. I almost always leave good reviews."
"Attractive, nothing extra you don't really need, makes decent coffee.  BUT:I was replacing a much-loved Braun Aromaster, so was looking for a basic coffeemaker, preferably by a respected manufacturer.  This Krups is similarly simple,  but is awkward to use.1.  The coffee carafe is shaped such that pouring from it requires me to tip it way over, practically upside down, to get all the coffee out of the carafe.  Mildly inconvenient when pouring a cup of coffee.2.  However, VERY inconvenient when filling the small opening where the water reservoir is located, as the lid to the combined reservoir and coffee grounds area doesn't flip back far enough to let me empty the carafe of water into the reservoir.  I 'solved' that by measuring the water amount and putting it into another container which I use to fill the reservoir.  It's an annoying step to have to take when Krups so easily could have avoided this by designing its lid to flip all the way back down.3.  The power button:  its location is to the left side of the machine where no one will see it and remember to turn off the machine (which will happen automatically in ONE hour...but still...)  One fills the machine with water on the Right side, or when finished with the machine, would likely place it on the counter with the front showing.  NOT the left.  This means that I am constantly repositioning the device.4.  It does make decent coffee, but not so outstanding that I wouldn't return it, but repacking it for return would be difficult to have replicated the packing process.DON'T BUY IT.  IT'S PRETTY BUT IT'S A PAIN."
"I REALLY wanted to like this, and I did like a lot of things about it...the small footprint, the cone filter (my preference) and it made a very smooth cup of coffee.  However, it was nowhere near hot enough for me.  Some people suggested leaving it on the warmer for a few minutes, which did help a bit, I also ran the carafe and my coffee mug under hot water before brewing and that helped some…but not enough, and honestly, I don’t want to have to do that much work for a cup of coffee.  The temperature in the carafe was 166 or so, versus the Capresso Single Serve at 179, and the Cuisinart 5 cup at 180.  The 166 may be enough if you drink your coffee black, but for me and the amount of cream I add, it was lukewarm. Overall, I prefer the Cuisinart 5 cup, and even though it has a bigger footprint and is a bit more expensive, it also has a cone filter, makes a much hotter cup of coffee, and has auto shut off."
"The lid doesn't stay open. Adding water and coffee has to be done through the top, so one hand always has to be used to keep it open, which is a real pain. It's hard to pour the water into the back of the unit because the lid doesn't move out of the way. Spilling water on the counter while filling is very hard to avoid.It also percolates the water to the grounds too quickly, and the result is, to my taste, weak coffee. I do a couple of pour-overs from the carafe after the brewing, and that brings the strength up, but I shouldn't have to.The force of the percolated water also blasts a small amount of the grounds out of the basket, some of which end up in the water reservoir, and on the ledge surrounding the filter basket. How are we supposed to clean it without getting the electrical components wet? I sent a message to KRUPS Customer Service, but have not received a reply, so that's a waste of time.Disappointed, as I thought that KRUPS was a good brand. It seems like this was designed and approved for production by someone who never actually made coffee with it.  I'm going to return it."
"I'm surprised that any coffee makers are still made without automatic shut off's but this one doesn't come with one (Didn't claim to have one but I had just assumed they all must).  Also the top only opens 90 degrees, so if you use the carafe to fill the water, you can't empty it all the way because the top is in the way.  And not that it matters much, but we're still laughing about the measuring spoon.  The handle is about 1-1/2 inches long (yes, I said inches) so if the canister that your coffee is stored in is anything but full to the top, you won't be able to reach the ground coffee because the handle is so short. Makes coffee fine but I guess overall I expected more from Krups."
"I work from home several days a week and had a small Gevalia coffee maker that I used for years. It was just about perfect! If I filled it to the maximum I could get 2 full mugs of coffee and maybe an extra 1/2 cup to top off the cups with. When that coffee maker finally needed to be replaced I looked for another small coffee maker to replace it.I wanted a coffee maker that used #2 cones, and I use those also for pour over coffee and prefer to use paper filters over the reusable filter the machine comes with. But I also wanted a coffee maker that didn't shut off after an hour or two. I make a pot of coffee when I first get up but sometimes don't get to a second cup until a few hours later.The Krups fit the bill! And, with a slightly larger capacity I can get 3 full mugs of coffee! It's as basic and as simple as it gets. You add water, coffee, and turn the machine on and it does the rest. The only thing that you have to remember is there is no auto shut-off, so you do need to manually shut the machine off when you've emptied the pot or no longer want to drink coffee.My only complaint is to add the water and coffee you have to flip up the lid on top. At first, the lid would stay open but now after just a few months of use the lid refuses to stay open and I have to hold it up while I add coffee and pour in the water. I have resulted to using a bread clip that I use to wedge into the lid to prop it open, which doesn't take away from the function of the machine but it is annoying."
"I read a lot of reviews before purchasing a new coffee maker.  This one is just OK.  The shape of the carafe and the small fill hole makes it difficult to get the water in.  The lid of the maker is not removable and the pot hits it before all water is out.  I always had spilled water or water left in the pot.  The gauge that shows how much water is in, is not clear plastic but gray and i is difficult to see the water.  I ended up using a large cup to fill the pot.  I found this pot very inconvenient.  I did not return it but got fed up after a year and purchased a Ninja which has a removeable water reservoir.  It has markings, you take it off, fill it up, and replace.  Simple.  No mess.  Do not have to remove from under cabinet to fill."
"For some time, (since April, 2024), this has been a great coffee maker. It keeps the coffee hot, and does not have ton of electronics to malfunction. It is the end of November (7 months later), and the Krups won't work. The heating element just won't get hot. I switched from a Ninja to a Krups. Both good name coffee machines. But, it is disappointing the the Krups petered our before a year. The Ninja lasted almost 5 years before that went. Now I need a new coffee pot. I will do more research this time. Is nothing made well and to last anymore? I must search and research to again make my sacred morning cup of brown joy. (Sigh!!!)"
"The shape of pot and the lid of the coffee maker cause spills when filling. The lid of the coffee maker gets in the way of pouring the water into the reservoir. The shape of the pot makes it so you need to turn it almost completely upside down to empty it. Photo shows just how far you need to turn it to empty it, about 140°. The design could have definitely been better. The auto shut off is also annoying."
This maker is good because it can stay on for up to 4 hours and can be programmed. But the programming process is challenging. Same for the bold coffee process. You will want to set to boldest because this machine makes weak coffee. It also does not keep very hot and I found no option to make hotter
"This is a good although relatively expensive solution for someone who basically drinks coffee to get out the door  in the morning, as a simple ground coffee brewer. My major complaint is that it would take almost nothing to improve, such as making the hinge a tiny bit bigger so the lid lifts up and stays, in order to add coffee or to let it dry out after use, instead of flapping down in the way. It is also somewhat of a challenge to fill the water tank because of the tight fit. Anyhow, these annoying but readily fixable issues cause me to post this, more in hopes that Krups modifies its product to make it more workable."
After using this project less than one week the top would no longer remain open on its own which required me to hold it as I poured the water. The water opening is very small making it difficult to pour without spilling. I returned this product.
I have limited counter space and broke my little Mr Coffee - I thought this might be an upgrade. It’s not. You have to manually hold the lid up and manually turn it off or it will stay on and burn the bottom of the pot. It also makes a loud hissing noise. Get yourself a Mr Coffee instead.
"I like the size of this coffee maker, and it's great for single serve use. A month after I got it, the lid to the coffee maker lost its ability to stay open, and then last week part of the carafe lid broke. It's also really hard to pour all of the water in to the maker from the carafe because of the way it's designed. So, decent product for the price, but cheaply made and I doubt it will last very long."
"Unlike its big brother that I had before, the smaller size of this one make refilling the water tank a bit difficult without spilling some water or using a funnel.  It is to easy for the top lid to fall down unexpectantly."
"I like the style, size and simplicity of the coffee pot.  However, the ""hot plate"" began rusting shortly after purchasing which was about six months ago.  I was careful to wipe up any drips or spills so the rust was surprising.  The pot is made of very thin glass as well."
"I purchased this coffeemaker in early October, 2023. It was fine, did what we needed it to do, fit nicely on the countertop in our small kitchen. It served us well...for one year.But three weeks after the one year anniversary, the hot plate stopped working.  Now another week has passed, and it just quit mid-brew.So here I am, ordering a new coffeemaker. But not a Krups."
"We have had Krups coffee makers for many years and incorrectly assumed that this latest iteration would continue using common #4 cone filters. The  10 cup version still seems to, but we needed a 12 cup, so I marked that. None of the pictures associated with the 12 cup showed the change to flat bottom filters. The 10 cup version shows the basket and #4 filters which lead me to unfortunately think the 12 did too.  Would help to update page to make clear the distinction.We have always disliked coffee from flat bottom filter style makers, so we are having to move to Cuisinart to find a 12 cup with #4 cone style filters. Hope the DC-1200P1 works as well as our old Krups."
"overall this was just what I was looking for but there is a design flaw in the carafe such that no  matter what 100% of the time when  you go to pour the water/coffee from the carafe it spreads all around the carafe and spills vs. coming out of the spout. I just do all the pouring over my kitchen sink, but it's a pain. Also the top flap does not stay open on its own, so you have to have two hands available to pour the water in the maker to start your coffee. Not great."
Positives - 1) Overall makes good coffee. 2) Has reusable filter. Negatives - 1) The lid does not stay up when adding water or coffee fixings. Lid tilts slightly forward. 2) The area you add the water is very small and the lid gets in the way when adding the water. Hard to pour the complete pot into the water area.
"I’m disappointed in this coffee maker. It requires two hands to fill the water dispenser, one to hold the lid up and another to pour the water. Ridiculous."
"I loved how compact this coffee maker was. Made a great cup of coffee, sadly it only lasted 13 months."
"The pot holds 72 ounces, which is 12 cups (6 oz ea), 14 or 100 depending on your definition of cup size.After 10 months, once a day use the plastic handle on the carafe failed where it clips onto the top lip, spilling all over the place. It seems there are no replacement carafes."
"Not a great coffee pot, it drips a lot into the hot plate when you remove the pot.The lid will also not stay up when trying to load it with water and coffee.It feels a little cheap, but for the money I guess it's ok, maybe a 3 star, purely in cost, I'm about to get rid of mine as the issues I mentioned are getting on my nerves."
Really annoying that the lid won’t stay open while you are filling the water and coffee grounds
"Poorly made, not what you would expect from Krups!"
The best thing about this coffee maker is that it is pretty fast so you'll have your cup in just a couple of minutes. The annoying thing is the top won't stay open on its own so it's awkward adding water and getting the filter in place. It does drip once the carafe is removed making the warmer get gross fast so I'm constantly cleaning it.It's annoying enough that I'm buying a new maker but good enough (and small enough) that I'm going to designate this one as my travel maker for those weekend getaways since I refuse to use motel room coffee machines.
"It's big, it's belongs in an office. I don't feel the coffee maker. Don't be fooled by a German name. It's made in Mexico with Chinese components. I still would of preferred a manual on and off switch!  And turn it off when I need to. Not wait two hours after brewing. For the automatic shut off to kick in. I never used it! Beautiful looking but not practical."
"I am very particular about my coffee flavor.  For years I have boiled the water, ground the beans and poured boiling water slowly over the beans, just a little water at a time, to make the most delicious cup of coffee.  I wanted to make life more simple and keep coffee warm longer so ordered the KRUPS.  The coffee tastes burnt and tastes even more so after sitting in the carafe for 10-15 mins.  Coffee sediment collects around the top of the filter area and in the area below the filter and it is hard to clean The lid to the maker doesn't flip backwards very far and so it is hard to pour water from the carafe into the water tank. I will go back to my old way of making coffee even though it takes longer."
"First, there's nothing that's WRONG with this coffee maker other than it's kind of expensive for a very simple machine with a single button to turn it on or off.There are minor issues that I find irritating but I can live with them.  One is it's SO compact that the basket that you put the filter into doesn't lock into place.  It relies on the top lid being shut to put downward pressure to force it down into place.  Next, if you shut the lid before putting the carafe into place, you have to use some pressure to push the carafe into place and while this supposedly won't hurt anything I wonder if over time, because of how much this coffee maker relies on pressure to keep everything in place, that something goes wrong, like plastic wears out, or while fidgeting to get things in place you bump the carafe into something, etc......  And the carafe lid is flimsy, and I have to hold it out of the way when putting water into the carafe and that's a little irritating, and then add that to the carafe is VERY compact, barely holding 10 cups, and it's short, so handling it isn't like handling a taller carafe which to me is easier to hold and pour from.And last, the heater plate is too hot.  If you brew a pot of coffee with 2 - 5 cups, this thing will start to burn the coffee after only 15 minutes of sitting on the heating plate.  It's also scalding hot coffee, still burning the inside of the mouth trying to drink it.  So, you have to be there at the end of the brewing and within 5 minutes after it's brewed turn the coffee maker off.  This is the first time I've had to deal with this and that's simply the plate is too hot.I'm going to keep it and use it mainly because coffee pots are now a ridiculous price and I don't want to have to try to find another one, but I will say that for something that's cheap and compact, I like this one the least of anything I've ever had in the past, which also cost about 1/2 as much.  And to be clear I mean it's hard to find a cone filter coffee pot that's inexpensive.  I don't like the basket filter because they aren't good at making 2 - 4 cups and you need to use more coffee grounds and the brew isn't consistent.  So for now I'm stuck with something I really don't want to use but I can at least deal with it.It DOES make hot coffee, so it does its job."
"The coffee maker works just fine the coffee is very good,and its very simple to use. the only issue is the ring around the warming plate that holds down the warming plate is broken, i dont know if it was mishandled and broken or already broken when packaged. But either way it is broken, it might cause an issue later on if it gets worse but for now its not causing an issue. I dont know if this is a one time thing or an ongoing one. But i just thought you should be made aware of it. Thank you!"
"This is more like the little coffeemakers one used to see in hotels. It’s a smaller carafe,  kind  of flimsy, and turns itself off after a short amount of time, like a half hour or so (I haven’t timed it).  It’s not bad, but if I were going to buy it again I would invest in a larger cuisinart coffe pot. When I operate something first thing in the morning, (when I’m not fully awake) the flimsy quality leaves a bad impression, as it seems easily breakable. The glass pot seems easily breakable, and it’s kind of hard to pour the water out of it into the maker."
the lid did not stay up by itself when trying to fill the coffeepot with water for brewing....made it very hard to fill by oneself.....returning it to Amazon and just purchased a Black and Decker coffeepot ....should be here in a few days
"price is good.  makes good coffee.  gotta be careful putting water in because water reservoir is tucked into the back and it's easy to miss (when you're justing waking up).  wish that top popped off to facilitate washing.  Shape of the spout is not sleek, so I'm thinking the spout is going to break easily...  Had a Braun for 30 years - still works but cannot get a replacement carafe!"
"While this coffee maker is nice enough, apparently I didn’t read the description well enough. It doesn’t have an automatic shutoff, so I have to turn it off when we are through drinking our coffee."
"In looking for a small (4-5 cup) coffee maker, I read the reviews. I did the research. I went with this small Krups because of Krups reputation and the overall glowing reviews.The coffee does taste good but it's frustrating to get there. The lid doesn't want to stay open. I'm afraid I'm going to break it if I try to force it. Once I do get it to stay up, any condensation on the lid leaks down the back.I like the lines on the side of the carafe that shows to get 5 cups of coffee, really 2 mugs, fill the water to X line. But when it's that full, the water does not pour well out of the carafe into the pot reservoir. It leaks down the side of the carafe on the counter. And it does the same when trying to pour hot coffee into a cup when it's done. If I pour slow, the hot steam comes through the lid and burns my thumb. Oh, and as it's finishing the brew cycle it is LOUD.These are really small frustrations in life, but it is a lot to deal with when just trying to get a cup of coffee.But the coffee tastes great!"
"Makes great coffee BUT,  lid to reservoir needs to open wider so you can actually fill it without pouring water all over the counter and coffee maker. Second problem, it is the slowest 5 cup coffee maker I have ever used. I have owned 12 cup makers that made a pot in 40% less time than this does. It is too bottom light, put some weight in the base, I have drug it halfway across the counter trying to get the carafe off the heated plate, it’s a two hand operation, one to hold the pot and the other to pull carafe out of brewer."
"Great little machine, loved it until I realized, immediately, a 5 cup carafe is not 40 ounces as expected. Returned for a 10 cup machine which requires a measure of 8 cups to get 40 ounces....Other than that if you want a simple, easy coffee marker it's a good value and I recommend it..."
"I bought this to replace a Krups 4 cup coffee maker I had had for over 20 years.  It was tiny, compact and made great coffee.  I had no idea the coffee maker you use could make such a difference.  But it does.  I bought this in September, it is now December, and I have yet to make a really great cup of coffee.  It never taste strong enough.  I don't really know how they could mess up something so simple as brewing a cup of coffee, but they have.  Too late to send it back, but if I could, I would."
"Dont think you can get a cup of coffee before all the water has passed throught the brew basket.  The auto drip free thing does not seal up if you pull the pot out while the maker is still pumping and burping the last 1/4 ounce of water.I normally start the pot, keep busy and come back after the brew is complete and get my cup ... no problem.  But if you are standing there waiting and think you can get a quick cup when it is nearly finished brewing you would be mistaken.  The coffee keeps streaming after the pot is removed, onto the hot plate and then on to the light colored counter top which creates the typical mess you thought you would aviod with a new coffee maker.The coffee it does make, is good / fine."
"Do not recommend this coffee maker.  I have been using this daily for about 6 months.  After about one month, the lid that needs to be opened to add water stopped staying open.  It falls constantly while I’m adding water into the reservoir or adding my coffee grounds.  It is super cheap plastic.  I have owned many Krups products and about 4 Krups coffee makers.  They must be cutting costs by using cheap material.  Also, the design is flawed.  The lid does not fold back all the way and it’s difficult to pour the fresh water from the pot into the reservoir.  When pouring water or a fresh cup of coffee, the carafe drips all over.  It’s frustrating and I cuss Krups out daily, but I missed the return window.  Don’t be me."
"I read a lot of reviews about small coffee makers at Amazon before I made this purchase and my first cup was less than satisfying. For the record, I am using the same coffee beans, ground to the same texture, that I have been using for several years.I've been drinking coffee since I was 12 and 2 days ago I got my last cup of coffee out of a Mellita 4-cup coffee maker that I bought in 1981 (42 years and a couple of weeks old). That machine brewed the best cup of coffee I have had since the old siphon coffee maker that my parents had back in the early 1960's. The cup I am currently drinking (first one out of this new machine) doesn't hold a candle to that old Mellita. The coffee is weak and lacking in a robust and complex flavor of a slow brew,and therein lies the problem.Coffee should be brewed slowly and gently. That old Mellita machine would take between 10 and 12 minutes to brew a pot, and the resulting coffee was rich and full-bodied with a complex depth that encouraged one to ""roll it around"" in the mouth. This Krups machine brews a pot in under 6 minutes and the grounds are simply not exposed to the hot water long enough to surrender all of the flavor locked inside. I realize that most Americans are in a hurry to do everything, but good coffee takes time.On the plus side,the Krups coffee maker brews 5 standard cups of coffee (5 oz. according to the Specialty Coffee Association and the International Coffee Organization).It is easy to clean.It is very easy to use.Its small footprint makes it easy to store.The down side,Weak, anemic flavor. Better than McDonalds but just barely.If all you really want is your morning caffeine fix before your rush out the door then this machine will probably do the trick, but if you have been drinking good coffee for as long as I have your are probably going to be disappointed."
"Everything was pretty good with this Krups 5 cup coffee maker except the taste of the coffee....weak, water-y and not good at all. Used the little scoop they supply you with and it was terrible. Used the 5 cup measurement as I brew 2 cups, too. Had to pour out the first pot and make it again...using a real tablespoon for the coffee and it was better, but certainly not good. Kind of disappointed because it is a great size, nice-looking and fits well on my counter and it got good reviews. Hopefully, it will become ""seasoned"" and the coffee will be better...eventually. It is my morning coffee and I need it! LOL!Oh and if you watch the video, the guy says if you want to use coffee filters instead of just the filter they give you, you should use #2 cone filters...UMmmm,no. The #2 are way, way too big and when I got them I had to cut them down .  It did help the taste of the coffee though. Not happy with this item and would not recommend IF you enjoy a GOOD cup of joe."
"Recently tried this coffee pot for a week. In a nutshell, I am sending it back and I do not recommend it! Following are the pros and cons:PROS:-is quiet when making coffee-Pause feature is nice and easy to sneak a cup-Does not drip or leak from middle spout where carafe meets top portion of coffee maker.CONS (mostly):- Coffee maker continues to produce a severe/heavy/disgusting burnt plastic smell, even two weeks later. The first few days were really bad, seemed to dissipated a little after a few days but still smelled and tasted like burnt plastic with each use! Not fun to smell and not fun to taste each time!-Most recently when using, the water from top of carafe all of a sudden  started leaking very badly all along side of coffee pot, then all of the coffee grains started pouring out over the side with water. In a nutshell, it was a massive exploding coffee grain mess that I had to clean up for an hour after making a pot of coffee! See attached photos for the mess this coffee maker made!-Plastic lid on top of glass carafe is very cheap feeling, for a $40 product, this feels like a dollar lid! Also the top plastic ware are you open to pour the water in also feels cheap.-Can’t believe Krups charges $40 for this rather cheap-feeling and leaking coffee pot!- I do not recommend this product, already sent it back!"
Kinda chinsie...feel cheap...makes a darn good cup of coffee...but for the money EH!..sorry to whoever I just told it didn't last a year...just got it!! Was thinking of the one I replaced
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I did my research, and I even asked the company I order coffee from if they had any recommendations. While they did not recommend this specific coffee maker, they did tell me that this one was well known, and that I should definitely try it.Try it, I did! I’m disappointed in how Amazon delivered. I saved $20 by ordering a product that said it might have slight damage to the box. Slight? It literally came in its original box. They didn’t even put the item ( glass ) safely in another package. This is probably one of the reasons why I’m having some problems with the coffee maker working sufficiently, but that’s not my reason for this post.The main reason I am posting this as you will see in my video, is to show you how super inconvenient preparing coffee is. My greatest joy is waking up in the morning to make my coffee, but over the last few days using this coffee maker I have honestly dreaded making my coffee. Water always spills, and I find myself cleaning as I’m trying to get ready in the morning. It’s just poorly made. Watch my video for reference, and the whole thing is plastic inside. The water reservoir is so tiny, and impossible to pour all of your water into without spilling. Prior to this purchase I had a $20 Mr. coffee and it was better working than this. Much easier, and less hassle. Only reason I replaced it is because after many years it broke.I will be returning this and trying something else out."
"This product does make pretty good coffee. No complaints there. However, immediately after I purchased it, I noticed that when setting the clock or programming the start time, the ""minute"" button functioned sporadically. Not a huge deal, but it did foreshadow what would occur later. About a year and a half after I purchased this coffee pot, the LED screen begin malfunctioning. Some of the Light Elements no longer work and some appear to work only sometimes. This makes it almost impossible to program the coffee pot, which is a key feature for me. I would not recommend this product until they fix that item. If you just want good coffee with no programmed start time, the product works great."
Coffee stays hot and it’s perfect for one person. It’s a bit difficult to put the water in. I have to tip it backwards to pir the water in. But its ok.
I think the “power on lighted switch” would be better off mounted on the front of the coffee machine. I’ve left this machine on numerous times because that lighted switch is mounted towards the rear. Now i have a timer plugged in the outlet and problem solved.
"This is my second one, it works very well. The top to the maker is very tight and my wife managed to crack one of the connection points on the fifth day we had it. I would say that this needs to be built  to be a little easier to open.So, I will enjoy the next couple years of use with a broken top apparently because the customer support appears to be a maze."
Works fine but I had to replace the carafe when it broke off the lip by barely bumping a coffee cup. And Krups doesn’t sell replacement carafes for this model! Ended up searching other brands and found basically an identical carafe for half the price of a completely new Krups unit. So I replaced the carafe and now I’m storing a backup brand X coffee maker.
"I purchased this coffee pot I had to send it back ,it did not make hot coffee the coffee did not have a great taste because it was not hot enough, for me I love my coffee very hot I even tried two different coffee 's So if you like a good and hot cup of coffee this coffee pot will not be for you Thank you"
"Love that is so slim, but I am having trouble putting the water in the top"
"I had purchased this coffee maker to brew small pots of coffee through the day, without brewing a pot large enough to cook before I could finish it. It's low profile was also highly desired, as a bulky coffee maker just doesn't blend - pardon the pun - with the look of my kitchen. This was an ideal solution, and the Krups brand had been imbued as a high-quality and reliable espresso machine, which my partner had used for years. When I bought this machine, I was delighted that it heated the water properly and brewed fairly quickly, yet slowly enough for that properly-heated water to release the flavor of the ground coffee in the basket. I grew to like this coffee maker. Then the device simply stopped. A pot of coffee was brewed one day, as usual, then another. Then it just stopped working. The warmer did not get warm, the brew cycle never started. The power light comes on. That is all. And that IS all. It lasted about 17 months."
Hard to fill for me
Takes about 10 minutes to make a pot. Good flavor unless you like strong coffee. I use fresh ground beans and cold filtered water. Temperature of the final brew is 170. I will keep for now but will replace with a different maker. This one got decent reviews and was inexpensive.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is for the Krups 5-cup coffee maker.The bad: Cheap plastic. Will probably not last. Hard closing cover with tiny little plastic latches (see photos above). Counter gets very hot when it is on. I leave it on for hours and the counter is super hot underneathThe Good: One simple on/off switch. No auto-off. Great for people who want the pot on all day.More Bad: Pouring the coffee sometimes leaves drips off the spout—see video. Pour carefully and slowly and do it over the sink or counter. Definitely not at the table when the carafe is full. The filter gets stained easily and seems very thin fabric—not metal. First photo of the filter is after one pot of coffee and after soaking in bleach water for 5 min. Second photo of the filter is after 3 days of daily use and daily washing. The fabric filter is already stretching and about to tear.Verdict:  I would not recommend this model.Counter Verdict: It is a good size and a low price. Get it if you are on a real budget and don’t care about replacing the thing you just bought with another thing shortly after buying it (i.e. you hate someone so you give this as a gift, or you like throwing away money because you have to keep buying this thing over and over again since it won’t last long.I had more videos to post but Amazon only allows one short video. Ugh. I may have to post on YouTube so you can really see how bad it is. Although, tbh, I am using it since…ooopsies…no return on items that you have used….so I will have to buy another coffee maker to replace the one I just bought and I’m not ready to do that just yet….so I use it, it drips, it doesn’t taste great, but it tastes better than the one that it replaces."
"It brews coffee well, but cleaning the coffee pot is not very easy. My old krups coffee maker was much better designed and easier to clean."
"This coffee maker doesn't have an auto shut-off.  Surprised as it is a Krups.  Otherwise, it is ok."
"This coffee maker works well but the lid does not want to stay up/open to allow for filling the filter with coffee.  When using the ""reusable filter"" it's hard to take out the filter cone after brewing without making a mess.  Paper filters are cleaner to use."
I would have expected more from a brand like Krupa.  The design of this coffee maker is far from my expectations.  You cannot pour your water into the small water reservoir without making a mess on your countertop.  I would vie for a different brand altogether.
"Review Update 7/28/2022 - Well, the original coffee maker I ordered 1/7/21 died a couple weeks ago.  Decided I liked the Krups a lot, so I ordered another.  However, the old one may have burned out because I leave it on for 6 hours a day.  It takes me that long to drink 3 cups of coffee, but that means I get 2 cold cups of coffee everyday with other coffee makers.  This one doesn't have autoshutoff, and I like that.  I also like that it is a little bigger than the other minis.  These things should last more than 18 months, however.  Restaurants leave their burners on all day, every day.  So, time will tell with the second one, and I have a backup carafe now for the day I forget it's in the dish drainer when I chuck a pasta boiler in.I drink a little coffee throughout the day.  Unlike other coffee makers, it doesn't decide when to shut off.  Now, at my age, I have all the cognition of a jellyfish.  However, I do manage to remember to shut the thing off when I empty the pot.  I also like the removable basket.  No more coffee filters.  And it's just a little larger than usual.  Timer might be nice, but at my age, I can barely remember I made coffee 10 minutes ago, must less the night before.  Only disadvantage, when the pot is too full of coffee, only some of it pours into the cup.  But if you pour over the sink, you don't have to clean the counter."
Chinese made—why pay extra for a German “name”?
"I think advertising this as a 14 cup pot is miss leading. I started investigating after using it and running out of coffee much earlier in the AM than we were used to. A standard cup of coffee in the US is considered to be 5-6 ounces so even at the lower end of 5 ounces a 14 cup pot would hold 70 ounces which converts to 2.07 liters. If you read the write up on this pot it states it is 1.7 liters which is 60 ounces. One side of this pot has 12 cup markings and the opposite side has 14 cup markings at the same height on the pot. (not shown in the pictures on the site) The box states with an asterisk '14 cups of 4.33fl oz. This is significantly less than what most brands of coffee makers consider a cup of coffee. None of the pictures on Amazon show the 4.33 fl oz. Even if it did you would really have to investigate to find out it is really just a 12 cup pot. The coffee is good, the pot pours pretty well if you go slow with a full pot and the first cup. Bottom line though if you really want a 14 cup pot, which I did, you may be disappointed."
"This coffeemaker does not have any BELLS AND WHISTLES. It has one button to start or stop the coffeemaker. A positive feature is that this 10-cup coffeemaker does have a small LATERAL footprint, being barely wider than my Mr. Coffee 5-cup coffeemaker. As others have pointed out, the area where you pour the water into the resevoir is small. Also, the measuring gauge is on the left side of the coffeemaker ( as you face it). This means placement of the coffeemaker has to be considered. My little Mr. Coffee has a gauge on BOTH sides. The on/off button is also on the left side, but would be better in the front, like the Mr. Coffee. The price is this Krups is rather steep.Another thing is that, like many coffeemakers, this one does not heat the water to the highest temperature to extract the best flavor from the coffee. I have read a couple of times that some people actually heat water for coffeemakers in order to get the best flavor and essence of the coffee. Of course, this defeats the purpose of an AUTOMATIC COFFEEMAKER. But I've done it for years in the past because I want coffee hot enough to BURN THE HAIR OFF YOUR TONGUE, even if restaurant drive-thru lines do not, for liability reasons."
Everything about this coffee maker works really well and is very simple except for the fact that the temperature of the warming plate on the bottom is too hot. I can't keep the coffee on the warming plate for more than about 10 minutes before my coffee starts to burn. This is very frustrating and forces me to shut off the coffee almost immediately after it's brewed.
"Coffee pot is nice and small, brews pretty fast and coffee tastes just fine. That said maybe I'm a little picky but the top lid does not stay back so you can load the grounds. You have to push it back just right and maybe it will stay back. I usually have to do it 4,5 times and first thing in the morning it's a bit annoying. The other thing is to be very careful pulling the pot out when full or even after poring first cup putting it back in as coffee spills over as the basket is tight. Going to remove basket after brewing from now on so that should no longer be an issue. Dave E."
Does NOT have auto shut off.
I bought this for the 2nd cup and it just burns the coffee.  A second cup ends up hotter than the first cup.  The pot warming heating element is just too intense.  It needs to keep it warm not scalding hot.
"I can't pour a cup of coffee without it dripping all over the counter.  It's not a broken carafe, either.  it's just got a very poorly designed spout.  It's insane, quite honestly.  Every time I pour a cup, regardless of how slowe I pour, it drips.  If you like cleaning your countertop each time you want coffee, be my guest."
"The carafe has markings on two sides, one goes up to 12 cups and the other goes up to 14 cups.  When I fill the carafe up to the 12 cup level, the other side shows less than 12 cups, even when I rotate the carafe 180 degrees so when looking at the carafe, I am seeing it from the same view.  The Coffee maker also shows the 12 cups level when filling up the water, but it also has 12 cups as the max water level, so I am not sure how to make 14 cups.  In the pictures, it looks like they printed the cups using the top measurement as if they were both the same number.Also, the carafe has a tube in the middle where the coffee is supposed to flow from the coffee maker into the carafe.  This tube makes it difficult to fill the carafe with water.  It either is in the way, or it causes the lid to close.  The instructions are a little difficult to follow.  There is a section for English with pages of warning and then it goes into French and Spanish.  If you keep paging through you then get to the instructions on how to use the coffee maker.  Seems to me that it would make more sense to keep all the English information in one section and all the French in another etc., instead of making the user page through the whole manual to find the directions.I make 12 cups of coffee every day, I have been using the Amazon Basics filter, but I see the grounds getting to the top of the filter after brewing the coffee, so I'm not sure I could even make 14 cups of coffee without it overflowing.I would opt for a 12 cup coffee maker over this 14 cup if I had to do it all over.Update on the carafe. I contacted Krups and they said they would send a replacement carafe.  I have not received this.I called back and was told that the coffee maker is a 12 cup US and 14 Cup European coffee maker.I do not recommend this product or company"
"We used to love Krups coffee makers, and have been loyal to Krups for years-- we especially loved the Aroma brewers -- but when our last machine died (the carafe warmer rusted) and we bought this, what a disappointment! First of all, the carafe lid is not removable and it has a long piece of plastic stuck in the middle for some unfathomable reason, so when you try to pour water in to the machine it goes all over the place (it doesn't help that there's also a huge piece of plastic stuck in the middle of the machine as well). Secondly, it uses a basket filter, not a cone filter, which affects the taste dramatically. The coffee tastes almost sour-- it lacks the depth of flavor of previous Krups machines, even when set to the boldest setting. I bought the new Cuisinart instead and it makes coffee that tastes more like the coffee from the old Krups machines, with a rich, bold aroma. I'm returning this Krups."
"After my Mr. Coffee drip coffee maker died after many years of regular use I gave this one a try.There were a few problems that have resulted in me donating this one to Good Will.On the positive side it has a reusable mesh coffee basket.  It is simple with just an off-on switch and an auto-off feature after 2 hours.  (I don't need or want the time display or other ""bells and whistles"" features.)On the negative side.  The opening at the back of the unit next to the lid is strangely narrow which made it tricky to pour water in.  I tried pouring water from the front and sides and ended up spilling some every time and could not completely empty water from the pot.  At 5:00 in the morning this was just annoying.Without telling her about this,  I asked a friend to make a pot of coffee when she came over and she had the same problem.So, back to Mr. Coffee."
"It’s all automatic and the coffee, despite being an excellent type, does not taste as good as it could.  I should have bought a better coffee maker. 😕"
This coffee maker is very small and flimsy and after a couple uses a corner of the plastic lid broke off.  The top lid were you loaded the coffee and water doesn't stay up by itself.  Very poorly made.
"I thought Krups was a better brand, but this is a flimsy lightweight coffee maker like one you find in a hotel except it's 10 cups instead of 4.The carafe is thin and the handle feels like it's going to just fall off. I bought this because it was a no frills maker. Didn't need all the settings and thought I was getting a featureless but solid coffee maker which wasn't the case. The price is cheap I guess for our current economy, but would spend more and get a different brand. I might return it.It functions and makes coffee just fine, has a single button to start. It has an auto-shutoff, but it's pretty short duration, about an hour. I'm WFH and it was off before my second cup. It got 3 stars only because of the low price. Any higher price and the star rating would be lower."
"Purchased this to replace a 10 year old Krups, which actually still worked and had more features.  Liked the simpler design of the new model, especially lack of a clock and auto-on which we no longer need.  The new model seems flimsier though, and one of the parts has already broken.  This is the piece that holds the brew ""sprayer"" (?) to the top.  It does make good, hot coffee which I guess is the most important aspect.  Not sure I would purchase again due to the flimsier design.  Also wish it had an ""aroma"" feature for stronger coffee."
"It is good for the sale price! But, not for original price!The carafe glass is very thin and I am afraid will break fast."
"The industrial design and form factor of this coffee Maker are excellent. It is small, attractive and the electronics all function as expected.  The big glaring problem with this coffee Maker is the shape of the caraffe.  They're is no way you are going to put water into this Maker without spilling some on your counter top or through the brew channel. Down to the burner. This needs to be cleaned up before turning on, so it doesn't boil off this water under the vessel leaving residue and damaging the heat element surface. I was hoping that aspect of the design would have been executed properly. It makes no difference if the lid is up or down, the shape of the glass pot is not going to allow you to get all of the water into the Maker without creating a mess.  I wont to be using it long enough to find out other areas where the shape of the caraffe leads to hot Coffee being spelled and creating further messes."
"Mine was delivered during a move and came dented. Unfortunately, I opened it past the return date and didn’t realize it in time. The carafe is kind of a struggle to remove from the machine, and there’s no feature to remove it for a cup and stop brewing while you do that. I was used to doing that with the Cuisinart. It has no additional features at all, so it’s pretty basic, but the price does reflect that. So if you just want a very basic machine, it’s good, but if you’re used to or want a few bells and whistles, I would suggest paying more for a different machine."
"Frankly, I except better from Krups. While the coffee pot is compact, attractive and makes very good coffee, it has three serious design flaws. We returned it after a week of use, replacing it with a 4-cup Gevi coffee maker. The taste of the coffee from both machines was identical.The flaws are:1. The pour spout. Even when you are very careful and deliberate and slow in pouring coffee, the design of the Krups maker often causes coffee to leak during the pour. If your rush your pour, forgedda-bout-it: tidal wave of coffee.In comparison, the Gevi has never spilled a drop of coffee, no matter how fast we pour.2. The Krups lid does not open far enough to comfortably pour water into the tank. You can work around by pouring from up high, but, coupled with the design of the pour spout, this process results in lots of water spills during filling. Again, the Gevi allows filling completely and without spills.3. (This is partially in reference to the website descriptions). The website has conflicting descriptions of the auto shutoff feature. In the produce description it says it turns off automatically. In the comparison matrix it notes it has no auto-off feature. The matrix is correct. This machine does not turn off automatically.Again, in comparison, the Gevi turns off automatically after 2 hours. A good safety feature.I would hope Krups would take another pass at the design of this nicely sized coffee maker. They can do better. In the meantime, we are very pleased with the small Gevi"
"I bought this unit to replace my 30+ year old Braun which has been an awesome unit - and still is -  For simplicity sake, this Krups fine.  The flavor of the coffee is fine. What I don’t like about it is the ""placement"" of buttons and functionality of the top lid and filter insert.  The power button is on the side of the unit - this is a bad location for a power button. You can't see it as its on the side.  Also on the side is the water level indicator - compared to the ""old school"" braun, which had the water indicator ""in the water receptacle"" itself as it is white and easily seen.  I just prefer that look as there is just not good visibility to ""things on the side"" of the unit.  The filter receptacle has an added ""handle"" that just simply gets in the way - I took it off and its easier to insert filters with it out of the way - overall its an ok unit for its simplicity and I continue to use it, but the black interior is looking into a black hole and the power button on the side is not optimal placement for a power button - I want Braun to bring back the simple coffee maker and Krups to reengineer this one a bit.."
"this is 10 cups, if you use 12 cups this is way to small, its very light so it moves around every time you get coffee or replace the carafe back, smooth hidden  bottoms make for nice clean look but wake up and try to start your coffee and you are searching for the hidden button"
"This coffee maker is a nice small size to make a few cups. But when you remove the carafe after it’s made the coffee, the coffee drips onto the hot plate and the hot plate corrodes.The coffee also takes longer to make than my previous coffee machine. I wouldn’t recommend it."
"This is a great little coffee maker, which has been perfect for making coffee for the two of us each morning. In fact, we have bought two. However, it lacks an automatic power shutoff, which it sorely needs as a safety feature.  I took two stars off my review because of this. Without an automatic power shutoff after some period of time, turning the coffee maker on keeps the power on forever; if the coffee maker is an environment where it is near flammable materials, then there is a risk with its use."
I was very disappointed in this coffee maker. The hinge on the carafe broke almost immediately and I cannot find a replacment carafe that fits. The fill compartment is awkward and I can't empty the pot of water completley. The fill window is a little hard to read. The lid on the water and coffee fill compartment will not stay up so I feel like am constantly fighting with it. One of bumper dots on the bottom fell off and I cannot get it to stay back in. I'm not a huge fan of the permanent fileter because it's pretty messy. Paper filters appear to be out of favor so I may have to live with that. I have ordered a different coffee maker from a different manufacturer
"this little coffee maker and i are having a difficult bonding period.  unless i wait a good ten minutes after the coffee is made, the no-drip will drip.  i think the measurement must be off by an increment because it seems to have more to do with how it lift up when taking out the coffee pot.  the aim of putting in the coffee pot and pulling it out has to be dead on---like directly in from the front. directly. even then no guarantee.  it's hard to be so precise at 4 in the morning.  it's cute though.  and takes up very little space...  and the coffee is made and all that no problem.  just very finicky in wanting you to put the pot in a very specific angle. oh and pouring the water into the reservoir ... you can only tip that pot so far so usually there's a table spoon or two of water that stays in the pot. not a problem. but, is that a result of the severe lip on the coffee pot? or the way the lid on the reservoir will only open 90 degrees? and if i DO use the no-drip thing that sorta challenges putting the coffee pot in without disturbing the top strainer and no drip piece, when the coffee is finished brewing, the lid pops up on the reservoir! hilarious. there are already three steam holes. Ah well, like I say, it's a bit of a hassle to maneuver and I'm thinking of trying a Mr. Coffee... but for (what?) $35 this pot will do for now.  Besides, it's probably just me..."
"I got this as an alternative to my time-consuming pour-over setup, and for making coffee for more people than just me. After washing this I tried brewing a 4 cup pot of store-bought ground coffee, same stuff I use every day in my pour-overs, and using the reusable filter since all my paper filters are cone shaped not flat-bottom.Maybe I'm a coffee snob. I don't think I am, just an ex-chain barista who likes the ritual of pour-over and can taste poorly brewed coffee, but this was gross. The reusable filter did nothing to filter out the finest of the coffee grinds despite the very fine mesh, and it didn't catch any of the natural oils that a paper filter would take care of. Freshly brewed I got a very oily, silt-filled, weak cup of coffee. I don't know what happened but it absolutely didn't brew strong enough, and with the simple on-off functionality there's no way to adjust for that without adding more grounds.I went back to work and forgot about the pot and accidentally discovered that if there IS an automatic off function, it wasn't working. Five hours later the warmer was still on and still hot, so much so that when I took the pot off and a few drips fell they sizzled at the heat. I noticed the automatic off function is only mentioned in the full description not the Amazon blurb, so maybe it didn't have an automatic off in the first place? Unclear. That's a frustrating oversight and possibly dangerous if you make your coffee then leave the house.Overall, I know this is a small machine and probably is intended for hospitality suites, but 30 dollars??? On SALE???? I had a 15 dollar one button drip machine in college that made better coffee than this. Massive disappointment."
"Brews a great cup of coffee, but I've hit my breaking point with a couple of design flaws:The worst is the lid to the coffeemaker won't stay up so it makes it very difficult to add coffee to the filter. This design also makes it difficult to pour all of the water from the carafe into the water compartment.There is no automatic shut-off mechanism so the user has to switch the coffeemaker off manually. I know, first world problem, but this first-world problem can cause a fire."
The spout on the glass carafe leaks/drips coffee all over the counter.  No way around it.  Had to upgrade to another 5 cupper different brand
"It's hard to find a small coffee maker, but as my 18 y.o. Mr. Coffee was on its last legs I had to choose something. I ran one pot of vinegar through it and 2 pots of filtered water, then I ran a seasoning brew of weak coffee which I poured out.Pros:-easy to set up-easy to clean-perfect sizeCons:-condensation in pot-flavor is no better than my old Mr. Coffee-permanent filter-water level marks are black and hard to see how much you've filled...they should have been white.I'm not a fan of permanent filters. While they are a great idea, they do not work as well as paper filters.-The first real brew I used the perm filter...ended up with sludge in the bottom of my cup and bitter coffee.-The second brew I added a cone #2 paper filter and no more sludge, but not much flavor either.-The third brew I omitted the perm filter and put the #2 cone filter directly into the baslet...which resulted in better flavor and still no sludge.*Keep in mind I use Starbucks beans which I grind only enough for each cup.Surprisingly the old Mr. Coffee brews very good coffee, but as they changed the design and too many people do not like it, I tried the Krups. I will keep it but continue to look for a better small coffee maker."
"I really did like this coffeemaker. Great tasting coffee. Hot and tasty as coffee should be. Warmer kept it warm. It looked nice in my camper. Many compliments on tastes and looks.* The bad: I’m sad to say it only lasted 5 months. And quit. It sputtered, bubbled hot syrupy coffee and quit. So sad. At this price, I could try again. But, alas! Looking for the perfect coffeemaker under a hundred."
"This product is a very poor purchase.Pouring the water in the reservoir is hard to do without some of spilling water as you try to pour it in.  Maybe if the reservoir was wider you could poor the water in it.Then once you wipe the spilled water & the coffee is brewed pouring it into your cup the coffee spills out of the coffee maker!!!I don’t know if the spout is off or what but I don’t recommend buying it.UPDATE-I received another one & I have to use a measuring container that has spout on it to fill the coffee the pot .  Then when I go to pour the coffee it spills all over the counter!!Someone said on their review that the filter basket pops into place, mine doesn’t .It sounds like a number of people received good coffee makers but I wouldn’t chance it.I can’t return it either because I missed the the return date by one day so now I’m stuck with it! 😡"
"This is the 2nd krups coffee pot I’ve had. My first one lasted a really long time, so I thought buying the same brand was a good idea. Thd pause and perk does NOT work at all. The spout is shaped in a way that makes it difficult to get the last of the coffee poured. I’m very disappointed."
"While it's an okay coffee maker for the price, the problem is that the opening where the water is poured in is too small. As a result, You cannot pour from a mug (which is the easiest way to insure the correct amount of water)--you have to pour from something with a spout which the carafe has but, even using it, because of the angle and logistics, some water will stay in the carafe. I've ordered a different coffee maker that has a large opening for the water, and will keep this one as a backup because, having used it a few times, I don't feel right returning it."
The numbered settings don’t work correctly.
"Makes a decent cup of coffee and the size is good. Makes 2 actual coffee cups of coffee which is about right since the measurements on pot refer to measuring cups. The problems are the pot does not pour well, the reservoir lid does not stay up  and the reservoir opening is small. I have to put water in a a empty 2liter bottle to pour into reservoir. It works."
Have only had the coffee maker for 8 moths and  it no longer turns on. I did like it contemplating if going to order another hoping this one will last longer
"Feeling a little unsafe,.. it's been left on a couple times because we've forgotten to turn it off or unplug it. I wish it had an automatic turn off but for the price, it's great"
"coffee maker quit brewing after 11 months, I've had krups coffee makers  in past and had been very satisfied.. but this is disheartening, I have tried  unplugging it , and tried different outlets. it won't brew. I LOVED the coffee maker until it quit working a few days ago."
"It makes coffee ok but, it isn't hot and the paint all burned off the heater. Some water got on it and I wiped it off. The paint was coming off with the water. Not great. We got a better one."
"We enjoy the craft side of this coffee machine. We have had major issues with the pod side. Each time we use it, since the first time, it overflows and grounds get all in the cup of coffee and also all in and around the machine. It is a pain to clean the grounds out of the machine because no parts come out to clean, you just have to wipe inside and around until all the grounds are gone, this is very time consuming. Also when I contacted Cuisinart customer service I do not think their return policy is fair. They want me to cut the cord to the machine, take a picture of this, send back the machine and then wait 2 weeks for the replacement, therefore we would be without a coffee pot for two weeks because they sell a faulty product? If I have to go out and get a new coffee pot I’m going to buy a new one and not waste 200$ on one that doesn’t work well. I asked if they could charge me for the new one, ship it and then refund me when they get my broken one back, so we can use the craft side in the mean time, so we don’t have to be without one. They told me no, and I will have to go without and wait for the replacement. Seems strange, I asked why they operate this way and they responded, “we have alot of fraud and don’t trust customers to return the products”. Well welcome to the world, everyone deals with fraud, unfortunately part of owning a company is making the customer happy and standing behind your product. Very disappointed in this company and the product quality. Do not buy this machine!"
"Review for Cuisinart Coffee Center SS-15 AND SS-16…We previously had the SS-15 model… which has a ton of problems in itself. Leaky water reservoir (and no, a replacement will not fix the problem), the more than occasional k-cup coffee ground explosion, and a red clean light that will not turn off no matter what you do to clean or re-program the darn thing.We decided to just deal with the SS-15 for three years and finally decided to “upgrade” to the next model, SS-16, hoping it would fix the previous problems. WELL JOKE IS ON ME. My husband brewed a pot of coffee 24-HOURS ago (worked great then) and this morning while looking for the serial number under the machine I noticed that the plate was STILL HOT! No - the “off” button does not turn off the plate and there is no side switch to turn on/off the machine like the SS-15. We attempted to make a k-cup and per the manual we had to descale the machine first. After holding the clean button, the light flickered red and it beeped five times to tell us it was done. EXCEPT NOTHING HAPPENED!! The water was still in the reservoir. We clicked on the “pod” button to select a cup size. Again. NOTHING HAPPENED.So just like the last machine three years ago, I found myself calling Cuisinart customer service AGAIN. Turns out the machine is malfunctioned. So I must either have terribly bad luck with coffee makers OR Cuisinart makes cheap quality products that could have turned into a FIRE HAZARD had I not discovered the 24/7 HOT hot plate… I’m going to go with the latter. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on Cuisinart coffee makers. You’ve been warned."
"I was disappointed with this purchase. The first unit I received was obviously used and ""Bold"" button wasn't working. It was replaced and everything seemed to work fine, however, I wish I had tried a Keurig pod before my return window closed. I used regular grounds in the provided mini basket and it brewed a single cup or coffee, convenient when you need to go and don't want to brew a whole carafe. I will say that it seemed a bit weak given the amount of grounds I used. It also allows you, supposedly, to use Keurig pods. I thought it would be nice to have Chai and Hot Chocolate pods on hand. However, more often than not, the mix gets stuck in the pods and doesn't drip evenly into the cup. It almost always comes out weak, and then I need to  pull off the piping hot foil cover from the pod, spoon out the sugary, wet sludge and manually stir it into my cup. I've tried everything from shaking the pod first to slamming down the lid harder so that the pin can puncture the pod with greater pressure, to no avail. I basically paid three or four times what I should have for a carafe only coffee machine. It looks cool, sure, but when friends remark on it and want a single cup of chai, I have to say, ""sure, why don't you wait for me in [insert other room or garden] and I'll bring it to you"" so they don't have to witness the mess that will follow."
"We love the coffeemaker and it works great, but for the price & the name CUISINART you'd expect the quality of the machine would be excellent.  The lettering on the ""CARAFE"" button is wearing off and now says ""AFE"" (see picture), and no, we are NOT using abrasive cleaners or towels.  We called Cuisinart and they told us we were still under warranty and they can replace the machine, but it takes 7-10 working days to get the new machine.  Well, we can't go without making coffee for 7-10 working days.  I guess we'll use our label maker and put a CARAFE label on the machine.  Yeah, that'll look classy.  For a machine that costs $160 USD, we have to put a label on a button.  Seriously, are you kidding me?  Cuisinart, you used to have high-quality stuff.  We also had to return a can opener of yours......it didn't open the cans.  We also had to return a kitchen scissors of yours.......it wasn't easy to hold.  The only thing we've gotten of yours that IS quality stuff, are your stainless steel pots and pans (the big ""professional"" set).  But all your other stuff has lost it's magic.  What happened to you guys?"
"I have had this machine for a year now and use it daily so hopefully this is a helpful review. I have had no issues with the carafe side. I set the timer and it is ready in the morning. However, the pod side I have had countless issues with after just a few weeks of owning the machine. It either explodes and grounds get everywhere or when it does work I have to hold the top down so it will run properly since something is wrong with the latch. In addition, after 6 months of use the clean light returns within a day descaling both sides. Note: I only use filtered water and descaled the machine monthly on both sides before this issue happened. I am still using the coffee maker daily but rarely use pod feature due to continued issues."
"This is the first coffee maker I have had in a long time that has a carafe instead of an internal reservoir. It was also a Cuisinart and would have liked to have that again but I wanted a single cup maker also and this had both so I bought this one. It works mostly good with two exceptions. First the single cup maker seems to posh some of the fine grounds through into the cup. 2ndly. The carafe dribbles when poured. I have tried holding the cover down which I shouldn't have to. I've tried pouring slow, fast, holding the cover slow and fast. Nothing works. Pour spouts have been around for several thousands of years. I would think that designers and engineers in this day and age could look to history to know what works and design accordingly."
"Not only does the clean light keep coming on, but the words are coming off the machine and I only had it for a little shy of 5 months. This is not right as I always purchase Cuisinart products. This was not a cheap coffee pot and I just keep having g issues"
"I have had my for over a year, I started out loving this coffee pot has a great single serve basket to use your own coffee. That’s the good.The Bad. Keeper erroring out on the single serve side with E07 which means you have to clean the nozzle on that side which isn’t that easy and I have a water softener.It has two water tanks which is tiresome to keep filling, my old Keurig had one tank.The latest problem is it no longer seems to measure the cup size correctly on the single serve side.I wish I hadn’t paid so much for this coffee pot as I feel I can’t throw it away, but now I wish I had stayed with my Keurig us was 5 years old and never had a problem."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            UPDATE- My replacement SS-16 has been working perfectly! No steam, boiling coffee or strange noises.2 stars is generous here…I purchased this new design SS-16 Cuisinart model on 7/11/23 at a prime day price of $150 to replace the SS-15 I’ve had for years and was on its last leg. I’ve been eyeing this one for a couple of months and was excited to get it on a great sale.  I’ve only ever purchased Cuisinart coffee brewers for the past 18 years and they’ve always sat in the exact same place on my counter with no awful issues.This one is absolutely horrible and I’m exchanging it for another of the same model to try because I love the look and new features. Hoping the next one functions properly and I can update my review with a better outcome.EXCESSIVE STEAM: An insane amount of mega hot steam bellows out the back of the machine! So much steam that only 8-10 cups out of 12 ends up in the carafe! I tried brewing 12 cups twice. We ended up with 8 cups of brewed coffee the first time and 10 the second time. (See video) This coffee maker left my entire backsplash soaked in water runs and water physically dripping from the bottom of the cupboards above it. The whole machine had condensation on it and the clock display ended up with heavy condensation behind the glass/plastic screen. I expect some steam but this amount was ridiculous and would definitely eventually ruin many types of backsplash and cupboards.BOILED COFFE: The coffee brewing into the carafe was literally bubble boiling in the carafe! Not kidding. I took a video but Amazon only lets me upload one video per review and I chose the excessive steam video. The coffee it freshly brewed was murky and discolored although no grounds were in the bottom of the carafe.IT’S LOUD: this machine hisses and periodically clunks loudly as it is carafe brewing. It takes longer to carafe brew compared to my SS-15 version.WON’T BREW A FULL CARAFE: So much water is turned to steam bellowing out of the machine that I can’t get a full carafe. 8-10 cups is all that brewed on either try at 12 cups.I tried a K cup on the single brewer side and that worked perfectly. We are big coffee drinkers and go through 2 full carafes a day plus occasional K cups. I need a machine that performs well and this particular one is not it. I’ll update my review when I receive the exact model replacement next week."
"I loved the flexibiity of this machine to have a big group carafe option and a single person one-cup brewing option. Unfortunately, the K-Cup brewer side of the machine broke after less than 6 months of use. I tried troubleshooting w/ the manual, the internet and finally Conair, the parent corporation. Nothing fixed it. Then it took me several weeks and multiple proofs of purchase (amazon receipt, pics of the machine, pics of the bottom of the machine, pics of the PLUG on the machine) to get the seller to agree to replace the machine under its warranty. Conair's customer service only replied to my emails every 3 business days or longer, which added up to a total of nearly 6 weeks of my constant follow-up before I received a warranty replacement. I truly hope this new machine holds up better than the first one did because I do not want to have to deal with such slow customer service ever again."
"It's fine but it drip part when brewing it's overloaded and spills out over the coffee pot. And sometimes it has coffee grounds in it, due to not running though the top of spelled on copy pot."
"The carafe still works without issue. The pod side, not so much. In under a year the pod side just produced error codes on the display and won't work. It has devolved into an over priced simple drip coffee maker."
"The coffee pot side works perfect, never a problem.  We are a 50/50 user on pot vs pod.  Pods well its not been perfect but overall after doing a few things, its been solid for 6 months now.  Issues with the pod side:  Sometimes randomly just turn the whole machine off when pressing Brew.  Required taking the pod out, and removing power for 5mins. Would would great for about a week then do the same thing.  Noticed certain pods are really packed and will leak water all over the place.  Stopped buying those pods.  After brewing the pod will still be full of water.  Would let the pod sit for 10 mins after brewing, lift the cover, put cup under to catch any additional water but usually water would drop into the pod. Limits you in brewing multiple pods back to back.  And need to clean the pod side at least once a week and the drip be full of junk but stopped once I used pods that were not packed.My biggest issue falls back to the type of pods used. If they are packed to the top, I would not use them on this machine, it will just leak and make a mess."
It's ok.  I replaced my old Cuisinart with this one.  The cup dispenser does not allow for larger cups to fit under it.Not the best quality I have experienced.
"It's great looking,makes good coffee.kinda of pain to refill everytime.but about every third time it leaks a huge puddle underneath."
"I really wanted to love this combo brewer, but the k-cup brewer is not satisfactory. On the plus side, the regular brewer works as advertised. Coffee tastes great. The problem I have is with the flavor of the coffee brewed on the K-cup brewer. When brewing K-cups, the same coffee and tea I have been using for years, is overly bitter and strong, even at the largest cup size. There are some engineering specific problems, as well. The capsule (K-cup) holder dies not always stay seated, and watch out if this happens. There will be coffee grounds all over inside the brew area that are not easily cleaned up. Even when seated properly, there are frequently still grounds in the coffee, and not just a few particles. It appears as though the part that punctures the top of the K-cup is not sharp enough so the hole is not precise, allowing grounds to flow up out of the pod. I am sorry to say I am dissatisfied with the unit because of these issues.Addendum: a previous issue not mentioned is that it is impossible to pour from the carafe without the liquid dribbling down the side of the pot and all over the counter. A new issue with the k-cup brewer has come up recently in that it’s necessary to run the brewer up to three times to get a full 10 oz. Cup of coffee. Now I realize that 10 oz is more than one cup, but you select your cup size from 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 oz. It should only be necessary to brew once to achieve the selected cup size. This was the last straw. I called Cuisinart tonight and they will ship a new unit after I send the a picture of the unit with the cord cut. Hopefully the k-cup brewer will work better though I do not have high expectations for that, or for the carafe issue, as that is related to poor design. All in all, the coffee center 2 in 1 unit has left me with a bad taste in my mouth for Cuisinart products."
The water reserve leaks. It doesn’t attach well to the back so it leaks all over your countertop.
"My coffee pot is leaking very bad around the rim ,and makes coffee fast"
"I would have rated this five stars if it had not stopped working inexplicably after five months of use.  This is the individual cup side that failed.  The full carafe side continues to work and the coffee is fine, as is the temperature, which is an important consideration for me.  Hence the three stars.  The failure cost you only two out of kindness."
"I love the color it looks good in my kitchen.  The pot coffee is as expected, works great. The k-cup side is hit or miss.  Sometimes it leaks water down into the cup when it making the coffee as well, you end up with grounds in your cup when this happens. If I was buying this style again I would probably buy a Keurig."
Decided to go the “contact the manufacturer” route for missing parts to make this coffee maker function right. 30 days later and I’m still waiting. They sent an email they’ve processed an order for the part but I’m going on a month unable to use this. I bought it because I needed a functioning coffee maker. I’ve been loyal to cuisinart for more than 20 years. I don’t know that I feel the same about their products anymore. Service would get perhaps 1/2 a star. The actual unit does turn on and brew. The coffee just goes all over the place.
"I chose this coffee maker because I like to make single pods and my partner likes to brew a pot, so this was a great way to cut down on devices on the counter. I did buy a “like new” used version, but it had never been USED and came in original packaging with the plastic still on, so I got it for a great deal. I went to do the initial hot water brew before making coffee for the first time and this was where it all went downhill. The carafe brewed no problem, and then I went to try the pod side and the button didn’t flash on and wouldn’t brew. I though oh silly tech, it’s probably me- cut to an hour an half later, after reading the manual, watching demos, and CALLING CUISINART to see if there was a hard reset or trick I could do! Come to find out, this is a common flaw with this product, and the rep recommended I return this and get my money back because this happens a lot and there’s nothing else to try or do. Why they haven’t revamped this maker so that doesn’t happen, idk, but it’s not worth the 150-200 it costs, and I didn’t even spend that much and I’m pissed!"
"If it wasn’t for the reviews, I’d have thrown this thing right out the window. Pod issue is real. I pressed in a little rubber button on the inside of the pod part and it works. Very skeptical, but will continue to use."
I am kinda disappointed with Cuisinart.  Why would you sell a white coffee pot with a black cord.  Doesn't really make sense to me.
"I love Cuisinart. However, I went to use the single serve pod option for the first time since since purchasing this coffee pot and the pod button does not work. I tried previously a month ago and thought I was using the machine wrong and gave up. Went ahead and tried again along with Googing how to work it and watch a video. To my disappoint, I had done nothing incorrectly the button/pod function is defective. This maker has been treated like a Queen so no damage has occurred for it to not work. So sad."
"Above all else, the carafe still requires pinpoint accuracy when you are pouring coffee to avoid spilling coffee all over the counter. Their disregard for how coffee flows out of the carafe  is the only downside, aside from a complicated set up."
Coffee machine makes lots of noise when brewing
"After about a year, the single serve is giving an error.  The only way to clear the error is to unplug it for about 5 minutes.  Not what I want to do right away in the morning.  The carafe brewing is really nice, especially with the bold option and being able to control the warming plate temperature."
"The first one I ordered in Stainless Steel arrived fine, but when I set it up, the Pod feature/button would not work, no matter what I did and tried. And believe me, I tried. So I went to Amazon for a replacement. They sent the replacement and it was the wrong color ... geeze! So I had to haul not one, but two of these nice hefty boxes back to UPS. I received my refund and decided to buy it from a physical store. That worked out just fine! If you want to avoid the hassle of defective appliances and people who cannot choose the right item to be shipped out .. save yourself the aggravation and buy it at a retail store in person.Side Note: We actually really like this machine and haven't had any issues with it. I love that it can do a carafe and pod. We buy ground coffee and use the Barista pod it comes with. It makes a nice pot of coffee too. Generally really love this machine!"
"Ordered first time and the glass pot arrived cracked. Packed up and sent back for a replacement. Received replacement coffee pot, set up, brewed cleaning cycle and all appeared to be working. Threw out box for garbage day the next day, set auto timer and woke up the next morning. Coffee brewed fine, but by the time it had brewed and we got up for coffee, it had been about 30 minutes. Coffee was lukewarm because the burner did not stay on after brewing. Dumb design. Frustrated, I went to the Cuisinart website to submit a form for help. I completed the entire form and hit submit, only to get a message saying their website was having technical difficulties. I then reached out to Amazon support to explain why I could not return the coffee pot (again) for a replacement/ refund. Amazon promptly refunded my money and said to throw away the brand new coffee pot. We decided to order ANOTHER new coffee pot, this time a Keurig dual coffee pot. Smaller, better design and it actually works. Do not order the Cusinart dual coffee pot.Do better Cuisinart."
"I will be returning this machine. I bought on Sept 30, 2023 and enjoyed using both Pod and carafe side without issues. About 2 weeks ago the Pod side developed attitude and started spitting, sputtering and steaming with each cup made. Then the pods were exploding, sending grounds throughout the Pod side and into the coffee. I cleaned, descaled, paper-clipped and cleaned the needle holes but without success. So I call customer service...""find this number on the bottom of the machine, and that number on the plug-in prongs"", really. For $149.00 I can buy cheap Walmart 5 cup carafe machines and throw them out without feeling remorse. I thought Cuisinart was a better product than this."
"Absolutely loved this coffee pot at first! But it's constantly leaking. My whole counter is always wet because of it. Not sure what the issue is. If I could return it I would, but the time frame just passed because I waited too long 😭"
I’ve tried both the pod and removable cup options and every time coffee grounds spill into the brewing chamber and make a mess. It’s pretty frustrating.
First one leaked all over my counter from bottom of unit. They did replace
"Bought the SS-16 to replace an old SS-15, which worked flawlessly. Ordered because I really like the auto off setting that can be adjusted, as well as the warmer temperature adjustment.  Not to mention it makes great hot coffee. However, on my new SS-16, the Bold feature does not work with Auto On.  According to Cuisinart product support, that is normal.  But I’m not convinced.  It worked on the previous model and I think I have a defect.  If it’s not a defect and is normal, that’s a huge step backward for a $200 coffee maker.  I’m reading questions and answers that say Bold setting works with auto on which further makes me think I have a defective one.  I will probably have to return it and try another, or something else."
"**update** cuisinart sent me a new machine and it seems to be working well.  I'll update in 3-4 months.Either I got a faulty machine or its a terrible product.  I spent a ton of money and it breaks the pods open almost every time.  I have done all of the troubleshooting, making sure the needle is cleaned, I even poked a tiny hole in the top of the pod to release any extra air.  I have tried 8 types of pods and it does it to ALL OF THEM.  I end up with tons of clean up, and tons of grounds in my coffee.  I absolutely hate this Machine, and I spent a ton of money on it.  Total waste."
"So disappointing!- Used for two weeks as carafe only coffee maker, went to make a single cup, and the ""pod"" button would not do anything. I tried trouble shooting tips in owner's manual,re-read operating instructions,searched online for help- nothing helped. Then, I called ""customer service"",after a brief trouble shooting exercise, customer service said they would replace the defective unit. Now we start having trouble- first the customer service lady (Rosana)was very hard to understand, then, she repeatedly explained to me that I would have to verify that (after sending Item(coffee maker) via UPS) was received by them(Cuisinart), then I would have to call them to notify them that they had received item before they could send a new one. I was sure that I did not understand correctly, and she repeated instructions at least three times. I asked for a manager repeatedly, and she just kept on filling out return information, and supposedly sending me shipping labels.I kept insisting that I talk to a manager, and she began getting snippy- saying""I have asked""Finally,(after 22 minutes) she said she would get a manager. She put me on hold for 3 minutes and 23 seconds, and then came back on line and said we have to continue with the return as she had said before, and that there is nothing else that could be done. I then advised her that I would return Coffee maker through Amazon and never look at a Cuisinart product again.- She replied"" I will cancel this return then""- and hung up.  - (total phone time 29 minutes 37 seconds).  Now Amazon took every bit of 45 seconds to arrange free UPS pickup at my front door, and I know from past experiences my refund will be prompt and accurate. - I am shopping Amazon for a new coffee maker- maybe two -(one carafe,one pod) that is not a Cuisinart."
"My husband wanted this one, so… we use the k cup pods and they work but the water reservoir is so small we have to fill it daily.After a month or two, I have to say, this is the slowest coffee maker I’ve ever had. I would not recommend this coffee maker. The reservoir is too small and it takes too long."
I am was supposed excited to receive it. However 2 pieces of it were missing. 😩
"The k-cup side will leak, but one way I have found to stop this is to press the cup down.  I don't think the single serve size is designed correctly.  We have 2 people in the house one works mornings and use the coffee pot side, and one works nights uses the K-cup side.  This machine is messy if you don't take your time but other than that good."
"Carafe feature works fine, if want to use ready made Pods don’t purchase this, the PODS exploded grounds in cup. The Home Barista Pod that comes with it works fine any other not worth the aggravation  very disappointed when primary use is single serve."
"The Pod side works fine, a bit loud - but gives a good cup of coffee.  However, the problem is with the full pot side.  You cannot make a pot of coffee without getting grounds in your pot.  I've tried to just use filters, use the filter basket provided, and a combination of both.  No matter what, there are grounds in the pot.  The lid to the pot has to fully come off, would prefer it to be on a 'hinge'.  You have to pour carefully, and over a sink.  Because unless you tilt your coffee cup and the pot together you will get coffee all over the place.  It leaks as you pour it.  The machine makes loud popping noises while on the warmer.  Cleaning is very difficult - the top gets ground in the water holes and you cannot take it off to try to rinse and clean it.  You have to take a tool to clean out each hole.  All in all - an expensive machine that I cannot return..."
"Now I can write a review. I've had this coffee maker since June 2023. It's a good product,  but have to clean it every 2 weeks. The red light indicates that it's time to clean, sometimes every 10 days. Now I make coffee 365 days a year... but my last Cuisinart coffee pot would come on once a month after a 100 cups of coffee. It's a good coffee pot, but for the money, not really that great.  I wouldn't buy this again."
"Mine didn't work. I read the book, followed YouTube instructiob, then called customer service at cuesinart.  He kind of made me feel bad for not ordering directly from them, but they didn't have the color I wanted and can't beat amazing shipping. I returned mine and am still using my old pot."
"Love this Coffee maker as I saw one at my brothers house, so bought one and found the pot side works great, timer, and all.,BUT the K-cub side leaks water when making no matter what size of coffee from 4 oz to 12 oz. The lid closes and everytime over the past several months from day one, water comes out the sides, while making a K-cup of coffee. Check the seal, cleaned the parts, assure all was good. Hey, i have had K-cups makers from the very start and this one disappoints. To much money for this not to be a top brand from the company I TRUSTED Cuisinart . Try it and if it leaks return ASAP, I waited to long."
"I bought this coffee maker and had to return it within a month because the pod side completely quit working. Before it quit working, the pods were exploding. Every time you tried to make one cup of coffee. So I returned it and got a replacement. The new one is working on the pod side but, once or twice a week the grounds overflow, filling the coffee in the carafe with grounds. This is extremely aggravating. I know that I am not overfilling coffee grounds as I usually make 6 to 10 cups and use three to four scoops of coffee. I originally bought this coffee pot because Cuisinart products are usually pretty good. I do like the option of having the single pod and carafe on the same unit.  I have to say I’m definitely disappointed in this Cuisinart product."
"After a good couple of months to begin with the Kuerig side of the product started blowing up the K cups. The product was not opened until Christmas, and did not last 6 weeks. And of course is less than a week past the return time."
"Well, the machine SS-16 looks amazing and it has both Pods and Carafe - awesome for AirBnB I though.So, I purchased it for both of me AirBnBs. The first one worked less than 10 months and then the Pod's part stopped working. It's a small 4ppl AirBnB with vacancy of course, so the use of the machine was less than in regular household. And the warranty doesn't cover it if it's a commercial or business setting. In the second Bnb, I had to return it as it wasn't working out of the box, and a new one still holds but I guess the time is ticking.Now, looking for a better option to put into work again."
"After setting it up and plugging it in, it would not function for brewing a k-cup.  The indicator light and portion control setting would not function.  After making arrangements for a return, it has started working for an unidentified reason.It is disappointing that the k-cup must be first pushed into the pod holder and pierced at the bottom before the top can be closed to pierce the top of the pod and brew.  This was just not expected with other manufacturer units.It could also benefit from a backlit led display for time and portion size as it is could be easier to read."
"Updated review: received my new coffee maker and this one works great. Just inconvenient that I had to return the first one.First review: The carafe side worked great but the Pod button would not work, even after several troubleshooting attempts. I looked for the problem online and it seems like other people have had the same issue, but the questions about how to fix it were not answered. I’m sending by back for an exchange. Hopefully the next one will work and I can update my review."
The single cup side does not puncture the coffee pod and the coffeepod button does not illuminate or work. I had read this in the reviews and ignored it because of the Cuisinart  name.  But now it is too late to return the item. I had researched how to correct the problem and cleaned the sharp point that punctures the pod but it worked one time and the coffee grounds flowed into the coffee.I did not wantseveral coffee makers on the counter and so I purchased this double coffee maker But my recommendation is to but a Keurig single cup coffee maker.
"We used it for a week before trying the pod side only to find that it doesn't work. Now, we no longer have the box and both Cuisinart and Amazon are making us return this crap and I'm not sure how to do that, I mean it has glass parts and I'm not spending more money or time trying to wrap and box it, that's stupid. It will cost me far more than its value once all these hours on the phone and having to find a UPS store are done. It could be a great product just as much as Cuisinart could be a great company. I am going to have to buy another one and I have zero faith it's going to work, but this unit just happens to be a perfect fit. Doh! Last time. No more from this brand after this terrible experience. AND, no more buying appliance online. Had I went to a retail store this would have been a better experience by a mile!"
"This quit working after 3 months of purchase, the pod side, do not recommend this"
I keep getting grounds in my coffee. It's too big. I thought it was a good product because of the name. Disappointed.
"Purchased the Amazon renewed double sided coffee maker as kind of a gift for my kids. It was at a low price, which I could afford, and my teenage kids were excited .. iced on one side for our 14-yr-old daughter, and hot for the rest of us.UNFORTUNATELY IT CAME BROKEN! The entire cold coffee side wouldn’t even turn on. Called Amazon customer service and they would not do another renewed product at the original price, and my only option was to return for the price I paid. Sad. Hopefully it goes down in price soon!"
"After two months the glass container as well as the coffee maker started leaking. I just moved into a new house and did not send back! Big REGRET! What a waste of money! Time to look for a better product, made in USA."
"I purchased the coffee maker from Amazon on September 11, 2023 on October 21st no longer would turn onI contacted Cuisinart and was told they would replace the unit all I needed was shipping label that would come from UPS once they received the order it would take 3 to 5 business days to email the label after 5 calls to Cuisinat I still have not received the label and this is November 3rd very poor customer service from Cuisinat"
"For the price I paid, this is terrible.  It hasn't kept my pot of coffee hot for anything past an hour.  I've tried changing the temps, the time to keep it hot, nothing works.  This a.m., the pod area broke and coffee grinds exploded all over, hot water and before any cup of coffee, early a.m., this is NOT the way to wake up!  I had to clean up for over 1/2 hour from this mess.  I've only had it since early April.  Terrible coffee maker!"
First of all there's no instructions for how to make a specific amount of coffee in carafe!!  I called Cuinisart first time over 1 hour hold not 1 minute 1 HOUR!! I indicated for them to call me back they never did!  Next day it said 2 minutes hold then 20 minutes later never answered. So I read the reviews and found out that whatever amount of water you put in is how much it makes!  So it basically has to RUN OUT of water to stop sounds bad. So having a large reservoir is worthless if you have to fill with only the amount for 1 pot what's the point?  Returning!  I normally love this brand but they are hiding the fact of this by purposely leaving out of instructions when they address every other tiny detail but this important detail is no where in instructions so if not for other buyers asking questions I would never know
"I would be very careful in purchasing this unit.  The instructions say it can handle 15 tablespoons of ground coffee.  Don't believe it.  I have used the scoop that was included and did 9 level scoops, and 8 level scoops on another pot.  Both times the coffee maker overflowed the coffee grounds into the carafe and coffee all over the counter.  The maker is very sensitive to the amount of coffee you put in."
"Cuisinart has normally been an excellent brand, but I was disappointed with this model, as it ran water all over the counter from under the single serve side.  I cleaned it and then it worked fine for about 2 weeks.  Now the single serve side won't work at all.  Called number given and had to send pics from my phone which did not work, so sent pics to my computer and sent that way.  What a hassle.  However the customer service person was very nice and helped.  So they will replace free of charge once they receive the pics.  Hope the new one is okay because the coffee is really the best and the Coffee Center is so easy to use.  We need more quality products made by our own US citizens!!"
"I had high hopes for this coffee maker. The ONLY thing that works as intended is the brewing pot! The pod feature does not work & the warming plate does not work & the ice coffee feature does not work properly. I have followed the instructions to the ""T"" multiple times with no success ~ Very disappointing!"
"I loved this coffee machine so much that I have 3 for different locations.  The one I use daily has decided not to work for the single serve anymore.  I have descaled it sooo many times, and did all the steps their customer service shared with us.  Now after each use, the grounds leak out of the top and it is a nightmare mess.  Once it leaked the first time, it hasn't stopped.Had to give in and buy a Keurig, however I loved the dual capability of this cuisinart.Bummed big time."
"While the machine is beautiful and exactly what I was hoping to purchase, the initial disappointment was in the delivery. The box was broken. Thankfully, I got the machine into the house and unpacked and everything looked okay. Though right away, I noticed that there were missing materials: the two charcoal water filters for the units filtration, and the 4 started coffee filters for the first cups. This was frustration, but not insurmountable.I then went on to prepare the machine. Plugged it in, set the time, sent through the first cleanse through the carafe side of the machine. Now to test the pod side. It didn't work. The troubleshooting guide that came with the unit wasn't helpful, so I went on line. I found a few sites dedicated to this specific issue, so I followed the directions; and still the single-serve pod side of the until doesn't work.This was the reason I purchase this particular machine. Additionally, I have had such good experiences with my cuisinarts in the past. This is so very disappointing. I'm going to have to return it."
"I hate to leave a bad review about a Cuisinart product.  I've purchased many of them, including the pod only machine, and the combo unit that was the previous version of this one.I was super excited that this newer machine had the pod dispenser on the left side (the old one had it on the right side), it works better for my counter set up.The older machine didn't poop out, I just moved it to my office to make room for the new one.Here's the problem:  The coffeepot dispenser worked fine, it was the pod dispenser that didn't work very well.  I can't tell what the actual problem was, it seemed to work better if I stood there and pushed down on the pop up pod door.  Even then it would leak water around the pod into the cup (if it actually dispensed some coffee), sometimes it would dispense only vaguely brown water - and made a crap load of noise doing it.It makes me really annoyed to ditch a machine after so little time, but I will be tossing it - because it takes up too much room to keep it for the coffee pot."
"Junk,,, first day I used it it started leaking had water all over my counter top. The leak seemed to be coming from inside the unit. Did call Cuisinart  rep was nice but all they could do was have me return it and they would replace.  They had no idea why it was leaking. Anyhow I needed a coffee pot and it will not be this brand for sure."
"I only give this coffee maker one star because I can’t go lower. I am warning you, do NOT under any circumstances buy this.I happened to be outside when the delivery driver arrived and I met him at the curb and carried the box in myself. The box was in perfect condition and I mention it only to eliminate shipping damage.  In a matter of minutes, the unit was opened and unpacked sitting on my counter. The pod side wouldn’t even turn on to run it through the FIRST CLEANING!!  I’m so disappointed in Cuisinart and myself.I ignored the other reviews warning me of the same issue. I was sure my experience would be different and it was just a fluke that Cuisinart must have worked out. NOPE!  They should be embarrassed to sell junklike this and Amazon should read the reviews they solicit and stop selling this unit until it’s fixed. If I wanted cheap plastic crud that didn’t work, there are a whole lot of options rather than returning this junkYou’ve been warned, don’t make the same mistake. You might have guessed I edited my review to take the potentially offensive words out."
This particular item was a customer return (defective) and was sent out by the Warehouse without being checked. The original buyer 's info was still in the box. I  have bought from Warehouse a number of times and this is the first time this has happened to me.
"Purchased product on 9/24/24, within 4 days the pod side leaked grounds and spilled over, had to clean. Has not had a problem with pod since, making 2-3 pods a day.However, today the carafe side stopped working. Checked trouble shooting, disconnected unit several time as instructed.Checked filter in place, it simply will not brew. I have made only a dozen carafe’s to date, this is most disappointing.Definately a mfg. problem, after seeing other customer reviews I strongly recommend looking at alternative units."
"Looks nice, delivery was fast. POD side didn’t work. Contacted manufacturer, to to reset it. There’s a black button inside top , press several times to reset. Nothing, nada. No lights nothing. Been returned no hassle Amazon thank you."
"I made the mistake of not reading the reviews. I had the previous model before this one that eventually died and I truly enjoyed the product. I found this new model and was expecting the same,  highly disappointed!!!! $200 for a coffee pot, you expect a certain level of quality, but not in this case. I used th carafe part of the coffee pot for about a week and it worked consistently and well. Yesterday my wife tried to brew on the single serve side with a Dunkin Donuts Kcup and couldn’t even get the Pod button to light up to brew.  Now I am going back to read the reviews and seeing others with the same problems. I am not even bothering with the Cuisinart customer service, I don’t want a replacement and have the same issues. I am boxing it up and sending back to Amazon. I am going to order a different brand coffee pot with the same features. Again, so very disappointed in Cuisinart, I have purchased several coffee points"
"We have had to contact Cuisinart 2 times because the K-cup side stopped working. They have replaced the ENTIRE machine twice - we are now on our third machine! And we don't even use the K-cup side very often. While the customer service has been on point, what an incredible waste and contribution to landfills! Please choose another coffee maker."
"Aesthetically it is nice, however it is very loud when making a cup of coffee"
"I have now ordered (and returned) two of these (the second a replacement for one I assumed was defective0), Assembled, brewed a a carafe of coffee, fine. Nut the single serving side did not work. Went on line, did all the You Tube suggestions...called customer service who were very helpful but none of their suggestions worked either. They told me to return the product (thank you Amazon for making this so easy), I assumed I'd just gotten a random malfunction and reordered...exactly the same thing happened. Went through the whole process again, the single serve side would not work (according to all the on line advice, this was very common). Second maker is on the way back to Amazon. Cuisinart was very polite, tried to be helpful and I will no doubt buy other products from them...but not THIS one. Two trips to the UPS store later, I would love suggestions for alternate product."
"Yep, makes a great cup of coffee but damn near set my house on fire.  It was just smoking and wasn’t even in use. This is at 10pm at night luckily I was up and smelled something. The entire thing was smoking.  Had I been asleep it could’ve set my house on fire."
I don’t understand why the coffee comes out hot when u push the button for over ice. I would rather it come out like warm or room temperature and not hot. Ice eaters down the hot coffee as it cools off.  Don’t get it!!
Great look. The coffee is good. Like that it is pods and carafe. But we have to pull it out fully every time we make a pot because the entire top has to lift up to fill it. We have no other place for it other than where it is under our upper cabinets.
"My wife and I have used Cuisinart coffee makers exclusively for about the past 30 years or so.  Wifey wanted to get a Bunn until I told her it's about a dollar a day just to keep the water hot.  I steered her to this one because she likes the single-serve pods for making a cup mid-day.  This thing makes the best coffee; I don't know how they improved it so much over the ""under $100"" coffee makers but they did.  It's just a beautiful appliance also; it's so elegant looking.  Everything seems to be perfect on this machine; would buy it again in a heartbeat.Now for the downside: 14 months later it almost burned our house down because of a defective, out of control warmer."
"After reading the instructions and a couple YouTube videos, I setup our new coffee maker and ran a couple brews of water through the carafe as instructed. Then moved to the single serve side and could not get the pod light to come on. Tried many sequences and called Cuisenart customer service. They had no suggestions and told me to return it to Amazon."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Had a Cuisinart coffee maker for 12 years, it finally died this past Summer, decided to get something fancier so chose this model (BIG mistake). It arrived, followed all directions, gave away my Keurig thinking I didn’t need it anymore. Woke up Day 2 and display didn’t work, tried ALL the trouble shooting and was told eventually it was defective and could return for a new one. Took a few weeks for the new one to arrive.New one worked great for about a month. Then water reservoir for pods started leaking slowly. Would notice standing water on counter around coffee maker (this counter space was only used to make coffee). So kept a towel nearby and decided to just empty reservoir after each use.Fast forward, to month 5, husband makes coffee as usual and notices it starts bubbling and boiling. So he unplugs the machine and watches in horror as it starts smoking.Would NOT recommend this product!!!! Very expensive for 2 that malfunctioned right away with seperate issues. The smoke and fire hazard has us now looking for a new brand…."
"Buyer beware!  I highly advise against buying this products. We owned our previous Cuisinart Keurig coffee maker for 10 years when it finally stopped working.  We decided to purchase another since we had such a great experience with our first one.  However, we received the coffee maker and immediately  upon opening, the keurig side didn’t work.  The button wouldn’t light up when pressed so we weren’t able to brew a cup of coffee.  The carafe side worked.  I called Amazon for a replacement which they sent immediately.  Only issue is the replacement coffee maker didn’t work either!  This time the keurig side half worked but you had to manually hold down the compartment where you put the k-cup so it would brew.  However if you accidentally let it go, it immediately stopped brewing.  So we tried one more time and Amazon shipped us a third coffee maker and this one again DID NOT WORK!  The Keurig side button would not light but again the carafe side worked.  Save yourself the hassle and find a different brand.  I’m so disappointed in Cuisinart."
"I was excited to get this coffee maker because I liked all the different features it has but only to be disappointed with it. I got it yesterday and tried a regular cup of coffee using the reusable pod but it came out very slowly and made a bunch of noise and steam was coming out. I also tried the carafe which seems to work okay but it also brewed slower than I thought it would. Today I tried making iced coffee with a K-Cup and it dribbled out everywhere, grounds and all. I tried it a couple times thinking I was doing something wrong but it keeps doing the same thing. The last time I tried it, when I opened the lid, after turning the brew off of course, it exploded everywhere. I would not recommend buying this."
"I was always happy with Cuisinart products until now. When I purchased this coffee maker I was initially thrilled with it. However, after only two days, the issues started. The buttons stopped lighting up consistently, and the pod side of the machine stopped brewing entirely after just one time. Shortly after, the carafe side also quit working. I attempted to troubleshoot but nothing worked. I regret not reading more of the negative reviews before making this purchase."
"The package ( inside the pristine Amazon box) was badly damaged and taped to try to hold it together, (showing on their end, they knew there was a problem).Inside the carafe was missing and the machine was very dusty like it was sitting in a shelf on a construction site.Horrible way to deliver an expensive product. Fantastic way to get a bad review. Careless, sloppy and they were fully aware of this!"
"This product is good looking, and has the features we want - make a pot of coffee, or a single cup of coffee using pods. The issue here is that the pod feature doesn't work on this model. after extensive googling, it seems this is a recurring issue on this model and many people are struggling with the exact same issue.there is some internet advice to reset the machine, or use a tooth pick to reset it, but we shouldn't have to do that every single time, and not on a brand new machine.This machine makes a nice pot of coffee, delicious in fact, but sales should be disconnected until the issue is resolved."
"The coffeemaker only lasted 6 months.  My husband attempted to make a cup of coffee on the single serve side.  It wasn’t coming out, but the heating element under the coffee pot came on by itself.  It smelled like something was on fire and cracked the pot.  Although we  deemed it a fire hazard at that point, we tried various things just to see if we could make it work again.  We could press the function buttons to turn the machine on, but other buttons would randomly light up and nothing would happen.  The machine didn’t need cleaning and we didn’t use hard water in it.  I will not buy this brand again.  This machine was overpriced, didn’t last even 1 year, and obviously had some kind of electrical wiring issues."
I was excited to receive this coffee maker but since day one it was a waste! Every time I filled the water container for the carafe ALL of the water leaked. Won’t be purchasing another coffee maker from them again. Lesson learned.
"The reusable HomeBarista filter results in a VERY weak coffee.  I haven't tried a preloaded pod.  When brewing a pot of coffee, the filter basket often overflows leaving grounds in the pot and a mess in the basket.  What a disappointment from a Cuisinart coffee maker."
"Initially,  the coffee maker worked great.  Both the k-cup and carafe.  Bought it a year ago October.  But for the past month or so,  the single serve has been getting worse and worse.  I cleaned it 4x with descaler, vinegar,  everything I could think of.  But the needle is not piercing the k-cup. Ok, I can deal with pushing down the k-cup. But even when I do that,  it brews watery coffee with grounds in it.I guess that's what I get for not getting an actual keurig machine. I honestly expected better for over $150."
"Well I love the full pot future.  Today for the first time, I tried the single pot and the clean mode. It does work and won't light up. I never tried it new. So most likely it never worked."
"I bought this coffee pot right before surgery, so I wasn't able to really start using it until the past month or so. This unit is so frustrating!  It almost always pours coffee down the side of the pot as you pour a cup, or pour water into the unit.  It keeps showing ""red"" indicating that it needs to be cleaned, I have run water and vinegar through MULTIPLE TIMES!!!  It costs too much money to be this aggravating.  Now I am 2 weeks too late to return it. I would not recommend this coffee maker."
Received this coffee maker yesterday. When I took it out of the package I was shocked how it felt like a 29.99 black and decker model. The lid for the single cup feels weak. My first pot in carafe had lots of ground coffee and yes I know how to make a pot of coffee. We have other cuisinart products and they are solid and well built. If they want to sell this coffee maker it needs to be priced correctly. When we bought this we though it would be better. No food grade plastic either so the hot water that runs through the machine adds plastice particles into your hot coffee to drink. We have no problem buying high end appliances and will pay more than this BUT we expect to have a quality product not a flimsy coffee maker protype that we can buy at a local walmart. This is a 50 dollar coffee maker and that is all.
"Love the idea of this machine.  Thought I would spend more to have more features.  The k cup was always ""overflowing"" so you had grinds in your cup.  Service was to replace the k-cup holder but before that arrive it completely shorted out from my cleaning out the grinds that were everywhere.  Going back to Keurig"
"I bought this coffee pot a year ago. The first one did not work. Had to call customer service still could not get it to work after troubleshooting. They told me to have Amazon replace it so I did. I have had trouble on and off with this coffee pot. It now has officially quit working. I attempted to contact Amazon. I was told to contact the companies customer service so I did and they turned around and told me to contact Amazon where I bought it.  Neither Amazon nor Cuisinart wants to make this right a $200 coffee pot or I should say 199 should last longer than a year and you should not have trouble with it on and off for that year. If I could do negative stars, I would. DO NOT buy this coffee pot. The brand is good but this coffee pot sucks."
"When it finishes brewing it makes 6 LOUD beeps that will wake up anyone next door. So if you're making coffee and don't want to wake someone in the next room do not get this coffee maker.You CAN'T turn the sound off.Pod side does not produce a sound when finished.Also be careful if there is limited space under your cabinets, it produces a lot of excess steam."
"It was an ok coffee maker not the best and not something to write home about but functional. However, less than a year later it won't work. Just stopped. Both pods and cariff just stopped. Does absolutely nothing. I would not buy it again. It didn't wow me for the money. It was nice to have both pod and pot. But for the price I could have bought two separate coffee makers that lasted longer. Horrible to clean."
"I bought this because it says it has a removable water reservoir.  The K cup side has one.  You still have to pour water in the top which means moving it to do so.  It is HEAVY.  Also the K cup side tank is so small. It may hold 3 cups of water, but I doubt it.  I miss my old Ninja already!! The tank on it was removable and you then placed it down and did not have to move the entire system.  This thing sucks!!"
Cannot get pod side of machine to work.  Can’t reach the help desk for assistance. Bought in August 2023.  Not even a year old and $200.00.  Guess I’ll be sticking to the cheap “throw aways” from now on.
Do not buy !!! Only had unit for less than 1 year - we have had so much trouble with the pid side. We have cleaned it as the videos suggested and ran water through it. Light will not even come on. Will never buy this brand again.
"Have had a Keurig Vue for 10+ years, and it started to leak (from underneath).  Decided it might be time to get a new coffee maker (3-4 cups a day ... average ... for 10+ years).  Did my homework, and decided on this one.  Ordered it, but as setting up, realized we needed a reusable filter as we use our own coffee (pods way too expensive ... nothing mentioned on Amazon page).Ready to use new maker (there were a couple of surprises when setting up ... like you need to take out the pod holder and the ""outside"" holder on the My K cup reusable filter to get it to fit).  Ok, figured that out (thank you Google).  Made our first cup, and was surprised to see the coffee came out of not only the right place, but also from the back of the filter basket.  Lost about 1/8 of the cup that first time.  Shortened timeline, couldn't get it to stop leaking (many cups later, moving coffee cup trying to position to catch the leaks), from all different areas of the filter basket.Called Keurig.  They walked me through steps (that I had already done ... not going to kill the messenger, but Keurig, your support needs to think a bit, not just read from a list of questions), and had told them what I had already done.  Again, long story short, they told me they would send me a new coffee maker (thought getting from the mfg. I might be luckier) just had to send them some documentation.Sent them all the screen shots (via email) and reply told me they could not approve.  S/N was blurred (it's on the bottom of the maker which means you have to set it on it's back).  Guess the people approving aren't technologically adept enough to enlarge a photo (I did prior to sending and was able to read the S/N with no issues).  Also, the screen shot I sent of my order confirmation from Amazon wasn't acceptable.  Guess it didn't matter it had the order number, date ordered, and picture of what was ordered.  Also, guess the fact that I had already registered the maker, and had given the serial number to the person I was talking to (three times) didn't count.Anyway, sent another photo of the S/N and another screen shot of my Amazon confirmation, noting this was what Amazon offered.Received an email (next day ... we're now a week into this) expressing their concern over the issue, and if I would reply with my address, Keurig would send me a new one (I had already included a picture of my mailing address, the ref #, and date as required in the original email).  Told them to cancel the request, I was going to get my money back and find another coffee maker.Requested a RMA from Amazon, dropped it off and received my refund within two hours.  Keurig needs to take some lessons from Amazon.Still don't know if it was the coffee machine itself or the reusable filter that caused the problem, and guess Keurig doesn't really care to figure it out."
"After getting tired of dealing with a dribbling carafe lid on our last two Mr. Coffee makers and our bulk coffee starting to get thin in flavor, we opted for this much more expensive Dual Keurig maker and a new brand of coffee.  Our coffee intake had decreased from 6-8 cups per day to one for my wife and three for me.  The plan for the new Keurig was for her to use K-cups and I'd brew enough in the carafe for my wants.Other than having to trial & error various K-cups coffees to find a flavor we liked - difficult at best because most were pretty strong/bitter compared to our 'usual' - the Keurig worked as advertised, making a tasty cup for her and me - once I got used to the bolder, but very smooth Peet's brand.  I'm still working on that.Why Keurig?  There are other brands at AMZ that have the same dual function and are highly rated, but a few friends & relatives have Keurigs and offer few negatives about them.  Unfortunately, I do.If you're a neatnik and don't like having a messy coffee maker greeting you in the morning, this Keurig unit requires extra effort to clean.  It's not just a case of rinsing the K-cup holder and filter basket.  To do the job reasonably well, the thing must be disassembled (see photo), all of the component's nooks & crannies gotten into with a soapy brush, rinsed, towel-dried (I don't like water spots, so don't air dry) and reassembled.  That's about a 5-minutes job for me.  Since my breakfast only consists of toast & coffee, it's annoying to spend more time cleaning up than eating.  Since it's just me and my wife, we rarely dirty enough dishes to use the dish washer more than once or twice/week, so handwashing is our only option.Although a different review should probably be posted, I included the two ""load-your-own"" K-cup holders in the photo to add the comment it's important to NOT overfill them with grounds.  I also use a K-cup, paper filter with them. Too many grounds will result in a loose seal on the lid, allowing the grounds to overflow into the hard-to-reach areas where the K-cup basket and trough sit that lets coffee flow from the K-cup to the hole in the filter basket holder and into your cup.  I noticed that today and spent an extra 10 minutes cleaning out the mess.I infrequently join my wife in a flavored K-cup (Chai Latte) and have found the machine will spit and sputter out around the bottom of the filter basket holder, adding to clean-up chores of the resulting splatter.  We remove the filter basket before using K-cups - one more thing to clean up - and keep the stainless-steel carafe away from the unit or it will catch splatter too.What do I like about this unit?  As mentioned, it makes a tasty cup of coffee, once you find a brand you like.  We're probably over-filtered - whole house filter, water softener, fridge filter (for coffee water) and a filter in the unit's water-source-reservoir.  It's fast - press the power button and the water begins to heat, easily making a K-cup in less than a minute.  The K-cups, although 3 times more expensive than bulk coffee, are very convenient for only one or two cups.  Being able to change position of the water reservoir allows an easy way to figure out the orientation of the unit on the counter.  The stainless-steel carafe keeps coffee hot enough for me.  I'll take about 45 minutes to drink three cups while tending to email, reviewing the calendar, and having toast.  The third cup is not quite as hot as the first one but is still too hot to drink fast.I bought this as a late Christmas gift to myself.  My last two Mr. Coffee drip machines cost about $65 each, but the poorly designed, dribbling carafe lids were a nuisance and I'd hoped this Keurig would eliminate that problem.  I think I've moved from the frying pan into the fire re cleanup.  I wonder if other styles of Keurig makers require so much cleanup between use?"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            There's an advantage for having both K-Cup & Carafe in a combo spout for space saving, but here is the problem. If the K-cup has leak on the seal, the water then overflow outside the the kCup container, it doesn't have proper drainage. It could spill to place that beyond the cup can contain. In the classic design if this happens, the leak still drain within the glass area.The K button seems unecessary if you used to have old Keurig, the brewing process starts after pressing cup size. The new model need to press extra K button to start. In total with this model you need to press 4 buttons to start brew:1 power button2 k-cup or Carafe option3 cup size button4 K buttonSometimes you have to redo step 2-3 when you pressed these when water not hot ready.Overall if you have space probably this not a good option. But the water reservoir location(s) is perfect on this model."
"We love the idea of having both a single serve and a 12 cup craft coffee maker for our short term rental. Unfortunately, there is no safety to stop someone from inadvertently selecting the 12 pot option then putting a cup to receive the coffee resulting in coffee flowing everywhere if this make mistake is made. The design should have included a safety to only allow 12 cups if the craft is in place."
"I bought this to have one machince instead of two separate ones on the counter the size is decent. It has not once produced a full 12 cups of coffee in the carafe which is a bummer.  Therefore ok product would I recommend it, yes, but I would definitely let them know doesnt brew full 12 cups like it states."
"Karafe doesn’t keep coffee warm, far cry from Mr Coffee. K cup operation is fine. Makes the Karafe useless."
"But 120 volts was delivered, it was hard to see the specs on the actual machine (embossed black on black), so when i plugged it (used in the Philippines) — heard an explosion"
"Have had this just under two years. Liked it at first, but couldn’t wait to get rid of it once we decided to switch. The single cup function stopped working some time between 6 months and a year after purchase. It was annoying, but we did typically do pots any way. That area got so gross even though we weren’t using and cleaned it often. Solely using the pot on this seemed kind of pointless. Being there’s no burner, it did not always retain temperature. It did keep it warm but I was frequently reheating a second cup in the microwave instead of being able to go refill from a hot pot on a burner. It’s slim, but it does take up more room than a regular coffee maker. Overall, this machine may be good for someone who is a more frequent single cup drinker (if it won’t stop working like ours) and occasional whole pot drinker. But for our family who likes to drink from a pot, it just doesn’t make sense to have one that doesn’t stay warm. I would not (did not) buy again."
"I've had mine for a few weeks now.  I was using a Zojirushi, which I was pretty happy with.  But, I wanted to be able to make a single cup from time to time.  We don't have room for 2 coffee makers to sit on the counter all of the time, so, this seemed to be worth a try.  I like the flavor of the coffee it brews for the pot.  It's the same coffee we used for the Zojirushi.  But, it does taste better.  But, I'm not a fan of the reusable filters.  Some silt always ends up in the pot.  Also, the coffee isn't very hot and the carafe doesn't keep it very hot for long.  The Zojirushi carafe does a far better job at keeping the coffee hot.The way it seems to work when brewing a pot is like by heating 12 oz or so of water at a time and then emptying that and repeating until the set amount is brewed.  That takes a long time.  Another thing we don't like is that it doesn't produce any kind of signal or tone when the coffee is ready.  So, if you're in the other room waiting for the coffee to finish, you won't notice it's done unless you get up and go look.Another thing I don't like is that it goes into sleep mode in 5 min.  So, if you want to brew just a single pod, you have to turn the power on, wait about 90 seconds for the water to start heating, then it will start brewing the pod, which takes about another 90 seconds.  That's a long time when you're standing in front of it waiting for it to finish.  You can brew a whole pot in a Bunn in about 4 min.Overall, I don't care for it."
"I purchased this coffee maker to replace a Braun coffee maker that made fantastic coffee, but constantly overflowed. This coffee maker is very convenient in that it allows you to use both a carafe and a pod. However, it’s difficult to get a good pot of coffee when using the carafe. It always seems somewhat tasteless. I think it would be an improvement if Keurig changed to a cone type filter instead of the basket. Also, when, using the strong button with the carafe, there’s virtually no difference. In fact, I think the coffee tastes better without using it. The coffee maker works fine with the pod, my only criticism being that the chamber to insert the pod is at the back of the machine. If you have a cabinet over the area where the coffee maker is situated, that may present the problem in lifting the lid to the pod chamber.UPDATE:  I found that the Keurig Duo makes more flavorful pot coffee if you DO NOT use the strong button. This makes some sense because the coffee is drip, not expelled by pressure like with a pod. The strong button merely sends less coffee through the basket at one time, but the water’s resident time in the coffee basket is not increased. However, when you do not use the strong button, I believe the water floods the basket faster, so the waters resident time in the basket is increased, because only a certain amount can flow out of the basket at any moment. I also tamp the coffee down slightly.  If your anal about the taste of your coffee, as I am, these minor changes seem to help a lot."
"I did my research but still was miffed on so many things. So far, I'll keep it but I bought extra warranty. When reviewing read carefully, I thought I was looking at the reviews for the K-Duo Plus 12 Cup with stainless steel carafe but because the seller also had the older K-Duo, when people asked about the hotplate, they were referring to the other one. The one with the stainless-steel carafe does NOT have a hotplate. It's slow...of course I'm used to a BUNN for years and years but it's really slow and I don't understand why I have to hit the power button every time I make a k-pod cup or full pot...it takes a while to reheat. My old Keurig I kept hot all the time. Many people have trouble with the pot leaking, thankfully I haven't had that issue, but where the grounds go, leaks or drips frustratingly. Also, the pot fits in so awkwardly I at first thought the lid didn't even fit and had to ask questions how to keep it hot? When you take out the pot, you physically have to hold where the grounds go, or it pops out at the same time that's how tight it fits. I still haven't figured out how to set the timer to have a pot be finished when I wake up. They really should do away with the 6oz cup and add a 16 oz cup because even at the 12oz it still doesn't fill my coffee mug. For what I paid, it's ok. If BUNN made one that did K-cups and a full pot...that's what I probably would've purchased. It does make a hot pot but doesn't stay warm in pot over an hour 1/2."
"Seems to make pots of coffee fine. But, since it was delivered with the missing kcup holder/lower needle I can't brew  k-cup. I called Kuerig and they ordered one but it won't be here for up to 7 days. I asked about expedited shipping and they said ""No"".Also, as an fyi, shorter people or those in a wheel chair would not like this machine. The controls are on top and fairly high up on a standard counter. I'm personally OK, but I doubt anyone 5'4 would like it.Well, I'm returning the product to Amazon and ordered something else."
"I seldom give a review but wanted to let Keurig  and others know that we are not happy with the Carafe at all. I purchase on reviews and most said it kept coffee hot for hours. The carafe does good to keep it as hot as we like for maybe  30 minutes. All the coffee will not empty from the carafe because of the lip it doesn't graduate down in a slope so coffee/water remains in the pot probably 2 tablespoons or more. I expect a coffeemaker I pay about $200 for to  give more satisfaction in all the features. I am sure these features are tested by someone before it is actually approved that consumers will enjoy using it. Would we buy this type of coffeemaker again, NO!. I guess I will go back to purchasing one by physically shopping in a store so I can check out the features. We had a Keurig before that lasted about 18 months I will probably go to back to a Bunn or Hamilton each of those lasted several years"
The controls are overly complicated with four button presses required to brew a single cup. I have to assume this was done to cut down on the number of physical buttons resulting in a cost savings in manufacture. That would be understandable on a budget coffee maker. It is inexcusable on a high end and very pricey Keurig machine. Overall I am not satisfied with this machine and I would recommend going with a lower cost model unless you have a very specific need for a machine that brews post and single cups and you don't have counter space for the slightly larger but less expensive Dou model.
"It doesn’t make coffee very fast. The coffee splatters when using Small cups , disappointing."
"I love the 12 cup thermal carafe and the ability to make 1 cup.  I like the way it fits in my kitchen with the water reservoir in the back.  I hate that the lid can't be opened up to clean and that after 1 year it's doing the same thing our 1st one did. When set to brew in the am, it brews about 1 cup and shuts off. It works otherwise, but my favorite cup of the day is to stumble downstairs to the smell of freshly brewed coffee and pour one.  Since this doesn't work anymore I'm going to toss it and buy another brand."
"Bought this brewer in Feb of 2023, 1 year 4 months ago and the Auto Brew feature will no longer work.I get up at 3am every morning and it is important to me to have my morning coffee ready when I get out of bed.The K-Cup and manual pot brew work fine on their own but not having the Auto Brew feature is a royal pain.The coffee is good over all but if one thing goes out then who knows what will be next.I have always liked my Keurig products in the past so this is a little disappointing for me. For $200 I think it should have lasted a bit longer"
"I had an older Keurig for many years so I decided to upgrade to this model.  Love the stainless carafe option.  It worked very well for 2 months until one day it would turn off when the brew button was pressed.  Tried unplugging to let it reset but no luck.  Contacted Keurig directly expecting a fiasco.  On the contrary,  they determined my machine was defective and sent a replacement immediately after providing my proof of purchase. Did NOT have to send broken machine back!  Machine #2 was received a few days ago.  I will update review after a sufficient amount of time has passed.  I must say when operating correctly,  this machine brews a great pot of coffee and the k cups come out nice too. Hope this machine stays working."
"The whole reason I purchased this model as opposed to the model with the glass carafe was because of the stainless steel carafe, thinking it would keep the coffee hotter for longer. However, I had no idea that there is NO hot plate on this model so the coffee comes out of the machine lukewarm and goes in to the stainless carafe Luke warm so that's all you get - Luke warm coffee.  The k cup pods seem to produce a much hotter cup of coffee but we make a pot on most days. I will be returning this model to get the model that has the glass carafe with the hot plate.  Other than that, we love all of the other features of this machine - adjustable water reservoir, k cup option, size of the machine, programability. We just don't want to have to microwave our cups of coffee."
This machine delivers good coffee and the versitality of having the K Cup feature is excellent.  It is easy to clean and heated up fast but the pot does not keep the last cup warm despite other reviewers posted when I bought this unit.  I will never buy another without a warming pad.
"To start I love the coffee and loved this machine.  That said, it was bought 4 1/2 months ago.  I loved it until it broke yesterday.  The pump won’t pump, the water just sits in the reservoir.  For quality of the coffee I would rated it at ***** (5 stars), but, because it broke down in 4 1/2 months only ** star rating.  I am toques off at myself for not registering it for warranty but I guess there is nothing I can do."
"I had this machine long enough that the warranty expired and it made good coffee (add a star). Then it just stopped making coffee. I like that the company had an FAQ page and a phone number to call (also add a star), but there was nothing the person helping me could do except say sorry and offer a coupon on a new machine. Why would I spend that much on a new machine that is going to break once the warranty expires?"
"I was seduced.  Combining my cup maker and my pot maker seemed like a brilliant idea.This dude is on a shelf in the basement now.  Old guys are back upstairs.I can't put up with devices that sass back at me.  This one is the pinnacle of temperamental.  Sketchy latch on the cup holder.  Can't actually make pots as big as claimed due to insufficient water tank.  Absolutely will not tolerate third-party refillable cups (which I use a lot due to flavored coffees that aren't in pods, but also general eco-sensitivity about the horrible waste trail associated with those plastic cuppy things.)Third Keurig I've purchased.  First one I've regretted."
"One year update: well, this Keurig is about done. I have hard water, but I have cleaned the machine every couple of months; regardless, either the water or some mechanical failure has ruined this machine. It no longer makes good coffee. It frequently will make 1 cup of coffee even when the selection is 6 or 8. And the coffee is barely warm, never hot. I considered contacting Keurig but they will probably offer me a discount on another overpriced Keurig, so I am going to punt this unit into the trash and get something more reliable. It was good while it lasted.Original reviewA few years ago I bought one of the K-cup machines but since I brew 6 cups as often as one,  it meant having two coffee makers on hand. Then I came across this machine. It is very well engineered and designed. It has a really good water tank and detaches for filling so no more awkward pouring water into a narrow opening. The water tank can be moved to either side or the back; brilliant! Really helps you fit the machine into your kitchen space.It brews a pot from 6 cups to 12 cups and it tastes great. No boiling plate, the pot is insulated and keeps the coffee hot for plenty of time without altering the flavor.  It makes a K-cup that can be adjusted for 6-12 oz.The filter basket and tray are easy to remove and clean. It has an option to brew the coffee a little stronger and an automatic timer.This is really all the way around the best solution for coffee. If there are any shortcomings, I will update this review but so far I don't see any.  Again, so impressed with the design of this machine, I would love to shake the hands of the design team."
"Hey everyone, so I got mine last week on  Thursday 11(April). I work middle  shifts on Thursdays so when I got home  I open the box, set up the machine to use it on Friday morning.  Well, I couldn't, the machine didn't work. Got on the phone with keurig customer service on Friday morning and they help me through what to do. Sadly they say  I'm not eligible for a replacement. Returned yesterday and waiting to purchase a new one again. But I definitely love keurig."
"I bought this thinking, this is exactly what I needed! I wanted a coffee pot and K-cup at the same time. While I love making this quick cup of coffee, it’s when I brew a pot. The plate is plastic! The pot of coffee does not stay! I was very disappointed! This sucks"
"For the amount of money this unit cost the coffee should be hot, but it's tap hot and the thermal pot should keep it hot but it doesn't. I'm very disappointed. It should also have a single use option besides using pods."
"We had a unit just like this one, which stopped working. So bought the same model on Amazon. This new unit stopped working only a couple days after purchasing. Returned it for a full refund. Don’t waste your money!"
Not really worth the money that I paid for this it’s nice but the coffee pot is self does not stay warm because there’s no heating plate underneath so the coffee when it comes out hot by the time it gets in the pot. It’s only warm not hot.
"I’ve had a single serve Keurig for years and it has brewed thousands of cups of coffee without any issues.  But, I wanted a unit with a water reservoir and this one had the extra capability of making a pot of coffee, not just individual cups, so I bought it.  First couple of uses were fine, then I started noticing water on the counter if I left the reservoir on the unit for even a few minutes after use.  I called Keurig and, after sending them receipts, photos, etc., they said throw it away - we’ll send you a new one.  So I get the new one and it immediately does the same thing - water all over the counter.  Called Keurig, more photos, etc. - throw it away we’ll send you a new one.  So, now we’re on unit number three - I’ve given up calling Keurig - my procedure is to fill the reservoir, quickly make a cup and remove the tank immediately - and, keep a towel handy to sop up the water that it spilled around and under the unit.You can’t put the reservoir on wrong - the problem is that there is a spring loaded valve in a nipple on the bottom of the tank, that nipple fits into a receiver on the side of the unit and is sealed by a flexible ring that fits around the nipple (“O” ring, “H” ring - I can’t really tell).  There is a pointed piece in the center of the receiver that overcomes the spring and allows the water to flow in to the body of the unit - except that, the flex ring doesn’t seal the nipple and the water migrates up along the bottom of the tank and on to the counter.  The tank is transparent and you can see the water working its way up around the nipple and under the tank.Anyway, I would recommend that you avoid this model."
"After retirement I started making coffee at home more frequently. I had been using a french press occasionally but wanted something a bit more automatic. I got a super cheapo Mr Coffee at the hardware store that made good coffee after quite a bit of experimentation. Then I decided to splurge on one of those fancy pod coffee makers and I chose this Keurig based on the name brand.I'm not a coffee snob. It all tastes pretty much the same to me but wow the pod coffee is terrible. I flushed the system when it was new according to the instructions. I tried multiple brands of coffee pods, different types: medium roast, dark roast, etc, the strength button off and on. Why does it taste so bad? I don't know enough about coffee to describe the taste: not bitter or sour, just bad. I've gone back to my entirely satisfying Mr. Coffee.A relative keeps telling me to get a Nespresso but I just don't think my quest for totally automatic mindless coffee making is worth it anymore."
"Initially, the concept is a good one. I've had this maker since 7/2023, used it daily but have recently retired it. Keurig should just stick to what it knows best and that's k cups. I've found that through trial and error it wasn't me making inferior coffee but the machine. It does NOT make a good cup of drip coffee. I started out using my regular brand but found it wasn't tasting as it once did. I tried adjusting the measurements but that didn't help either. I then switched to another brand but again, did not get the results I wanted. I kept switching out brands, making adjustments but nothing helped. The coffee taste tends to be either bland, burnt or have a strong bitter after taste. I finally brought out my trusted drip coffee pot, used my regular brand of coffee and found that my coffee was back to tasting as it normally had which is a nice deep flavor and absolutely no bitter after taste. Normally, I don't do reviews but felt compelled to do this one as I can't be the only person experiencing this problem. It's too late for me to return the pot, but if anyone is considering buying it, I would suggest making a drip pot with your regular brand. If it doesn't taste right to you, then no matter what you do to adjust the prep, it will not help."
"I was so excited and wanted to like this sooo bad but was so disappointed. Our other keurig bit the dust after only 2yrs and we’ve been using our keurig mini from our RV while shopping for a new coffee maker. I saw this one and thought it would be perfect for our needs. I was sadly disappointed and it’s not like the bar was set real high either. The first disappointment was it brews significantly less than what you select- Karafe if you select 6 cups it only brews 3.5 cups, single k cup if you select 12oz it only brewed 8 oz. We take travel mugs to work and the single only fills them half full. The coffee tastes awful. The karafe doesn’t keep the coffee warm whatsoever. Was like luke warm 10 minutes after being brewed. The auto brew feature did work is the only positive. Not sure if we just got a defective one? Will be sending this back."
"I bought this because it had the duo brew options - carafe and K-cup. The size was perfect, fit under the cabinets, didn’t take up much space, and wasn’t an eyesore. Once I got used to how to program the auto brew I flew through it. The water reservoir is great - so easy to access and can be put on whatever side of the coffee maker you choose. How convenient is that?!?! What I don’t like is that if you auto brew and expect to see it in the morning you can’t visually tell if it’s brewed or not. And because there’s the metal carafe, which is great BTW for keeping the coffee hot, you never know how much is left in the pot. As soon as it’s finished brewing the coffee maker turns off. I would’ve given it 4-stars had it not stopped working after 2 months. I would’ve liked to have exchanged it for the same thing, but if I can’t rely on it working for more than a couple months then I don’t want to be bothered with it happening again."
"I bought the Keurig K-Duo Plus Coffee Maker 2 years ago and it worked very well till now. The taste was great, the temperature was right and the maintenance was easy. However lately it has stopped making a full pot of coffee. It stops halfway and wastes all the coffee powder in it. When I contacted support via phone, the agent kept making troubleshoot the pod size even after repeatedly telling her the problem was with the carafe side. Finally she gave up and said the troubleshooting was not successful and since my machine is out of warranty she said she could only offer me a 10% discount on a machine but not do anything about this. After paying $200 or so I expect the machine to last a lot more than 2 years. This even after me keeping up with the maintenance schedule(filter replacement, descaling, etc.) It made a very good cup of coffee while it worked, however for the price point I won't recommend it if it only works for 2 years."
"ProsFull coffee pot brew optionWater tank placement optionsCompact designSimple buttons/programConsPoor reusable pod optionsMessy if pod failsPricey pod filtersI have had a keurig coffee maker before. We purchased this one to have a pod and full pot brew all in one machine. The smallest full pot option is 6. The options go 6, 8, 10, and 12 with button inputs along with the designated pod or pot setting (picture included). I strongly dislike the limited options for reusable pods. After researching I found a compatible reusable coffee pod that works but uses more expensive filters. It is the type of pod that requires a paper filter. My old reusable pod from the previous Keurig was not compatible.I did not purchase the Keurig reusable pod due to the reviews it was rated. I may try it though if it gains independence from paper filters. Last time I checked though Amazon was out of stock for the pod.I try to use this on the daily for the reusable pod. For making a pot it is easy peasy and it is convient that the water tank supply can be moved into three different directions. Please follow the instructions carefully when changing the water tank position. It isn't flimsy but it certainly isn't as simple as flipping a light switch.If there was a better reusable pod I would easily give this coffee beast 4 stars or more."
"I had this coffeemaker for about a year and six months and loved it. The size of this unit is very versatile for different spaces.  I love having a hot cup of coffee waiting for me first thing in the morning ready to go. This is where everything started to go downhill with the unit. The auto brew feature just stopped working. Not long after that, it would not brew a full pot of coffee, followed by the K-cup feature not giving the full amount either. I talked with customer service at Keurig to see about warranting it out. The customer service agent was very nice and helpful and walked me through troubleshooting.  After that was complete it was agreed upon the unit was defective. I was informed the coffee maker was out of warranty (one year warranty) and 20%off a new one was all they could do for me. This was pretty disappointing considering how much they charge for these. I believe looking into a brand with a better warranty is the direction I will move in going forward."
Had only 6 mths an will not make coffee pods or reg coffee. Like it just shuts off when you hit start does nothing. Not impressed
"Bought this on a recommendation from family. We don't usually make large amounts of coffee at one time but sometimes on the weekend hubby will. I did like the fact you could do either. I also liked the fact you could move the water tank around to fit your space. It was actually smaller then my current Keurig 2.0, which is 9yrs old. It says you can use universal pods but the only way to make ours fit was to take the pod holder out and remove the plastic holder on our universal pod. Water would leak out of the basket area all over the sides and make a terrible mess. It would also fill up with water after each use. It didn't matter if you were using a pod or the basket to make a carafe of coffee. The first time I went to pull the basket holder out after making a carafe of coffee, I got burnt from the hot water and it was filled to the top. Of course that made of a terrible mess to clean up. I did notice the coupons that were in the box expired 3yrs ago, so that tells you how old that machine is and just sat on a shelf somewhere. I definitely wouldn't recommend this item, especially for the amount of money you pay for it. We just boxed it up and sent it back. We currently are using our old Keurig, until I find a replacement."
"I loved this machine, but after a few uses, the coffee flavor comes out burnt. I thought it was the coffee, but it only happened every other time. I cleaned, descaled and ran the machine a few times, still nothing."
Kuerig coffee maker arrived on time but when I plugged it in it did not work at all. I sent it back
"I purchased this is August 2023. Shortly after using it the reservoir would leak from the bottom. I did some investigating and found that the spring loaded piece would stick open. No problem, I bought a replacement part from keurig.After a few months the brewer would only fill the carafe between 1/2 and 3/4. We cleaned and descaled regularly so it was odd. The. In March when we would start a brew cycle it would make a noise as if it was drawing the water but after 10 seconds it would just shut off. No matter how many times we’d try that’s all it would do.I called keurig and they sent a replacement. About 2 months later it was doing the exact same thing.I called keurig and asked for a refund. They told me that they can only refund items bought directly from them. So I reached out to Amazon(which is next to impossible) and was informed that the window to return the brewer was closed.Now I’m out $160 for a product that came with a 1 year warranty eve. Though it’s only 10 months old and been replaced once. While $160 may not seem like much, it’s the most expensive coffee maker I’ve ever purchased and both parties(the manufacturer and the seller) basically said “that sucks lol”.Don’ waste your money."
"I have had keurigs for as long as they have been out.  This is my least favorite.  I wanted dual which it does but the reservoir will only hold enough for a pot and I'm filling it multiple times a day.  My old ones stayed hot so I could just put in a pod but this one turns off so you have to wait for it to get hot everytime. Too many buttons to push each time, it doesn't store any settings.  I guess for $200 I was just had higher expectations.  It does make good coffee."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Arrived wet as if used or tested. Looked new meaning no scuffs or marks or coffee grains, but water was all over the unit inside the under the wrapping let alone the box! Wasn't sure wether to go thru the hassle of calling amazon to issue a return/exchange which would take over a week by my calculations. Which meant no coffee for that long maybe longer! So I said the heck with it, it looked clean at least so I decided to try it. And sure enough, it worked perfectly. The drip setting gave me a stronger brew, much better than your standard no frills Mr Coffee drip version which wasn't doing it for me as far as producing a stronger brew even at strong setting. So this Keurig won on that count. Still waiting for my resuable K-cup to arrive from amazon which is running several days late already. So I can comment on it yet.Cons:Manual sucks! It doesn't clearly illustrate how to set the time and there is a sequence to using this machine which is not clear or intuitive for the user. Thank god for YouTube tutorials because the manual was usless though well printed. Its a one page fold rather than a booklet which they need to make illustrate a section for setting time alone. The included quick start manual says nothing about other hidden features that the YouTuber mentioned like holding the hour(H) button 5+ seconds to activate changing the time. Or that you need to set your time first else the unit will not work. You can't bypass this like with other coffee makers. So this is a very important step they fail to mention. Manual doesn't show the steps to brewing your first brew. Its a little involved at first but easy once you know how. But its not going to be very self explanatory for the tech challenged is what I mean, like your 80 year old mother who's a devil if she misses a cup since born to it. 🤣 So YouTube the duo plus and you'll learn all you need to know."
"What a great idea, a combo machine with a insulated carafe, right?  Well, as with many things that are duel purpose, this rig does one thing great and one thing just so so...  The Keurig part of the machine was great, with the removable reservoir (great for cleaning), the 'strong' button and size choices, it was perfect!  The coffee maker was great as well, until you got to keeping the coffee hot.  It dispensed at a really lovely temperature, but cooled in the carafe in just a few hours.  Know I know some of you may say ""a few hours?  WTH, how long should it stay hot?"" and I say at least 3 or 4 hours.  Not piping hot, but drinkable hot.  I guess I was spoiled with my, well, lets say it rhymes with squeezeanart, thermal carafe on my old machine and expected a similar result, so I am jaded.  If your going to drink your coffee right away, this machine is a good drip coffee maker.  If your going to let it sit for a while, ehhh, I would think of maybe getting another style of drip coffee maker and a Keurig Mini Plus for your instant coffee needs.  (That's what we did!)  Hope this helps."
"This is my third and last Keurig I will own! The very first one lasted a few years , 2nd one about 2 years , this one last then 2 months . God knows where these are made now . Tried to return ….NIGHTMARE ! I bought it as a deal day purchase .  Tried to exchange it through Amazon 53 minutes the end result is , we can’t exchange because we don’t have enough in stock , but they have some instock. Then they said they would refund but there is a $30 fee .  So the want to refund me the original cost take $30 to restock something that needs to be thrown away and if I want to replace the price is now hirer . Supervisor you called in looking for a refund . Ugh explained the entire thing and the reason they can not exchange is because the instock items are from a different vendor . DO U THINK I CARE WHAT VENDOR ???  I bought it from Amazon , if they replace from a different vendor they can give them back the defective one !Many of my friends have been experiencing the same type of return , exchange, bs restocking fee and refund issues . More and more products are now coming for countries that you have no way to contact because they hide behind emails that go unanswered. The quality of the product is going down hill and quickly while we pay the retail prices . I love Amazon love the variety , I hope Amazon starts taking note how much they are spending on hood will credits .  So super disappointed."
"Keurig is great, until it isn’t. I’m done with Keurig, I have owned 6 different machines all lasting less than two years (why has it taken me this long?) obviously Keurig are not designed for everyday use, Going to Cuisinart!"
"Loved the options, pods or a pot, loved the water tank, everything great until 11.5 months in, just won't turn back on. I would buy it again, but $200.00 for a year? I might as well go to Starbucks....."
"My first Keurig was the duo.  Worked one day, next dead.  I really wanted a Keurig so I found the Keurig plus, impressed with features and smaller footprint.  So I ordered it but out of the box, the new Plus didn’t work so I  returned.  Dudes happen so I ordered another one.  Returning it.  At least this one allowed me to test it.  Coffee is warm not hot when it is dispensed.  Since the stainless steel carafe doesn’t seal well the coffee is cold within the carafe in  less than a hour.  Not 2 hours as the Keurig website states.  Maybe the testers like warm to cold coffee instead of hot coffee.  No warming plate to keep the carafe warm.  Great design but Keurig plus needs a lot of work to pass the $200+ price point.Keurig Customer service no service call  was a joke.  This guy must have walked in off the street and been hired.  I got so exasperated that I put the call on speaker so my husband could hear the conversation.  Even my husband started laughing and kept telling me to simply hang up but I meant the customer rep was going to at least be able to spell my 5 letter last name.  Finally he could spell my last name and I told him that I was proud of his  accomplishments but I was going to hang up.  We all understand that call centers are outsourced but at least hire people that can read a screen.  Boxed up and returning the coffee machine.Keurig a great design but that is all.I am in my 70’s and have owned a lot of different brands of coffee makers.  In my experience, Keurig is the worst.  I was extremely disappointed in this product.  This is my last Keurig."
"I purchased the Keurig K-Duo Plus Coffee Maker during Amazon Prime Days 2023. I would never buy this coffee maker again! I ended up putting the coffee pot away because of the coffee maker's inconsistency brewing the selected amount of coffee. I brewed a full pot (12 cups) and barely got enough for my husband and I to each have a cup. It's complicated to set up the timed brewing, and you'll need to be careful to select the pot instead of the cup--it's an easy mistake to make. I'll be purchasing a different brand next time I purchase and pot and single serve coffee maker combo in the future!!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            What I really liked about this Keurig coffee maker was the removable reservoir that can be placed in multiple locations based on your kitchen layout.However, a pot of coffee brewed into the carafe does not stay hot very long since there is no heating plate. I figured the ""thermal carafe"" would keep the coffee hot, but just a short 10-15 minutes after the brew cycle is complete the coffee is luke warm at best; especially if you are adding milk or cream. If you want it hot you'll have to microwave the coffee before adding milk or cream.I returned the coffee maker for that reason. I have had nothing but bad luck with Keurigs over the past few years and would not recommend buying any of their products at this point.  I instead purchased a Ninja CP301 which is what I should have done in the first place. For anyone considering a machine like this, I highly recommend you check out the Ninja instead. It does  A LOT more for the same price without the need for wasteful pods."
"I so wanted to love this machine. When I first hooked it up and turned it on, I made the first “cleansing cups” of coffee. Then I set it up to make a cup of coffee, pushed all the buttons and waited, and nothing happened. Machine turned itself off.  I thought that was a fluke or my own stupidity (I’m notoriously bad with technical stuff).  The try and it worked.  It seem like each time the coffee maker sat for a while before I turned it on when I powered it up and selected my preferences, it would sit there for a few minutes and then turn itself off without making any coffee.  This didn’t happen every time but it happens often enough to be very annoying given that I would go away and come back and find that I didn’t have coffee!  So, after two weeks of fiddling with this, I figured it was not worth the money to have an unreliable machine. I called customer service, but they really weren’t much help and couldn’t explain why the machine would just not work some of the time.  I packaged it up and returned it, and I’m ordering a Cuisinart instead. After digging into the reviews, I think that they have a quality assurance problem. So, it would be a great coffee maker if you are lucky enough to get one that works consistently."
"So this machine does everything it should very well.  I can toggle between K-cups when I want coffee fast or when I have guests, I can brew a nice pot of coffee in an insulated carafe.  I love this dual capability in a single unit.  The coffee always tastes great.Update after 3 months.  I noticed that my coffee cups were not getting as full of coffee but it was gradual.  Then I noticed after brewing my K-cups that there was water leaking after it was finished and it was a lot.  Not that occasional drip.  I finally decided to investigate and low and behold, the filter basket was flooded full of water!  I haven't used that in 2 months!  I emptied it out and brewed another K-cup.  Upon checked the filter basket, there was 1/2 inch of water in it.  Something is not working correctly!  No water should go there when I am brewing a K-cup.  I have reached out to Keurig and will update what I hear back from them."
"Loved the pot But to program for morning coffee and to get it to set the night before was not great!!!! Had to unplug every night, reset clock for regular time and keeping trying to get to get Auto setFor morning.My brother had the same problem also. Loved how you had water reservoir come off to put water in but you also had to make sure the reservoir was setting extra close so magnateAt Top could touch coffee pot otherwise all the water wasn’t pulled out."
"Timer is not dependable, sometimes it comes on, sometimes it doesn’t.  Never gets hot enough, have to heat more in microwave."
When I got it the water reservoir leaked. I had to contact kuerig for a replacement. While it is convenient to have a water reservoir the annoying thing is that I have a 16 oz yeti cup. And I used to just pour that amount of water into my old keurig and it would make that much in coffee. Now I have to choose the oz and the max is 12. Stupid part is they actually offer 6oz. But who makes a 6 oz cup of coffee? Most coffee cups these days are 16 oz. Had I realized the design of this I probably wouldn’t have bought it. Would have stuck with the old version were you just pour your water into the top yourself with each use.
"I purchased this two years ago, about one year in it started to not brew as well, only brewing about 6 cups when I selected 12 cups. My mom also has the same model, and it did the exact same thing for her 1 year in. Now it won’t brew more than a couple ounces after selecting 12 cups. Keurig will not replace it after one year, so definitely not worth the money. I spent $200 for a coffee maker for 2 years. Things are just not built well anymore, Especially this coffee maker."
"Purchased this for tea and coffee for company. Does not work well with tea, and if I knew that would have just bought a small coffee maker for occasional company. Did not really think about the fact that when you use a tea bag you let the tea steep. This just pours hot water over tea grounds with the k-cup, no steeping even on the strong setting. The tea had no taste and was bitter. So if you’re getting it for just tea I would think twice. Unhappy with it but don’t think I can return since I have tested it."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Ok, I bought this Keurig K Duo Plus in mid September 2022 as I like the removable reservoir and being able to use grounded coffee or pods.  After 1 month of trouble free use it started acting up.  The power would shut off after only making a partial pot.  I tried restarting, unplugging for a time to maybe reset but no changes.  October 17, I contacted Keurig customer service and they asked some questions and had me try some fixes.  They seemed to think it had something to do with the ‘auto’ function, but I had never used that function.  They decided I to send me a new one which I received within a week.We used it with no issues for a month and it started having the exact same issues.  November 15, called customer service again.  I requested to be refunded as I had lost confidence in the product.  They wouldn’t refund me.  They sent me another one.  The only difference was they requested I send the defective one back.  They supplied a shipping label so I just had to drop at a UPS.  So we received our 3rd coffee maker and have been using each morning.  Yesterday, December 17, it didn’t make a full pot.  I made a mental note as it had been about a month, again!  Well, this morning it would only made about 3 cups and shut down and it won’t brew anymore!  Number 3 has bit the dust.  I do find it odd that I’m not seeing more reviews with this issue considering 3 out of 3 have gone bad for me.?I’ll request a refund again tomorrow but I am not optimistic.  The video is from the latest one but is exactly how the previous 2 were."
"Until recently we've enjoyed it quite a bit, but lately when brewing K-Cups it has begun, some how, missing the cup. I haven't witnessed it to try to figure out what might be going wrong, but I have tried to investigate it afterwards and can't find anything clogged or anything like that so I'm really not sure why it would be doing that, but we've had like half a mug of coffee just end up on drain tray sometimes."
The water container is very lose.
"This brewer started out with lots of promise when we bought it in late 2020, but we're just about ready to pitch it and go back to a Bunn. It makes great coffee, either a pot or a cup, when it's not clogged with scale. Our water is hard here, but we've never had to clean any coffeemaker on a weekly basis before this one. We make 3 to 6 pots of coffee per week, and the need for descaling has become more and more frequent as time has passed. I think this may be an inherent problem with the Keurig water heating/pumping system. The Keurig heats the water as it is pumped through the internal workings, much like an on-demand water heating system for the home. Based on the flow rate of water through the machine, I'm guessing the water tubing is relatively narrow, and thus more susceptible to scale clogging. At this point we have to run a tank of vinegar through the machine weekly, and let it set for about 24 hours to dissolve enough scale buildup in the inner workings to be able to begin the water rinse portion of the process. I'm expecting this unit to permanently clog sometime within the next 6 months or so, and we will throw it away and look at other brands."
"Machine quit working (water pump) after 11 months.  Fortunately, it was warrantied for 12 months.  Operation also has to follow specific steps in sequence - it is not obvious, and guests were always confused when trying to operate on their own."
"While it worked, I loved the look and convenience of this coffee maker. I don't use it frequently, so greatly appreciate its flexibility when guests are visiting. Although I've had it for about 1.5 years, I've probably only used it about ten times. I started a pot over the weekend when my kids were visiting and the machine lost power after brewing about 1/2 pot, never to light up again. I've been told this is a potential issue with Keurig machines. The machine was not, by any means, inexpensive. It is now out of warranty and after a handful of uses, the best Keurig would do is offer me a discount to purchase a new one. How can this possibly make any sense if another ends up dying with the same problem. Extremely disappointed in what I thought was a high quality brand. I have learned otherwise. Don't waste your money and experience this similar aggravation."
"The unit worked for maybe 1 month.  Afterwards we had issues with the water leaking out the sides. Thought it was a scaling issue or something we were doing.  After trouble shooting, nothing was fixing it.  We would put the pod in, follow instructions, then water would just leak out everywhere (center, sides, etc.).  We also have something like this at the office and that has no issues.  This one was just awful and we could not figure it out.  We tried.  Now I've contacted customer service at KEURIG and they are not helpful at all.  Repeatedly asking me to describe the issue, but not offering any help or solution or replacement.  I will just throw the unit away and stop stressing over the money wasted.  Maybe if you don't have any issues or don't a lemon it will be OK?  But if you do have any issues, return RIGHT AWAY or else you'll be stuck with throwing it away probably.  I'm pretty disappointed in Keurig, thought the company would stand behind their products."
"This product stopped working just shy of two (2) years.  Keurig Customer service gave me 50% off a new one with a one (1) year warranty.  Unfortunately, the 50% off was from original price of 229.99 which brings this coffee maker to $115.00.  This coffee maker is being sold all over the internet $149.99.  Yes you save $34.00 but it should be 50% off the selling price of $149.99.  Based on reviews, this items stops functioning quite often.  Not worth it."
"I have owned several Keurig brand products in my life and they have always been high quality. I was very excited to try this carafe/cup combo as the appearance, size, and functionality seemed perfect for my needs. So, I was disappointed today when the coffee maker arrived inside the manufacturer's box with no packaging, wrapping, foam, etc. There was nothing protecting the machine whatsoever. The coffee maker was just banging around inside the box throughout the delivery process. I could hear it rattling around inside the box as I carried it inside from my carport. I bought this as a used item with ""minor cosmetic damage."" I knew it wouldn't be brand new and may have some scratches/dents- but I expected it to function. The water reservoir was entirely cracked and unusable. The handle of the filter basket was also broken off and floating around inside the box. Considering how it was (wasn't) packaged, I didn't trust that the machine would function reliably either. Possibly there was only minor cosmetic damage before it was shipped to me, but it arrived totally busted. I can't comprehend why it was mailed in this way. I immediately returned it to a UPS dropoff location. After several weeks of not receiving a refund, I contacted Amazon customer service. They told me that the reason it was taking so long was because it was ""a high value item""!!!! I told them that was ironic because they shipped it to me like it was worth absolutely nothing."
"I liked the idea of a 12 cup coffee maker and K-Cup pods in one machine. I ordered this to replace a leaking Ninja coffee bar machine. I could never get this machine to make anything but lukewarm bitter coffee. It pales in comparison to the Ninja coffee bar I previously owned. I return this machine and we ordered the Ninja for flavorful, hot coffee. I was very disappointed in this coffee maker."
I do like how hot the coffee staymy coffee brews at 430am and by 9 it's still warm. The flow is a little slow but after paying 199 I should not be looking for another coffee pot when this was just purchased in July. Every day my coffee is different some days strong and others weak I use same coffee same scooper and same water n settings. When I empty coffee grinds most of them are not wet the cup setting is great but 12 cup full coffee pot I dislike
"UPDATE:6 months into the purchase and it is now defunct.  The machine leaked three cups of coffee in a row all over the kitchen counter! I've inspected and cleaned it each time. I am now purchasing another coffee maker.  This purchase didn't even make it one year and all I asked of it was 2 cups of coffee per day, but it couldn't make it.  And yes I tried multiple brands of cups.First Review: Purchased this 5 months ago and it was wonderful, at first.  Five months later, the lid which perforates the coffee cup no longer stays closed unless I put a weight on top and their are now coffee grounds in my coffee (a lot) so I have to filter the coffee again.  The product is too costly to return, it would cost one forth the price I purchased it to return it.  Maybe this is a fluke, but now my morning coffee has became a daily annoying habit!"
"HONEST REVIEWER: 2 stars because it does make drinkable coffee.Before buying, I always do my research and look for the best overall quality product and price. That's why I chose this Keurig coffeemaker. However, my first cup of coffee was only warm, not hot. The ""strong"" button doesn't seem to make a difference in taste. Overall, I was not impressed."
"Leaks bad it fills the pot coffee, basket with water when you don’t even use it. I have reached out several times, but nobody has returned any of my messages. Look at another product. this is what happens after I make a pod. Never used the pot ever."
"I almost never review anything, but for the money, this should have lasted at least until it could die the day after the warranty expired. First the pod part stopped working. It would just shut itself off when trying to make a cup of coffee, leaving drips of coffee in the bottom of the mug. So now we had what any $20 cheap coffee maker could do, brew carafes. That lasted about another two weeks, and now that's not working either.Can I call the warranty number? Sure. Is that a hassle I don't expect or want, especially after spending almost $200 on this lemon? Yep. Since this was replacing a machine by Keurig that only made it about four months past its warranty period, I think we're breaking up with Keurig. Sorry Keurig, it's not us, it's you."
I've had mine for a round a year now it leaks coffee out all over the countertop the part that holds the K-Cups doesn't close anymore so I have to use a jar of pickles to hold it down and I spent $160 on a coffee pot that a cheap Mr coffee is better thought I would get a quality product and it's the farthest thing from quality I've ever seen I'm totally disappointed with it for how much money I had to spend on it I'd say don't buy this model at all. Garbage
"We owned a Cuisinart for a long time before we purchased this. The thermal carafe idea is great because the coffee does not keep cooking in a glass pot on a warmer. The carafe in this model does not keep the coffee warm at all! My husband wakes up much earlier than me and with this coffee maker, I had to heat it up in the microwave. I gave it two stars because I love the idea of being able to use both, and it can be used in narrow spaces."
"I would have given this coffee machine a 5… until I figured out you can not empty the machine completely of water for storage. Bought the machine for our RV which sometimes gets stored along with the coffee machine for a few weeks sometimes months. I know we can run water through when first using it again, but not knowing what’s going on inside the water tank just turns me off.  Had I known the internal tank could not be emptied and cleaned, I would not have bought it/ otherwise we loved the machine.  If you need to store the machine for longer periods, I would not recommend it."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            After 4 months the machine says add water, even though it's full. A quick web search shows that this is a common, well-known problem. Temporary fixes like bouncing the water chamber up and down gave it an extra 2 months. But for the price,  6 months is a terrible life span."
"We had one of these for years and loved it. The kcup lid eventually wouldn’t stay closed so moved to cabin when that other coffee maker broke. So we ordered another one of these. When it came, we niticed that the coffee seemed too hot and weaker and the carafe didn’t keep it warm ad ling as the okder version but decided to live with it. Then 6 months into it, it completely stopped working. Contacted Keurig and they sent out a new one under warranty. This one had issues from first pot. After first pot, it automatically shut off but not like an auto shut off…when tried to power uo, had to go through resetting clock to brew anything…pot or kcup. This continued for days then began shutting off cup or two into a full pot brew cycle. Had to power up, reset clock, then it finished. This is only four fays into it and contacted Keurig again. After explaining everything over and over, they are going to try again. I don’t understand how they shipped a (new?), product that didn’t work day one? Coffee doesn’t seem to brew as rich as first model on strong or not and the carafe seems definitely less insulated, and they aren’t working? Have they cheapened the product while raising prices? One more try then ask for refund if had issues again."
"I bought this Keurig coffee maker  hoping it would last. I had it 6 months, then it started shutting off without making coffee. I got it working again, and now 3 months later it won't work at all. Turn it on, then shuts off. It's a piece of crap. Don't waste $200. For nothing.  Would like to atleast get this replaced somehow.Update:  I called Keurig and they are sending me a new machine.  They stand behind their warranty.  But, still it shouldn't be breaking in less than a year."
I bought this as a gift for my husband who makes coffee all the time at home. I noticed the other day the lid wouldn’t close. I told him and he said it’s been like that for months but he just delt with it. Unfortunately I was two weeks past the one year warranty so they couldn’t help. It’s a very expensive coffee maker to have to hold down the lid the whole time your making coffee for a pod. I love the carafe but when you’re just needing to make one cup be sure your lid will close all the way after a couple months of usage and don’t miss your deadline like me.
Nicely designed for compact space on counter to brew single cup or pot. Disappointed that coffee does not brew hot enough and there is not an option to brew 4 cups in the carafe.
"Within 4 months of having this product it stopped working altogether. I contacted Keurig directly and they sent a replacement under warranty. 13 months after receiving the replacement, it also stopped working altogether. Because we’re now 1 month out of warranty the best they could do was offer me a “discount”, which was the exact same sale running on their website. After two failed machines, I’ll be going with a different brand."
"This works fine for the carafe brews, though I really hate the design of the carafe. The way the lip is designed it's really hard to pour out the last drop of coffee (or water if you're cleaning it.) My main issue is the single-serve function. It brews an absolutely disgusting watered-down cup of ... coffee? I got this to replace my perfectly fine single serve Keurig because I wanted the dual function but what a mistake.When I called customer service it just got worse. The first time I explained the issue and then was disconnected. I called back and wasted 20 minutes with someone who didn't understand me, had me run through a cleansing cycle then said so the buttons aren't working correctly right? Which was not the problem at all. Then when I asked to speak with someone else she said she would transfer me to a US representative."
"A bit tricky to get the steps down just right; but I did.  Had a nice honeymoon stage.  At about two months it started giving weak coffe.  I cleaned everything with vinegar solutions (five of them).  A week later, it did it again.  Cleaned again.  My question is this:  Why, if you are using filtered water and (in my case), filtered wter is going in even before their filter, does it clog up over the pot?  It's just water!"
"After 5 months the lid that closes on the single cup cartridge failed to lock in place. We contacted their customer service dept. who sent us an email with instructions how to get a replacement. The instructions were THREE PAGES LONG. We had to provide a photo of the unit, a photo of the serial number sticker, a photo of a handwritten note with my full name, today’s date and an obscure number that we had to hunt for in the email. THEN we had to provide the original confirmation of the order from Amazon and then the specific confirmation receipt it was delivered. The last two items I pulled directly, as documents, from the Amazon website. THEN the documents and photos all had to be converted to high-resolution JPEGs. After finally getting all this together and emailing it all back to them, per their exhausting instructions, they had the nerve to write back and say sorry, no replacement for you because THE EXACT CONFIRMATION RECEIPTS FROM AMAZON were “BLURRY”. Blurry? High-resolution documents (not photos, not screenshots) that could not have been clearer if they were 2400 dpi images rendered in Photoshop. It’s Keurig’s way of being sure they NEVER have to replace their defective products. Never again, done with KEURIG forever."
"Both my parents and I bought one of these about a year ago. We did the suggested descaling maintenance but the carafe does not complete a full pot anymore. My parents pot ended up having electrical issues and won’t even turn on now. Keurig was super unhelpful with this issue and only offered them a 20% discount on a new machine. Considering the price of this coffee maker, one year is not the kind of longevity I am looking for. Don’t waste your money."
"Always been a Keurig fan and was very excited to order this as we are huge coffee fans.  Long story short, there is something wrong with these that causes them to stop working at the 3 month mark.  They are absolute junk.  Since I was smart enough to learn that after the first one died just before the 3 month mark, I ordered a second one since I liked the design and water capacity.  The second one also died just past the 3 month mark.  So, just under $400 dollars down the drain and hunting for something that is built better and will last longer than 3 months."
The unit worked great for 18 months and then the seams came apart and it started leaking all over the counter.
"Inadequate drainage/spread of water over coffee grounds leave grounds half wet and half dry. Something seems to clog over time. I suspect it is steamed coffee/splashback into the drip hole(s). The water line has been maintained with clean charcoal water filters and I did clean it with vinegar on 3 separate occasions over the time I have owned it (meaning I filled the water reservoir up with vinegar and ran the machine). I have a feeling the smaller water holes are clogged, but poking the holes with anything would just poke whatever is in there back up the line, further clogging things up. I never did use the K-cup feature.This is an expensive and inadequate coffee maker if you're making drip coffee. Oh yeah, and you can't make less than 6 cups of coffee. There's no option for 2 or 4."
"Even after thorough cleaning, the Keurig coffee make will not make a full carafe of coffee. It will not recognize the number of cups selected. The coffee grounds will make the basket overflow even after cleaning as suggested by Keurig. Ver poor product design. Also, coffee does not get hot only lukewarm. Will never again purchase another Keurig product if this is what they market."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Of course it starts spewing water out the sides a month after my one year warranty ended. It was a great coffee maker, I loved how quickly you could brew after turning it on, fairly compact, and you could pre set a brew time for the carafe.But this morning it wasn’t making a full cup and was making a funny noise, it’s been four months since my last descale so I thought I would try that. Unfortunately, at the end of the brew cycle it starts dripping water out of the sides. For the price you pay you expect your coffee maker to last longer than a year."
Can't find an adapter to work for one cup coffee
Loved this until after less than 6 months it stopped working. Keurig customer service will not stand behind it because it was bought used. When purchasing it  only stated that it had cosmetic imperfections and packaging was original. I am very disappointed that Amazon did not help me or Keurig So beware of buying any of their products.
"First, the Keurig K-Duo Plus Coffee Maker is an ideal size for narrow spaces. It's also convenient for those wanting to switch between K- Cups and actual brewed coffee.But--if you're using K-Cups, be prepared to use more than you require. The design of this device is somewhat flawed--off-center might be a better term. Most of us tend to place our cup in the middle of the platform, thinking it's directly under the brewing funnel. It is not. With the is Keurig, you must position your cup to the left and back. If you don't, your coffee spills into the drip tray--and you have to start all over. This is annoyance consumers shouldn't have to contend with, especially for such a high-price coffee maker."
Began not making a full pot of coffee after setting to 12 cups. Started a month ago now it will not operate a one cup Keurig cup brew. Coffee pot is not running at all. Non operable smells weird too. I've contacted Keurig they say read my manual paid on affirm. $216 less than  one yr usage
"I like the pot.  Makes great coffee.  A little difficult to figure out the timer.Only real complaint I have is that about 3 weeks after I got it, the plastic reservoir slipped out of my hand as I was filling it with water.  Hit the kitchen floor and the bottom cracked.  No way to use it without the reservoir.  Had to order the part from keurig…. Not available on Amazon (yet?).  Would think it could have been made more durable?"
"I think the overwhelming number of reviews for this are probably based on first impressions because the first impressions are pretty positive:- sleek design- makes decent coffee- easy to use and cleanThose things are all true. I bought this with some hesitation after reading a few of the negative reviews because I noticed a worrying trend in them. The Keurig consistently goes kaput after a few months. And this isn’t a one off problem as many people have told stories of getting replacements and having the exact same thing happen. I chalked it up to bad luck. But here I am having learned the same lesson. I’ve had 2 of these go out both after only a few months of use with the exact same problem: turn on the machine, start a coffee cycle, and immediately have the unit shut off. It’s been discussed in other reviews ad nauseam but there is definitely some kind of electrical issue with the engineering that they’re unable or unwilling to fix. Oddly enough, they don’t seem to have an issue with sending a replacement when it does go out but I’m curious as to how often they have to do this. Perhaps some people just give up and buy something else. I’m considering doing that myself.Long story short, do NOT buy this if you want a reliable and long lasting coffee maker."
Love the looks of the machine and what it provides with the decanter and a single cup of coffee. But very disappointed that it doesn't have a coffee warming plate at the base to keep the coffee hot for more than a cup of coffee.  Not sure what I'm going to do with it since the box was trashed and we're stuck with it.  Probably donate it to goodwill and but a $50 coffee maker to give me my basic hot coffee for an hour or two.
"I want to like this machine but it’s no comparison so my old Keurig 2.0. The best thing about this is you can move the water reservoir to either side. Bad things are you have to hit the power button every time you go to use it. I get it. Save electricity. But let’s not do that to a coffee maker. I need my coffee in order to function in the mornings ahhhh. I haven’t delveloped the muscle memory to hit that dumb button yet and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve stood there, waiting for coffee, half asleep and nothing. Also, the carafe is meh. Keeps the code somewhat warm but there no way to empty the entire pot. The rim around it prevent some of the liquid from coming out. I have to use a towel to dry the excess out every time I rinse it. I wish I would’ve gotten a different machine but I trusted the brand."
"3 stars - Not ready for prime time at this price.  3 issues.- This only randomly makes a full carafe.- Doesn’t make strong coffee unless you use fine grounds.  (Finely ground coffee tastes great.)- Keurig Brand refillable pod w/ or w/out the adapter is not compatible.  Not a deal killer since we rarely use them but not worth full price and the hassle of return.  I hate the waste of the K-cup and won’t buy them.  I’ll just reheat coffee or drink it iced.  If the Keurig Brand refillable pod worked with it and if the carafe pot would fill every time, I would rate this at 3 stars.  Withholding 1 star until achieving 6-7 yr longevity (and a better warranty).  Deducting 0.5 star for fine grind required to make strong coffee and 0.5 star for reliability if full (12 cup) carafe."
"I purchased this maker for the seemingly magic flexibility of brewing a full pot of coffee, or a quick Nespresso pod. In what is a crystal-clear sign of the times, my partner and I almost exclusively opt for the instant gratification of the Nespresso pod.For the first few months, the product worked precisely as intended. A dazzling array of colorful coffee pods at our fingertips, we consumed enough caffeine daily to kill a family of medieval peasants. However, after a few months in, the medieval lord known as ""shoddy production standards"" arrived to assert its right to prima nocta. A puddle emerged underneath our coffee maker. At first, we chalked it up to the fact that we typically ran pods in the machine until the catch tray was full (which one would assume to be intended given that the catch tray fits multiple pods, but I digress), and determined to empty the bin after just a few brews, and place a paper towel under the leak for good measure.Our plan of action declared, life seemingly resumed its proper state of affairs. The warm, voluptuous bean-water resumed its daily flow. However, all is typically calm in the eye of the storm. In a few weeks' time, water was once again seeping out from under the machine, having completely saturated the poor sheet of paper towel that had been pressed into a service that it was altogether incapable of fulfilling. We attempted to make do, emptying the drip tray after every run of the machine, and yet the paper towel pressed into service in relief of its fallen comrade, eventually also succumbed to the torrential downpour with which it was beseiged.Upon further investigation and troubleshooting, we determined that the water responsible for the ""Great Kitchen Counter Flood of 2024"" was likely flooding from behind the pod, never reaching its intended destination. As it turns out, this is a not-uncommon issue with Nespresso makers, as the diffuser plate, responsible for controlling the flow of coffee (and not grounds) from pod to cup, can get clogged.Attempting to satiate my primal urge to troubleshoot, myself, I set about attempting to disassemble the unit, myself. However, my attempts were initially thwarted by my lack of a safety Torx screwdriver set, and then wholly confounded by the fact that this machine was, apparently, designed by someone who didn't want us to have nice things. Beyond the innocuous screws, the unit is a labyrinth of clips, wires, and pieces that have apparently been glued together. From an aesthetic perspective, the result is an undoubtedly handsome coffee maker. From a practicality perspective, the unit is basically unworkable.In a final, last ditch effort, I summoned all of my wit, and seeing as that failed almost instantly, I eventually coxed the diffuser plate from its housing using a screw driver, leverage, and good old fashioned brute force. Diffuser plate in hand, I set about cleaning it, and was eventually able to pop it back into place. Placing the screws back into place, I was optimistic that we had reached the dawn of a new day for our coffee maker.Alas, happy endings are only for fairy tales, and they, too, are reserved for children and adults with unsettlingly large gums. Upon resuming regular service, our coffee maker is no different than before I had done anything. It appears that we are not out of the warranty, so there may yet be hope. Unfortunately, Ninja's warranty policy also insists that I pay them for the privilege of them providing me a properly working coffee maker for longer than a few months' time, so I am still debating whether I shall take them up on that offer.In short - if you would like to embark on a Hero's Journey, then by all means, purchase this coffee maker. If you'd prefer a minimally-complicated route to your daily cup of dark jitter elixir, then perhaps you would be better served looking elsewhere."
"I feel like I'm writing this review too early. I haven't gave the expresso/k-cup side a chance yet. I'm still waiting on the cups to arrive. But what I do know is that I've always preferred perculated coffee over drip. But this was the first time I actually was able to do a side by side comparison, the perculater won hands down ( not even close). So I thought maybe I could save someone a little money, and recommend to purchase just the expresso/k-cup machine. Forget adding another 100$ for the drip side. That's if you prefer perculater coffee. The quality is ok and seems to work well, so I'm not complaining about the product, just upset with myself for thinking that drip coffee and perculated coffee were closer in taste than they were. So heed warning perculater people don't waste your money on the do it all machines. Keep your perculater and buy just the expresso and k-cup machine."
I wanted to love this coffee maker and I did until it randomly started to turn it's self on and off one day. I unplugged it and plugged it back in for it to have no affect. When I called technical support they saw through video chat what was going on but said that since it was passed the one year warranty they could only offer me 30% off a new machine. I feel that when spending over 200 on a coffee machine it should last more than a year and a few months.
"Have you ever watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail? If so, consider the Swamp Castle--only the last one didn't stay up.If I had written this review within the first 4 months, I would have raved. 5 stars; legit. So convenient! Makes good coffee! Quick and easy espresso! Brew as much as you want, from a cup to a full pot! Everything I wanted in a sleek, compact package!On the fifth month, the item that pierces the back of the Nespresso pods died. But the coffee maker still worked, and I could still make espresso if I pierced the pods before inserting them. Annoying, but fine. I can deal.On the eighth month, the coffee maker's drip stopper stopped working. I'm a former barista, and I can swap vessels below a coffee maker like a pro, so okay. Not thrilled, but I'll survive.Then, one week after the warranty expired, the disk that pierces the foil front of the Nespresso pods fell off, and there was no reattaching it, so I called customer service and Ninja was kind enough to send a replacement base unit--as long as I covered the shipping and handling (since it was just out of warranty).So I received and swapped out all the bits into the new (refurbished) base unit. ...which lasted about 2 weeks before getting an 'Add Water' error whenever I attempted to brew, even though the reservoir was plenty full. I called customer service back and reported the issue. They initially said they'd be happy to replace the base unit again--as long as I covered shipping and handling. They then promised to ship it free after I pointed out that I had just paid S&H for the unit they'd sent not 2 weeks ago.Surprisingly, I received a new-in-box unit a few days later. I naively assumed my issues were over, and happily went about setting up and enjoying my coffee.It's been barely 80 days since I received the NEW unit. The pod piercer has broken yet again, and both the coffee and the espresso maker are giving the 'Add Water' error.I've lost all faith in Ninja's reliability. If it worked as intended, I'd be thrilled and delighted in the product. However, I now have three defective units in my house, and I'm not willing to continue contributing to the landfill with any further broken units.I'm out."
"I think the coffee brewing side of the system makes a good, very hot cup of coffee. However, the espresso side produces only lukewarm warm espresso, so you really need to heat up the milk if you want a hot drink. The lever that turns off the coffee flow, so you can grab a quick cup, does not work. The frothier is pretty decent and I appreciate the measuring spoon that recommends the amount of coffee to use based on how much you want to brew. I think Ninja is very close to making a great system, but they still have a few kinks to work out."
Doesn’t give same amount of water in each cup. Lacks consistency. Will say it needs water when doesn’t. Not all nespresso style pods will fit or work.
"Love the ease of use. Well designed.  Both the coffee maker and espresso. Frother very easy to use and clean. Coffee maker takes the cone filters. Fine. If you use more than 2-1/2 scoops of coffee (which is a half a pot), the water pushes the grounds up over the filter, making a mess of the machine and the coffee!!! I’ve tried different coffee. Nothing helps."
This makes some great espresso! Too bad the design is terrible and it ends up letting go and dumping the cup and pod catcher all on the floor as often as it ends up in my stomach!
"I have had this for six weeks now and the three things that I could definitely complain about are the water reservoir is very small so you have to keep refilling it; and, besides the fact that the coffee doesn’t come out very hot even on high so refrigerated creamer cools the coffee to lukewarm, there’s also no way to put the warming plate on without brewing coffee. Unfortunately if you accidentally shut it off there is no way that I see to put it back on without brewing more coffee. To me that is a major drawback. Disappeared"
"I loved the coffee pot in general, the regular or strong roast option and the espresso side. Truly loved it. I purchased this back in March of 2023, used it yesterday and worked fine. Today nothing. I keep getting “add water” and the container is full. I regularly clean my parts and once again did the whole thing by hand hoping it was not an internal issue. It won’t do anything for the cleaning option. The timer starts but no water goes through the coffee maker. Take the container off and push in the mechanism on the bottom, water comes out great. Really disappointed since it’s a $200 coffee pot to not even last a year in half. Hate to leave a bad review but truly disappointed in the life of ninja we received."
"1) the espresso portion: works well. It takes Nespresso pods which are harder to find, my local stores all carry K cups.2) my primary complaint is that is doesn’t make hot coffee. If you drink it straight out of the pot (after adding a little creamer) it needs to be microwaved right away to warm it up more. There is a hot plate under the pot, but it takes a while to warm up. So… either need to MW it or make it In advance of drinking and let it sit on the heating pad for a bit. It takes more coffee grounds than I used in my old coffee maker for the same size pot. Likely related to the water being less hot….."
"The good- the drip coffee prude a good pot. It is narrower than my old Ninja coffee maker that’s lasted for eight years .The cup of espresso, I would rate 7 out of 10 for a pod.The bad- for this price point, it should’ve come with a built-in filter like my old pot did that cost half the price.The coffee maker is to tall the way the grounds go in to put coffee grounds in without pulling out the pot. This is a major design flaw in my opinion on Ninjas part. Also, the watercraft is a little awkward to get out if you don’t pull the unit away from the wall compared to my old model.The way the pod go in is odd. My first few try’s at an espresso were challenge because the pod kept falling through  to the waste bin.I am Undecided to keep it or get a newer Version of the old model."
"The espresso does not come out hot, at all. I didn’t take the time to read, but the froth does not warm up the milk, which I don’t understand the purpose of. I didn’t use the drip out of it so I cannot speak to that, but I was just not impressed and am returning it."
"We have gone through two of these machines and both ended up with the same issue, excessive leakage on the espresso side.  The first machine lasted 7 months and the latest machine lasted a little over 12.  I am very disappointed at the failure rate of these machines when it comes to the espresso side.  The coffee side works fine.  If you are a heavy espresso user and plan on using the espresso side multiple times a day, I would look at a more quality machine.  We brew about 10 or so pods a day, so I am guess the machine just can't stand up to that much usage over time."
Love my Ninja appliances. I Bought this to replace Ninja coffee bar purchased in 2018 that tragically no longer brews and its been discontinued. It was my favorite coffee maker ever due to consistently smooth coffee. This would also replace my Nespresso bought in 2008 but still going strong.Water doesn't heat near as hot as my old Ninja Coffee bar. Coffee has been bitter disappointment and espresso doesn't even come close to my Nespresso. Not as sturdy as old Ninja coffee bar.  Seems like cheap knock off comparable to a $40 coffee maker. Still in return window so searching for better coffee maker to replace Ninja.  Three stars cuz it plugs in and brews coffee and espresso but brew quality is 2 stars
I bought this coffee maker for the ease of use. I have loved the taste of the lungo coffees I have enjoyed and my wife loves the iced varieties. I purchased it in May and now in November it has completely blown up. When I try to use the capsule side all the water runs out the bottom of the machine. Needless to say I am disgusted with the lack of use I got with the machine. However I have enjoyed it so much I have decided to try it again. Surely I won’t get two lemons in a row. I will let you know if the next one fails
"I will update this review when it's appropriate, as I haven't put it through all the cycles before writing this review. But let's talk about what hasn't been said...The 1st thing that stuck out to me was the misleading measurement. I wanted to get this upgrade my previous 10-cup Ninja to a 12 cup. This actually was a downgrade, as the water reservoir and the carafe only fits 8 cups to the max line... So to say it's 4 more cups than it actually is, I think was very misleading and I would have thought twice about purchasing based on that alone. I wouldn't have bought this if it was advertised as 8 cups. The picture is my carafe from my 10 cup Ninja to the right of this carafe. The right one is actually a little taller and fatter at the bottom and it's 10 cups... So there is no way this is a 12 cup carafe when I literally measured at it."
Returned the item because you can NOT make a normal size cup of coffee like you can on a Keurig.  I think you can only make a 6 oz cup of coffee.
We’ve had this machine for a quite a while now and use it daily and it’s very inconsistent on working correctly and often does not disperse the correct amount of coffee and the water gets backed up in the filter container. It also will overflow cups at times and keep pouring after the selected size is finished. Ninja is typically our go to brand for items and we had a similar ninja coffee maker before purchasing this one and never had any issues with it. But this one definitely has some kinks that they need to get worked out.
"Capsule brew is quite troublesome. I never know if I will receive a full serving or only a teaspoon! I should have returned it when I noticed the issue but I decided to give it a try because, perhaps it was user error? Now, I’m only 4 months in and it’s broken!"
"I bought the Ninja Coffee Espresso Maker 15 months ago. While it has been great for brewing drip coffee, I’ve encountered a significant problem: the espresso function just stopped working. The machine consistently fails to puncture the espresso pods, making the espresso feature completely unusable.If you’re primarily looking for a reliable drip coffee maker, this Ninja model might still be worth considering. However, if you’re counting on the espresso function, be aware of this serious flaw. Given my experience, I’d suggest either passing on this product or purchasing the 2-year warranty to cover potential issues.In summary, the Ninja Coffee Espresso Maker is effective for drip coffee but has proven unreliable for espresso. Consider your priorities before making a decision."
I love the fact that I can brew a carafe of coffee or just a single cup with just the grounds and the filter however the Pod side the coffee is only semi warm and I can only get the pods in there if I take the Pod capsule out of the bottom and hold my finger under it so the pods don't fall directly through otherwise there's no catch for the pod and it goes directly from the entrance all the way down into the Pod capture in the bottom and it doesn't Brew anything
"Pros:- Nice water reservoir for both espresso and coffee functions- Small for countertopCons:- Hot plate only comes on automatically for carafe mode and not for smaller oz. settings so must turn on manually after waiting for selected oz. brewing to finish- Frother is not a steamer, so it only spins and does not heat up the milk- Must manually close the drip before pulling out the carafe to stop coffee dripping- Only uses Nespresso pods for the espresso part- Coffee basket is not easily put back into place"
The coffee just didn’t taste good. I tried using the scooper with different amounts of ground and it’s just not good. You can dial a single cup but not use any kind of k cup or refillable cartridge as one review suggested. I tried multiple stores and the expresso capsules are only available online. I plugged my old Keurig back in and the coffee tasted much better. Because of reviews and a friend’s recommendation I bought the Ninja but had to return it because it did not meet my expectations.
"So I spent months searching for the perfect espresso/coffee maker. I found this one and thought ‘Yes!!!’ So excitedly I purchase the machine. The first machine arrived damaged. The packaging wasn’t damaged but the machine was. I messaged immediately requesting a new machine be sent. I was sent a new machine and had sent back the damaged one. This was was a refurbished machine that was missing all the extras that the new one had come with. Warmer plate cover, samples of paper filters, the reusable filter. The machine was still wet from them cleaning it and had none of the package safety features. The coffee side brews sludge about half an inch thick and the espresso pod side stopped working shortly after the 30 day return window closed. I am so disappointed and frustrated. I attempt to double filter and make a point to watch how close I get to the sludge to avoid drinking it just because the machine was over $300.00!!!! Who wants to waste that kind of money"
water container came broken with plastic inside
It is very frustrating that you cannot find the expresso pods. The machine is great but nobody carries the small pods for this machine.
"First received machine with a shattered water canister and had to send it back for a replacement.  Advertised as containing 2 long handled spoons.  Replacement was missing the spoons. Just kept it instead of sending back again, for a second replacement."
The clock light is burnt out in spots. See attached pic. I spent a lot of money and would expect better.
This system does not dispense the espresso side hot enough and when you have to heat up your cream every use it foams up unless heated with stove .  The espresso is claimed to be at 180 -190 degrees at dispense however when tested with digital temp gauge it is showing 165 -170 which cools down ..  my final review of this item is does not compare to some of the competitors in the espresso machine line up as temp is very important in producing & maintaining  a good cup of espresso most likely to go back to another brand or style .  Classic coffee side works well
"I didn't find it very user friendly.I am the only one who can use it at home, you to have to carefully read the manual to have a clear idea of how to use it."
"When reservoir has water in it, over a couple hours it will leak water everywhere. I've did research and found multiple people with the same issues. Looks like the machine leaks from where the reservoir, where the pitcher seats into the machine. The water that's on the bottom of the machine needs to be soaked up otherwise the pitcher doesn't make a perfect seal. When this is done, the leaking is minimized but still leaks. Also, the coffee doesn't seem to get hot enough on the warmer."
"Not happy with this coffee maker.  Way too many steps to make a pot of coffee.  Hot plate does not work on some of the settings.  I was expecting a much better product from Ninja.  Would like to return it, but waited too long I guess.  I was hoping to get it set to where I wanted it, but was unable to do so.  Oh, well!"
"A wasnt impressed by all the plastic. I returned it without  opening anything on it other than the outside box. Of course, it's been over 3 weeks. I haven't gotten my $250 back from amazon although I have tracking that shows it was received by them two weeks ago! Really frustrating. Won't by big purchases from Amazon again. I'll go to Target or Walmart!"
"So I bought this big beautiful piece of tech because of the features and of course its a ninja. It was awesome until about 2 weeks ago. I moved it to clean and there was a large amount of water hidden under the machine. I thought maybe someone had overfilled the reservoir, so I cleaned it up and never gave it a second thought. The next time I cleaned under the machine, a big puddle again. Hmm. Maybe the capsule collector had a lot of water in it and it leaked. Cleaned it, then I decided to test the reservoir for leaks, nothing. So I made a cup using the nespresso single cup. I lifted the machine and lo and behold water. I tested my theory again, yep water. Last night I called Ninja to find out about the warranty. After much listening and explaining and videoing, the lady says we can have a new one sent to you in 3-5 days. GREAT I say. Then she explains the warranty doesn't cover shipping. $22.95. No problem. Then she tells me BEFORE they can ship it out, I must cut the power cord to my machine....WTF?  Um, no I will not! What am I supposed to do for coffee until the new one arrives..sorry, sucks for you. You gotta cut the cord. NO THANK YOU! I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER NINJA PRODUCT AGAIN!. I have almost every Ninja appliance, buy this has turned me off their products. Buyer beware!"
"This was a very good machine and I very much enjoyed it for the time it did work. It’s suddenly started glitching, not letting me choose a setting. The espresso has also gotten weaker. We’ve had the machine for about 14 months now. Not long enough for the $250 it costs when now I have to find a new machine."
"I really loved this machine but within less than a month of having it kept saying “add water” and would only make 10 ml of espresso, not the normal 35 ml. I’ve had to return it."
Coffee and espresso isn't hot enough
"So this one I was very excited for but didn't quite think it through. I'm happy to now be able to brew espresso pods but I think I could have bought a single pod brewer and been fine and kept my percolator. The brew works ok and the options are nice, but it is a space hog as kind of expected but also not my favorite layout. The water in the back means you cannot put this against a wall or you'll not be able to grasp it and get it out so you already lose a lot of space. After brew when you want to clean, water goes EVERYWHERE when you lift the lid and drips down to the base. The frother on the side means you have to leave enough space to swing that out. Since when you finish frothing there is liquid on it you need something under it to catch all the drippings. There's just so much space killing on this it just doesn't hit the mark."
We bought this coffee make the summer of 2023. It worked great until about a week ago. We heard a pop and then started smelling something burning in the kitchen. There was smoke coming out of the barrel that holds the coffee pods. It smelled like wires burning. It was also making a sizzling/sparking sound. Got a bit nervous and had to take it outside to make sure it wouldnt burn our house down. Ive had other wayyyy cheaper coffee makers make it longer than a year and half. Guess we are out the $200 bucks and have to go buy a new one now.
I loved this coffee maker until not even a year later the pods size stopped working.
Must use filter and ground coffee to make a cup of coffee. Limit for using capsules is 4 oz. Convenient for expresso but not for single cup of coffee. Makes coffee really fast.
Heating milk for espresso is a pain. If you like iced coffee drinks this is for you.
It’s a very basic coffee maker made of plastic not at all what I was expecting.Overpriced item that functions exactly like the less expensive coffee makers.Very disappointing.
"For the amount of money I spent,I was not happy about this defect. Coffee was great however. I guess I need o spend more on a better quality product. So no one QC’s this?"
"I purchased this as a return because it was discounted. When I received it it looked like it was new. The only thing that suggested it was a return was the box that the coffee pit was in had been torn. I have had this machine since early July, it is now early November. I mostly use the espresso side. Well it has stopped working. The pods don’t get punctured any more so the water just runs into the cup, no espresso. I have done the troubleshooting, I have descaled, made sure there were no bubbles in the line, etc. It still will not work. I wish I would have paid more attention to the 1 star reviews. I am off to find another espresso machine 😢"
Water does not heat up.  Coffee never tastes that great warm.
"The machine started acting wonky after 1 month of use- cleaning cycles did not fix itI loved my old ninja and bought this for my new house - I expected it to last like my other one did- but a month in it started failing to new for lack of a better termMid brew cycle it just stops- or right before fully beginning a brew cycle- the lights all go off and the time setting starts to flash and it clicks offI contacted ninja and the amount rigamaroleAhhhh!!!Then my online chat lost connection after I had agreed with the tech to go 2 weeks without a coffee maker , gave him my address for the delivery of a new machine, and gave the go ahead for the FedEx labelBut because it got cut off without officially ending I never received the label- I need to go back through the whole process when they’re open again and my coffee pot still refuses to make me my coffeeI’m SO TIRED NINJA!!!! I NEED COFFEE NIIIINNNNJJJJAAAI honestly just want my money back and to go out and buy a new machine"
"This machine makes good regular coffee but it looses a star because you have to select one of the pre set volumes.  Mostly that is OK but not ideal.The real downside to this product is the expresso maker.  There are only two sizes and again, no way to change the volume like a real Nespresso machine.  AND, most importantly, the temperature is no where near hot enough.  If I run three with no capsule, it gets to almost hot enough but never really gets there.  this has a great effect on the coffee and drinkability.  Very poor performance on that part of the product.  If I were to do this again, I would just get one with the coffee maker and forget about the espresso."
"I purchased this for our office and I was very disappointed to see the water reservoir cracked upon delivery.  I will give it another shot and order a replacement, but if it's broken upon delivery, I'll be shopping locally."
The Kpods  only pour two sizes ! I wanted a full coffee cup but have to use two Kpods to get less then half a cup full! Love the kettle and how it keeps the coffee warm for 3hrs!!
"We loved this machine for about a year.  We primarily used it for espresso/lungo.  Now, everyday, I get the 5 beeps to add water.  I bet you want to know, does it have water?  Of course it does, but it still beeps.  I think the espresso actually is giving the lungo amount of water now too. We have called Ninja’s support line and they were great, and our machine did work properly again for about a week, but the dreaded 5 beeps are haunting my morning routine again.  This is just not something I want to deal with before I get my coffee in the morning.  I have given up and will go back to my Technivorm for brewed and buy a separate  machine for my Nespresso.  Trust this wisdom, coffee is not an area to cheap out on. Buy the best machines you can afford and have a peaceful, beep free morning."
Just everyday
Doesn’t make very hot coffee and the espresso side is malfunctioning and telling me to add water when the reservoir is full
"This thing is a monster and takes up a lot of counter space. It would be worth it if it made a decent cappuccino, but it comes out luke warm at best. I used a Nespresso pod and heated the milk for the recommended time, but my cap was not hot at all.For the price, I was hoping for Ninja quality, but maybe they should stick with cookers and leave the coffee to the experts. Back it went."
"My coffee was never hot enough and the machine does not offer a way (such as a steamer) to heat the coffee.  The pressure of the machine was not strong enough to extract the full coffee flavor from the Nespresso original cups.  I need three capsules instead of two to make coffee the way I liked it.  When I read the Amazon explanatory page, I thought it had more capability and was wrong."
"This is a more budget-friendly coffee maker that gives you the option of making regular coffee, espresso, and iced coffee. It’s pretty compact and doesn’t take up too much space. However, I only had it for about two months before the frother stopped working, and I barely use it. For the price, I wouldn’t expect to have to troubleshoot that problem so quickly.UPDATE (Dec 2): less than six months from the time I purchased this, I tried to make coffee today and got an ER: 11 message. Looked it up on the manual and it says I need to contact customer service. This is not a problem I expected from Ninja since I have several Ninja products. This costs too much money to be breaking down all the time."
"Setup before I went to bed and woke up to the entire contents of the reservoir leaked all over my counter and on the floor. Cleaned, refilled,  returned an hour later to it leaking again. Called Ninja support, did a video call to verify issue and they wanted to charge me shipping to send out a replacement reservoir. Returning to Amazon and going to try a replacement.  This is our second Ninja coffee maker and was very happy with the first one but wanted added features."
"I have owned this machine for two months, and it has already started deteriorating. I do regular cleanings on my coffee pots, and it just stopped working for the regular coffee side. The reservoir can be full, and it will indicate that it needs more water… so I tried to clean it again, and start fresh, and it started leaking water from underneath the entire machine. Surprisingly the espresso side works just fine. Very bummed at its short life."
"I purchased this in March and worked great! Loved the espresso option it had and liked the overall design. But now months later one morning while trying to brew a pot, the clock was blinking on the brewer to set the time. I did and then it continued to try and make a cup. But then it glitches back to the clock to set it or it won't make a cup of coffee. Not sure why it won't brew even if the time isn't set. I've unplugged it, tried different size cups to brew from 8oz to 55 Oz but I think mine has reached it limit. It doesn't want to brew unless the clock is set but then when I set it, it tries to brew then it resets and say, set the clock. Annoying, so I'll be trashing this as a pricey loss. Hopefully this helps someone, and I know mine was problem a lemon from alot of functioning ones but good to know."
My Daughter loved this.
The espresso part of the coffee maker was not working straight out of the box until I went through at least $10 of pods and then finally it brewed a cup of coffee has been an ongoing problem. The machine does not have the pressure to push water or steam through the pods
"We're in the process of returning this. We expected to be able to use Keurig capsules or Nexpresso capsules, and we bought both. But no. It takes a much smaller capsules. How do you search on Amazon for that? It's too much trouble.  And we can't return the now useless Nespresso capsules."
"We wanted to love this coffee pot, but we could not get our coffee to taste good. We cleaned it 20 cycles and two of those cycles were with vinegar, nothing worked to get the chemical taste away, it almost tasted like burnt plastic. Returning"
"For one of the more expensive Ninja Coffee makers they sell, Ninja can't be bothered to include the permanent coffee filter?!! Now I get to spend additional $$ after spending over $250!! Mostly on principle, but Ninja should have included the $12.95 permanent filter 😡"
The espresso comes out of the machine at 165°. No options to increase the temperature other than preheat your cup.  I shouldn't have to heat my cup to increase the temperature of my freshly brewed coffee.... Ridiculous!
Seven months after purchase it no longer makes espresso. All it does is dispense water. Markings on all buttons are disappearing and have only been wiped down with a damp sponge. A waste of money. Typical of most products made nowadays
"I love everything about this machine but I purchased my first machine Dec. 25, 2022 and it died on Mar. 14, 2023 delt with customer service had to send the first machine back and got a brand new replacement machine that went to Nov. 7, 2023 called customer service and was told I would get a new base and to keep all the pieces to the old machine but toss base of the machine. I was told the base was on back order so I would have to wait 2-3 weeks for the new base. I received a brand new machine Nov. 8,2023 I don't know why  the sent that new machine vs the base but I'm greatfull. The warranty still ends in December so if this machine has the lifespan of the last two I will not be getting another and will be switching brands."
"I owned a Nespresso machine for 10 years.  I loved it.  Now we got the combo machine for my wife so she has a choice.  Well, that was a mistake.  I wanted an espresso, but all I got was 3 seconds of espresso followed by 3 seconds of clear water....aka coffee.The coffee is stronger that the espresso.  I don't know why the espresso shoots out clear water on the last half of the cycle.  There's no crema, there's no bold flavor...just weak coffee...from the espresso side.We're not even done with the first week of use, and its' weak.  Very expensive drip pot.  Should've ordered a cheaper unit that does the same thing."
"We loved it at first, and the espresso side still works great. However, within the first 6 months the side that brews a pot or cup stopped working. Pulled up the warranty info and found out we will have to pay to have a replacement shipped back to me. Seams a little unreasonable when their machine is faulty, and we did nothing to cause the issue."
"I got this coffee maker to replace the Nespresso, but within the first week, the little side, single cup coffee, part broke and the pods fall down inside of it without actually making the coffee. The pot works if you’re wanting to make a full pot of coffee, but But it has not been very useful and takes up a large amount of space on my counter and turned out to be a pretty big waste of money. I’ve tried to contact the company because Amazon won’t accept a return. Call the phone number no one answers and hold for extended periods of time. Pretty disappointing."
"Have had this item for less than a year and the espresso pod brewer portion had the plate that punctures the pods fall out. Since that, it can only brew coffee by the pot.Not very durable as compared to other espresso options. I've had my mr coffee espresso machine that is now my fall back for over 7 years, no problems."
"I was originally going to return this as after I purchased it, the price dropped .. I decided to keep it and give it a go … well the first few days it was Awesome.. yesterday I noticed water was leaking ..Couldn’t figure out from where, this mornin I woke up to water everywhere and I’ve never filled it completely up so not sure what is going on , also I notice a ring line inside the carafe and from what I’ve searched it’s an inside glass crack that is created when crafting the glass … so it’s returning and I’m on the search for a all In one .. I hope they fix these things ..also only used the frother  once you have to hold the  bottom down and hold the cup :( not a good thing at all ..I miss the flavor of the coffee from this"
"This was delivered a few weeks ago. I followed the priming instructions and we used it repeatedly. Then the espresso side started telling us to “add water” when it was already filled. I followed the troubleshooting recommendations- jiggle the water reservoir, take it off and put it back on, unplug the machine for a few hours and try again, etc. I even tried different nespresso pods. Now it doesn’t work. And I’m not sure how to return it bc after it worked well for a few days, we tossed the box. This is my first truly bad experience with a Ninja product and it’s an expensive one.Update: Ninja replaced the original machine in April as it was “defective”. It is July and the new machine is now having the same problem of saying that there isn’t water in the tank. Customer support originally was terrible. It took hours plus a video chat to confirm that it wasn’t user error. I’m not dealing with that again. Ninja/Shark have great products EXCEPT their coffee makers. This is the third coffee maker we’ve had from Ninja and my husband reminded me that we’ve had to have each one replaced at least once by the manufacturer. Buy their vacuums and air fryers but don’t bother with their coffee makers."
"My coffee maker broke so I hastily ordered this thinking that I might as well upgrade to espresso maker combo. I really liked my old ninja coffee maker, so I stuck with them.  Long story short; you cannot find the pods that go into the espresso maker.  I went to 5 different stores and couldn't find them. I bought the wrong ones and can't return them because I opened the box. They were like 20$ to boot. Sorry for my improper use of a semicolon BTW. The froth wand does not heat up liquid!! How dumb. This is a decent coffee maker, nothing more. Total waste of money and space. I can't even return it because I threw out the box. Who wants to drag a coffee maker through Kohls to return anyway. This will look amazing in my trash can soon..."
"Says that it can use k pods , it can't. It's not even close. It could brew an nespresso original , but even though it looks like it has the space for it says it won't do the newer versions. Drip coffee maker Section is just as horrible. Basically three hundred dollars for garbage. Never again."
"Likes - consistent coffee, decent espresso, enjoy the optionsDislikes - look at the buttons! I’ve only had this for 5 months and the 2 buttons are almost half worn off. The pic attached actually makes it look better than it is."
"Instrument stopped working properl y after about 9 months. Won't brew coffee grounds, and just resets regardless of the options selected. I reached out to the manufacturer, who agreed the coffee machine should be replaced but needed to charge $175.00 in shipping costs. This is the second machine I've bought - had I known this would be an issue, I would've gone with another option. Great to know this now, before buying other Ninja products. Never again."
We purchased this machine and it always had issues with water leakage. After 11.5 months it stopped working completely. It has become a brick sitting on our counter as we have tried everything possible to repair. It is not worth the amount of money for such a hassle.
"Having same problems as others 1-star reviewers. Bought the machine, loved it! Couple days later started ""add water"" error, went troubleshooting but the error persisted, i think it even go worse. Called Ninja support line, the wanted to see the error for themselves and initiated a video call where I walked though the error. They said it is known base problem. So the scent me a base replacement. After almost 2 weeks, I finally got it, but to my disappointment the new base started to have the same problem. Tried to return to amazon, but i couldn't since it was past 30 days, so chatted with customer support spcialist, and they were super helpful and accepted my return as one time courtesy but charged me $40 a restocking fee, then went to drop off the box, since Amazon told me to put coffee machine in original box (which i luckily had) but turned out ""original box"" was meant to be the brown box with shipping label and stuff which of course i didnt have, so ups charged me extra 10% for the box. Anyways, very disappointed with the brand and the coffee machine"
A little over a month we heard a POP and water came pouring out the side of the machine. It was not over used or abused. Just normal use!  I’m completely frustrated and irritated as this should not have happened. Hoping Ninja takes care of this.
Worked just couple of months. After that started leaking water and after tube slips of the pump. Trying to attach tube on the pump. Unfortunately no luck. Feels like bad design on water pump barb. Complete waist of money.
What started as drips from the espresso side quickly became a puddle on the counter after just over a year of what I'd consider light every other day or so use.  Way too early for a nearly $300 machine to crap out on us.  Ninja support is useless - learned our lesson not to buy a first gen Ninja product!
This is my most disappointing purchase to date. I just ordered the Ninja espresso and coffee barista and the machine keeps shutting off every time I try to brew coffee or espresso
Used this for about 3 months and thought it was great since my boyfriend likes lots of weak coffee and I like the Nespresso pods. The machine made a large pop sound and started tripping our outlet and smelling like burning plastic. Not sure what to do because I would not want another one. Would not recommend.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Edit 2/19/2024: I’ve had this machine for about 8 month, and the espresso machine no longer works. This is very upsetting. One day it was working, and the next day it never brewed espresso!We’ve had this for half a month and we love it! Coffee tastes amazing! I’m so happy with this purchase! I’ve actually recommended this to my friends and family! Super happy! I was hesitant in buying this based on the reviews because I’m a review freak! I bought it anyways because I knew I could return it if I didn’t like it. But we love it!!!"
"The barrista side is very faulty, the pod falls straight thru, owned 2 months n only able to get the pod to work right 3 times  expensive n faulty"
"After about two weeks, the “add water” error came in and there was no way to turn it off.I STRONGLY recommend you NOT BUY THIS."
It leaks. The leak is small but it will leave coffee stains on the countertop. Also the coffee does not get hot. Randomly I will get a hot cup of coffee but at least 92% of the time it does not get hot.
