"The only good thing about this dishwasher is that it runs quietly and takes little water. I don't like the control panel. It is hard to set the cycle I want. I wish I hadn't bought it, but since I have used it I will keep it and make do. It's too much bother to drain it. I don't even know how. So I can't return it."
"I’ve been using this daily for two months now. It works well except that the top spray arm is prone to jam with food particles. I suppose the food filter on the bottom doesn’t capture everything. There is a way to take the spray arm off to clean it, but it just jams again in a few minutes. The bottom spray arm does work well, and the dishes still come reasonable clean, but this is a frustrating experience. I would recommend buying a different model."
"wanted to love this, as had to convince hubby to purchase.  Unfortunately, he was right. The hose is REALLY HARD to connect that it wont leak or fall off (no problem the 1st 2 times then all he.. broke lose) .  Then the same hose that is in the sink when is filling up to release the dirty water goes crazy (the little suction cup is worthless at holding it) and again its all over the floor.  Guess will try to use it outside otherwise will become a new paper weight..... plus side is very quit and really cool to watch!"
"Yes, this dishwasher works and will clean your dishes. However, the drying cycle produces a strong melting plastic smell. The odors will fill your kitchen and home. Be sure to either open the dishwasher door and allow what’s in there to air dry or open all your windows during the dry cycle. The dishwasher does not appear to be malfunctioning, I think it’s just made out of cheap plastic.Go with a Farberware dishwasher instead. It’s a little bit bigger, but absolutely worth it. If I hadn’t moved into a smaller place recently I would still be using a Farberware for sure."
only used it for 3 days before the top stopped spinning. otherwise it work’s amazing highly recommend!
I bought this product specifically becauseit says it does not need sink attachment as you just fill the water tank up. Yea that is total lie. You have to have this hooked into a water source as well as havr a drain hose in the sink and of course it is too big for the faucet so will also now need to buy an additional product a sink adapter just to use it.
"Ordered, received promptly and was excited to get started washing dishes.  Filled it with dishes and followed all the directions on how to use my new dishwasher.  Used the fill from top method.  Pushed all the right buttons to get started and the dishwasher dinged 5 or 6 times and that was it.  It never started up.  As per the directions I repeated this process more than a dozen times.  Finally unplugged the machine and am now trying to figure out what I might have done wrong.....maybe having bought an appliance online without being able to talk to someone about the product.  I'm giving a 1 star rating till I know if it will ever work"
It was not a quality product and broke after a short period of time. Very disappointed.
"I'd love this little dishwasher if it actually worked. The arm gets stuck constantly. If theres a tiny little piece of food in it, it throws it off balance and it won't turn. Every use I'm having to clean out the bottom arm, and it still gets stuck all the time."
"Like the title days, it keeps leaving a fine powder on all my dishes. I do have hard water so I tried thr detergents specifically for that and even tried distilled water and it's still leaving a powder and soap residue on everything."
Dislike- came scratched.Like- came a day early.Will update when I use it later after buying detergent.
When using the heavy duty setting it leaks out the door
"Rather simple set up.  Filled the reservoir tank per directed with the 1.8 liter container.  Press the cycle, and the RED INDICATOR saying to ""fill the reservoir"" continues to blink red and it won't start.  I've gone through this about 5 times.  Instructions say when the RED INDICATOR with icon of water blinks, it means no water is in it - I opened the reservoir lid, and clearly the water I put in did not evaporate.  WTF!!!  I cannot put into words my frustration at this fresh out of the box appliance that doesn't work, and the support phone number is in China."
This machine was working great and was a life saver. However it just stopped working and won't stop beeping. I have tried the manual and online troubleshooting. There's no local number to reach the company.
If you fill it up it doesn’t do the job just 3 cup and 2 dish in strong cycle will work if you clean them before you put them in the machine. Over all not good
Quicker and cleaner to just do the dishes in the sink. I thought it would save me time but it actually increases my time spent cleaning dishes.
Worked ok for a short while. Takes about 2 minutes to fill up the tank manually sitting there holding the sprayer from the sink. Died quickly. Started spewing out dirty dishwater from the base plate and now it's just a monument of sadness.
"Perfect for my small space, does an incredible job. I didn't have to hook it up to my plumbing which was a great option because I have a non standard faucet. I love it and I am soooo happy.UPDATE: DIED a year TO THE DAY after I bought it. Won't turn on nothing. Almost like it was programed to die. Very upset."
"The dishwasher arrived and on the same day we tried to fill it with water to use. We installed the outlet pipe and secured it tightly.However, on its first run, it started to leak water. We placed a towel around the outlet pipe, but it ran dry. We found that the water was seemingly leaking from either the front of the machine or the sides.There is so much water gradually leaking that we were unable to leave it on our kitchen counter, and had to place it in our shower.This brand new machine is faulty. We would like a replacement."
"If you look at all the 4-5 star reviews, they all talk about how great it is after owning it for just a few months. If you look at the 1-3 star reviews, most of these units barely make it to their 1 year warranty and the ones that don’t, lose their money because the customer service and contact methods for the warranty are so bad. Honestly, I’d just stay from their brand altogether. Ours died after about 14 months we were not able to contact the company. The number they  provided was no longer available."
"I just bought this and the second time I used it, it is stuck on dry mode. It just says ""6"" and stays that way over night. You can hear a motor running but it's not doing anything. Can anyone help me with this?"
"Wet inside, scratches and scouring marks all over the exterior. I paid too much for this to come out of the package as messed up and tossed together like it was. I don't trust putting my dishes in here I don't know where it has been and in whose home. I'm disabled on a cane took a lot to get this in and open, lifted just to see it is poor quality. Trash!"
We use this for washing baby bottles and parts. Can’t put anything in the corners because it doesn’t reach there. Still have bottles that we have to wash twice. Save your money or spend it elsewhere.
"I've had this dishwasher a couple months now and it keeps saying E3... I've done everything from manually flushing, ie: holding power and dry, to pulling all the filters out. It did work great for the first month. I don't know what to do now?"
Was happy that I finally made the purchase until I opened it and it already had mold growing in it.
I was super excited to try but as soon as I opened the dishwasher I realized I would have to wait. Pulled it out of the packaging and when I opened the dishwasher it was soaking wet inside and full of mold. I paid full price for a new dishwasher and received a used moldy appliance.
"If I could give zero stars I would. Unfortunately, this didn’t work during the first use. I think the gauge for flow of water was broken and it continuously would tell me that there was not enough water in it. Waste of money and sent back. I wouldn’t waste my time purchasing this countertop dishwasher."
"I'm not sure if I got a defective unit or something, but since they say I bought this dish washer, it's been more annoying than helpful.We were confused as to why half the dishes in each load seem to be perfect and the other half seem untouched. Turns out, the water spouts that are supposed to spin to clean the dishes just don't spin at all. As far as I'm concerned it's pretty much a waste of money."
Bought this product November 2022.  Got an E2 error May 2023.  No longer drains.
"This machine simply wasted my time and energy so much. It was leaking on my first trying and I needed to clean all floor. Dishes were not cleaned enough so I had to redo my dishes as well. Water was not fully drain, so I wiped out inside manually for return packing."
The product was all wet and the hose was dirty. Disappointed.
The dishwasher was easy to use and I was pleased with how it looked. My dishes were scraped clean but the dishwasher did not get them cleaned thoroughly. There was a residue on the glasses after. I used a name brand dishwashing soap. I was very disappointed. I tried it a second time and it did the same. I would not recommend this dishwasher as I return it with regret.
Opened the box to find water inside… not cool
"I researched as well as one can, I  must hand wash so many items before using this appliance.  It takes up counter space and does nothing wonderful for my family."
I'm using it for almost 2 years now (at least 1-2 times a day). It still works great but unfortunately the paint of the dishrack is peeling and my dishes are exposing the rusty metal 😞
I’ve loved this dishwasher. I’ve had it for almost a year. It randomly started to leak at the bottom right corner. I have done everything I can think of and I can’t figure out why it is leaking. I can’t find how to contact customer service for my warranty. Help!
"Water level sensor is malfunctioning saying there is not enough water when the tank is completely full. Wash cycle will not start at all, keeps beeping with the alarm. Water sensor wouldn't go up and down properly. When I moved it manually I could start the cycle"
I purchased this because I thought it could be used without a sink hookup but I guess not.  I've had it for a week and haven't been able to use it because the instructions are incredibly unclear.  As of right now a paperweight has more function.
"I’ve had mine for a little over a month, at first I loved it because I finally had a dishwasher but about three days ago it broke. I tried reaching out to the company like recommended and none of the forms of communications are active. Don’t waste your money!"
"Don't buy this.  Amazon offers no extended appliance plan and you will be left dealing with a foriegn company for ""help"".  I'm still waiting to hear from customer service about why my new machine suddenly stopped working."
"Came with dead bugs, scratches, dirt, missing parts to the point I cant even use the dishwasher to see if it works so I had to buy them on ebay. Hopefully it works.Update: works perfectly fine, had E4 setting error then tilted and adjusted drain pipe. Ran it on baby care cycle and everything drained fine."
"I bought this little dishwasher with low expectations for our needs. We have a small home and a lot of dishes! I will say that if you need to use this continuously you may not want to try this model. I bought it yesterday. I have run three loads in 24 hours. It is already showing an error code. Capacity is okay if you are good at Tetris. You cannot overlap however because the machine won’t clean the items (hence three loads, the first was done twice). Gave it three because it’s cool and has great potential and might work for a single person with a handful of dishes weekly."
"So I’m a mom and I bought this to wash bottles. We have a garage with a kitchen so my husband and I thought it would be great to use for bottles now and then use in the garage kitchen later.This is far too big for me which is one of the reasons I returned it. It took up basically the entire counter.Set up is easy, but you have to put water into it every time you want to use it. I did find that it did a decent job cleaning but it left a cloudy residue on the bottles. It’s also slightly louder than I expected but not annoyingly loud.I did order this as a “buy used” product and it ended up having an error that it would throw randomly an error. This is what made me return the item but I did not like it enough to get a replacement.I do think this would be great for someone who doesn’t have a dishwasher. But if you’re looking for something to wash bottles that’s aesthetically pleasing, this isn’t it."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I absolutely love this portable dishwasher!  It cleans my air fryer racks, without rinsing them first, to spotless perfection.  A glob of peanut butter on a knife?  No problem.  The only reason for 3 stars is (1) the flimsy little plastic thing they give you for silverware, & (2) I didn't receive the fruit bowl, even after calling the seller & Amazon.  So I bought a utensil rack & something I could use to rinse fruit in."
"I have not got to use this yet so I can tell you about that yet, but what I can tell you is I received a returned dishwasher! When I went to plug up the hose water came out of the dishwasher drain hole, because they test them first. I almost thought it had been returned."
"Pros;1. Doesn't need a hose connection to run. Very important - if it worked (See Con #1).2. Fits on countertops and rolling carts easily. Very important.3. Looks nice on counter alongside other appliances, sort of. Aesthetic, but not necessary.4. Window is nice to be able to see in. Amusing, but not necessary.Cons:1. Description said it holds enough water in it's own dedicated tank for multiple load runs, but the washer absolutely *refuses* to run unless the tank is completely full of water. This means you have to top it off Every Single Time you run it (This does not work me. Especially since the pitcher only holds so much water, and my sink hose barely reaches the fill hole).2. If the washer is not completely full of water, it makes a horrible grinding noise that doesn't stop until you realize what's wrong and how to fix it (fill the water tank back up until the machine beeps at you with several *piercingly* loud beeps).3. Steam vent is only on the left side (your right when facing the machine) and the only space I can fit it is directly to the right of my sink, against a wall. This is a problem.4. Soap is not always rinsed entirely off from dishes on shorter modes. Be VERY aware of how much soap you put in; if you think you put in enough, put less.5. Air dry option doesn't dry dishes at all.6. Pouring water into the flush hole on top is *very* difficult to do without spilling water everywhere, and I have decently steady hands and very good hand-eye coordination. Flush design with no funnel is a design flaw.7. If the washer needs to be placed under a cabinet, you cannot access the water fill hole. As well, forget about using any of the space above the washer for at least 15"" inches if you need to use a pitcher to pour, or at least 6"" if you're able to use a sprayer/hose of some sort.8. Doesn't fit dinner plats unless at an angle. Yes, I know the description states this, but what it doesn't state is that even putting one normal sized dinner plate in there severely limits what else you can put inside. I *only* recommend this washer for someone who owns two place settings worth of dishes maximum, otherwise you'll just end up washing the dishes that don't fit by hand, or having to run two loads for one meal's worth of dishes for three + people. It's honestly less effort to just wash an entire meal's worth of dishes by hand than to deal with the above-mentioned issues.Overall:Nice idea, cute aesthetic design, but execution is lacking in some fundamental ways.Used it one week and all of the hassle is just NOT worth $400. Maybe $150 or less. But definitely NOT $400.You're already paying $400+, spending another $20-50 for something that works better."
Worked well for 3 years. Started getting E3 error and contacted Farberware. They do not support this product. Also need a new door gasket and they will not supply even the part #s so I could order one. They responded by telling me to take it to a service professional but could not guarantee that they would be able to get the parts. And then told me that they do support their products? Again worked great for 3 years but when support was needed it was not there. I have researched and it is possible this was manufactured by Midea who also makes the Comfee model for what that is worth I am going to try and contact them to see if I can get parts. A bit frustrated I bought this model because of the name and was disappointed with their response and lack of support.
"You fill this machine manually, even when using a water line (you still have to manually fill the internal tank then shut off the water). Otherwise you use the included pitcher to fill the tank. You must have the unit powered on so you can hear the beep during filling when the tank is full.Mine seemed to have a struggle dissolving the Finish Advanced dish washing detergent powder. Powdered cleaner will not dissolve during the short wash cycle. I'm going to investigate if there exists a liquid detergent in stores locally.For a counter top machine the port to add water is on the top of the machine at the back so if used under an upper cabinet you'll need to be able to slide it forward to add water, then slide it back into position.To drain it comes with a ribbed grey plastic hose you lay across the counter and hang in the sink which limits the working location, it must be within a few feet of the sink since the hose is only about 3ft long. Cross tip screw driver needed to attach the hose and tighten the hose clamp.Inside the box, the machine is smaller than the inside of a dorm size refrigerator.The manual is poorly written with omissions and really lousy translations to English.Basically, you un-pack the machine, remove all the stuff inside the washer (hoses, fruit basket, two styrofoam grippers on the spinning nozzle, pitcher, and the silverware shelf). You unwrap and attach the drain hose, load it with dishes and detergent, close the door, plug-in, turn-on, add water (3 pitcher fulls) until it beeps, then select the cycle and press START. (the unit really only needs to be powered on when adding the third/final pitcher of water).It did a decent job of washing dishes and silverware. The internal LED only runs for a couple minutes which is handy to make sure nothing is hanging down preventing the spinning thing from spinning.You will spill water filling the tank, so be mindful of things around the machine that cannot get wet."
"So this product works, but everything I've washed has a lot of residue on it, esp the silverware. I use Cascade platinum liquid and only the small amt suggested. The normal cycle takes just over 2 hrs. It fits less than the pics show, but living alone I don't create a ton of dishes. Honestly the only reason I'm not returning is that I live in a 3rd floor walk up and this thing is heavy! I wouldn't recommend, but it does seem like it cleans."
"I receveived a unit that has damage on front cover. I bought it as a recycle here that was only supposed to have box imperfections. It was also missing the metal tie for the hose.Con:  It takes 2 hours and 10 min to do a load.  That is a LONG time for such a small load. I tried the quick wash cycle, 40 minutes.  It leaves the load totally wet.  You would have to take out the dishes and dry them yourself or put them on a drying rack and wipe out the unit, to use this on a regualr basis.  It just doesn't seem worth the counter space for me.-And it appears take up much more space than it seems, when I meaured out the dimensions, due to the bulk of it.-It is fairly loud for the whole 2 hours and 10 min. I wouldn't put it on while I sleep or watch tv.-It doesn't save much water, by the time you let water run to get it hot to put in it and also while you are pouring it in.  Turning off water in between pouring but also if you did by hand while washing would not be a lot different.Pro-Having a dishwasher is nice.  It held 4 large plates and about 3 cups and some silverware. I put an airfryer oven pan in it and it holds more but not a lot.-It is a pretty white, clean look-watching it through the glass is fun and entertaining.  I took a video for my adult son-he got a good lough at me!I wish I liked it more, but I don't.  It doesn't seem worth it to wash a few dishes that would take me 5-10 minutes to do."
"I'm writing this review to express my disappointment with the Farberware countertop dishwasher. While it seemed like a convenient option at first, I've been constantly battling the E1 error code. This code supposedly indicates a drainage issue, but my dishwasher seems to drain just fine.Following the troubleshooting steps in the manual proved useless. I even tried cleaning the drain filter thoroughly, hoping that would solve the problem. Unfortunately, the E1 error keeps popping up, interrupting cycles and leaving me with dirty dishes.For a countertop dishwasher at this price point, I expected much better reliability. The constant error code interruptions are frustrating and make using the dishwasher more of a hassle than a convenience.If you're considering this dishwasher, be aware of the potential E1 error issues. Where you may see the name “Faberware” and think, “this is a brand name that I should trust”, think again. I would recommend looking for other options that offer a smoother washing experience."
I have to roll the dishes out onto door and leave them for several hours to dry. Would like to just unload and reload quickly.
"Code was not in use, just started buzzing while we slept. Was never hocked up to water always filled with the strayer.  not lasting two full years is very disappointing"
"One of the only available portable models that can be filled without a sink faucet attachment so choices are limited. Unfortunately we have a fancy schmancy pulldown sink faucet in a rented apartment without threads and I loathe hand washing dishes!I will say this dishwasher worked wonderfully until it didn't work at all. Started getting an E3 code  1 year and seven months after purchase date (E3 - Not reaching proper temperature The heating tube is malfunctioning. Needs to be repaired by a qualified service professional).Cost works out to $22 a month for this ""disposable"" appliance. The manufacturer of this Farberware branded product is a mystery, no online support available, website doesn't recognize model number, etc.Doesn't seem worth the trouble to send away for servicing so plan on buying a new one every few years.Also for a small family of two, we had to run the machine multiple times just to clear a days worth of dishes now that everyone is working from home, breakfast lunch dinner. Wish there was a two tier model available to hold taller / more dishes.This dishwasher is just slightly too tall to push under the kitchen cabinets so we have it on a rolling cart. But since we're using it so often the cart stays parked in front of the sink and we just push it around the kitchen to get to the blocked cabinets and only put it away when we have company. Lame."
"It’s an adorable, compact, easy to use dishwasher, but I’ve had “water won’t reach proper heat” error messages after just a few times using it. I owned another model before and less than a year later had other error issues. It also doesn’t dry the dishes - so that’s a drag, too."
Worked mostly fine for 2 years. Then I got an e4 error. Followed tips online to just turn it on its side to drain excess water and it did fix it for another year. Then yesterday water started pouring out of the bottom of the unit. just took it to the dump. bought in june of 2021 lasted until may of 2024.
"We really wanted this to work for us. We are about to have a baby and we were hoping to use it to wash baby bottles and pump parts for my wife. We were attracted to this model specifically because it is advertised as having a baby care mode. We expected that the dishes and bottles would be dry when the cycle completed but everything is still wet at the end so we still have to spend the time drying.The biggest complaint that we have about the dishwasher is that it does not heat up to the stated temperatures. This units ability to sterilize is in question. We are going to buy a baby bottle washer/sterilizer instead. If you are not too concerned with this unit heating up to the stated temperatures, and only use it periodically, it may work well for you.It is very easy to use and to set up. It is a little more noisy than we would like. We are bummed that we have to return it."
We bought this in hope of cleaning bottles and pumping items. It had good space to place all items but the water pressure is high enough that’s tripping all items which results in poor wash. The wash cycle is also very lengthy at 2 hours which doesn’t help. Requires more than 5 liters of water for each cycle.This product would be more useful if it supported manual control of cycles and uses less water.
"So I've had this unit and it's been working ok. But there are two things that cripple it for my use case. First off is the internal size. It's great if you have a lot of flat ware and cups. bowls become an issue if they have steep sides then you can't get as much in. Same goes for the small tuperware bowls. getting them set up properly so the jets get them becomes a skill to be learned.But the BIG crutch........ there is no where to put any kind of rinse aid. so some dishes will come out with very hard spots or even rings. I've actually stopped using it because of this as just washing by hand ensured I wasn't grossed out. I really wish there was a way to ad a rinse aid, maybe it would fair better.If you're looking for a counter top washer, I honestly would say to try your best to get one of the others with a built in dispenser etc. Only get this if you really really have zero choice because of space( as was my case)"
"Farberware has a larger size portable dishwasher that I would have preferred, but this is the only one I could find that allows you to pour in the water instead of hooking it up to the faucet, which was not an option for me.  This dishwasher only holds a couple of place settings, so if the larger Farberware dishwasher is an option, buy that one.PROS:  It really saves water.  I hate dirty dishes in the sink, and my water takes forever to heat up.  I got this dishwasher because I felt like I was constantly running the water to wash a dish or two.  The dishwasher also heats the water well.CONS:  In addition to the small capacity, there is no option to add rinse aid.  The dishes come out spotty and somewhat damp.  The drainage hose can also be a challenge.  It needs to be secured, or it will spray water everywhere.  Draining into a bucket is an option that might work better for some.  I also think this is really expensive for its size.I recently moved to Hawaii, and dishwashers are not nearly as prevalent as they are on the mainland.  I hate constantly washing dishes.  If you don't mind washing dishes, I would not purchase.  You really have to hate washing dishes to justify the price and limited features."
"The size of this little machine is amazing. I’ve got a small studio kitchen and this fit nicely on the counter. Another pro is that you don’t have to hook it up to the sink - you can fill the water tank on top. Since we use our sink for a portable washer, disconnecting and reconnecting them constantly would be annoying so I really appreciate this feature.  It is also super quiet! I had it running while watching tv 10 feet away and it didn’t bother me. There was no leaking or mess. The clear front and interior light are pretty cool. The soap dispenser is a little indent on the front door. There is also a helpful suction cup on the drain hose so you can position it well.The cons are that it doesn’t fit very many dishes, even compared to other countertop dishwashers. I think this is because of its smaller size. It has a higher price tag. Similar to other countertop models, the wash cycle is pretty long, clocking in at 130 minutes for a full wash and dry. I also was a little disappointed with the quality of wash of some champagne classes that still had smudges after a full wash/dry cycle. I tried the rapid function and it washed adequately. I have not yet tried the other functions.This would be best suited to a household of no more than 2 people due to its limited capacity, but it’s a good workhorse for its size."
I was thinking I was smart by filling it with hot water. It seems like the internal pump is not able to pump the hot water so it’s gets funky errors. Every so once in a while it throws a fit and give me an E1 error. Which usually if I leave it alone for an hour and come back it works fine.
"UPDATE: After 2.5 years, the hinge mechanism broke through the plastic clips that attached to the door, and is no longer functional. An appliance should last at least 5 years, so Ive changed my rating from 5 starts to 2.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I got the version with the window in itOther reviewers have been quick to note the easy installation requires no plumbing. I noticed, however, there were no reviews from people who had plumbed it in like a regular dishwasher. I like this option better, since the hoses stay out of sight. I can also confirm it works. The unit has an automated fill valve that opens when it needs water and shuts off when it doesn't. The drain has a pump, so the drain line needn't be directed completely downward, despite what it says in the instruction manual. I plumbed the drain line to the sink drain line right above its U trap, which is actually above the level of my dishwasher since I installed it under the sink. No installation related problems yet.In terms of performance, it's very good. I bought this to replace my 15 year old Equator countertop unit, and this Faber ware cleans much better and more reliably.TWO MONTH UPDATE: Still working excellently. This is a phenomenal dishwasher. The only complaint I have is that there's a ""blind spot"" in the bottom toward the door that that water doesn't get to, so that part periodically needs to be cleaned by handTHREE MONTH UPDATE: still works great! I use it at least once a day, so I guess that's somewhere between 100 and 200 cycles at this point. I like that the food trap is very easy to remove and clean and that the silverware tray is easily removable, making it easier to wash a bunch of tall things at the same time"
"Mechanically this works fine, but I noticed the washing temperature for the rapid cycle is 122 degrees and for the normal cycle it’s 158 degrees.  I looked it up and both are below the recommended temperature of 165 degrees (usda website).  I haven’t had a problem so far, but then I live alone and don’t have sick kids getting their germs all over my dishes and silverware."
"After less than 4 weeks of using this dishwasher for only baby bottles and breast pump parts, this dishwasher has begun to have condensation in the display window, water pooling at the bottom of the display window, and the dishwater dispenser at the top of the machine does not spin and only drips water while washing the dishes. I attempted to contact Customer Service using the seller's information on Amazon, but the agent could not help me and gave me another telephone number to call for Faberware products. The Faberware telephone support has the worst hours of operation, closing daily at 4:30 pm EST. After 4 weeks, I have not found time to contact customer service about my concerns about their product. I'm a hardworking 8 weeks postpartum mom who wants to replace what appears to be a faulty dishwasher.I have since stopped using the dishwasher. This washer was not worth the price for only 4 weeks of use. If it did not have the condensation issues, I would have given it 3 STARS because it doesn't clean the bottles well. The dishwasher has too few low-pressure water jets to clean the inside of bottles properly."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Nice size… Only fits 12” plates at an angle. Neatly made inside.I hate that the tubing that drains to the sink is a hard plastic tube. You have to wrestle it to shape how you need it to reach. It should definitely be silicone so it’s flexible. Also the suction cup to attach it to your sink is complete worthless, cheaply made crap. Considering the price, a much better quality suction cup should be attached. You have to slam it against your sink to get it to stick because of the tubing being so hard and resistant to movement.Looking forward to using it, but not 100% happy with the included parts.  Will update review after a few washes."
"I got this a while ago and I’m now realizing that there is mold build up on the door! I have to constantly wipe it out, even if I leave the door open to air out! Doesn’t dry all the way either and the baby setting is backwards, it sanitizes the bottles before it cleans it. Overall not worth the price. Thankfully my baby hasn’t gotten sick. I will definitely just be hand washing the bottles. What a waste of money."
"This unit works well most of the time.  I did one  normal cycle to clean it out and then used the Rapid setting only.  Since purchasing (June 25, 2021), this unit has reported the E1 error code three times:  one about 2 months ago, and two more time consecutively yesterday.  According to the manual, E1 is ""longer inlet time"".  The explanation says ""It is a drain problem. Call a plumber.""  If the drain component is defective, that is a manufacturing problem that the manufacturer should have to fix.  Call a plumber?  I don't see that working for me or the plumber.  Sending it back is impractical as I no longer have the box to this unit and finding a replacement box will be difficult.I like this unit and want to continue using it, but the errors are unacceptable.  I am now getting incomplete cycles regularly.  I might just have to toss this unit and get a different brand or go back to washing dishes by hand."
"Update:  the dreaded E1 thing has happened and this is now out of warranty and useless.  Used it for two months until the built-in arrived.  Recently tried it and the drain works, but the water never comes out of the spray arms before the beeping happens.---Due to backorders in major appliances, a replacement built-in dishwasher wash not available for a couple months.  Decided to pick this counter-top up to bridge the gap.  Learned to run a load for prep-ware before the meal, to allow a more a manageable load after each meal.  If you can imagine, we were often running this washer 6 times/day!When loading, be aware of items that protrude below the rack that block the rotating arm.  One of the plastic clips in the rack is extra low and barely clears the spinning water arm.  Too much weight can also cause that to bump or stop the arm.Our sink has a pull-out spout that happens to just reach the top fill opening.  Takes about 70 seconds to fill the water tank using our faucet.  I tended to use the RAPID setting.  To save a few moments, I actually start the RAPID setting and then fill the tank with warm faucet water.  The water temperature for each setting is displayed and the RAPID water temperature seemed appropriate for a mix of glass, ceramic, stainless, and plastics.The glass viewing window is a sort of mystifying entertainment to watch.  The interior has an LED light that goes off by itself.  Press the START button to wake the light back on and make sure the arm is spinning.In my opinion, all things that make sounds and especially ""beep"", should have user adjustable settings for volume, mute, etc.  The display is very informative and well conceived.Only once, did we experience an error message for ""overflow"", that was successfully cleared.  This product was just a hand-saver that worked hard and consistently well."
"I loved this washer until I noticed both of the door's hinges were rusting, and the plastic holding the hinge on the left was cracked and falling apart. Now the door is hanging by a wing and a prayer. Although I can still use the dishwasher, I have to be extra careful with the door when opening or closing. I don't think it will last much longer. Unfortunately, the window to return had just shut 7 days prior to noticing the problem and the warranty I bought through Amazon doesn't cover rust damage."
"This was easy to use and worked well for about 2 years.  Luckily I bought the insurance coverage.  It cleans dishes well but does not scrub have a disposal.  It uses less water than handwashing.  The bottom spinner stopped working.  I contacted Asurion, and they had no one to fix it so they refunded me.It is very quiet.  The cycle is pretty long but I don't mind that.  It would be good for a studio apartment.  Just set it and forget it.  I was very happy while it worked but I am unsure about getting another one if it won't last that long."
"Parents hoping for a time save, don’t waste your timeNew parents here doing bottle feeding and pumping, we spend a LOT of our time every day washing bottles and pump parts, then putting them in a sterilizer. We bought this hoping to save time and it caused us more problems than it solved.The “air dry” feature doesn’t work at all. After putting in a load of bottles and letting them “dry” for 8 hours, they were still soaked. So we would have to take everything out and put it into our sanitizer for a dry cycle.It would also leave a soap residue on parts even if we used less soap that what was recommended. So we’re typically have to rinse everything off after a wash.The placement and configuration of the water inlet meant pouring 3 full pitches at the top and often making a mess while trying to do it.Between the extra rinsing, the extra drying, and the time it takes to load it, we spent more time trying to use this than it took to just wash things manually. Don’t waste your time."
"I was a little nervous about buying a product from a mfg who appears to be spoofing a different reputable brand. And the warranty issues I've seen in the comments did make me nervous. So I'll reserve awarding any more stars for now. That said, I really like how this thing functions. It uses very little water compared to hand washing. It's cool to watch in operation. And, it's perfect for someone living alone for most of the week who doesn't want to wait three or four days before filling up and running a regular-sized dishwasher. The only reservations I have are (1) there's no room for anything bigger than a small sauce pan, and (2) leaving the door open after the wash to allow the interior to air dry makes me nervous. I can't leave it just cracked. It's all the way open (and thus protruding into my kitchen area and making me nervous it'll be run into by a distracted child or an oblivious me) or it's shut all the way and won't dry naturally.  Anyway. for what it is, so far so good...."
"Arrived in a box that appeared to have been previously opened.  Set it up and didn't heat the water well.  Finally threw an E3 error and shipped it back as a return.  I did get a full refund with no issues, because it all happened in first week of getting it.  If you decide to try it, open and use quickly and determine if it's a dud quick.  Also make sure you measure the space under your cabinets for this."
"I wanted so badly to love this, but alas, I can't despite having several features i liked (Baby/steam cycle, fruit cycle).  It's great at washing a properly loaded load, and sucks at drying the same load. If I wanted to hand dry 3 loads if baby bottles and everything they entail every day, I'd keep this for the other features; unfortunately, I bought this to make my life with a new baby easier and all it did was create more work and take up more space on my counter than my other sterilizer + dryer."
"I got this for my tiny apartment because I truly hate hand washing dishes.  I intended to put it on the counter next to the sink.  But it sits under a cabinet and without the faucet adapter, I had to stand there longer than I wanted to slowly pour water into the top intake.  It only held 4 8"" plates, 1 small pasta strainer, 3 8oz glasses and a handful of silverware.  At the end of the 40 minutes quick cycle, I had a few clean dishes, that I could have hand washed much faster.  The temp gage on the front indicated the water never got over 120 degrees F.  So, not hot to sanitize the dishes. I'll try it out a few more times, but I am not sure this tiny thing is worth all the effort.*update*The coupler the product page recommends you use, DOES NOT FIT the intake hose.  I got an adaptor to make the first adaptor fit and it still didn't fill the tank up because the interior diameter of the hose that comes with the washer is narrower than a pencil.  The fill hose is worthless.  I'll have to pull the machine out from under the cabinet and fill it by hand forever.  The 'glass' cycle' is a  joke.  It goes through an hour long cycle, then just sits motionless for the remaining 40 minutes of the cycle."
"To get normal sized 11"" plates to fit you have to play tetris to make sure nothing is going to cover something else and stop it from getting washed. the amount of time it takes to fit the plates properly is as long as it would have taken to wash them by hand. The fill hole is very splashy and makes a mess. There is a seal at the bottom of the door that attracts a lot of grease and i can never seem to clean it well enough to stop the whole inside from smelling bad. It does a good job of making glassware shine and thats about it."
"I was so excited about receiving this product. I got it to strictly use for my pump parts and babies bottles. However, when I opened it up there was powder in it and water in the filter area. It looked like it had already been used."
"First unit was flooding the basin immediately because the pump meant to drain was faulty, resulting in an error code and bombing out of cycle. I thought maybe I got a dud and went the hassle of trying to get another unit and ship the old one back. Second unit pump works but it leaks on the left side and the heater element won’t heat up to over 80deg F, resulting in an error code and bomb out of cycle. The odds of getting one dud in normal manufacturing practice is 15% for cheap Chinese built to print electronics, the odds of getting two duds in a row is 2%. It is more likely the design and components are fundamentally flawed. Save your money and look elsewhere."
"I’ve had it about 2.5 years and I think I’m done fixing it, and replacing it now.  Works well when it works, lots of little things break or jam up, leaky.  It did usually get things very clean and is probably perfect if you just need to wash baby bottles or coffee cups."
Nothing dries. Nothing. I've used the air circulation feature and still everything is 100% still wet. I'd love to return it but the box was too large for my apartment and I had to get rid of it right away because we couldn't move in the apartment without doing that. It's pretty frustrating to spend so much money for something that doesn't work esp for this money. It's also insanely large for how few dishes it fits.
It works well enough but is too small for basic items like plates. You will not fit any pots or pans in this unit. I have primarily used it for cups and cutlery. The unit does not have an adequate drying system and the dishes will stay wet. There are too many downsides to recommend this item.
"This was a big purchase for my husband and I, it took us a while to bite the bullet and finally get a countertop washer because we weren’t sure how well it would work and it’s pricey. We chose this one, in part, because it’s a familiar name brand. I think overall it does a really great job cleaning the dishes, however, a few days after we got it and began using it I noticed the dish rack was rusting already. It’s been about 2 1/2 months since we got it and I see more rust in another area. I should note that it has a coating but the coating is missing in some areas and that’s where it’s rusting, so the coating appears to not be durable or came damaged that way and I just didn’t notice. I’d be happy just to receive a new rack and hope that it doesn’t chip and rust again, I’m concerned about the damage the rust may cause in the machine and shorten the life of the dishwasher which would be a bummer for us who are on a very tight budget but chose to invest in something like this. I suppose we’ll see."
"It's a nice little machine.  I don't use it often - which perhaps speaks more to me than anything else - but it did a good job for its admittedly (and intentionally, my needs are minimal) capacity.  So, why the low marks?  Well, even after incredibly minimal usage, it died a week shy of two years from when I got it.  E4 error means that there's either a blockage or a leak...and there's no blockage.  And of course, the warranty is only good for ONE year.  And I'm betting it's going to cost more to fix than the replace.Looks like I'm going to be buying a new countertop dishwasher.  Anyone got any recommendations?"
I bought this in 2019.  And it worked fine.  About 7 months later It started to leak water from the door.  I called the number they gave . And was told there was nothing they could do. ( Because they no loner made parts for this model.  OK?????  So after 8 phones calls the woman on the phone said it MIGHT be the Gasket around the door. And they did not have anything in stock. BUT they would PULL it off of another washer and send it to me. ( Can you believe that!! )  A few weeks later the Gasket came. And I installed it. It still  leaked.  It turned out it was the seal around the glass on the inside of the door that was leaking.  Due to the door being PLASTIC . So I ended up resealing around the glass on the INSIDE of the door. And that stopped the leak.  BAD COUSTOMER SERVICE.
"The good:  This looked sleek and good, it seemed simple to setup, and was.  The cons:  For some reason the waste water didn't go out the waste hose.  It leaked out on the floor, not from the hose but from under the machine itself.  It also returned an error code that required a service tech. visit.  Since this was on the first try on just returned it.  No manufacturing is perfect.  I gave three stars because it looked and felt like it was a good counter dishwasher and had I got a different one that worked right out of the box I would have been happy with it.  I may try this dishwasher later.  I think I just one of the ones that QC didn't check.  I hope you all have better luck."
I wanted to love this washer SO MUCH. I WAS TIRED of washing bottles and pump parts x3 times a day and drying. It’s too much for someone who breastfeeds and pumps. So I was more then willing to splurge on a $350 mini dishwasher specifically for baby items. However not only did it leak all over the counter but it didn’t even wash the bottle properly. There was still milky residue In the bottles and the pump parts will still greasy. I’m so bummed I really needed help trying to run a house hold and tend to my infant. So I thought I’d cut an hour or two down in washing but I guess not. :/
Doesn’t actually fit under standard counter without having to hard plumb water connections. Drain hose fell off twice soaking kitchen floor. Drying feature randomly stopped working and hasn’t resumed working. Takes about two hours … dishes need to be cleaned by hand before cleaning. 😂
"At first we were excited to have an extra hand around the house. But filling it with water every time was a hassle as we could not get the hose to attach to the sink or pipes under the sink, strike 1.Secondly, we don’t mind the really long wash time, its best if it takes long to really wash the dishes.. if it washed them properly. Often times we would find our dishes were still greasy and food was still stuck on them. We’d have to remove some of the dishes and end up washing them by hand anyway. Totally defeats the purpose of having a dish washer, strike 2.Lastly, it’s a little heavy, kinda bulky, and barely fit under the cabinets as we didn’t have anywhere else to place it. The constant refilling for use is also a little inconvenient. Only reason we have it still is because we missed the window for returns. Yay."
"I want to educate/warn anyone about my current experience. I'm disappointed in Farberware and Assurant.After 2 years I discovered the dishwasher rack is rusting apart and can no longer be used. The mnufacturer warranty ended after one year but I purchased Assurants 5 year protection plan (I'm still within coverage period) and they won't cover it because according to Assurant, it is considered ""cosmetic."" I had to pay $25 to buy the replacement rack from Farberware. But I've already paid about $15 for the extended warranty when I first purchased the dishwasher.I will see if I can escalate this and provide an update for anyone who is interested but I would not recommend the extra warranty or this product as both have left me dissatisfied at the moment.Me ranting now...I've never had to buy a dishwasher rack because the original rusted. Is it normal for a rack to only last 2 years?Why pay for the extra warranty if they won't cover parts?"
"Bought for the RV and it ended up being stored. Used it 2-3 times and each time I had to carefully support the drain tube.  It seems that any back pressure will cause it to fault.  We did like the fact you can connect to a water source, or use the pitcher to fill the clean water up.  Even has a nifty beeper to let you know when the water tank is full.  Overall, it was ok.  $450 is a lot of dishes done by my kids…"
Wasted money. Farberware won't do anything to help.
This was easy to use and it's small and holds enough dishes for probably 2 people through out the day 2 dishes a meal etc. But anything more than that and you'll have to do them by hand but it does get the job done not to worry about that! I have to return it because I've got way to many dishes and not enough space in that thing.
It was perfect for me because I needed the tank feature  as the only room I had for it was not near a water source.  My only problem was the plastic pitcher used for pouring water in the tank.  Its lip was too wide making pouring the water in messy. For me.  I have a plastic watercan  with a spout made for watering indoor plants  that worked much better for getting the water into the unit.
First off trying to set it up was extremely confusing because the drain and the water inlet are opposite of what is in the directions and the drain did not have a rubber plug but the water inlet. So the directions are wrong.After I figured that out now came the issue of setting it up. The electrical cable is short so I had Limited space to choose from. It is so bulky that it doesn't fit under my cabinets. My only choice was to balance it on my sink.Now comes the test run. I try running it and is starts leaking from the door. I shut it off and remove the basket and then I start getting a E4 error. Also it produces a burning smell when it's running which is worrisome.I drain it and tried again.  Error cleared but it's still leaking from the door.I'm thinking of returning it because it's been nothing but a headache and clearly leaks. Plus it hardly holds any silverware and it's really noisy.
I had another one like this before but bigger it was great this one is pretty good although a little smaller it will fit one load if you angle it right 4 plates 3 bowls 2 cups that’s it the best part of this is it really only needs a drain to work which helps the compactability you have the option to hook a hose to the sink to get water or you can just pour two gallons of water into the top two speeds and an fresh air dryer helps out really good buy
"I’ve used this for a about a week and a half now, it works as advertised. I would give it 5 stars but when I received it, it had a deep scratch on it from the beginning."
We had an issue with the E4 code out the gate then it seemed to stop a few days later. We have had it since January this year and every other time we use it stops halfway through the cycle and has the e4 error code and leaves a pool of water on my counter the past few weeks. Not very impressed that something that was supposed to help is potentially going to cause more problem from water damage and waste of money.
"First unit I received was actually leaky - the door would not shut properly. Luckily I received a replacement from Amazon. This second unit works well in terms of cleaning, but have noticed a brownish ooze that comes out of the rubber seals even when running empty loads. I suspect it may be some sort of adhesive that is bonding the rubber seals to the dishwasher, but am not 100% sure. EIther way, doesn't seem safe to be washing plates that you eat off of with that stuff around..."
This is called a “countertop” dishwasher. I don’t think it unreasonable to expect to be able to optimize counter space by having it under one of the upper cabinets. This cannot be done in a reasonable way with this appliance. The fill port for the water tank is on the BACK of the dishwasher top. This is the dumbest design choice ever. This means that you either have to have it always out taking up usable counter space. Or you have to keep shifting it in and out from under your upper cabinets to be able to fill the tank and use.Save your time and money and wait for the BOB to become available in your area. It actually fills from the front which would stick out from under your cabinets.
The only frying pans it will wash are the very small ones. The average frying pan is too big. The handle would need to be taken off before it would fit inside the machine.
I waited over a month for it to blow water out the front and not drain from the tub I am beyond pissed sold by amazon said they tested it I doubt thatEdit: recieved a replacement from amazon that so far is working I have my fingers crossed that it will last for a long time but we will see upgrading my rating to 3 stars. Still had a lot of trouble with the 1st one that wasnt worth it.
I really like this dishwasher but the hose doesn’t work properly. It took 4 different tries to find an adapter for the hose because the manual gives very little information. Finally got the right one and the hose leaks because the seal is bad on one end. I can still use it but it’s annoying to refill from the top since I have to move it every time. If the hose would work then I’d give it a 5.
"Dishwasher gone mobile! Yeah can use it anywhere as long as you have electricity and some water source. Excellent for little vacation homes, apts, rvs, with no built in ones. Only a few items can washed so if one has a sink full of dishes , big pots and pans probably won’t work for you. Left spots on dishes maybe need to use a rinse aid. The front plastic lid started peeling. Called customer service # disconnected.  Rather expensive and no extended warranty is available"
"I'm in the process of returning this. First off, even if it did work, it is pretty large, and takes up a ton of counter space, and doesn't even fit under my cupboards, and even if it did, makes pouring water into the top pretty tricky.But, it won't even run for me. I'm generally savvy with appliances, tech, etc. I build my own PCs configure my own networks, etc. So I doubt it's user error but if it is, I'm failing to see where. I've consulted the instructions, Amazon's question section, Youtube videos, etc. I finally emailed the company, and they said they try to get back in THIRTY days, which, is outside of my return window so I'm just returning it. Absolute waste of $400 and definitely not worth it for how few dishes it actually holds. Even if it worked, the ""rapid"" cycle is 40 minutes. That is not rapid at all. And the normal is over 2 hours. Just to wash a tiny handful of dishes. Not for $400, no thank you."
"Whatever water temperature you place in the hole seems to be the temperature it uses to wash, it doesnt heat the water before use. Bought for babys bottles but the baby cycle on the dishwasher steams before washing. So it steams the milk and other products on the bottles before washing with the soap. Now steam leaks out of bottle part of door and makes it warm. Also I cant trust the nipples to be in there because it doesnt wash well enough. If you place hot enough water into the hole the goal temperature seems to be reached.Its really easy to use and set up. Very small and extremely convenient."
"I bought this mini dishwasher for washing baby milk bottles just because it has BabyCare. After using it few times, I returned it because of few reasons: missing fruit basket, dry mold is a joke, and visible milk stains after 2h wash. The most horrible thing is the glass milk bottle looks very clean after wash, but if you wash it with running water again, both inside and outside are very soapy!!! I already feed my baby few bottles that are cleaned by this dishwasher. Now I’m very worried my 6 months old baby. This dishwasher should never be sold in Market anymore!"
"So first impressions not great, first one I got was defective, couldnt run any cycles, would start and soon later show an E1 error on the panel, I was able to get a new one sent to me relatively easily, spoke to a nice lady on the phone. Anyways, the replacement came in today, not defective thankfully, however, Im not super impressed with how well it cleaned. Ill be trying other detergents, but the utensils I have were left with what looked like food and detergent residue. It did clean my glass plates and spatula okay though. But yea, Im gonna try different detergent and see if that makes a difference, I did use finish brand tablets in case you're curious. Ill come back and edit if things improve."
"The unit is fine, and seems to clean dishes well. However, the tray that holds silverware arrived broken. It had been taped up inside the dishwasher and the prongs on the tray had broken due to the angle. Amazon rep was unable to reach the manufacturer for a replacement, and my direct contact with the manufacturer hasn't yielded results yet either."
"I was really excited about this purchase because I knew it was going to save me HOURS of hand washing baby bottles, pump parts, etc. Unfortunately, after testing it out, I realized everything was soaking wet when the cycle ended. Is this normal? Does it not dry the contents inside?"
"This is my first dishwasher ever and I'm almost 40. I live in a small house with a small kitchen. I felt silly at first loading my dishes, cups and silverware in this dishwasher and only washing my pans. It has been two weeks and I'm pretty sure I have never made a better purchase in my life. My husband I cook and eat constantly and this little bugger has cleaned up my sink and given me back some time to do things I would rather be doing. It is worth every penny and every inch of space. UPDATE:NOVEMBER 12TH 2022 IT IS HEADED TO THE DUMP AS IT NO LONGER WORKS  1 YEAR AND 7 MOS......I WILL NOT BE BUYING ANOTHER"
"I like everything about it, other than it leaked after a few uses. The machine is leaking from the door, I've had to place a towel in front to catch all the water."
Didn't like that the pitcher and water hose attachment for it is missing.
I received my order about 8 hours ago did to runs on it and in the middle of the second one E3 code pops up. I'm calling customer service tomorrow since they're closed. Hopefully they help otherwise I'm returning.Update: It's less than a week from the day i received my order and this dishwasher doesn't want to work. I called customer service and they told me E3 Code means defective. They said there's no fix for E3 but the manual says call plumber. The rep over the phone said don't do what the manual says. This sounds sketchy already.She basically said if the E3 pops up you better have warranty or 30 days otherwise they can't help you. I'm not risking it on exchange it. It was a horrible experience having to carry this around couldn't wash my dishes depending on this thing. If they had a solution for the E3 i would of considered keeping it/swapping but if you get unlucky once your warranty is up that's $400 down the drain in 1 year.
Overall the dish washer does great at the actual cleaning job. It has a poor design unfortunately. It leaks really bad out from underneath. Water goes all over the floor each time we run it. It would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the awful leaks
The product works pretty good my only complaint is it was obviously used. There was food in the bottom when I opened it up and all the papers in it were soaked with water. I paid full price and it REALLY makes me mad it wasn’t listed as refurbished.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Its only been one day I am impressed. It cleans good. I used the cascade platinum. I poured the hottest water my sink will give which came it about 125 to 130 F. I recommend reading the directions before opening its not many pages. Will try to review again in six months.Update late: Ended up having to send the first one back it stopped spinning. Second on was great. I recommend running a cycle once a month with bleach to prevent a mold problem. Other then that I love it. Had it for a year now but I don't use it often.After a year or so it goes out. Starts falling apart. Definitely not worth the money.
"When I first got it I used it a few times and noticed that it’s not as powerful as I wish it would. I don’t want to hand wash before putting it through the dishwasher I might as well wash it myself. I wanted to see if I could make it work by getting stronger detergent but by the time I tested it out it was too late to return it. So I left it alone for a couple years, came back to it and now it doesn’t work at all because of some error that won’t go away and is not fixable… complete waste of money. I got rid of it months ago."
I was so excited to try this as I need help with dishes in my small space. I let it run for the full time which is about 2 hours. I hate a few utensils and 2 bowls in there so it wasn’t full at all. The dishes came out looking the same when I put them in there and food was harden on it. I did rinse before putting them in there as well. I immediately returned. You shouldn’t have to wash dishes before putting them in the dishwasher.
"Product arrived used. There was dirt everywhere and water inside. The note says to expect that it was tested beforehand but there’s a difference between testing and someone else using it for an extended period of time. There’s dirt literally inside the machine and stains at the bottom too. The parts attached to it were placed in all the wrong spots.When I tried to use the machine, it gave an error once it tried to dry the plates. Manual said it needed to be returned to the manufacturer.Even the part that seemingly worked, the wash cycle, seemed to NOT work as well. I removed two sets of plates/spoons/forks/glasses and it came out still filthy.As a girl who lives alone the only thing this gave me was grief and back pain. Lugging this around was the worst experience I had in 2022"
"We ordered this dishwasher for our camper. It worked great for a few cycles and then it stopped working. It had an error code that when googled, said the dishwasher was not repairable!?!In theory it was going to be awesome but we will continue hand washing for now.."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was very happy with how the dishwasher worked the first use but after that it hadn’t worked since. The dishwasher doesn’t spray the water it just fills up the bottom them drains it. Not sure why it stopped working so quickly when nothing else had been changed. Not worth the money to get one wash out of it. Also the dishes don’t dry even when it did clean them. It doesn’t do anything the whole run. I tried to contact the manufacturer got sent to wrong department then hung up on.
"Advertisement photo is a little misleading.  Standard size plates and bowls don't fit upright (10.5'' diameter plates).  The ones in the pic must be slightly smaller.  However it's easy to install and use, and does a great job cleaning the dishes."
"Love it’s functionality! Cleans dishes spotless. 2 negatives— pretty heavy if you plan to move it after use (RV counter space is precious so I move it after each use) which brings me to the second negative, water leaks out somewhere besides the drain hose so have a towel handy when you move it."
I was never able to get a wash cycle to run. Always got an error of E1. Not help from support.
Was way too small couldn’t even put all the dishes from one meal and I live alone sent it back
"Had the dishwasher ~3 months, worked great, then one day an E4 error showed up and we couldn't fix it. No problem I thought, since this product was for my business I figured we had a 1-year warranty if anything were to go wrong. I called the number on the manual and was told that that number was only for microwaves and to contact amazon. Contacted amazon, I was initially told that I could request a replacement, great - I've always had good customer service experiences with amazon before, which is why I use them for my business. Turns out when they went to process the replacement there was magically nothing they could do. They couldn't even help me figure out an alternative of whom to contact to make a warranty claim. Super disappointed in Amazon and the fact that this has an advertised warranty that apparently is worth nothing."
"I had high expectations for this dishwasher. Cute compact design. It had a window for entertainment! It has a steam feature. ( I can autoclave  my dishes. ) What more could I want?  Alas, I wanted it to work. : (I followed directions, Not that they were followable. I stole a designated outlet away from my clothes dryer hoping the kitchen plug just had a voltage issue, I went on youtube and watched long winded videos. That persistent, annoying,  E1 error code would not stop. Apparently, that's appliance talk for the water wouldn't sprinkle, flow or DRAIN. I had to turn that heavy thing upside down to get the water out before i returned it. If anyone owns a small portable dishwasher that they are happy with, please let me know."
This product was very pleasing to the eye ! Very quiet when running . Havent had but few months the door started leaking around the bottom ! Was very disappointed ! Also it wasn’t big enough to hold enough dishes even for 2 piece setting !
"Crazy this things advertises that it can fit 12 inch plates and cannot even fit a 10.5 inch one standing up straight. Just outright lying, avoid."
"Worked great, unfortunately every time i used it it leaked all over my counter.It's not the soap, i tried to use it without soap and it would still leak."
Broke after less than a year. Had to toss it. Worked ok till then
"Mine did not fit my plates (they were too tall somehow) so it was rarely used. On about the 6th or 7th use (4 months after warranty ended), the top sprayer stopped working and now it has a permanent E1 error that occurs every time despite filling it with water manually instead of connecting to the tap. It honestly was not worth the price for me...super disappointing."
"When it worked it was great.  As soon as it went out of warranty, it died.  We called support and they told us that it was probably a dead control panel (the touch panel on the front of the machine), but that since we were days outside the warranty we were out of luck.  $400 for 1 year of dishwashing is a little beyond what I can justify spending.  This is beyond infuriating."
Got it  and it works goodBUTwe gave it back  just too small for us.Was easy to return.
"This thing is gigantic. Don't let the photos fool you! It is huge and deep, like an old tube tv. It takes up SO MUCH SPACE, and then it only holds about 4 plates. Not worth it -- we sent it back."
"It started leaking two weeks after purchase! This dishwasher will not remove any food or slight stains from silverware or dishes. Maybe my expectations were too high. In my opinion, It's almost like taking a water-gun and spraying your dishes with it rather than washing. I'm still puzzled on to how people can rate this dishwasher anything above three stars. I may give it one more try or try another brand since this was my first dishwasher."
"At just over 16 inches wide, it is a nice size with regards to counter space. However, the capacity is minimal. My dinner plates will not fit. Also, I am very disappointed in it's cleaning ability. If I have to wash the dishes before I put  them in, why bother?"
"Update.  Broke down.  Still within Farberware warranty period.  Error message requires repair by qualified service professional.  Customer service tel number in user's manual doesn't work.  Customer service email bounced.  I will report back if Farberware stands behind its one-year warranty.Update.  After many phone calls, I was unable to find a Farberware licensee to stand behind the warranty and repair the dishwasher.  I contacted Amazon to ask what could I do.  Without hesitation, Amazon sent me a replacement.  Thank you, Amazon."
"Bought this -- worked well for a year, and slightly more. Then it stopped functioning properly. Water no longer flows through the arm, dishes do not get washed and it cycles for hours.The warranty length on this machine is one year -- easy to see why. This is a temporary machine.Spoke with their support, Crystal. Tentatively they think it's a water valve issue, and insisted the fix was a replacement part.They sent me one for ~$55. The part was lacking instructions or the necessary small pieces for a full install. Had to call for further support.Got the new part installed -- SAME PROBLEM PERSISTED.Crystal offered to send me different parts to attempt to replace -- AT MY COST. I offered to bring the machine into their warehouse to have it fixed on site. Yes, but they would be charging me all new parts plus labor. No attempt to make good on a scenario going bad. No attempt to help. No actual care.AVOID THIS COMPANY. GO WITH A DIFFERENT BRAND AND BE MINDFUL OF THEIR WARRANTY PERIOD"
"This works good.  It saved a lot of time and work, relieved me of so much stress!I thought washing very lightly soiled pots, mixing bowls, cutting boards and tappers was not a big deal, but realized I really hate them.I strongly recommend you limit the hand wash only when absolutely necessary.It can fit frying pan and other pots.When there's too much stuff to wash, I put light stuff first with a shorter cycle, then, put heavy stuff with a normal cycle.One thing I am puzzled is the ""Mini Party Cycle"".  It shows 20 min running time, but feels taking perhaps double longer.  Each first five min shows perhaps takes 5 or more minuets. Its cycle is disproportionally short compared to other cycle, too (but in reality it takes time).My shorter cycle first strategy is not working as good as expected.UPDATEIt stopped working, the spray arm doesn't work at all, after let's say 8 months.  The manufactuere customer service was just ok.  They first sent me a replacement spray arm.  But it did not work. There's no motor sound so that it is more mechanical, serious problem, I think.The problem is that this item is TOO HEAVY to move by myself to ship it back for repair/replacement.Manufactuere warranty did not misrepresent on this part.  I understand.BUT IN PRACTICE, I CANNOT POSSIBLY MOVE THIS ITEM BY MYSELF AND CANNOT PACKAGE AND SHIP. It will surely hurt my back even if there's no accident during the packaging.  I am petit woman living alone. I cannot always get that sort of help.However, I wrote in response to someone's question that you should buy a warranty that covers the onsite service.  Amazon suggests Assurant for that extended warranty service.  It is NOT SPT's fault, but Assurant advertises they cover onsite service, but if the problem STARTED during the manufacturer warranty period, they do NOTHING.  The online complaint filing system is also deceptive. Given that the additional warranty is useless, there's no way to fix the problem to use this product beyond 8 months for me.I am sorry that I have to downgrade.I feel so miserable thanks to the deceptive ""extended warranty.""  Not so much by SPT, but I cannot use the product, and cannot even throw away this big item.  It is certainly a headache."
"Over the course of many washes, the basket has progressively breaking apart and rusting. No option to buy an extra basket."
"This dishwasher worked pretty well for almost two years. After that, I started to notice random leaks that eventually became pools of water on the kitchen floor. Now it frequently stops and shows different error messages mid-cycle, and I have to tilt it on an angle to get rid of pooling water inside of the dishwasher so it will start again. At first, doing this once would do the trick, and it would finish the wash cycle. Now it happens upwards of three to four times and restarts the wash cycle from the beginning. It can take hours to get through one wash cycle. I've given up trying to figure out how to salvage it, and it's going in the trash. We'll just have to hand wash the dishes until we move and I can get a full-size machine. I wouldn't rebuy this item."
Did not work for long after I bought it
Absolute garbage. Garbage product. Garbage manufacturing. Tried 2. They arrive broken and you have to fix them before you can use them. You’ll count on one hand the times you’ll be able to use one before it reads an error code. Run don’t walk away from this product.
"Compact, easy to install, works great, used in an apartment and pretty quiet.The downside, the dish rack rusts, even on non-contact points, after about a year. The company will replace the dish rack under warranty for 1 year, that I was happy for. The original rusted apart and so has the replacement. I was told by the company that I have to buy another rack myself because I don’t have the extended warranty."
"I purchased the unit in 2016, and it has worked brilliantly...until today.  The unit flushes any old water, and it fills with water as normal...and then it just sits there. I worked through all of the solutions suggested in the owner's manual.I have 'LOVED' this dishwasher.  In my opinion, it gets dishes cleaner than built in units.  You do have to remember to open the door so the dishes dry, but that's no big deal.With that said...I feel that a $300 one-rack dishwasher should last longer than 3.5 years.I await customer service's reply.  If the customer service is good, I will increase the the dishwasher's rating to 5-stars.The extended warranty is expensive, but if your experience is like mine...it may end up paying for itself."
"I waited 30 years to buy a dishwasher but I didn’t have much room for one in my kitchen.So I happen to pick this one.It just stopped cleaning dishes so I called the company and they said “ to run a cleaner on the longest cycle. ( I always cleaned my dishes off and rinsed them before I loaded the dishwasher and kept it clean. But I tried it anyway and same thing no clean dishes and the water didn’t even get hot . I paid over $300.00 and very disappointed .Now I have to buy another dishwasher.Not happy at all ,it was supposed to be dependable it’s not. Hate to give negative review but that’s my experience with this model dishwasher"
"I haven't had any leaking problems.  If items aren't mostly rinsed completely, then there's going to be leftover food, but overall it's better than standing at the sink for an hour a day.  It is big, and the wires/tubes are a bit of a pain.  If you have a faucet water filter, it's time to say goodbye."
"I purchased this dishwasher about 18 months ago. I live in one of the largest cities in the US, but despite calling a dozen repair companies I could not find anyone who would repair it. SPT told me that the only repair technicians they have in the entire country are in Los Angeles county where they operate. I was told that this unit is almost impossible to repair and offered a ""discount"" on a new unit for what this unit costs.My new dishwasher will be a brand someone has actually heard of."
"Spend the extra $50 for brand name product. Got this in September and it worked until February. I am in the process of going around in circles with the support team who has provided resolutions that were already done. We have replaced 2 parts and it is still not working. It works well when it works, but don't count on that being for very long."
"Yes it was easy to install, however the one time I used it I was disappointed because it didn't get the dishes clean. The next time I will run it on the heavy cycle."
"It worked great for about  a year and a half, since then error messages kept popping up, and now it refuses to work. I called the company and they couldn't offer any troubleshooting besides a tech coming to look which would almost cost as much as a new unit."
i  like  it works  but when  i took  it  out  of  the  box  there  is a  big  dent  in  the  right  hand  side  of  the  door
I bought this item because it had more positive feed backs then it did negatives..At first I gave it a 5 star rating because I used out twice and it was awesome. I used it again the 3rd and fourth time and it already started leaking. I'm accrual very disappointed. Now i have to spend more money on getting it fixed. Extreamly disappointed.
The seller was great unfortunately the dishwasher arrived and leaked like a sieve was returned at the sellers request to the manufactures distributor and did receive a prompt refund. The product look like it was substantially bill I guess it's just one of  those quality Control issues that slip the final inspection
I really wanted to like this Dishwasher but I couldn't even use it once. It kept flashing E4 error but there was no leakage anywhere. After spending 3 hours to get it to work.. I gave up and decided to return it.
Almost 1 year from purchase and it stopped working. I've been trying to contact customer support here and it says to contact the during their hours of operation (8:30 am -4:00 pm). It's 9:38 am on Monday and still can't contact them.
"Horrible item, motor was unsecured and clips broken as soon as it arrived, leaked water everywhere.  A huge waste of time and energy to setup, then take apart, then have to return, avoid avoid avoid."
"Unit was a dud - LED menu ""froze"" and water indicator wouldn't light up even though all connections were correct.  Returning to Amazon after 2 days."
Did not get one load done. Machine leaked out of the bottom the first time using it. Not impressed  at all.
Owned less than a year and will not power on anymore. Looks like I’ll be buying a new one. Don’t settle for this.
"I’ll start with saying that I actually really liked my dishwasher and it worked well. I’ve had it for four years and recently started having issues with it. This entire review it’s solely based on the fact that their customer service team is refusing to respond back to my emails and are ghosting me after following up on the thread THREE TIMES. For whatever reason, this dishwasher has started to make my dishes smell like an aquarium. I deep clean the machine once a month with a dishwasher cleaner, I clean the tubes and filter once a week and try to shake out as much water as possible. This is all to say I take care of the machine. I reached out to their customer service team and they responded with a suggestion I was already doing. When I followed up and asked them if they thought the dishwasher was entirely broken, they are ghosting me. People need to know that their dishwashers do not last long and what’s worse is their customer service is so unhelpful. Just be honest and tell me the dishwasher is broken, don’t ghost your customers, it leaves a poor representation of the brand. This entire experience of trying to resolve this has made me back away from this brand and I won’t be suggesting them to anyone I know because of the quality of product and poor service."
Smell poor Quality
"I bought this May 2020, worked GREAT! Until it started leaking. Emailed customer service, they got back to me with a form to fill out for a replacement. I filled it out, emailed it back, never heard from them again. So ok, I can handle the leak, well now it doesn’t start-it turns on but doesn’t start. And yes, I’ve done the troubleshooting. I am SO MAD that I spent so much money on a paper weight. Go with another company."
"If you need to return this, it will take weeks and they will not refund your money for weeks. So, don’t but it unless you’re okay with having $240 of your money unavailable to you for weeks.Aside from that, my friend has one of these and it works great."
Mine is leaking out of the bottom and I can’t figure out why
"This is by far the worst Amazon purchase I’ve ever made. Leaks horribly all over your countertop and as soon as you fill it, it just chunks alllll the water back to the sink. It doesn’t clean very well when it chooses to work, and it leaks every single time I’ve used it. Complete garbage and customer service is HORRIBLE at assisting with a refund. DO NOT buy this."
"So first off. They show off this neat 'mini' dishwasher. Saying it attaches right to the sink! AMAZING.WRONG. It will not fix to any sink. Hate to break it to you, you need a second piece that they don't tell you about until you BUY it and looking through the instructions.So NOW I am having to buy other stuff to just make this work because the price is already INSANE.0/10 do not recommend.Always remember: if it SOUNDS too good to be true? It normally is."
The cushioning on bottom was 1/2 missing which caused a lot of damage in shipping.  The product itself wasn’t put together squarely on the base either.  It’s broken like crazy and now I have to mess with a return.
"Ordered twice and neither one worked. Looking for another brand.Also, the second one that arrived already had water inside as though it had been used already."
The hookup to my faucet doesn't fit. Will be returning.
To small for plates and silverware. Returned
"Dishwasher arrived dripping with water and musty on the inside, box was bone dry"
"It arrived wet and with food in it, disgusting"
"Mine did not fully dry, nor, was there much pressure at all.  The water just “dribbled”.  I ran one load 3x’s, and still, glassware came out cloudy. I rechecked everything.  All assembled properly.  Still, not effective nor reliable at all."
Great product but terrible on believing  Instructions when Receiving it
"The physical setup was easy! BUT I have not gotten it to work. The wifi symbol  has never lit up, so therefore ""NO WIFI""! (I did down load the app) AND it hasn't never worked on its  own!"
Doesn’t work after a month. Don’t buy it
"This dishwasher does not take up a lot of space on my counter. It is compact BUT still fits a lot inside. I can fit the larger 10 inch plates with little problems. It also sprays water from the top and the bottom. I tried another one that only sprayed water from the bottom which means some parts would not get clean. This dies a wonderful job.As for noise, there is a whirling sound from the fan as it dries but it stopped bothering me after the first time I used it. It also does not seem to smell bad at all.I hooked it up with a couple of adapters from my local hardware store so I do not have to put water in it manually but the option is there.{Update} One thing that irritates me is the App. It has a feature to monitor the water usage as well as the power consumption. It does NOT work. It makes the ""smart"" feature of this dishwasher non-existent. If you are wanting a Smart dishwasher with a nice wifi App, this is not the one to buy. I paid extra specifically for this feature that does NOT work."
Its came wet already like it was already used. I hope it continues to work
The dishwasher was on sale pretty good size works well but it leaks way too much Don't know if there was internal damage when it was delivered or it was made that way so I'm going to have to spend a lot of money to fix it so be caution of this product
When I received my dishwasher it came with mold all over the top little area where you pour in the water🥲
"The dishwasher itself works great, at first it didn’t because the water level wasn’t working but I figured it out. However I cannot figure out how to connect it to the app. Also the suction to empty the water does not stay stuck in the sink which is inconvenient as it can move and spill onto the floor."
But I can’t figure out how to connect it to the app any help would be appreciated thanks t says nothing about it in the instructions
"PROS:-Washes dishes very well (when it actually works)-Attractive lookingCONS:We’ve had this thing for 5 months and it has been trouble from the start. 50% of the time it stops working mid-cycle because it says it's “dry"" (it isn’t, the reservoir still has water). If you add more water to the reservoir and just resume the current cycle, the water overflows and begins LEAKING out of the front door all over my countertop. So the only workaround is to completely drain the machine, refill, and restart the cycle. Even after doing this, sometimes it still gives the same error message in the middle of my 2nd attempt!! Typically this “dry” error message happens during the rinse cycle so lately I have just been taking the dishes out and rinsing them by hand because this thing is so flakey and I’m over it.Lately the machine has even started giving us the “dry” alarm only 2 minutes into starting it up!! Just now (which prompted me to finally write this review), I had it alarm “dry” 2 minutes into the cycle 3 consecutive attempts. I had to perform the drain, refill, restart ritual 3 times in a row before the thing is finally washing the dishes. TBD if it finishes the cycle….My husband has been emailing back and forth with the company regarding these issues and despite the fact that they have actually been responding, they have not resolved anything at all (no offer to replace, refund, or repair). I’d be willing to give this item more stars if the company was actually providing any remedy to the situation, but they have been completely unhelpful.Listen, when it actually works as advertised, I love this machine. It washes dishes very well and looks attractive in my kitchen. However, please save yourself the trouble and DO NOT even consider purchasing this product."
"The plates and mugs in the product photos must be very small.  My plates are normal size, and they barely fit in and take up too much space.  I mostly use this for cups, silverware, and small plates.  I use powdered dishwasher detergent, and I'm not sure if I'm using too much because I'm left with spots on my dishes.  I also purchased a cart to put the dishwasher on because it took up a lot of counterspace."
"This lil guy is great for getting all those small dishwasher safe things taken care of so I can spend my time on other things. As long as there is no food on the dishes, both the regular and speed settings work perfectly. There is one major catch: It takes TWICE as much water as advertised. You have to fill up the water tank twice per run, once at the start and once for the last rinse. The owner's manual claims that you only have to fill the tank up once for the full run but either mine is broken or that is totally bogus. Every single time I have run this dishwasher (I'm up to maybe 10-12 runs so far?), it has needed me to refill it for the last part of the run, for a total of about 9 liters of water per run. I'm extremely disappointed because the idea that this dishwasher would save on water use over handwashing was a major part of why I purchased a countertop dishwasher.HOWEVER: If you don't care about the environment, this model works extremely well. It took a little bit of practice to figure out how to load my dishes into it efficiently, but once I got that sorted out I actually really love it except for the high water usage (the high water usage is why I wanted to give it 2 stars).It's also worth noting that customer service was extremely prompt and helpful when I emailed them questions, and when you combine that with the smooth and easy use of the entire model, that is why I gave this dishwasher 3 stars instead of the 2 I wanted to give it for guzzling water.UPDATE: It is now about 5 months since I purchased this dishwasher, and it has started making a LOT more noise when running. This is often the first sign of the pump going bad. :("
"I bought this specifically to wash baby bottles and breast pump parts. I've had it a week.PROS:- User-friendly interface- LED light is great for making sure it's working properly- The ability to add water into the tank instead of having to hook it up to a faucet is great; gives more flexibility in terms of where to put the dishwasher- Gets everything clean with a relatively small amount of detergent- Many of the wash cycles, including the Baby Care/Heavy one, makes the water hot enough to sterilize (150F) so don't need a separate sterilizerCONS:- The water pressure tosses all the small parts around, so if you don't have a way to contain them, you're constantly pausing the cycle and opening the dishwasher to put the parts back on the rack otherwise they'll fall to the bottom and stop the bottom spinner from moving.- The basket provided is too small to include all the small parts, so I had to buy a separate dishwasher bag to put the parts in and contain them.- The heated dry function is pretty ineffective because all my bottle and pump parts are plastic/silicone. I have to open the dishwasher once the wash cycle is finished, shake the water off everything, and let it air dry for an hour.- Still need to place it near a sink because of the drain hose- You cannot use standard detergent pods with this, they're too big. I had to cut mine up and will probably have to buy liquid detergent or the tablets next time.- It's a bit bigger than I anticipated; about the size of a microwave but twice as tallOverall, satisfied with this purchase - it's only been a week and I've been using it twice a day to good effect, just some of the inconvenient things mentioned above get on my nerves but not enough that I will stop using it."
"This dishwasher is great for small kitchens.  The only 2 negatives for me is that the machine doesn't heat the water hot enough (120-140°F) when using the internal tank. The drain hose is entirely too long to stay put.  My cabinets are too low, so the dishwasher has to set on a table. Because of that, I cannot run the drain hose to the sink, I have to use a bucket on the floor and use masking tape to hold the hose in place since it's so long.  The suction cup doesn't stay in place to hold the hose. Also, the water leaks out of the hole on the bottom by the right front. I emailed the company several times.  They had me take the darn thing apart to make sure everything was attached inside. It was.  It still leaks from time to time.  So, they sent me a new one.  That worked fine for the first times and it is now leaking in the same spot. Since I have it setting on a table, I can have that front part off the edge of the table so that water drips right into the bucket. But that's not the point. When I took the unit apart, there is no obvious opening to explain how the water is getting to that opening. The company is no longer responding to my emails regarding the leaks.Also, gel detergents don't work well. I was using Cascade gel and my dishes were hit or miss on coming out clean.  I changed to the Finish Quantum pods and my dishes are completely clean every single time.**Edited to say that I used bathroom caulk around the window on inside of the door and the dishwasher no longer leaks. **"
"I purchased this Hava dishwasher twice and received a defective product both times. The dishwasher is still under warranty, but the manufacturer has not been helpful.Within a few wash cycles using the first machine, I noticed that more often than not, the upper arm would not spin. I would have to pause the cycle and use my finger to spin the arm a few times to get it to spin on its own. That machine did a great job of cleaning and drying my dishes once I got the arm moving, but sometimes I need to start the cycle right before leaving my apartment, meaning I can't wait around to make sure the arm spins.I quickly exchanged that machine for a new one. The upper arm of this new machine works on its own about 95 percent of the time, but now my dishes never get dry. A thick layer of condensation forms on the window towards the end of every drying cycle, which never happened with the first machine, and then I have to leave the door open to finish drying the dishes. The air in this machine never feels hot enough to dry anything.Due to work travel, I missed the window to exchange the second machine, and to be quite honest, it is a hassle to exchange such a large item and be without a dishwasher in the meantime.I contacted Hava Lab given that I missed Amazon’s exchange window and the product is still under warranty. Their support is basically troubleshooting via email, but they have suggested things that I’ve already done that have not worked.Having this machine is better than washing dishes by hand, but not by much. I give it two stars because it does clean my dishes. I just wish the upper arm and drying mechanism did what they are supposed do."
"I purchased this little dishwasher a month ago.  The box did NOT arrive damaged and was actually in excellent condition.  The packing on the item was spot on as well.  The dishwasher is the perfect size for the 3 of us.  We only used it about every 3-5 days, therefore we only used it about 6 times.  It was easy to set up out of the box, no problems.  Super easy to load.  Held all the dishes I needed washed.  We use Corel plates and bowls, 8 oz. size drinking glasses and assorted silverware. I used dry detergent and I used gel, both cleaned the dishes perfectly.  Washed everything beautifully.  Squeaky clean.  We loaded the dishwasher from the top water inlet using the pitcher to fill the tank that comes with it so we never used the faucet connection.  The drain hose was easy to install.  Didn't see any leaks there.  However, on the first use we did find a puddle under the bottom of the unit, and at the front right side (facing) the dishwasher.  Could not see where the water was coming from.  Yet, each time we used the dishwasher the puddles and leaks became larger and larger.  I really, really like this dishwasher but I can't keep it with it continuing to leak so much, so, unfortunately, I had to return it.  I would say this to potential buyers:  You may be one of the lucky ones whose unit doesn't leak, if so, you've got yourself a little gem.  I hope the developers and quality control will go over this issue.  Before I purchased this particular dishwasher, I did read the reviews and was aware that other customers were having this same problem.  I purchased it anyway hoping I would get a ""leak free unit,"" but not so.  I can't recommend this unit to anyone at this time.  Again, Quality Control with the company needs to figure out where the FLAW is and correct it.  Then, you'd never have anymore returns with that particular issue."
"Good small dishwasher. The Major Drawback is that the dishrack is terrible. I have to spend way too much time figuring out how to get NORMAL dishes (plates, bowls, cups) to fit. I have to run multiple loads to get 10 dishes clean, because they don't fit the rack."
"Using the hose fitting that came with the washer, it leaks like a sieve! No amount of tightening will get it to stop, and yes, the rubber gaskets are there. Filling it via the included bucket is messy because of the way the screen is built in on top, it redirects the pouring water all over the place and typically outside the area you are trying to pour it into. The dish racks are poorly designed, bowls or larger plates have a hard time fitting in anywhere in the racks. None of my drink glasses fit in the designated area. The suction cup on the end of the drain hose won't hold on anywhere in my sink, either. With that said, the washing itself works really well, I was impressed by how well it cleaned my dishes."
"The dishwasher works well and performed almost as well as my traditional dishwasher. However, ours arrived damaged and it took as a while to figure out why it was leaking everywhere because the instructions were not super clear on how to use every feature of the machine or what to do when things went wrong. So we had to trial and error things until we finally found we were doing it all right and then started looking for damage and finally found a small crack in it. It looks like it happened in shipping so I don't fault the company on that but I do fault them for not having clear instruction that made us think we were using it wrong and it wasn't draining correctly. The only other con I would have is the rack for glasses is kinda pointless and in our couple weeks of owning it we could never find anything that fit on it or would stay on it once the wash cycle started. I would recommend this to others though because despite the crack it worked really well at cleaning and used very little water.  I just recommend inspecting the whole machine very well before use.  Finding the crack at the start would have saved a lot of headache. Also, trying to drain all the water out to return it was a huge hassle."
I am updating my review after having this a little over 2 years. It’s is already having issues. In fact it started having issues before I had it two years.  It keeps having a heating element error code and a clogged error code.  Some days it works well and others it hardly works at all. I spend more time fighting this machine trying to get it to work than it washes anymore.  I am replacing it as soon as we can afford to. I could wash my dishes by hand faster than I can get this to work. I’m hoping to make it through Christmas so I can have a little easier time washing dishes but idk if it will last that long.  Honestly I wouldn’t waste your money. It is great for about a year then it will slowly die on you.I absolutely love it. It is so easy to use and it washes dishes well. It’s a good value for your money. I was pleasantly surprised to see how well it did.  I was skeptical about it but as soon as I used I knew it was amazing. I got a cart off here with wheels as well and it fits on there perfectly. Now I can wheel it to put away and over to my sink to place the drain pipe.  I haven’t hooked it up to our faucet since we have low water pressure but filling the tank on it works perfect.
"After 1 year of light use, I now get an E3 error 2x a week.  I have to unload it, unplug it, carry it outside, tilt it on its side for 30 minutes, and start over. This error is caused by excess water being stuck in the system.  Seems to be a common flaw and complaint."
I was so excited to use this. I set everything up but as soon as I poured water into the tank it spilled out through all the crevices of the machine. I’m guessing the tank is majorly cracked but I can’t see inside.
"When arrived the glass is broken, but it doesn’t affect the work, it works great and we like it"
I tried this with different brand of soap. It does not clean. I see the top sprayer does not turn it just sprays water. Not impress with this dishwasher.
I wanted to have a dishwasher option for our new house we’re renting that doesn’t have a dishwasher. I thought this would do the trick. What I didn’t factor in was how small this is and what you have to do to get it to run. By the time I’m done filling it up with water I could have done twice as many dishes. It also isn’t as powerful as a normal dishwasher. I wish I returned it when I still had the chance!
"It seems to be working pretty well so far despite a few hiccups in the past. My only complaint is that the rack is rusting and splitting so pieces are falling off. I had purchased the insurance for the dishwasher and filed a claim, but of course they do not cover rust. Now I have to find a way to purchase a new rack."
I waited weeks to make sure I could afford to buy a new $300 dishwasher for my counter only to receive a used machine. Everything was shoved inside still wet and the box was poorly taped. It wasn’t even clean!
"Only had it a few months and it's already having problems with overheating. It is well ventilated, drains are clear, and the water I'm using is not too hot. It's a mechanical error, not a user error."
Item arrived without the main drawer/tray as well as the silverware holder. It looked like it had already been returned by someone before because it had light marks on it and the box had UPS Store stickers on the outside.
"I was truly in love with this countertop dishwasher. I kept referring to it as a ""wonder of engineering"". It was everything we needed for two people in our little apartment. I received this dishwasher in October 2021, and in January 2022 it stopped working. There is no discernible way for me to fix it, the spinners where the water comes out just...don't go anymore. Really disappointed, I have e-mailed the e-mail address listed in the questions here with no response. It looks like this company maybe doesn't exist anymore...Very sad about this situation."
Dishwasher worked a couple of times and then would not even turn on after that.
"I bought mine in October of 2021 it is March of 2023 and my spinning jet won’t turn, I have a 2 year warranty but no one has replied back to my email as of yet and it’s been over a month, if you do buy this, get insurance!!"
I’ve washed 8 loads of dishes and everyone I’ve had to rewash by hand.  Some dishes come out dirty but they all come out with a white film all over them.  Not impressed at all.
I’ve had this dishwasher for more than a year now and started having problems with it a few months ago. It started with getting an E3 code on it and it leaking out the bottom and now it just leaks out of the bottom every time I try doing a cycle.
I bought a new product and received a obvioulsy used one. Very shady. The filter area on the tip is also dirty looking.
"This is nice product, easy to assembly but the small wheels on the racks keep falling off and the hose is leaks"
I've had 2 of these. ( The second was a replacement) I will not buy again. They just stop working.
"I have had this countertop dishwasher for less than a year, and it has already proven to be not worth the purchase. At first it worked fine, however now it does not wash dishes effectively. I have to rewash 2/3 of the dishes that come out of the cycle."
Definitely makes my life easier. Dishes are the bane of my existence. Frustrated that a crack has formed and product support no longer is accessible. I haven't even had it for a year.
"I really wanted this dishwasher to work, but after three months I’m calling it quits. The pervasive plastic smell has only gotten worse over time - everything that runs through the dishwasher has to be washed by hand after because of the smell and residue left behind. Leaving it open for days does nothing to help air out the plastic smell, it seems like the design is defective as the plastic interior can’t handle being wet or heated. The chemical stench seems to suggest that it’s not safe to eat off of anything run through this machine. I do not recommend wasting your money on this."
First cycle was a dream. Every cycle after that has been a hit or miss. I've reached out to the seller and their latest advice is to use baby care mode. Very expensive purchase just to have 1 mode be the one that works. I've had multiple dishes come out as if they were never washed. Might return this.
Sure it may save you some time but you have to hand scrub your dishes after they come out because they are never ever clean and use very specific detergent. And I’ve had it for probably 3 months now and the water things no longer spin. Don’t waste your money
"Ordered a HAVA dishwasher which worked initially, then after 60 days (right after the money back return policy expired) a leak was observed on the front right of the machine and an E3 error code displayed on the machine. It just sits there and beeps now, I can't even clear the error.No easy way to contact the manufacturer (no working website/no working support email).Very unhappy, don't buy!! Save your money and find a different solution, there's $300 for a few months of a working machine isn't worth it!"
"Worked great for 8 months, primarily for small items and mostly the baby’s bottles. One day I went to run a load and when I came back to the dishwasher, an E3 code was reading. There was a puddle of water on the counter and all over the cabinets.This isn’t what I expect from a $399 piece of equipment. Now to see if they’ll offer the one year warranty."
Mine stopped working exactly 5 hours after the return window. Did not do the best job before it shut down. 30 days closed..what junk …Save your money…hand wash them…it’s faster and less trouble
"The information says you can fit 12"" dishes. You cannot. At least, you can't fit more than 2 or 3 in the dishwasher because you have to tip them too far and little else fits. As you can see by the photos, I cannot stand the plate up far enough to close the door. I have to move it over to the third spot for plates and now only 2 fit."
"Although the dishwasher does what it is supposed to do, the customer service for this brand is truly less than poor. They simply stopped responding after giving me a very rude response when I tried to return this item. I would not recommend this company to anyone. I want my money back. 10/10 WILL NOT BUY AGAIN."
Tried to use it once but died in the middle of first use. Than water wouldn't work anymore so i returned it already. Not good.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is gross..
Complete waste of money dishes were not cleaned at all and it leaked water every where!
Item arrived with water leakage. The inner layer was cracked.
Loved it till it started leaking water from the bottom.
"I would highly recommend avoiding this product and brand.This machine leaks from the bottom, a lot. Our dishes we not clean, even after two cycles. I would recommend finding a different product or company, or just stick to hand washing like we are doing now."
"When I first moved into my apartment, a family member gifted me this dishwasher. I thought, ""Why not give it a try?"" It's better than washing dishes by hand, right?I loaded it up with two ceramic plates, a plastic Tupperware, and a ceramic cup—all pre-rinsed, of course. I filled the portable water tank and started it on the Heavy/Baby Care setting, hoping for sparkling clean dishes.Surprise! After one cycle, the dishes still had some stubborn bits of food. I ran it again with the same results. The machine does heat the water, but it also gives off a weird plastic smell when drying. Lovely. While waiting, I ended up hand-washing the rest of the dishes that didn't fit.Lesson learned: Just wash your dishes yourself, or make sure your new place has a built-in dishwasher. Rookie mistake!"
"Works fine for a while, but it died after only 2 years with an E3 (Faulty heating element) and all the support/technicians for this brand is UK based so good luck getting any help if you're from the US"
"I didn’t buy this from Amazon but directly from their site. I was hoping this would save us time from handwashing bottles. This machine does a poor job rinsing and drying. I pre-rinsed the bottles before loading, used baby care and dry mode."
"Would give zero stars if I could. Worked ok for a bit then it stopped. Spent a month and half trying to contact customer service. Apparently they have two customer service departments. One handles HAVA machines purchased from their website and the other handles HAVA machines purchased through Amazon. The CS that handled Amazon orders never ever responded (emailed repeatedly over several weeks). The CS that handles website orders finally told me they would help me, but I would have to pay to have the machine repaired. (Since they could not verify my order number as they did not handle Amazon orders.) Will never buy HAVA again!"
I’ve been using this dishwasher for about 4 days now. I’ve found myself needing to run two cleans somtimes because there is often a layerOil/residue left after the first wash.I’m assuming this is because there is no detergent release mechanism. Typically dishwashers do an intial clean with a small amount of detergent and get rid of most of the dirt and oil. It flushes that water away and uses a fresh batch of water with the detergent. However with this dishwasher all of the detergent is immediately mixed with the dirtiest water reducing the effectiveness.
I loved this dishwasher until 5 months in when it started leaking. It has leaked since then. I have tried many times to contact customer service. They answer 1 out of every 3 emails and then don't respond again. They have not helped me with the leaking dishwasher. I paid a lot of money for this and it hasn't worked. I'm very frustrated as I tried contacting them multiple ways and still no response. I don't know what to do next.
Did not clean as well as I expected it to
"I went back and erased my old review because I finally found what caused the issue and a fix for it. My review was previously much longer because I detailed all the trouble I was going through trying to get the top sprayer blade to spin. Taking it off, tightening it, loosening it, using vice grips, spinning it by hand to kick-start it, running cycles repeatedly just for testing. Very frustrating. I opened a return request because I was afraid I'd never figure out what the problem was. I thought the pressure going through the blade was too low because a lot of water leaks out of the center, rather than going out to the ends and through the nozzles to create the rotational force. It was spraying out of all the nozzles, but not spinning. Couldn't find a way to fix it. After too many hours screwing around with this machine, I finally found the problem. While spinning the blade by hand shortly after starting a cycle, I noticed it felt like there was some grainy substance in the center of the blade. The rotation was very scratchy, like a little sand was in it. Turns out the issue was detergent that hadn't completely dissolved. I'm very certain this is the issue now because some tests I did without detergent consistently resulted in the top sprayer working as intended through the entire cycle. My advice to anyone thinking about getting this is to be very picky about your detergent. Do not use packets that are entirely powder inside. If your detergent packets do have some powder, load the dishwasher with hot water to dissolve it faster. This helps in my experience. If you can't do that, or maybe you're in an RV and just don't want to use what little hot water you have, just run the normal cycle and wait ten minutes. The blade may not spin at first. The issue may resolve itself as the water heats up and dissolves the detergent. If the water is hot and the blade still isn't spinning, pause the cycle, spin it around a few times, and start it again. That should grind up whatever bit of detergent is stuck in there. You should feel some scratchiness when you spin it that will quickly go away. You may need to do this even if you load hot water, but the issue will at least resolve more quickly. I'm just going to have to get a different detergent at some point. The manual mentions nothing about this issue. It just says to use dishwasher detergent. The top sprayer's design is cheap, but it will work perfectly fine when there aren't grains of detergent flowing through it. My dishes are still getting cleaned quite well despite this problem. I would think there are a lot of detergents available that don't cause this to happen, judging by all the positive reviews. Going to leave my return open in case I run into any more problems."
"Our unit stopped working at about ten months , we had used it almost daily and it was fine until the 10th month then had glitching and would not start , thanks to amazon we were able to get refunded so thats nice . Probably would be great as a backup or camping unit ."
"I really wanted to like this product but it did not do what I purchased it for. I didnt want to buy a washer that was marketed for baby bottles so I tried my luck with this. And like one of the reviews I did find on here, it didn't wash the bottle nipples well. It left some residue. :( this is better for regular dish washing in apartments or rv. Not baby items even though there is a baby care option. It also doesn't sterilize. LASTLY, don't count on it to completely dry your dishes. The drying capability is just not there. Disappointed customer.  I don't know what to do with it now since I have a regular dish washer at home already. :("
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This dishwasher stopped working after 5 months of normal use, and regular cleaning and maintenance. Customer service sent directions for how to fix it myself, which unfortunately don’t work, and I haven’t heard back from them about a refund or at least a replacement. Very disappointed and it feels like I wasted a lot of money on this appliance.UPDATE - 03/24/23A couple of months later, I received a replacement dishwasher from Airmsen. This one came with a large crack at the bottom of the dishwasher, which means that it's not possible to use it. The package it was shipped in was still intact, which means that they were aware of shipping out a dishwasher that was already visibly broken. They are currently wasting both their time and mine, and in two months the warranty period will be over. Let's see if they can manage to send me a dishwasher that actually works before then...UPDATE - 07/09/23I’m happy to say that Airmsen customer service sent out a third dishwasher before the warranty period was over. It’s working well so far and hopefully it will last longer than the first one. They didn’t ask me to send the other two dishwashers back, so now I have two dishwashers for parts if the third one ends up breaking as well at some point… I’d give customer service five stars, since they were always very friendly, and the packing department and manufacturers one star. So I’ll change my 1-star review to a 3-star review.Good luck with your dishwasher purchase! You might want to look elsewhere to skip the headache."
"Hmm, on the fence with this one. This was supposed to make my life as a single mom easier and it honestly does, just not for this price.It is very quiet. Easy to fill with water (I wasn't willing to compromise my Brita attachment for a dishwasher so the top-fill feature is essential for me). It is very lightweight. Big enough for two days of mom and toddler dishes.I bought specifically for all the sippy cups, toddler bowls and plates, and silverware. The first issue is a good problem for most people in that the water jets are really strong. They move the lighter cups and bowls around, sometimes flipping them upsidedown, and I have to readjust mid-cycle.The suction cup for the drain hose is useless. I had to rig it and that definitely takes away from the tidiness I was looking for.The dry function does not work, at all. No really, ran the device with extra dry feature then tried to run a whole new dry cycle after that and only my coffee mug and ceramic plate were dry. Anything plastic, still soaked.Not necessarily a problem with the machine but the water spots are relentless. I know I have hard water and have been using Calgon with every cycle with no improvement. There is no rinse agent spot so I can't use something else without manually adding it later in the cycle.The dishwasher requires a lot of extra steps and now I am spending the same amount of time on dishes that I always was. The one I purchased is unavailable now but the same exact item is being sold under a different seller for more cash. Honestly, I would skip this item unless you have soft water and willing to still let them air dry."
"I purchased this solely to use on my baby items and pump parts. It doesn’t efficiently clean the insides of the items. Each wash they’ve come out oily and spotty. I’ve switched dish detergents, used all the different washing modes, rinsed my items before placing them in the dishwasher, and positioned items different ways to see if they’d come out 100% clean. Every time there is no change. I wouldn’t recommend this for use on baby items. However, I feel if you’re using this for your normal dish ware it’d probably work just fine."
"It needs the 89-minute ""Baby Care"" setting to be sure of removing stuck-on food.  But it cleans well and thoroughly on that setting, which uses no more water than shorter settings.It's nice to have the option of either pouring 3 pitcherfuls of hot water in the top hatch, or hooking the inlet hose up to your faucet.  I use the pitcher to avoid tying up the faucet for 1 1/2 hours straight.  The dishwasher does have its own internal electric water heater, but where I live, heating water with electricity costs twice as much as with my gas water heater.  The internal heater makes the water hot enough to deform soft plastics.But my sample arrived with *two* defects:  It doesn't respond to the button setting to turn off the 60-minute heated air-dry option, which wastes a lot of electricity when I can't be there to set my alarm for 90 minutes to turn it off manually.  And it has leaked slightly from the bottom since the start.  The leak isn't from the drain hose attachment--I checked that--but internal.  I had to buy an oversize plastic cutting board and a drain mat to put underneath, so the leak would drain into my kitchen sink.  It's a big heavy item, so returning it for a refund would've cost me more than buying it.One slip says the small amount of water inside it as received is from the factory test to make sure it runs.  And there was some, so they really do test for function.  Apparently, checking for leaks isn't part of their quality control."
"So far used this for two days. We got it to use for all of our baby bottles and pump parts so we didn’t have to hand wash or run the big dishwasher every day. The convenience is great. The cleaning power is pretty good on the baby setting. There isn’t a lot of room for the bottle nipples, caps and other small items, if you put them on the shelf they fly off mid cycle. I used the extra dry feature, and everything still comes out very wet, which is an inconvenience when it comes to the pump parts. Overall… it’s okay, keeps me from washing everything by hand."
"I wanted a unit that rolls on the floor so I can fit large item. Apparently they're unobtainium, new ones go for over $600 (shouldn't be more than $300)This will cut down on most of the load. Been washing dishes by hand for a year and it was either this or kill myself."
"Out of the box this dishwasher had a very strong chemical smell. We dismissed this at first because it was brand new. We followed set up instructions and did a few washes and it worked well, but after a few days we discovered that the chemical smell was still present and giving us headaches, fatigue, and dizziness. Unfortunately, we had already thrown away the box, otherwise we would have returned it. It was unbearable and very concerning to have those symptoms, we ended up leaving it outside to see if the smell will dissipate, but going through this makes me hesistant to ever bring it back inside, it may end up in the trash. If you are sensitive to smells or VOCs, be forewarned."
"Absolutely loved this little dishwasher at first. But after about five cycles, we noticed the upper arm bar wasn't spinning. I looked through several other reviews and found a few people complaining of the same thing. One person said he found Tide Pod residue clogging it up. This made total sense since you just set the pod in a little square indent in the bottom of the door, to which it immediately falls out when you shut the door.But I happily purchased a jug of liquid dish soap, which was way cheaper anyway. Everything was great for about 10 washings. Then the drying cycle stopped working.It's not really that I care if my dishes aren't 100% dry when I put them away, but I do care that it's only been a couple of weeks and I've already had to change dish soaps and settle for something that only partially works.It just made me wonder what else is going to go wrong? So I'm sending this one back and am gonna opt in for a cheaper one."
"I bought this 6 months ago. I ran it every other day. It cleaned and dried the dishes well, didn't leave water spots on things. It is simple to use, fill the pitcher included 3 times and pour it into the top, add your detergent, select the cycle you want and press start. Yesterday when I pressed start it started to run, then it started to beep. A red symbol showing water was flashing. The instructions say to tilt it backwards if you get that error code. I drained the water, started over and the same thing happened. Second thing the instructions said to do was contact customer support. I sent an email and will update this review once I receive an answer from them. I just think for the price of this machine you should get more than 6 months of use out of it."
"I've been trying to get ahold of this 'company' daily since July 6, 2023, due to the attached pictures. I've used their website to make a warranty request. I've used their website to make a contact support request. I've emailed their general email, support@airmsen.com, all with zero response. If it is after 30 days, which July 6 was, Amazon will not step in on your behalf and force you to contact the manufacturer.This thing is junk and falling apart. Entire prongs have just broken off and disappeared. No clue what material they have this basket coated in that it couldn't withstand normal use of dish washing.You cannot use this dishwasher without rack. So I have a nice $300 paperweight sitting on my counter for over 2 months now.I'm pretty sure these are just relabeled machines made by one manufacturer in particular in China, as you can find this exact model with a different brand for more and less than this price.Absolutely, make sure you register the product to get that additional year of warranty.YOU WILL NEED IT.That is, if you can actually get help."
"Once I opened the box I saw the water inside the machine. It's not just a drop, it's a lot of water. The machine is nicely packed, but it def used.Also, the height is wrong. In the description, it says that the height is 16.75 when in reality it’s 18.05. They mixed up the descriptions for the item. H IS FOR HEIGHT . This is very upsetting! I have a very limited space on the countertop because of my kitchen cabinets , and I was relying on this description when I order this machine! This is not a cheap item and very heavy to carry for me to return! I bought this to wash my baby’s bottles and plates. I can’t even put this anywhere!"
"Dishwasher has always done a nice job in washing dishes. Beware, the door cracked while it was still under warranty. Dealer promised to send new door couple of times but never did. Would expect better for the price"
"Water pump quit working (right after the return window closed),  and I'm left with a $300 paperweight. I've tried numerous times to contact customer service (???) without any luck. First time the company answered they said it would be forwarded to their tech dept. Waited, sent more emails, couple weeks later they asked me for more info. I immediately answered, since then, NOTHING. NO REPLY. One month later still NOTHING. For $300 I could have hired someone to wash my dishes, do my laundry, and walk the dog! This company is trash building trash."
"The dishwasher, less than 12 months after my purchase, started making an unstoppable sound. I contacted the warranty (even under 2 years warranty) they wanted me to open it, find out the problem, then they would send me the pieces and I had to assemble back. Just the worst customer service/warranty.  I told them I didn't have the skills to open my dishwasher, they never responded back.  No options of replacement.  They just ghosted me. So i would recommend this one only people with handy man skills because it will break and when that happens you will have to fix yourself."
"The dishwasher stopped working after 9 months. When I contacted the company they sent me a part and claimed it was replaceable in 10 mins. The replacement video was for older, simpler model. After I messaged them that replacing the part was too complicated for me they stopped returning my messages"
"I still have to clean dishes before i use the dish cleaner . But i kind of expected that, I mean it's just a portable"
"It’s great for laughs. There’s a cool purple light and a warm loud noise each time it washes four small to medium dishes and four clean pieces of silverware. I hate dishes and was looking for a solution. My mood has dramatically improved with this piece of comedy, but it will take 38 runs to empty my sink. Dear China: this ain’t gonna get it."
"UPDATE: it stopped working today November 1st, 2023. 😧 It was great but only lasted 6 months.My only regret is: WHY didn't I buy this beautiful thing before?!!!!!It has changed my life. I hate hand washing cutlery, so now that ""she"" does it, I'm free and happy! Everything comes out squeaky clean and hot. She even deep cleans pans and lids. I'm just amazed. The upper water blades are sometimes stuck but I think it's cause I'm using a whole powder pod and it might obstruct the rotation when not completely dissolved (my very hypothesis but Idk). I'm now using only half of the pod, even removed the plastic but I'm buying cascade gel asap to try.I absolutely recommend this little dishwasher. I felt a bit guilty when I ordered it but now I just think why didn't I buy it years ago? It's just adorable, life changing."
It didn't clean the baby bottles and pump equipment right.  Still dirty after wash.
I ordered this late April of 2023. It is October of 2023. I would say this was a great buy but today I washed Tupperware in it only to hear a loud pop halfway through. This is what I see when I open the door. I washed Tupperware. Why is this door shattered? I haven't even owned this 1 year. And conveniently I'm out of the timeframe to recieve a replacement or get money back. Almost 400 down the drain.
"Hooked it up. Used it 1x, water EVERYWHERE!!! Read instructions again - repeated reconnecting and tried again- water everywhere. Repeated efforts one more time - same results. Asked skilled friend to check (thinking I had 90 days to get help from Amazon, okayed waiting for friend's availability). Friend said it's hooked up correctly. Tried again (4th try) - water EVERYWHERE! Amazon says they only help in first 30 days, even though it says 90 in description (apparently the 90 days is for help from manufacturer- Amazon chat assistant not helpful other than to connect me to manufacturer - no reply yet....in other news, I now own a fantastic mop 🙄"
"The rack is the dishwasher is falling apart and since the padding is cracking apart, it's rusted. I contacted customer support (within warranty) and the never contacted me. It's been MONTHS.I used to live this machine. Too bad it didn't last longer!"
We have had our dishwasher for two years. It’s working for the first 6 months then went down hill from there. It stopped cleaning the dishes (keep in mind we always spray them off first and make sure it clean the filters frequently) and it now leaking from the top and bottom. Very disappointed for the price.
"I don't know if I got a faulty product or what, my dishes are still coming out dirty. I've tried different dishwasher detergents to no avail. I ran Mt first test load 3 times on normal, and the utensils still had grime on them and the plates were not clean.  I'm not overfilling it either. Dunno what's up but really disappointed in this unit."
"Used it once a day and worked for one month. Stopped pumping water today. Tested every step including relocation.EDIT!April fool's Day!Still no response fromChina.....and counting!!!!Customer Disservice on strike??MARCH 30, 2023Still no response to dishwasher quitting within days of requesting replacement or credit."
Worked perfect 89 days. Tried to contact customer service no reply s returned to Amazon a restocking fee over $50.00 so they restocked it and you might get this lemon next
"Pretty disappointed, started leaking immediately on the first day after receiving and installing. Haven't seen any other complaints about leaks on here so I either got a dud or these reviews are fake. Be wary, my friends!"
leaking water all over the place! and can't do anything about it because it's a year old. Hundreds of $
Worked great for a couple of months. Top spray arm stopped spinning. Emailed customer support. No response. Get what you pay for.
The rack rust within a  year and a half.replacement rack is 80.00 just a heads up. I bought mine in Oct 2022
"I loved this when it worked. But now it has power and won’t cycle. It is just out of warranty so I can not get help. As someone who is disabled it is important to have ease of use it has that. However, it will not cycle and wash the dishes now."
"I purchased this product and it broke after 1.5 years of use. I purchased a three year warranty and fought for a replacement for the last few months. After wasting countless hours on the phone and using their online text communication (which apparently keeps no records)  I am left with a worthless product and out an additional 75 on the product warranty. Horrid private seller (no solution provided) , plus horrible response from Amazon themselves (won’t do anything) because now we are out side of warranty despite me reaching out multiple times within the warranty window."
This dishwasher was smaller than I hoped but looked nice
Doesn't clean that well.
A fantastic little dishwasher.  Takes 3 jugs of water to run and a teaspoon of detergent.  That said it does not dry dishes.  I am happy with it though because I dont really care about the dishes getting super dry.  I though my unit might be defective dryer but then i looked closer at the design and how little power it uses and it makes sense there is no drying.
Cleans well but holds very little.
"I have crazy hours for work and needed a small dishwasher to help keep my place in order. I did a lot of research and this seemed like a safe bet, but I have immediately regretted my purchase.It was all new and wrapped up when I took it out of the box, only when I opened it up there was water in it (see picture). So obviously used and then made to look new. Then I thoroughly read the instructions, and nothing works. The attachment for the sink doesn't fit onto my faucet. So, I tried the tank mode which is totally faulty. It's supposed to beep when you've added 5L. Well I added almost 10L and it never beeped and refused to run for ""lack of water"". The water was literally overflowing into the sink from the tank and it still says it won't run.Save your money and grief. This thing is SO HUGE, the box is twice the size of the unit and now I have to get this thing to the post office to return it. SAVE YOURSELF THE GRIEF."
"I boughted this April 2023, and used it pretty much daily. Loved it, helped a ton, washed great, not too loud, and add a bit of vinegar and no water marks either. It was a little bit on my counter but made it work. It started to have draining issues in December, and by January won't run anymore. I've tried to contact the manufacturer but nothing. Finally got a hold of someone through a number and was told they would send me a new motor??? And that was it. It's sitting in my living room floor just not working now."
The dishwasher is easy to setup and use. The ability to fill the reservoir instead of hooking up to sink faucet is a nice feature that isn't found on most countertop/portable dishwashers. For a person living alone or with little space this appliance suits very well. However the water pressure and cleaning power inside the unit isn't comparable to a large dishwasher and so you'll have to give your dishes a rinse and perhaps quick wipe at least to have the dishes come out clean. Or you may still have leftover scraps or organic material on the dishes.
"I purchased this dishwasher specifically for its ""extra dry"" feature, but I am extremely disappointed. After running the cycle, my dishes and even larger items like pots and pans are still covered in water droplets. The so-called ""extra dry"" mode is ineffective and does not meet the expectations set by the product description. This has been a frustrating experience, as I was hoping for a more reliable drying performance. I would not recommend this dishwasher if you are looking for effective drying capabilities."
"I bought this on Dec 4 2022.  At first it worked great. I cleaned the filters twice.  Then on July 30 2023 I filled it and pressed start and it buzzed and start began blinking.  I checked the filters, they were still clean. I opened up the fill opening  and made sure the ballast was moving. Plugged it back in still a no go.  Checked operating manual.  Saw that if you press power and extra dry at the same time for 3 seconds it will completly drain. I did that and then refilled it until I heard the 3 dings that meant full.  I crossed my fingers and it's working!  Well it stopped.  It's because the water level bob no longer works and  I now have the water filling top unscrewed so I can reach in and lift the bob."
It seems like it would be great if it started but the hose is too large for a normal kitchen faucet and will not start due to “water shortage” even though the water tank is so full it’s spilling out the drain hose.
"Bought this a week ago, I live alone and don't have the space for a full dishwasher. When I cook I will use a normal amount of pans, pots, dishes and utensils.My first day of cooking, I had to do 3 cycles of washing because the dishwasher internal space is extremely small. Each cycle is around 2 hours, one hour for cleaning and one hour for drying. So 6 hours of dishwashing for one cook for a personal living alone is crazy imo. Imagine the amount of electricity used as well, so it's not environmentally friendly.My second issue is the cleaning itself. On each cycle I've done up to now, half the stuff came out not fully clean and sometimes I had to put them twice or just handwash them.If this was 150-200$ I'd say it might be convenient, but with its price tag, I do not recommend it all. After a week, I requested a return."
Only after 15 washes this machine stopped working. Wondering how to get it repaired I cannot seem to get any support for this.
"I was so excited to receive this because I’m a disabled young adult on my own & standing for long periods of time is extremely painful & bad for my back, so anyway I received my dishwasher and the box was a little beat up but everything seemed fine inside, so I read all the instructions & set it up, the first minute was great but then water started pouring out of the bottom of the dishwasher and making a huge mess I ended up slipping and falling then having to clean everything up including my dishes, there ended up being a massive crack inside the bottom of it (that’s how all of the water got out) on top of that I had to figure out how to get this dishwasher to a mailing place in pain and extremely exhausted. I’m so sad I really wanted this dishwasher"
can't comment on performance as it started but did not draw water
Bought one for my mom and my grandmother wanted one too. I bought one for my grandma and at her house we relied on the dimensions described in the add. It said it was 18 inches tall and it needs 23 inches of clearance. But the unit is 23 inches and needs at least 25 inches of clearance. Now I’m stuck with the headache of returning such a massive box.
Has not worked since day one. Do not buy this cheap trash. LEDs kept malfunctioning and the unit turns off randomly. Thanks for the waste of time.
I like everything about this machine except this part that I took the picture of. There are some fungi on the top… I will still use this dishwasher after I clean that water inlet hole.
The hose system snapped within a month. Can't even use it anymore
"Sprayer arms stopped working is the final nail in the coffin. Have dealt with leaks, jams, and more since day one"
"Heat cracked the front window, go for the more expensive version of this. I will be next time for sure !"
Want this deleted
"I owned this machine for less than a year before the rust started.Unfortunately, the warranty is useless as the company will not actually send you replacement parts. They will tell you over email that they will, but they don't. I have a rusting rack and no options for replacement.Buy a better brand washer."
But Amazon didn’t like my 5 star review and video saying it went against community guidelines. Therefore I’m returning this machine and can’t recommend it. Thank you.
"Planned obsolescence!!! It broke after the warranty was up and terriblecustomer service.  Massive cracks started to show up after about 3 months of owning, the grew every time it would run and now it's completely useless. Both arms stopped spinning and doesn't work."
"As I said it didn't work so I'm returning it, turned it on once and never worked again"
"The water has stopped dumping from the bottom after 1-year of use. My warranty has expired so now I just have a giant, unusable machine taking up space in the kitchen"
Waste of money it doesn’t rinse so all of your dishes are covered in soap
I used the dishwasher for a SINGLE DAY before the touch buttons started registering phantom button presses that would pause or outright end the cycle that it's on.Absolutely no quality control from this company
Dishes are not at all clean I use hot water and still grease all over them
"Instructions erroneously state that temperature can be displayed in Celsius. Farhenheit only. Machine is too small for some of my plates, and dishes often seem insufficiently rinsed. Hugely disappointed."
"Not impressed,"
"This unit showed to my home with the internal stprage tank already shattered in a way that couldnt be done unless it was done prior to being built, and was still installed in the unit, huge mess as i tried filling the tank only to have water start pouring all over my kitchen, great waste of $700 ill be getting my money back"
Could hand wash 3 place setting faster does not have enough space inside
unit does not allow to load my 11.5/8 inch dinnerware
I disliked it not worth the money
"I bought in Nov. 2020. It broke today. Water was leaking as fast as it was filling. Otherwise, it did a good job.The rack started rusting about a year ago, and apparently there are no parts available."
I've had this dishwasher for 4 months. It does clean the dishes really well. And the black window and white body brings my mismatched appliances together nicely. However. That's as good as it gets. There is no suction cup to hold the hose in the dishwasher like other brands have. So the hose will slip out of the sink when not connected and onto the floor. Which brings to my big issue. It does not drain well. From moment you disconnect it there is water at the top pouring out. When the hose falls on the floor it floods with water. I have tall counters I can't drain the entire hose out so we have been hanging it on the curtain hook. I discovered today that the rancid smell I've been having the past few days with the warm weather is actually the water stuck in the hose. Some minor cons is you pay more for a false window. And I hate the dish rack. I would love to replace the dish rack but I have not found one for these small counter top dishwashers. The prongs are slanted strictly for plates. Not ideal for pan/pot lids. The mug or cooking utensil rack is constantly slanted up can't be put to a 90° angle. And I do have some trouble with the height. My butter knives appear to be too long and so they must be at a slant to be able to fit in. Overall it's a nice machine as far as cleaning goes. I need to find a way to mount the hose to sink. But that won't fix the trapped water near base that causes a terrible odor.
"I purchased this back in march 2024 and its been great for the most part, I'm just now having a major problem with this dishwasher, everything was working just fine until a week ago it started beeping and throwing up a E4 error code and in the manual it says the E$ code is the internal PCB cant connect to the front panel display. And I've tried contacting every one I could to try and resolve this but everyone Amazon, Farberware and for some god known reason the seller (National Houseware Supply LLC) can't even be contacted for assistance it's still under its year warranty, I'm looking for either a replacement or  a way to get the correct part so I can fix it myself.The product is great overall ill have to update this review if I hear anything from anyone regarding my issue"
"So does it wash the dishes? Yes, but it doesn’t do a very good job if you don’t at least pre-rinse them or scrap off anything that’s kinda sticky. If you don’t then you might have to run the machine two or three times. I believe this is due to it not having a heating element to heat up the water."
Does this happen to anyone else?
"We've loved using this machine, it fits nicely in a cabinet and cleans dishes really well. However, we've gone through two of them the past two years as they inexplicably stop draining water after about 1-1.5 years of use. Support was great the first time and replaced the product, but seeing the exact thing happen again after another use is very frustrating. Lots of water to clean up when the dishwasher doesn't stop filling itself."
"I have mixed feelings on this dishwasher. I was super excited at first to get this so I can be lazy downstairs and not wash dishes by hand. This thing is absolutely massive on the outside and super small on the inside. I had to buy a cart to put it on because it didn’t work in my space. It doesn’t hold much at all, I can’t even get a normal size spatula or whisk in the utensil holder, I have to lay it down. The cup rack is too small for cups, I’ve been putting my larger utensils and smaller bowl/cup items on the cup rack, but the lighter ones turn over and fill with dirty water. I have found so many things that has flipped over and filled at the bottom of the machine, the rack has giant gaps in it. I also had a heck of a time finding an adapter for the sink, the one it came with didn’t work for mine. I’ve also found remnants of soggy soap at the bottom of the machine. My absolute biggest issue with this machine is there is nowhere to put the cords and tubes during storage, they just hang there and the water tube dumps water all over the floor and makes a massive mess even after draining it. All in all, unless I had a better set up for this I don't think of ever buy it again, its too bulky and messy."
"It is definitely a smaller dishwasher. For a family of 7, we have to run a few loads. However, it does great. Very efficient. Suitable for a single couple, or a dorm room. The instructions aren’t too clear, but we figured out how to connect everything. Saves a lot on water, even if we run 3 or 4 loads. All-in-all, we can get 7 large plates, 2 bowls, and a few cooking utensils in the machine."
"I felt satisfied enough at first -- although it arrived with the *outside packaging damaged* inside it seemed okay. While it's large and really does weigh a ""ton,"" it was not overly loud and seemed to work okay. After a few weeks and perhaps three cycles, however, the fill/input hose sprung a leak and took multiple drip-pan emptyings plus moppings to get through that. Obviously, it was useless to me then.Enter Amazon.  :(  It took nine or ten days, calls with five or six different ""customer service"" (or notsomuch?) reps, tons of time and frustration, supplying my own shipping box (remember, the original arrived damaged, plus it was constructed in a way that really couldn't be reassembled suitably for such a weighty item) at my own expense of $15 ... and when I *finally* got shipping arranged and someone *finally* showed to pick it up and I *finally* got my ""refund"" ... they subtracted another $50 bucks from it! I seriouly *lost money* ($65!) in the process.  >:-(On top of it all, the replacement (different model, since I didn't want a repeat of this!) that I ordered cost me at least $75+ more, but I didn't anticipate losing so much on my ""refund"" to compound things. And ... the replacement arrived *already wet* inside the box! WTF? The first cycle went okay and I'm just praying it will work out better than this one ... or I'll probably lose even more! Clearly, Amazon needs to do more careful quality-control and vet their sellers/products better.Lesson learned: Never, EVER again buy a large, heavy, and somewhat pricey item online from Amazon! If I'd physically gone to Home Depot (which had this precise item for the exact-same price) or Lowe's (even Walmart), I'd have been able to walk in with my receipt after my new kitchen got flooded, say ""The darn thing leaks,"" and get *all* of my money back ... far faster, and without all this extra stress.If Amazon wanted to show some class, they'd send me a $75 gift card with apologies for all the hassle, less-than-competent staff contacts, and lost money ... but I'm not holding my breath.  ?!@#$%&?!"
"this product is small and compact. its relatively quiet for a dishwasher however it was difficult to install. in addition, our item always come out soaking wet and we need to run them through a dry cycle in our baby breeza which is not convenient. we purchased this for out baby items. furthermore there is constantly an excessive amount of soap left after the 90 minute baby wash causing me to run it for an addition 45 minutes in the speed wash. i have played around with many different amounts of soap and everytime there is an excessive amount left over. ultimately a cycle that should take 90 minutes from start to finish winds up taking us 3 hours. not great for a mother looking to reduce the amount of work she has!"
"Works wellFits inside a kitchen cupboardEasy to plumb in to sink (I did rig it a little as home depot was short of a pipe I needed, hence you can see I spliced into the drain and use a collar to seal it).Problems:E4 error. Happens when too much food debris is in. Once you get it on this, it never stops and manual says return for service.To fix it, unplug, and manually clear the drain of debris. Plug it in and turn it on and it will drain fully. Unplug. Wait 24 hour for the water at the float sensor to evaporate. Tilt it backwards 30 degrees and let the unit drop, the float falls back into the down position because of the G-force from falling and error gone. No need to unhook it, open up the bottom with a screwdriver and manually re-seat it.Haven't seen that info anywhere so thought I would post my findings for others.Regards, RobFixed the E4 twice for me now."
"The positive reviews were written in the ""honeymoon"" period after purchase.  I felt the same way.  Then the dreaded E4 errors started.  The filters and traps were clean enough to eat off of.  The hoses were straight - no kinks.  I took them apart to confirm they were shiny and clean.  The water pump was dying.  What was originally a blast of water that showered the surroundings of the sink basin was now a trickle.  The dishes were no longer as clean.  It never pumped all the water out - the dishes were often wet as relayed in other reviews.  But that weak motor also doesn't live very long.  Ultimately, just a poorly built product with a short lifespan."
Item was delivered with a huge dent in the side of it.
"The dishwasher itself is about what I expected as far as size and capacity.  My plates barely fit (to the point of just touching the top), but they did fit.  It won't hold a lot, but it isn't meant to.  I will say that you shouldn't expect to actually use the 'cup' rack for cups unless they're demitasse cups.  I removed them so they wouldn't be in the way (easy to do).Unfortunately, the red pressure release button came off on the very first load (picture attached).  When I contacted customer service to ask for a replacement for this very minor part, their response was ""Unfortunately we are out of stock with the part that you need and no indication when or if we will get more in. Since it was just purchased from Amazon I suggest that you return to Amazon for an exchange or refund. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.""Thus, I had to box up and return the entire dishwasher due to them being unable to replace a very cheap part.  Thankfully I still had the box, and Amazon made the return extremely easy (Thank you Amazon!).I'm not really sure how to rate the dishwasher - it did a good job of cleaning the dishes that I did wash, but the part immediately breaking (poor quality?) and the inability to support the product definitely soured me on it.  Thus, I'm only giving it two stars."
"This is my second countertop dishwasher, and I use it frequently. This unit is quieter than the one I used to have. The interior basket's design is inferior, with strange spaces that allow dishes to droop through openings. The connector piece for the faucet arrived difficult to use and has broken, and I'm looking at a $60 replacement part.If you need one of these, it's an okay dishwasher, but not necessarily better than others on the market."
it’s very big doesn’t fit on our counter. and don’t be fooled by the size it doesn’t fit that much dishes in there and it takes 2 hours to clean. you could just wash the dishes in 15 mins instead of 2 hours
"I bought this model last year and last week it died completely. It's a wonderful dishwasher if your only sink is a worthless bar sink and you don't mind having hoses connected to it constantly.What I don't like is that if it dies, you go on farberware's website only to discover that they don't deal in appliance warranties and the company that does is Wal-Mart. So then you call the line they give you and Wal-Mart hangs up on you once they discover that it was an Amazon purchase. So you contact Amazon and they give you a email (warrantyquestions@amazon.com) that doesn't respond to you no matter how many times you email it.So now I have a broken $400 paperweight in my kitchenette in a studio apt that I can't afford. So thanks Amazon for a whole 30 day return window and zero warranty support on an appliance that cost me 3/4th's of my income.I was going to give 2 stars but by the time I finished this review I was upset again so... 1 star."
Easy enough to put together and understand instructionsBut the timer doesnt seem to work like its supposed too..it gets stuck on a number and stays like that for several minutes...and it extends how long the dishes are in the washer and it makes me scared its gonna get stuck that way
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So I’ve had this for a while now and I’m having some trouble with a few things. I’ve tried a few different soaps for this things and my dishes keep coming out with soap scum on it. I’ve tried different soaps, different rinse aids and I’ve also been doing each load TWICE. If anyone else has this thing and doesn’t have an issue with soap scum please tell me what kind of soap and/or rinse aid you use. Cause at this point this thing is pretty unless. I rinse my dishes before they go in and I have to rinse them before putting them away. I’m happy she’s quiet but each load is over and hour and a half for “heavy” but still isn’t doing the job. Waisted $300....Update: now it’s leaking everywhere"
"It is definitely not worth the $300 i spent to buy it. Within a few months, it started malfunctioning. It was leaking water from the bottom. I called customer service, i did what the lady told me to. Nothing worked. Thankfully the warranty was still active. Well i received the warranty replacement, just for it ALSO to malfunction. It stopped washing my dishes, and the soap stuck on and didnt fully dissolve out of the container like its supposed to. I didnt even bother trying to figure it out honestly. I followed the care instructions to the T and it didnt have any influence on how long this appliance lasted. Im disabled, this was supposed to be helpful for me. But instead it turned into a stress induced nightmare. Wish i wouldve used my money on something that would be actually useful... like kitchen cabinets. Save your money and just wash dishes by hand."
"Disliked: needed to buy two adapters, two new hoses. One hose for drain and the other to supply water. The hoses that came with did not fit any of the water hookups that I could use. If I would have kept the machine I would have had to spent about $200 to try it out.  I returned all the items I bought for it and returned the dish washer. Sealed up the box with Gorilla Tape and UPS it back.Pros: Was well packaged and looked like a decent machine but did not run it to see how it worked."
"It's a little too large for the countertop. Meaning it's a little too tall. I did what other's suggested and put it on a rolling cart. Then I can tuck it away in a corner when not being used. It's pretty loud and noisy, but expected. Cleans well MOST of the time. There definitely have been times it looks like nothing was washed. Too much of a hassle to return."
"Update 8/22/24Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to mourn the loss of not only ONE portable dishwasher but TWO. That’s right, a total of 15 months and two dishwashers later, here I find myself searching frantically for another dishwasher that hopefully won’t leave my sink full and my heart broken.Around 6 months after our initial purchase, our machine started presenting the E4 code. Being the savvy folks we are, we pulled out the instruction booklet to see what the issue was.We tried everything that we could do and as the last resort, contacted customer service. They were phenomenal. They had a new machine sent out to us within 36 hours.Fast forward to now…..same issues. Opportunities for replacement ran out in May so I highly doubt customer service would be able to do anything.****************We live in a 450sqft house and this dishwasher is a life saver!!!! It works perfectly well. We run it as much as two times a day since we’ve purchased it and we have not had any issues!! Even if we had to purchase one of these a year, I’d do it!"
"My first dishwasher in 22 years. I love not having dirty dishes visible. It’s quiet and holds quite a lot. The outside was all marred. I thought it was a protective coating but it’s not. The marks can’t be removed. Too much hassle to repack and send back. Works great, looks like 💩"
"So, I like it.  It is easy to use.  But it doesn't really get the dishes dry.  The interior is spacious enough that I can wash  any dish, and small pots and pans.  It is counter depth.  The biggest problem is that it does not easily connect to more than a couple of types of faucets.  My faucets are all-in-one solutions, meaning the nozel is the sprayer hose.  But sprayer hoses are 1/2 inch female.  It is nearly impossible to find a 1/2 male to whatever the dishwasher hooks up to.  I crimped a rubber tube on it, but it broke after a couple of weeks.  So I haven't used it too much.  I would say this is good for a camper, but not for house."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            UPDATE on 8/17/24: I returned this on 7/29/24 and still haven’t gotten my money back. One more reason not to get this product because they will hold on to your money.This dishwasher has a leaking issue in the back. Do not buy this made in China product if you want your counter to be all soaking wet. Not to mention it’s pretty close to the power cord. You’re better off buying a full size dishwasher from a store like Lowe’s and is a reputable brand that’s not made in China than this. I will be returning this.
"This dishwasher worked great for the first month I owned it. Shortly after then it started having issues with water pressure and cleaning. Dishes would be left with streaks and dishwasher pods would be left half full. The item is also too large to fit under a standard cabinet, making it fairly difficult to find a place for it."
"It came with a slight crack in the door by the handle (got the one with the glass door). Also the silverware basket handle was broken. Neither are too bad but kind of disappointing when stuff comes broken! Also it doesn't fit on my counter but I bought a little stand that rolls and put a tablecloth on it which works nicely for me (bought here https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ARFEPM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) At first I was using powdered detergent and no rinse aid and the dishes were coming out soaking wet. I switched to a gel detergent, added rinse aid and used the extra dry function and they dry much better now. It's small but I live alone and it's definitely nice to not wash dishes by hand. Plus I imagine it saves water. I rinse everything well before I put it in, haven't tried anything heavily soiled yet. Works well for me!"
We bought this for ourselves for Christmas. Last night we got ready to run it and it won’t latch. The internal plastic piece is up inside the dishwasher. We’ll get it fixed (hopefully) just frustrating for what we paid.
I've had this dishwasher over 6 months and love it as it does a great job but also wouldn't buy it again.  I have had issues with the connector to the sink pooping off during a water cycle.  Then I get an error message and have to begin all over as I can't get my dishwasher to reset once I've reattached the connection.  We cannot find act rhyme or reason to this happening so I wouldn't feel confident buying again.  When it works it is fantastic and fits a lot of dishes and even my instant pot insert and lid.
"Have to add detergent booster, detergent, and rinse aid - all top “name brands” (directions specify using a name brand rinse aid) and still glassware - plastic, glass, ceramic - come out with streaks on them or not clean at all even when the longest wash cycle is used."
"I loath this dishwasher with ever fiber of my being. If I have to hear I told you so from my husband again I will scream. I do use it a few times a week so I don't have to hear anymore crap about buying it. I was looking for something to help me - save time. This is not the answer. Believe me I have tried different detergents - without and without rinse agents - different cycles... I am at my wits end. The dishes need to be prewashed , the dishes still have a layer of soap on them so I either run a self clean cycle immediately after or take them out and rinse them and all that does is defeat any hope I ever had of the dishes, glasses etc of being dry. I can speed wash and set out a load to air dry in a third of the time the heavy duty cycle 1:40 minutes runs. I'm not sure I can even call this a dishwasher when dried coffee is left intact in mug or left over ice cream on a bowl needs hand washed. And even following the direction or tip of letting steam out doesn't help these dry! - 2 days later and the load that sat there ""drying"" is wet. Frustrating and disappointing because if I have to wash/rinse and air dry every load - all it does is waste my time. I wish I hadn't bought this. Almost as much as I wished this would work."
"Used this to replace a decade old Magic Chef dishwasher that failed. I needed something the same size as the old one to fit in a tight space. This one was an exact match size wise. The unit works flawlessly and does a great job.I knocked two stars off because the top left corner was dented, yet the outer box wasn't damaged at all... Therefore this unit had to have been packaged this way at the factory. Because boxing it back up and returning it is a super pain in the backside, we decided to keep it despite the dent."
"Well, I found that while there is considerable variation in how well this dishwasher cleans depending on which detergent you used, it did actually do at least a halfway decent job.However it soon gave me an error code ""E4"" which for which the manual says I should call support.  After a bit, they offered t replace it on warranty.  We'll see how that one holds up."
The dishwasher works great. The only issue I have is the detergent cover never really closed correctly. You had to fiddle with it to make it stay closed. Finally it will not close. We are out of the one year warranty. I called the warranty support and confirmed out of warranty. I requested to purchase the part and found out they'd not sell the part nor can you find it any where. The manufacturer only has a few major parts available. My mistake for not calling within warranty period or buying one.
"Kitchen remodel is a good year in the future and portable dishwasher died.  So the Farberware countertop dishwasher will fill the need for the time being.  It is quiet, naturally cannot do many dishes etc at once, but that's a given.  The problem is the cheap plastic connection for hose to the kitchen faucet, the thing leaks constantly. Find another product image (as not shown here) and you'll know as you see it.  I have to wrap electric tape around the connection and a towel, to dampen the light stream while the dishwasher runs.UPDATE 2023-2024: Dishwasher no longer cleans well -- yes, cleaned sprayer arm but seems you can't fully clear any obstacles.  I contacted Farberware, their response they no longer sell replacement parts. Yet they continue to sell the model!!  Followup email for compatible sprayer arms, they did not respond.  D for customer service."
"I was so excited to get this, tight off the bat sn E4 message and did not even add water yet. I did notice dents in both top back corners. I called customer service, they were pleasant to work with. Did not resolve the issue so called Amazon. The item is being replaced. Amazon has been awesome to work with. Hope the replacement isn’t a lemon. I have always had good service with Amazon and purchase with confidence knowing they have my back."
"really not a terrible machine, but the hookups on the back are unique so don't break them as you cannot find them in any store. Also, just splice the hose if you'd like longer hoses. To fix E4 error make sure drain hose isn't kinked and once water is out pick up the front of machine and drop it 3 or 4 inches to reset sensor that gets stuck when water fills the bottom."
"Ordered new one…received nasty dented used one with cut hoses…go for it lolEdit-Amazon ended up taking care of me and gave me a full refund. I ultimately bought a similar unit from Home Depot.***don’t try to install these above counter dishwasher in the traditional way; with the hoses hooked into the normal plumbing below your sink. It can be done but you’d literally have to macgyver a connection under the sink utilizing the included faucet connection, which is intended to go above the counter. If you choose this route know that you’ll have to mix outdoor garden hose connections with indoor sink and bathroom connections to make it work.Even worse, If you hook it straight in like you would a normal dishwasher, it would just fill up and overflow the machine onto the floor; the included sink connection has a valve that stops water flow and is vital to the whole operation. A normal dishwasher must have this valve internally.Tally Ho carry on"
"This thing is okay at best. The first one we ordered leaked all over the counter when it was trying to fill with water. That was easy to return. The second one arrived shortly after. It is pretty noisy, but that’s not really an issue. The reason I really dislike this washing machine is the soap dispenser often doesn’t open up during the cycle. We have tried all sorts of things to no avail. I really don’t think this thing is worth the loss of counter space."
"return window was quite short. bought for my mother as a christmas gift but couldnt get around to installing it for a couple months. return window was, i think less than 2 months or maybe two. but dang thing leaked from the bottom... from what it looks like the door seal was designed to barely make contact with the door intself leaving room for the water to escape down the hinge into the outer containment and just found any and all plastic hole to spill out leaving the counter top drenched."
"There is no tight leak between the dishwasher's water outlet and the water hose. Instead, it's just a plastic piece that is more or less held in place, which is by no means tight in any way. The result is constant water leaks. Leaks are the normal situation with this dishwasher, not a rare occurrence. Some of the water will drain onto whatever surface you have the dishwasher was placed on. \\The constant water leaks are hazardous as the electricy supply is directly next to the water outlet.I tried writing the support. However, the support page that Amazon links to wants my model number. It claims the model number is invalid. I am using the model number here on the sales page in Amazon and the manual that the dishwasher came with (both are the same model number). That is the only model number I have. So the form of the manufacturer does not even let me submit my support request due to claiming that the model number is invalid."
Product was as advertised it is a countertop dishwasher. It cleaned my dishes great but now after 2 - 3 full cycles I get a E4 message. I have to pickup and tilt the whole unit into the sink to empty the bottom tray. Apparently the E4 error means overflow and some part of the unit leaks... Great that it happened 3 - 4 months into use. So buyers beware!
"This was was ordered on 3/31/23 and received on 4/5/23. Due to plumbing in a new faucet it wasn't actually used until 4/15/23. It has been a great diswasher up until today, 6/17/23 when it had an ""E4"" error code which is overflow. Cleaned the drain screens, disconnected the drain hose and it wasn't blocked in anyway. Ran a clean cycle and same error code with even more water in the bottom of the dishwasher. It is making a louder noise when it drains (like the impeller isn't working properly). Also the Amazon return window has closed unless I want to take a $67 re-stocking penalty for a $336 dollar item. I submitted a ticket to Nostalgia Products today to see if I can get a refund or replacement item."
"The machine itself is quite large and takes up a lot of counter space. But the inside is very small, a bit smaller than I expected, considering the size of the machine. I can fit my smaller dishes, but most of my plates are too tall. It does get them clean, tho, and it is quiet."
"My kitchen is flooded, my dishes are filthy and I regret buying this. This item came to me with a missing plug, which it says I need to remove before starting a cycle. So clearly someone has used it before. Then! I get E4 error code seconds before water starts flooding out of the bottom near the electrical paneling. I think God I didn’t get electrocuted! After spending three hours looking around and trying to disconnect and reconnect the hoses, I found that a hard plastic piece underneath, seems like some sort of train piece, has been cracked in half and then attempted to be taped back together. Mind you it arrived this morning while I was at work. Didn’t open it until this evening. This item which is supposed to be brand new is so veryObviously used broken and then returned. I am desperate for a dishwasher to help my elderly mother. So I will give them one more chance to replace this and send me an item that truly is brand new. If this happens again I’m considering not shopping on Amazon anymore. Save myself the money!"
"My husband & I like the dishwasher but we had bought another about 7 years back & replaced it with this one. I didn't care for the rack, too small so took the old rack & used it. It cleans very well but with the rack its hard to place much in it. If I hadn't had my old rack I would have sent it back."
"Unfortunately I found out the hard way that this dishwasher doesn't have a faucet adapter and that's only the beginning of the issues.  Their customer service with Farberware, a company more associate with dishes & cookware, is useless and persona non grata.  Emails and phone calls go unreturned to their customer service.  But back to the faucet adapter, nothing is packed in the dishwasher and if you're crafty enough, you should be able to find one.  (In)conveniently, the manufacturer doesn't bring up this fact and I found out the hard way, when unboxing this beast.  The unit itself is heavy and if you live in an apartment that's a walk-up, it's going to stink having to haul this system up.  Returning in itself is a whole new beast, given how it's packed, which is pretty specific, especially for a heavy unit that will do a number on your back.  I hated this unit for the headache it caused.Amazon customer service was good, this unit isn't.  Move on and find a useful countertop dishwasher."
"I bought this about 6 months ago. I loved it for all of that time, until today when the drain hose broke and blew off, and sent water all over my kitchen.  I can not find any where to see if these parts are universal or proprietary to Faberware.  It is less than 6 months old!  Very disappointed."
"it has a very nice look to it and wow does it clean! however, the hoses and connectors need improvement...I have had this for one week and one of the parts already broke! the parts are made of plastic instead of metal.  why???  the hoses are very short and very stiff.  when i connected them, it already felt like the plastic connector may break because of the strain from the stiff hoses.  not only is plastic easily broken, but it also looks like crap.  (so cheap looking).  high quality dishwasher yet way below par connections...for the manufacture to save a few bucks? in the long run, it doesn't benefit them because this type of thing causes people to return items, need warranty replacements, or stop buying new products from the company!  However, if you don’t mind a few cheap parts, this really is a nice washer!"
Dishes do not sit on the rack properly unless they are propped up by a bowl. Because of the need to use a bowl to prop the dishes there is no room for any bowls to wash. With all of that I had to keep adjusting the Dishes and bowls and 2 glasses  to push the rack into the dishwasher.
"This manufacturer assumes you have the EXACT TYPE OF FAUCET necessary to use this product. That would be like winning the lottery. Also, it comes with NO ADAPTERS, and NO INSTRUCTIONS about what to do if you don't have the right faucet.MORE IMPORTANTLY - the product descriptions conveniently leave this info out of the buying process. Why are there no diagrams and descriptions of the kind of faucet(s) you need to use this white elephant?EVEN WORSE, many of the reviews talk about how easy this is to set up. Well, maybe if you have the exact right kind of faucet it might be. But I'll never know. I'm going to have to pay a plumber to install a different faucet if I want to keep this.RETURNING IT? Would be a nightmare to repack this monster effectively.Also, it's BIGGER than it looks in the photos."
"It came dented and adaptor doesn't fit my sink. It was dented on top side and front. UPS has been ""shipping"" it back since 4/29, I already bought a new one you add water too which is great but would really like my 300+ $ back ASAP."
"December 2021: I initially gave this product a high rating but have to update it. After one year of use, the soap dispenser stopped opening and my dishes have been consistently dirty after cycles. I contacted the company and I am waiting to hear back to see what can be done. I am disappointed that this product stopped working so soon.September 2020: This machine has changed my life! As a mother of three boys that love to dirty up all of our utensils and cups every day, this countertop dishwasher has saved me. Fits in my small kitchen and washes the greasiest of dishes clean. Easy to hook up and quiet too. I highly recommend this product."
I bought this. It didn’t even work out of the box. It would get power and turn on but when I pressed or tried another button it wouldn’t work. And if you call their support their only troubleshooting they can do it’s what’s already in the manual
"So, unless you have a standard sink - you'll need an adapter.  I went to a couple hardware stores with no luck (I have a faucet that had the detachable spray nozzle).  I finally went to a plumbing supply store and was told the adapter size I need doesn't exist 😢"
"I would love to know if this dishwasher works well or not. The problem is is that in this day and age you would think that a reputable company would make it easy to connect the hose from the dishwasher to the sink. The problem is is I have a pulldown faucet and they don’t match up. Most people nowadays have pulldown faucets. I went to two different hardware stores and they told me it can’t be connected. I’m wasting a lot of time and energy trying to rig this together , does anyone have any solutions? I live alone and the thought of having to box this back up and get it into the car and two the UPS store by myself is overwhelming. I think the box alone weighs as much as the dishwasher. I’m very very disappointed that this doesn’t come with multiple connections for different size faucets or at least direct you where to buy or which ones to buy."
"This little dishwasher was amazing at first, but the drain pump failed in less than a year."
I have vintage 10 inch plates and they are too big for the dishwasher. It really holds very few items and takes an hour and 15 minutes to do one load. Good for a 1 person home. Would have returned it if it wasn't so heavy and impossible to repackage. It is very quiet though.
"Within a week the silverware holder broke. There is nothing to secure the holder to, so the silverware falls into the bottom of the dishwasher every time you pull the rack out. I would never buy this again."
"It worked great for about 3 months, then had to make sure all dishes were scrubbed before putting in dishwasher. After 6 months it left residue on dishes. Stopped working completely,  won't even turn on, after just short of 2 years."
"Got an E4 code out of the box, but then again, Amazon delivered it upside down where it sat in my complex office for 2 days.Installed exactly as recommended in the manual, double checked all connections. I had to find the correct instructions online because Farberware ships this item with a manual from an older model.E4 error code popped up instantly. I uninstalled and reinstalled everything and checked all common issues, no luck.Won't complete a full cycle, E4 error pops up instantly, and the washer turns on by itself as soon as it's plugged in.Gonna return it and try again. If the second one is garbage as well, I'll buy the Comfee."
"The product arrived a week after it was expected. This was in December of 2020, so understandable. My concern is this dent that is obviously coming from inside the unit. I am not sure how this will perform well over a long period of time."
"The basket or dishes holder doesn't hold any normal dishes easily.  There's a diagram provided as to how to load the dishwasher but it's not realistic to normal usage.Not even sure the soap dispenser is working properly as the Palmolive eco+ gel dishwasher detergent  builds up on the bottom of the door.Right now, it's better as the most expensive, glorified dish strainer since it's less irritating to hand wash dishes than it is to have this run for an hour and half and still not dry the dishes."
"We would clean things out regularly, but after about 8 months we would have to run the dishes twice to get them clean. After a year, the compartment that holds the soap stopped staying shut and we could not put anything in that wasn’t completely rinsed clean. Now after 1.5 years, we are looking for a new one because everything ran through it just needs to be hand cleaned after no matter what."
"I gave one star to this machine for attention, machine quality is great and works perfectly. The only problem is the hose quick release valve that it comes with it's useless. It's a shake that such great product has to be shadowed by one weak hose that is always leaking water and super hard to press a red button use for release the water. In case you want to use the faucet for something else say goodbye to your fingers trying to press that red button. I tried several times to contact the seller but to no avail. It's almost impossible to get a replacement valve or hose for this countertop models. Which led me to return the product I will attach a couple of pictures. Of the disgraced valve. Maybe because of the pandemic they didn't answer me. Anyhow, the machine is great but needs better connections."
"Purchased the first one in October 22. Quit working in January 23. Got a replacement and it quit working yesterday March 16, 2023. Same error message E4. Exploring options for a replacement. Loved everything about this dishwasher except it only lasts a few months."
"This is, unfortunately, the worst appliance I have ever purchased. The packing... fine, the condition on arrival, fine. I have underloaded the washer with a variety of kitchen items. I have re-run P2 making sure nothing was stuck in the spray arm, nothing was dirty (literally just things from a box taken from a box after a move) moved the silverware basket to the middle. Six hours with really good diswasher detergent, additional chemicals for water spots, really light load and it did still did nothing. I missed my return date by just a few days due to getting busy or it would be going back. I've gone back to washing by hand... the amount of water I am using and the amount of electricty and the lack of cleaning makes it a clear non starter. I'll be putting up on FB marketplace just to get the space back."
"I liked this dishwasher when I first got it, but less than two months later, it started getting errors in the middle of the cycle. I was told to tip it into the sink to drain the water out of it, but after getting the same error three cycles in a row, the company agreed to replace it. The new one came in, and it has not worked even once- it goes through an entire cycle but does nothing other than filling. When the cycle ends it shows an E3 error, and when I open it up there is still soap in the dispenser and the dishes are still dirty. Still waiting to hear from the company about what they are going to do. Maybe I’ve just been unlucky, but getting 2 lemons in a row is very frustrating."
When I got it I tried Sams Club dish washing soap. Did not work well. Then I found if I use a high end packet soap then it worked pretty good...not great but pretty good.
"We bought this sometime in nov 2022 and we keot getting thr E4. Fixed it and months later it's making weird noises and it floods the entire kitchen! We tried the customer service and they had me email them. 2 weeks later, i still havent heard back. And its still under warranty. They blame it on COVID ( for whatever reason) for the lack of communication and claim tickets. We decided to cut our losses and buy a new dishwasher and a different brand altogether."
"There's no upper sprayer, only a lower sprayer. The only way it cleans properly is if you hand wash your dishes first which defeats the point of a dishwasher"
The silverware holder came broken.  Dishwasher works like it should. I can't give 5 stars due the broken piece. We were able to replace the silverware holder.
"I owned a Danby for over 5 years before buying this garbage and it's been less than a year and it won't drain.  We have checked all the hoses and there's no blockages or leaks, just gets stuck on E4 and then we have to drain it manually...over and over again. 😤 Opposite of convenient."
Never worked properly and got error 4 message about leakage inside the bottom of the unit the first time I attempted to run it. Defective on arrival.
"for the most part this washer was great.... when it worked... i haven't even had this thing for a full year and i starts leaking making loud noises and beeping errors at me, i called the customer service about the warranty and they don't have anything to replace it, and can only give me the price of the washer back if i cut the power cord and send them a picture, i can't buy another one because they have doubled in price and it's not even enough to fix the thing in the first place!! STAY AWAY FROM FARBERWARE THEY WILL SCREW YOU OVER!!!! BUY A DIFFERENT WASHER!"
Absolutely NOT worth the money. My dishes still come out as dirty as they went in leaving me to hand wash them all.
You have to run items through twice as it’s not very powerful at all so it negates the need for it.  Not impressed.
"I thought this dishwasher was a godsend when I first got it.  I was really excited!  But it only lasted for five months and then it began to leak.  Flooded my kitchen floor.  I ended up just throwing it away because it wasn't worth it to me to repair it.  It was taking the enamel off my vintage sink.  I don't know if it was a combination of the chemicals in the dishwashing tablets or if it was the extremely hot water.  But if you have an old house, and a vintage 1950s enameled sink, I would NOT recommend buying this dishwasher."
"First, I had trouble with the fittings, and once I got that situated and started testing the line, the hose completely broke. I had it for a week and have yet to be able to use it and just got fed up and I’m returning it."
Packagsing was in damaged. Product looked good. As soon as it was hooked up to water source water was pouring from the bottom. Never even got to turn it on. No support from amazon nor farberware.
"I can’t return it so I will probably give it away and buy another.  Dishes have to be washed by hand when they come out, so why bother.  I was so looking forward to this, and it’s junk.  If it worked and wasn’t damaged, I could see it being the star of my life.  I’ve canceled my prime because I’m done being shipped junk."
Very light cleaning. Don't expect a clean like a full size washer.
It reads code E4 and screams and beeps while it's on. Leaving it for days and unplugging and replacing doesn't work. It just starts up again the second its plugged in beeping loading. Garbage and now annoying to return.
"Awful warranty service! The Amazon customer service agents did their best but the manufacture company has a horrible service! The hose is leaking from it's connection to the faucet and you end up wasting water, then I call them and they say they don't have parts!!! You have to return the whole thing, which is time consuming and also stupid! What kind of warranty is that?The dishwasher works okay, but it is not supper, and you can find many other dishwashers with same functions while paying even less, and get a good warranty. The drying mode doesn't really work that well and your dishes will be wet anyways!NOT RECOMMENDED!"
"My dishwasher was defective and leaked despite going to the hardware store and buying additional supplies to try and improve things. It also didn't get the dishes clean. I tried returning and it was a nightmare! I ended up losing money trying to return this piece of garbage. Seriously, don't waste your money on this trash! It's also really big and heavy, you need two people or a big strong man to carry this. One of the worst purchases of my life!"
It seems nicely constructed and larger than you would think for something that sits on your countertop.  It worked well for the first run but froze in the middle of the second wash and never recovered.  Had to send it back for a refund.
"After setting up the unit according to the directions, it doesn't work. As far as I can tell there isn't a problem and I can't clear the error message. Broken on delivery, don't buy this one.Edit: It just started working after not working for years. Nothing changed from what I know. Just tried it again and it worked."
"The dishwasher was fine for the two years we had it. Unfortunately, after many trial and errors on solutions to fix the machine we ended up giving up and just getting a new one from another company. It just sucks that you spend so much money, take really good care of the machine, and it still gives out on you."
"We bought this dishwasher as a Christmas present for our daughter who has limited space in her apartment. We did a lot of research and read through all of the reviews. She was super-excited until we spent literally months trying to get it installed. Four trips to hardware stores. Finally called a plumber who said he could install it for $1,200!! We are returning the dishwasher, but not before they charged a $54 restocking fee. So on top of the time, trouble, and $89 plumber call, this experience has been a big loss. Save your money. Don't order online for this, talk to a local appliance company.  Ugh!"
"hose was leaking , couldnt find the replacement. May have to buy another one to replace hose then atleast i would have two dishwashers 1 working hose. if something happens to one i will have an extra for backup. maybe look into selling replacement parts. lowes or others do not sell countertop dishwashers couldnt help."
"It might be great if I could use it but I still haven’t been able to order the correct connector for my faucet so it has sat unused.  Why not include an assortment of attachments? Nope only one, if it doesn’t work, good luck finding something that fits"
Within two months the buttons stopped working and the door mechanism broke so we couldn't close it. Tried working with the company listed for the warranty. ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE. THE WARRANTY IS A LIE! I literally got bounced around from phone number to phone number for two days trying to figure out how to get this thing replaced. In the end I gave up and just returned it to Amazon. Will be purchasing a different machine.
"It was used.  Still had dishwasher detergent dried in the inside.  Manual was missing.  First use,  threw the famous E4 code.  Been trouble shooting for about an hour.  Blew out the drain with a compressor.  This thing just will not drain.  Disappointed.  ""Amazon's Choice""? Maybe.  But it's not mine."
I love the compact size however my big plates don't fit
"Dishwasher worked well for about a year, now I get E4 error which means I have to physically bail all the water out of the bottom of the machine dry it all out, reset it and start again. No drain blockage. So disappointed."
"Well, we wanted this to work, but there is no way to hook it up to any type of pulldown or pullout faucet.  And believe me, we tried.  It is also smaller than we thought - the set of dishes, with small tea cups, is about the only type of dinnerware that will fit.  And on top of all that, Amazon charged a HUGE RESTOCKING FEE.  Be aware of that.  That left a very sour taste in my mouth, and I will be more cautious when I order from Amazon in the future."
"I ran to & from three different hardware stores to try to find the right faucet hookup adapter & then it ended up not even working. Would love a refund but I can apparently only get one if I have the original box, which I don’t have anymore."
"This looked amazing.  So much space inside.  Got it hooked up and the damn touch controls just didn't work.  Ran to the store to buy that...whats it called...detergent thing to squirt in for the light to go off that asks for it, you guys know if you have it, and the light went off but still no control worked and I couldn't turn it on.  Hassle to return something like this so I bought a different kind."
"Haven't even tried it yet, hoses wouldn't connect normally to my faucet (needed an adapter) and had to hire a plumber to tell me the hoses shipped broken. I'll have to sink more money into this thing to get it working. Overall, not too thrilled at how much this cost me."
"This PoS only rinses and sometimes gets the soap in the rinse. You have to scrub everything off the dishes and glasses before putting them in or they won't get 'clean'. The soap door doesn't even open half the time and it doesn't seem to work with soap pods that have any type of powder in them, they don't dissolve, so you waste 2 hours of wash time for slightly hot rinsed dishes. There is no sort of pressure washing action even though it has a pots and pans setting, which is apparently the only one that works with the soap pods, every other setting doesn't do anything noticeable except leave some soap scum on not-clean dishes.The basket for dishes has so many large holes in it that you can't put anything like utensils or tupperware lids except in a couple of spots or they fall through and get caught in the washing arm. Also the spikes to hold dishes are so stupidly placed that you can't put a saucer type bowl in without it falling over and taking  up 1/4 of the space available. Even pint glasses are hard to place due to the spacing of the spikes. All the extra plastic flaps on the tray do absolutely nothing except get in the way.The hoses for the water lines are different lengths and come bent in a circle in the box, which would be fine if they were pliable at all but they are too stiff to position without them bending back to packing position. This leads to water not draining correctly to the sink due to low spots so when you detach the hose from the sink, it immediately wants to coil back up and gush water all over the floor. Additionally the connections on the back for the hoses come loose every time you move the hoses, so it also leaks on the floor unless you take a wrench to it everytime.This is not designed for a countertop that has any type of cabinets, so I had to buy a tall wire rack just to get it to sit where it would partially drain. The plug is only meant for outlets that have no molding or backsplash on them (90° vertical plug, not horizontal or straight-in like it would make sense for any modern home).I really wish I had returned this crap in time, but I was too busy to even use it for a couple weeks and missed the window.Also when it showed up the box was mangled all to hell, didn't see any real damage to the machine, but who knows, something might have busted internally and that's why it's not working for me. Overall this was a total waste of money."
"We love(d) this dishwasher. It worked great. Then it stopped working. E3. So should just be a temp module. Customer service is being useless (Danby directly) & in frustration I went to order a replacement since it seems like it will be more than 2 month til we get the part. Depending on our financial state when we do, I figured I would keep the 2nd unit as a backup, or sell one of them. But Amazon is suddenly not shipping to where we live. When I spoke with an endless string of Amazon customer service to find out how to get it shipped...the main thing they would all admit about it is that Amazon is Redlining...not shipping certain value items to certain areas. I bought this dishwasher via Amazon in 2020. When I first tried to order a replacement, it wouldn't ship to me, but I could get it to accept addresses in Orinda & Beverly Hills. When I re-checked...working with a friend who lives elsewhere to try to understand the shipping mayhem, it had then switched to being blocked from shipping to any California address we tried. Amazon customer service repeatedly said this was redlining, while not seeming to understand when I said ""it is illegal to redline"". So we have a broken one we cannot get a part for months...which I think may be a problem with any brand of this particular build design. Not sure what to tell anyone else on whether to order it or not, other than if you are allowed to order it & you have trouble with it at all early on, insist on return/replacement because you probably have a lemon. Wish I had."
"I have owned two counter top dishwashers now. The. First one I sent back, as when it stopped functioning it was still in the return time. It’s been three months and I cannot return this now. The drain hose has leaked since I got it. This is still running, but it doesn’t clean any of the dishes. I’ve run a load three times and it’s still not clean. Now it’s just taking up space and creating mold in my cabinets below. I completely regret this purchase, and I am now out $300 and there’s nothing that I can do about it."
"Great for small house or apt where space is limited. Only dislike is a full size plate won't fit standing straight up in the slots. Got to lean it a bit. You also have to make sure there is nothing in the way of the dispenser flap where you put your dish tabs, if it gets blocked door can't open and dispense tab."
"It's pretty obvious by the headline. The first time we used the dishwasher, we got an E4 error message, stating the device was not draining water. Went thru all of the steps in the install guide - didn't work. Called the 800 help line, after waiting for almost an hour online, was cut off. Second time I called, the call was ended because it was closing time. Email ""help"" was either return it, at almost half the cost of buying it - OR - take it to an approved service agent, over 120 miles away. What a joke. I'm currently stuck with a massive paper weight in my kitchen."
"While the box did arrive damaged the part of the box that was damaged was not where the product itself was damaged. There is a large dent on the metal finish casing on the top of the product. In my opinion this likely occured while the product was being packaged or maybe even before that as it looks as though something caught the inner lip of the metal sheeting which would only be possible if the door of the dishwasher was open. This leads me to believe the product was damaged and packed/shipped anyway. Also lifting the washer out of the packaging it appears as though some of the black flared clips that hold the bottom to the outer casing were laying in the bottom of the box snapped off. While we are pretty disappointed that the washer is visibly damaged, it appears to work fine for the first few test washes I have done. I could return it for a new one but trying to have this shipped back would be a project in itself. I will be contacting amazon to see if there are any other avenues we could go down rather than return."
This dishwasher has a leak water issue on the bottom of the maching: the bottom cover is desing to hold some water and when there is a lot of water under a sensor actives an error. It is an eassy to fix by drilling a whole and put a cup under it so you dont get this error every time. I was getting the error after each wash.
"My step mom has a dishwasher that has ran for decades. This one ran well then broke in less than two yrs. Some family members had purchased one as well, theirs broke in less than a year (same error, seems to be the heating element is not good with cool water coming in). Perhaps you will fair better if you put hot water into it.  We have a small hot water heater (use to live off grid) and need all 5 gallons for showers. Relatives in similar situation. Oh well, trying a Farberware next..."
"Excellent machine when running BUT BEWARE— cheap, plastic hoses and faucet connector.  Plastic wears out quickly. Checked Lowe’s, Home Depot, Ace Hardware, and a plumbing supply specialty store for replacement hoses and connectors. Danby’s connection setup is proprietary and NOBODY could figure out how to replace the connectors, not even the plumbing supply store with plumbers on hand with 30+ years experience. So I checked Danby online, followed online instructions to pre-emptively order replacement hoses and faucet connector and they aren’t there. Called Danby. Refused to let me place order over phone. Kept trying to give me 15+ digit part numbers for multiple parts (which I had no way to confirm they were even the ones I wanted) and was told to go back on line and type in all the long part numbers to order. No thank you. WAYYY too complicated to replace the plastic parts that will surely break within a year. As soon as I mentioned the difficulty was such that I now prefer to return the dishwasher to replace with another more easily serviced, representative said “That’s fine if you want to.” and hung up on me. She  ever called back. So I assume it was intentional. I’ve now wasted 10 hours over two days trying to find replacement parts. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE."
"The dishwasher insert:- Uses up about 30% of the vertical height, leaving no room for large plates- Has no spots for glasses/cups. I have several highball glasses, rocks glasses, wine glasses, coffee mugs, and point glasses, none of which fit well anywhere on the insert- Has no good spots for bowls. Most other dishwashers usually have grooves that can hold a bowl upright- The upper area is so small, nothing but small pyrex lids can be wedged inOverall this dishwasher (mostly because of it's metal insert) just doesn't do it's job. It's only useful for silverware, small plates, and 1 bowl per load that I can use up the remaining space by placing it upside down. Would not recommend."
This dishwasher is alot smaller than I expecting! I can't get my plates in standing up because not high enough and if they lay down then you can only get a few things in it
The dishwasher works great but it arrived with a big dent in it. I read some other reviews that mentioned it having dents. Seems like the company should be working on better and more protective packaging. I kept it anyway because it seemed like more of a hassle to return it and the new one probably would have arrived with dents anyway.
Love the dishwasher. I just contacted customer service about my silverware basket breaking (never moved) and it’s not covered after 4 weeks (I bought 5 weeks ago). I highly recommend using a credit card with insurance because my experience with Danby thus far is they are very good at not covering any fixes on these products. Better to go through insurance or Amazon.
This thing was great up until yesterday as it was going through a cycle and started beeping. I went to look at it and saw on the front display a E4 error... I also heard a sound like it was trying to drain water out of the machine but there was no water in it so it was crazy. I unplugged the machine for hours and came back to it the next day and still E4 code showing.. Not sure what the issue is but there seems to be no fix for this from what i can see and this makes me very nervous in the future if this is replaced as I'm concerned it will keep happening.
This was an expensive appliance and I expected a higher quality.  The major problem is that the latch doesn't work and the door pops open!  I am using velcro to try to keep the door shut!  Photos show the crappy latch (who would use something like that?  the designer should be fired!) and my velcro work-around to try to secure the door.
Right now I have water dripping from the front of dishwasher. I had that problem with my old dishwasher that is why I brought a new one. I have contacted the company for a solution to the problem. Other wise the machine is quiet and does a good job of cleaning.
"Ordered this and it was bigger than expected, so be ready for that. All the pipes you have to hook up are annoying to set up, barely fit my faucet. Once I did have it all set up finally and loaded (barely any dishes into it mind you because it's somehow at once too big yet smaller on the inside, like a reverse Doctor Who contraption), it worked for about 15 minutes before it came time for the water to drain out and I kept getting an E4 error, which meant the drain pump had malfunctioned. Repositioned the pipes, kept tightening the connecting ports, even checked the internal filter (and was up to my elbows in suds), but nothing. Kept getting the same error and the thing refused to drain properly. Might've been able to figure it out but by that point it was too much of a hassle for a machine that only promised to do some of the dishload. Save yourself the time and get something else."
Unfortunately I can't give an adequate review cause my dishwasher arrived damaged and at all looked like it was returned not the first time. I had to return. thanks for arrange home pick up. Otherwise I don't know how to deal with this heavy box. For this 2 stars.
"This dishwasher was super helpful when we bought it. No longer had to handwash dishes, it was easy to hook up to our sink and held a decent amount of dishes for the size. HOWEVER, I bought it one month and one year ago. For just the last few cycles the detergent no longer cycles through properly leaving a soap scum layer on the inside of the washer and on the dishes. It also leaks water from the bottom of the machine. (I did clean it properly to try to fix the issue) I reached out to Danby to inquire but since I/just/ missed my warranty I can only pay to service it. It is disappointing that the dishwasher began to fail as soon as the warranty was over."
"I really like the size and design of this, but this is the second time I've ordered one of these and it arrived with a broken door latch. I can't use the appliance if the door isn't latched. Oh and Danby support is the actual worst, and the product's warranty is laughably bad."
"After ~30 minutes of reading the instructions to make sure I install it correctly the dishwasher didn't even work. It made an insane amount of noise when I started it and I thought it is going to explode. The screen showed an E4 error which apparently corresponds to a blockage in the drain (and yes, I checked that everything is installed correctly). Waste of money and time. Returning this and going with another company"
"Received package and it was a little beat up, but opened it up and it was fine but for one small cosmetic scratch on the top edge of the door. Worked fine for a week then we got an error E4, drain malfunction. Cleaned the filter, unplugged the hoses and drained the unit of all the water then plugged it all back in and still E4. Called theor support number and they told me to send it back for a new one. So I sent the old one back and the replacement came but instead of a compact dishwasher, they sent me a compact freezer instead. That was enough for me, so I've requested a refund."
"""Hey Boss, A truck load of our little dishwashers was in a wreck, what should we do with all the dented dishwashers?""""Sell them online""It is nice and quiet. It is a little too small. one inch taller would help a full size plate fit. You must make sure the rotating spray wand on the bottom rotates without hang up, or nothing will get clean."
"Item arrived damaged on both sides and top, but still worked"
"We purchased this dishwasher in May 2020. We used it infrequently for 1 year and 8 months.  The dishwasher is no longer operational because we got an error code, fixed the issue and yet it was impossible to clear the error code from the dishwasher.  A piece of junk!"
"It is very quiet, but it is poorly planned for glassware, cups and mugs.  The smaller 4 place setting dishwasher was infinitely better in its plan for stacking the dishes in it."
"This looked to be packaged well, but upon opening there is a large dent in top of unit!"
Worked for under 3 months. Stipped dispensing rinse aid one day and a week later the soap door starting opening toward the end if the cycle. Covering the dishes in soap. I also purchased the warranty and All-State has ignored my issues.
I've had this for 3 months and haven't felt like it's done a decent job yet.  I have to re-wash about half the dishes after every load.  Washing by hand has to be much more sanitary than this... Good luck if you pull the trigger on this buy.
This device worked great until recently the lcd is flickering on and out.  I slam the door to get or to work. And then it works half the time.  Danby said your screwed.
"Well the attachments included with the unit did not attach to my faucet. It has been a huge pain finding the correct ones, and I still am struggling to do so without buying a new faucet. Anyone have an easy solution for this? Danby doesn’t offer any additional connectors for modern faucets."
Quit after 3 months.
The dish washer gets 5 stars but the shipping was terrible
"Mine worked great the first two washes. Then the drain pump stopped draining and I couldn't get the error code to clear. Sadly, I sent mine back."
Cannot be hooked up to most Faucets in the kitchen I had to send this back
Not worth it. First load of dishes came out dirty. Had to rewash by hand. Total cycle almost 2 hours and still dirty dishes?
"This product came broken and with a huge dent on the top, like it had been dropped b4 packaging, the box was perfectly fine"
Defective
Arrived completely dented. Very. Disappointed.
"Love the idea of this, but on average 60% of my dishes come out dirty. Would love some advice."
"This appliance, that I purchased, was manufactured in Oct. of 19.  It was purchased the next month.  Plugged it in & it didn't work.  Since it was under warranty, I had it repaired, & it turned out to be a wire that either fell of, or was never attached to begin with.  Works fine, is quiet & doesn't take up much space.  But hopefully, yours will work when taken out of the box."
"After testing the screen media on the bottom of the unit for Lead (which was positive), I decided to send a sample of the wash water to a lab (only water-no soap was used). With a plastic tub bottom (most of the others use stainless) and the screen media being likely lead based, fully expect the wash water to contain several highly carcinogenic materials. Shame on you, Danby, being one of the highest price points in the Countertop Dishwasher category, taking these dangerous shortcuts is not very consumer friendly :("
"First off, shipping was very quick, the boxing is incredible (with instructions on how to continue unboxing once you open it. It's all very well done. I am a smaller woman (5'2"") and 67 years old. I found it quite difficult to lift it from the floor to the counter, not because the machine is heavy (it isn't), but because it is a lot larger than I expected and it was just plain bulky.All the installation instructions are well written and easy to follow. However, they just say to attach the hoses to the outlets and tighten them. In the past, any plastic nuts I have used tell you to hand tighten, which is what I did. That was a mistake as the water leaked all over my counter, ruining much of the contents of a brand new box of Cascade powdered dishwashing detergent. Luckily, I have both a backsplash and a bullnose on my counter, so the water went no further than my counter. Out came the toolbox, and after a few small turns of the wrench, and I assume that problem has been solved. At least I hope it has.This is NOT a small machine and it is not the space-saving device I had hoped it would be. With the benefit of hindsight, I should have bought a full-sized dishwasher on wheels. I will explain why shortly.OK ... so onwards to the actual use of the DW. As soon as I began loading it for the first time, the very first item I tried to load wouldn't fit. It was a standard-sized 10.5"" dinner plate. Danby advertises that the machine fits 6 place settings. I was in the dinnerware industry for more than 20 years, and a place setting consists of 1 dinner plate, 1 salad/luncheon plate, 1 bread and butter plate, and one cup and saucer. Since it can't fit even one dinner plate, that makes their claim patently false. There is absolutely no way in the world that you could fit 6 standard place settings into this machine.So, I went to Amazon and purchased (6) 9"" salad plates that I intended to use as dinner plates. They shipped me two plates and an obviously USED third plastic/melamine plate (with knife scratches on it) and that bore no resemblance to what I had ordered. After some difficulty trying to actually talk to someone at Amazon, they finally said they would make things right but that I would have to wait a few days as the carrier hadn't yet updated the status of my shipment.Next, my standard-sized 6.5"" round soup bowls don't fit into between all those posts either! I only discovered this after I had already spoken to the lady at Amazon. I had some olives in a bowl and tried to put it in the machine. So I looked at the picture of a loaded basket in the manual and discovered that there are really only 2 spots for standard-sized soup bowls. The other 6 spots are only sufficient for the little 5.25"" bowls that are sufficient for a small snack or mini-desert. I have the tiny bowls and have only ever used them for dips. They are way too small to use as a salad bowl or soup bowl. They would probably be good for the coleslaw you get from restaurants in those small styrofoam containers ... or maybe as a peanut bowl.At this point, I was pretty annoyed, since the 2 items I use twice every single day just don't fit in my rather expensive new dishwasher.But I was determined I was going to make this work somehow and told myself that although not ideal, I would just wash the bowls by hand since the tiny bowls are basically useless for soup or salad.I hate cups and saucers and prefer to use a coffee mug. Naturally, that doesn't fit on the slanted cup racks, so I immediately removed them as they were tacking up valuable real estate inside the dishwasher. I was able to fit one in on my test run ... thank God for small mercies.I put one of my soup bowls that had contained black olives earlier in the day in one of the two soup bowl spots shown in the photo. In the other, I put my small kitchen strainer. I also managed to fit in my small AllClad 1 quart saucepan and numerous knives, forks, spoons, and a spatula. The cutlery fit just fine. Yay!I then referred to the manual to find out how much detergent and rinsing agent to use. Once I had the machine loaded, had the detergent, and everything ready to go, I connected the machine to my faucet and pressed the appropriate buttons. I was gleeful when it started to run and even more pleased when I heard how quiet it was.I  then continued reading the manual, only to discover that the machine has no drying cycle and you have to unplug it from the electrical outlet after every use. That requires that I move the machine, reach in behind the machine to find the plug, do my best to pull it out of the outlet, and then move the machine back into place. They recommend that you leave the machine for 5 to 10 minutes after it has finished its cycle to allow the dishes to drip dry before emptying it. I left it for 20 minutes and I still had to dry some of the plates. The salad/soup bowl that had contained some black olives earlier had a black stain still in the bowl, so I had to wash it by hand.I had just run the machine using the ""normal"" cycle. I always scrape off any leftover food and rinse plates before I put them in a dishwasher, but I guess I didn't notice the small bit of olive juice in the bowl. I do not consider a little black olive juice to be ""heavily soiled"", and I don't think any reasonable person would.  Oh, I had to wash my saucepan again as well, it didn't remove the slightly green waterline caused by boiling peas either.To put it mildly, I am really disappointed. This is a badly designed machine that does NOT have the capacity the company claims, the basket is very poorly designed and it didn't clean sufficiently. Being the neat freak I am, I neatly broke up all the interior styrofoam packaging, slit open the box, and folded it over once on itself in order to put it out to the street for collection with all the other cardboard. Sending it back at this point would be a nightmare as there is no way I could package it as well. If I could, I would! If it hadn't been for the fact that I couldn't put my dishes in it, I would have used it before I destroyed the box and I very likely would have sent it back.At least one of those full-sized dishwashers on wheels would take all my dinnerware and clean it all properly! Needless to say, I do not recommend this machine. I could cry at this point as I have just wasted a lot of money I simply can't afford to waste. This was a birthday gift from my family and I just don't have the heart to tell them what a disappointment it has turned out to be.  :(Unless you and your husband eat like birds and don't use full-sized (adult) dinner plates, soup bowls, and coffee mugs, I suggest you steer clear of this machine."
"Overall, it works. It's a dishwasher. I have a bit of trouble fitting my plates in there, it's a squeeky fit, but it does as advirtised. The only main issue I have is it's filter system. It's crap. You Have to rinse your dishes really damn well. Even if you have sauces that have dried. Because of the design of the hoses leaving the system, debris easily gets caught in the out flow in the hard elbow despite the metal screen it shouldn't fit past. When this happens, the whole system backs up, it shuts down and leaves all the water in the unit which you have to dump yourself to clear the code. This is a messy job! I had to do this twice within the first days of purchasing while I was getting used to it and it dumped a lot of water everywhere! It's an E4 code if you run into it. Easiest way to clear it, open the door and dump as much water as you can into the sink. Spin the rear to the sink and pull off the out line on both ends. Put the opposite end of the clog directly on your tap tightly and turn on the water to have the water backwash and clear the hose. If you go through all this and the system still won't loose the E4 code, tip the dishwasher backwards until it stops draining. It seems Wierd, in flows out of the machine itself, but I got caught up for like 30 minutes trying to figure that out."
"The machine seems solid and can likely run well if in good condition. Mine arrived dented but I decided to give it a try. It worked well for a couple of washes then kept producing an error and releasing water from its underside. On investigating, I noticed a crack on the back plastic panel. I assume may have been dropped while on transit. Would have loved to try a replacement but seemed the only option was a refund."
The pictures on the Amazon posting make it look like you could fit a lot more dishes in it and it has capacity forThis thing does not even fit full-size dinner place without having to run an angle this supposed cup rack what are you talking about like miniature tea cups you can’t put a coffee mug there the rock design is completely ridiculous and too close together so please don’t sit properly it works really well however I’m gonna have to do two loads each time just to do a 6 Person setting it is actually quite upsetting to me soon considering now I’m gonna be wasting double the water running the cycle the pictures are very misleading as to how many dishes can actually fit in this thing otherwise impressed also Amazon is telling that you can use tablets with it of course that comes up on the advertising so I bought them and everybody is saying use liquid not impressed by that either but whatever for the price it does work well I’m just a little disconcerting about false advertising I think they should knock 50 bucks off for everybody that had to deal with us just my opinion As it’s very much false advertising it will not fit full-size dinner plates without them being on an angle and taking up more room  than is necessary
"I have a pull down type kitchen faucet and the adapter to hook up the dishwasher to the tap didn’t fit. The faucet aerator is too small. So, my husband and I decided to buy a new faucet rather than return this huge $500 machine. We went to Canadian Tire and couldn’t find ONE faucet that fit! We tried at least 10 different faucets. The only one it fit was a laundry tub faucet lol.There is another reviewer here who had the same issue and suggested an adapter from Rona that we will try.Just be careful because the statement that it fits most faucets is misleading!Update: we got it to work, loaded it, and the dishes came out dirty! We wanted to test it and see how well it cleaned so we rinsed off food, but didn’t ‘pre-wash’ the dishes. Well, they were dirty. We had to run them through a second time, tbd if that will work."
- i had mine for a year when i had to give up fighting the crazy leaking all over the countertop. It was coming from inside where all the electrical components are. I had had a second hand (actually 3rd hand) Damby countertop dishwasher for many years before it stopped working and it wasn't leaking.- this one looked and felt cheaper from the get go and seemed very much a cheap white labeled product. Waste of money!
"My 1st time owning an auto dishwasher so not sure a countertop would be satisfactory ,however this unit works well ,hope it last me at least handful of years ,wish it was slightly larger inside as one of my plates rubs the rubber seal upon entry. takes a bit of practise to load up ,metal dish tray doesn't seem to be the best design.  Still trying to figure out which detergent works best. if you can get on sale ,might be ok to try otherwise probably best buy a full size model be it portable of built-in 3.5/5 stars for me!"
"1 - Hose fittings on faucet adapter, fresh out of the sealed package were CROSS THREADED onto the adapter, I had to remove them, put in new washers and re connect the se together.2 - 2 tines on the dish rack were broken off, I found them lying in the filter cup on pre use inspection3 - Cutlery basket came with one side of the handle broken off.4 - there was about a liter of water in the unit I had to dump out when it was first unboxed. ( pervious use?? Testing in assembly? )Danby was very un co-operative when called, which is surprising as that I have had and still do have other Danby appliances.Caveat Emptor."
"Sleek looking dishwasher that is compact enough to fit in my 1940s kitchen counter but I must say that I am not fully pleased with how this thing operates. 1 out of 5 times the 1.5 hr cycle will complete only to reveal crusty, dirty dishes and an unbusted pod laying on the bottom or in the pod compartment that didn't unlatch properly or something (I use regular cloarax pods in this thing). It's a mystery how this machine sometimes straight up dose NOT wash anything. Also rusts my knives. The size however is good for two people, our dinner dishes always fit"
"This product works well, but you better put a permanent berm under it because it will leak regardless of how tightly you screw in the supply and return lines into the back. I even put thread sealant tape on the male threads and it still leaks from somewhere. Would not purchase again."
"I like the looks of it, obviously its small just a little to short to fit even my smallest regular plate. Pretty easy set up."
"This little dishwasher was exactly what we needed. It worked flawlessly for a bit over a year, before it kept getting constant ‘E4’ errors and drain itself on the counter it sits on. I scoured forums and reviews for solutions, tried every maintenance suggestion and operational adjustment I could find (lower the water pressure, clean it out more, etc.) but still it would fail and flood the kitchen if not babysat. I’ve given up with it. I’ve had it just under a year and a half now, and I would not recommend this machine to anyone."
Seams to work okay but can no longer use for intended purpose as it was shipped all beat up. The stainless steel skin is very fragile. And wouldnt look good in my original purpose. In regards to cleaning dishes seems okay.
Let me started by saying it took over 1 month to get this item ( WITH PRIME 2 TO 3 DAY DELIVERY) Then our first one came broken either by the mail lady or from storage not sure. After reported this we wore told it be a few days for replacement to arrive which it took another 2 weeks almost .... So finally I got my dishwasher with a little scratch on screen but hey I said to my husband I don't care I'm tired of waiting.... So I set it up and start my first load already disappointed as you can barely fit anything on this small appliance but hey I started dishes .... well let me tell you how much I hate this piece of crab .... it's my 4th time trying to get the same dishes clean even tho I rinse them before with hot water this dishes still dirty ..... OMG DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DANBY DISHWASHER YOU WILL REGRETTED!!! It's the worse so far calling right now because I want my money back not worth the hassle at ALL
"I bought this unit last week. I was very excited and it works well. The description is as it says and the install is super easy. I would wish that the hose that comes with it wasn't plastic, so that lot a bit of points with me.The real reason why this gets 3 stars and not 4, is the way it was sent. I saw some reviews saying that there was some sort of dent on the unit and that's how mine came. This doesn't affect the ability to wash dishes, but where this is more expensive as the lower model, I expected more. If you are not concerned with looks, I would advise to save some money and get DDW621WDB."
I like the compact size... I wish they designed the inside rack like a standard full size... As plates are awkward4to try and put in... I use to own a standard regular dishwasher so not quite sure about why the rack design could not have been the same on a smaller scale. But does clean my glasses but for lightly soiled dishes only.. Pre rinse is necessary before I put them in the washer
"The installation was an absolute headache, & I still cannot install the thing!I purchased this expecting to easily hook it up to my sink out of the box. Yet that was definitely not the case. The in-box adapter does not fit with my faucet, that is pretty standard in my area & finding an adapter for it has been a horrible experience.Even contacting the manufacturer, they literally told me that they cannot help anyone with a sink thats not a ""standard North American faucet"". I am running out of options here & have had a paperweight on my counter for weeks with absolutely no way to use it. Extremely dissapointed in this product & its manufacturer."
"My dinner plates are literally about a 1/2"" too tall for the washer, and there's a good 2 inches between the top of it and my upper cabinets. The side ""cup"" rack also only allows space for a cup that's about 2 inches tall. Which none of mine are. Other than that is cleans very well."
"The product arrived on time. When we opened the box, the inside of the box was wet, instruction manual was soaked and the dishwasher was dented on the outside and dirty on the inside. It was evidently a return. Additionally the adapter that was suggested did not fit the kitchen faucet. Do not want to return due to hassle."
This unit was clearly a used / returned unit and not a brand new unit. Not impressed.
Smaller than something I expected
"BE CAREFUL when looking in to it, make sure that you have the right measurement that can plug to your faucet!I have an old faucet (i'm renting so i can't change it) and we have tried 5 different adapters and none of them fits... it's just there on my kitchen table collection dust because i can't use it :/"
"Was shipped full of water and all the contents inside were soaked, other than that I have found the dishwasher works fairly well. It has gotten worse with time but dishes come out fairly clean."
"Door no longer closes, Danby consumer service has been useless, going on 2 weeks waiting for a solution. Now have a very large and ober priced paperweight."
"Not worth the money.After a few months, it just isn't cleaning dishes good enough. To often I have to re-wash by hand. We kind of stopped using it, and it was just taking up space. We've decided to get rid of it."
"Not cleaning well, iam disappointed."
"I've owned several Danby products in my lifetime, and the rest worked for years but not this one! First load of dishes and alarms were going off, screen was flashing ""E4"", and the unit was humming. after unplugging the unit, I opened it to check filters and hoses, all of which were fine. The machine continued to throw the error, regardless of what I did, so it got returned. I wound up doing my dishes by hand in the sink. These products should be tested at factory before they consume resources to get to my doorstep. Think about that, Danby."
I ordered on a Saturday I got it Monday. it took 3 days to fit it to fit the faucet I had to change me whole faucet. I got to use it Friday and there was no power after I plugged it in. I tried 5 different plugs even plugged in a alarm clock to see there was power. still no power in dishwasher. i tried for 2 days i called amazon for an exchange on this item they said no exchange only refund. I want happy after all that hassle in the whole week.
Badly damaged when received
"My hose connector broke about 2 months ago, I've contacted their warranty support and I STILL DIDN'T RECEIVE IT, after many e-mails exchanged.The machine itself is good, but my customer support experience would make me choose another brand if I were buying this machine again."
"Basically it does the opposite of what one needs it to do. My dishes are still dirty and some of them come out with soap still on them. More than half of the times, the machine malfunctions. The second time I used it, it nearly flooded my kitchen. I'm trying to be patient because I realize it's not a normal dishwasher but this is just ridiculous. Not worth the money."
"I don't know who's dishes are supposed to fit into this thing, but mine certainly do not"
"The only thing I can say about it is this dishwasher is very lazy. I can only wash one small load for every 24 hours, if I try to use it twice a day it just won’t drain the water for the second wash. I used two months after the purchase, so can’t really return it. Try to find support, still haven’t hear anything back from them. Not worth the money and trouble."
"Damaged at arrival and also after doing a firts wash, we discovered that he was leaking from underneath, not even the pipes"
"Bought in October 2022, stoped working in 10 months. Do not recommend"
I just bought this dishwasher and the only thing working is the power button. Everyone is hooked up properly but no water is flowing in nor am I able to even switch any programs. Very disappointed didn’t even get to try it.
Realized after about 2 weeks of owning it. The front door was not assembled properly at factory and is slightly bent
order it... and my post office had to return it because the box was damage...  ordered it somewhere else works fine love it would get it
I am still shocked! The second I opened the box I noticed that the side part was dented. Then I opened the door and saw everything inside was wet! and the water dispenser and the base of the machine was defective and broken. Very disappointed and definitely will return it.
This is my second countertop dishwasher from Danby. Often broken and need frequent repairs. Please avoid Danby products!
Too large for available cupboard space.
"Have not be able to use it yet, because I cannot find an adapter to connect to my kitchen faucet.  Still searching for one."
comes water inside like open box not new .when i try it error code F4  doesn t workmaybe the pump doesn t work
it had two dents on the top and it was wet insideit was not new
"Easy to install, but after every load there is a white powder like substance on the dishes. I’ve tried less / more detergent and rinse aid but nothing helps."
The front door was dented but the shipping box wasn’t.  Bad quality and returned the item.
"It arrived with the box having a slight dent in one side but I couldn't notice it before the delivery person took off. I set it up and discovered the front panel was bent inwards but seemed to not be completely inoperable. The silverware basket was broken, as for many others. Oddly, the internal packaging of the hose bag was already open, as was the manual package. I suspect I got someone else's return, despite this being labeled as NEW.Deciding to give it a try since there seemed to be only cosmetic damage, I went through clearing the counter and rearranging my kitchen to set it up. A cup of water and 1/4 cup of vinegar as an initial clean was a success. I then put in only a few dishes and the recommended amount of powdered soap and set it on a normal cycle to see if it actually cleans. Worked. UNFORTUNATELY, when I then loaded in a normal load and tried to wash it, it gives me many beeps after a few seconds and the glass cycle lights up. The manual says it means there is a leak or the door isn't closed. Checked and no leaks and door is closed tight. Left it overnight to rest but still no luck. I'm on hold with customer support as I type this.Edit: I called customer support Nov 7th and replied to their email that day. TWELVE DAYS LATER I still had no response, so I called them today. Told me to return it via Amazon and if I have problems with the replacement, then to call back. Wasted 12 days of my time to tell me to just return it. I will update again once the new unit arrives. Hopefully I don't get another broken one.Good: fits on the counter, surprisingly quiet, very easy to set upBad: Stopped working on first regular load, came with internal parts opened and silverware basket broken."
"(2 years later update in notes, all is fine with minor annoyance that they need to reprogram what happens if you accidently turn off your water. sometime you need a splash of water and habit makes you turn off the water. problem is there is NO alert when it needs  the water. it just shuts off and drains the unit and THEN starts beeping!! NOOOO! happens every other week. it SHOULD beep as it it detects no water so you can run over and turn it on. Usually happens after your soap has just opened and mixed with watrer wasting power, water and soap. FIX IT!) Decent machine but a few issues. First I want to quickly note the insides of this machine are identical to other brands that looks similar. Save yourself the money and go with this one with the ugly user interface. It works fine as promised for half the price.  —- This machine actually works pretty good but there have been two issues. First issue is it arrived with a broken wheel on the top out. and it’s been three months and I’m still waiting for a replacement (update: I finally got it 7 moths later). I’ve been too lazy to 3-D print one but it makes getting in in and out very awkward and unstable. The second problem is actually really stupid. It needs to be redesigned. The soap tray lid is blocked by the silverware holder. So the door does not open unless you pull it away when you’re loading dishes. I have learned to adjust the tray differently so this doesn’t happen but when I first got it it was really annoying to go through a whole hour and a half Of dishwashing just realize your soap was still in the tray because the lid was blocked by a fork (update: after relocating the tray this has not been an issue). That’s the downside of such a compact unit. But they could’ve integrated a better soap dispenser Also the loading tray is really annoying as well because it has way too many fingers to hold things everything is really squeeze together. And it has huge gap’s instead of a nice mesh on the bottom so you can’t put cups anywhere except work upscale because they’ll fall through and block the spray arm. They should be redesigned as well"
"Having this machine still beats doing dishes by hand but it could have been so much better.Years ago I had a Danby portable dishwasher and it was amazing. Crusty casserole pans came out squeaky clean. This counter-top unit is good but not stellar. Only the pots & pans setting seems to get dishes clean - the “milder” settings haven’t accomplished much. Regardless of the setting it doesn’t sound like the machine is spraying with much water pressure. I’m assuming the lonnng cycle time is an attempt to compensate for the lack of muscle.Definitely believe the reviews regarding the unfortunate rack arrangement. It’s horrible. I’m trying to come up with some sort of hack to improve space utilization and avoid items from falling through.  And those goofy upper rack things? Yanked them out immediately. Worthless.Also as others have mentioned, the instructions are sparse at best.This review is critical but only because my previous Danby was a powerhouse. I’m a Danby fan because of that unit. Was hoping their counter-top unit was a just a smaller version of their bigger dishwashers. That does not appear to be the case. Others have mentioned in reviews that this machine is not actually manufactured by Danby and is mostly a reskin of a generic unit which is sold by several companies. Based upon my experience with this dishwasher I’m inclined to agree. If this machine were a real Danby I have no doubt it would be incredible."
"(update below first paragraph)I don't typically write reviews for products I buy, but this has been a pretty gnarly experience. We bought this dishwasher July 25, 2018 and when we started it there was a horrible grinding sound. Luckily, my husband is a handyman and decided to pop open the bottom. We didn't buy extra warranty so we thought, what the heck? Let's open it up. The pump came detached during shipping or either wasn't attached during production. We tightened it and washed our dishes fine for the next couple days. On August 2 we noticed a blinking light, let the machine dry out and opened the bottom again. Fortunately, the float switch (which turns the machine off if there's a leak) works because the aforementioned pump was leaking due to a broken locking tab (which keeps the pump secured). Since we are beyond the point of calling Danby for help anyway we are trying a few things so we can continue to use it. So far, super glue has not worked ;)- - - - - v v - - - - - UPDATE - - - - - v v - - - - -So, your Danby DDW621WDB Countertop Dishwasher is made up of many different materials, but the pump on your Danby is most likely made of a type of plastic called HIPS. HIPS stands for High Intensity Polystyrene and this type of plastic is primarily used for fabricating PROTOTYPES and is typically meant for things needing less strength than a vibrating dishwasher pump. This type of plastic also does not adhere to super glue or any other glues. So, if your pump breaks and you want to fix it rather than deal with calling, returning, or if you didn't buy extra warranty, there isn't much you can do. My husband and I considered doing a plastic weld with a similar plastic (milk jugs are made of a plastic called polyethylene that are really similar molecularly). The only reason we didn't go this route was because we didn't want to melt any other plastic bits around the pump. Our brainstorming session brought us to our current solution - zip ties! I've included a photo showing how we've placed the zip ties, 4 in total. We aren't sure how long this will hold, but I've washed 2 loads of dishes so far with this zip tie sling. Hopefully, your dishwasher works perfectly! Ours came with some obstacles and we didn't want to scrap it, so we got crafty. Hope this helps someone else learn a little more about their washer."
When delivered had a foul odor and everything was damp inside.Its a gamble when and if this machine will startas well
"If there was a way to give this product negative stars, I would do it.  Warning to all Amazon shoppers - Do not buy this product.  Not only did this little machine break down after less than 3 weeks, but Danby's customer service is the worst I have ever had the misfortune to deal with.  When I first hooked it up, I loved this little dishwasher.  I was so happy to finally get something that would fit my tiny kitchen and it worked really well.  Then one day, it started beeping and flashing lights.  I opened it and noticed the detergent cup did not open.  I thought this to be no big deal and restarted the machine.  It was okay for another couple of days and then the same problem.  This time the problem did not go away.  by this time, we had just past the point of returning it to Amazon so we contacted Danby.  What followed has been nothing but a run around from them.  We were told to take it to an authorized repair shop who had the product for over two weeks and not able to fix it or even diagnose it.  We asked Danby to intercede and help but to no avail.  When I called, I was told to email.  When I emailed, I got not reply so I had to follow up with a call. At this point, I have given Danby by email everything they have asked for but I still do not have a working dishwasher or a refund.  I am ready to eat the loss of the money I have spent and put it in the trash but I just don't think that is fair.  All I want is a dishwasher that actually works and keeps working for more than a few weeks!"
"Bought last week, finally put together this week and maybe I put little more dishwasher detergent and made a lot of foam so I manually cleaned and let dry, everytime I plug it in now starts working on it's own even with door open flashing light is on glass icon aka program but doesn't do jack, even instructions on how to change programs doesn't work not even powering it off starts on its own as soon as I turn it off. Crap I won't even bother return."
"Update:  dead at 16 months; I liked it while it lasted...hard to have servicerdI am in love with this dishwasher; it has saved me from the drudgery of hand washing dishes (along with chapped cracked hands). I cannot say enough good things about this dishwasher; it fits nicely on my counter top and underneath the cabinets, ample capacity – read the outside dimensions people! This thing is not a TARDIS there is no way it's going to be bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. The capacity it as basically the top rack of a smaller dishwasher. It took me a little while to get use to loading, but now I have the hang of it.I researched a lot before making my purchase;1 year warranty (much better than some countertop dishwashers I looked at)  along with the extended warranty provided by my credit card and an additional 2 months added to the warranty provided by Danby, just take the short questionnaire on the Danby website – 22 month warranty, WOW!Quality companyGood repair history versus some of the popular Asian brands"
"The one drawback to this product that unique to me was that the intake and drain water hoses were not long enough.  I needed the extra length due to the layout of my tiny apartment kitchen.  I tried contacting Danby customer service and even though the answering agent was nice to me the manager I spoke to was belidgerant.  They do NOT sell extension hoses for the singular reason of, “it wouldn’t work properly.”  That answer is a bunch of crap and they know it. I tried looking for similar hoses at the hardware store near me but low and behold the fittings for the hoses that come with the product are custom made so that you can’t add an additional hose to the machine.  I had to go to a specialty store several towns over to find anything that would fit and had to make 2 separate extension hoses from scratch.  Other than this blatant atempt to thwart any additions to their machinery the product works well. I just hate washing dishes by hand."
"Cleans well but you can do better.1) It's so loud I use it as an alarm clock from the other side of my house.2) You'll need to replace your dishware set with unusually small plates that are 10"" or less."
It's just so sad that the dishwasher washed the dishes but was not able to drain... Love its look and it did a great job cleaning stuff but there is standing water coz the pump is not working. I'm returning this anyway...
"I loved it when it worked. I've had this unit going on three years. Yes, I know that sounds like a long time but I've barely used it and since I finally decided to start really using it daily/every other day these past couple weeks it stopped working.  Prior to that I only used it a handful of times. The pump burned out and I'm not about to shell out a bunch of money to repair it. Nor am I going to buy another one from these guys. It is simply a piece of trash. Get another unit. I thought I did my due diligence with it, but I was wrong. Spend a couple extra bucks and get something else. This one will not last for every day use. I can attest to that."
Update: We pretty much stopped using this mini counter washer. Not because it doesn't work well. It works great and has good settings and easy operation. The problem is that it doesn't fit many dishes at all. Mostly good for silverware since it can fit a lot of those small items. Takes a minimum of 2 hours to wash. You could wash the amount of dishes that it holds in about 1/4th that time and use FAR less water/power. It's a great product. Just doesn't make much sense to use though when you think about it. Now we're stuck with a huge $250 brick on our counter. Hopefully we can sell it at least.
"**Update** After one year it died. Previous model still going strong. Not worth dealing with trying to have it repaired. Please see other reviews expressing exact same concerns as me.I am a repeat customer. I also own the Danby DDW611WLED Countertop Dishwasher. I could not be happier with that dishwasher. However, this dishwasher is terrible. I own both at the same time. Because the new rack is so poorly arranged, I can not fit even half the number of dishes in this new one that I can in the old one. They also removed the timer. Now I have no idea how much time is left in the cycle.Some people have said, ""Buy a whole new dish set that fits."" Should not have to do that when previous model held my dishes just fine.Some people have said, ""But the manufacturer says this one holds more."" Maybe with whatever set of dishes they were using to get the maximum numbers they could for marketing, but in the real world, things are different. Wouldn't it be great if everything manufacturers claimed was true.I love my old dishwasher. It does everything I want. However I could not be more disappointed in this newer model. Please stay away from this one. Buy the older model while you still can."
"UPDATE: this broke a month or two later. The company sent us a replacement unit that also failed a few months after that. Do not recommend buying this.We love this dishwasher. It is our first portable dishwasher, and we've used it heavily for the 4 months we've owned it. It cleans like a champ. We can even stack plates pretty close together and it cleans them well. We will often end up running it one or two times a day to get through all the dishes we use. It saves us a ton of time and work at home.It is...as you might notice...small. It's a bit like playing Tetris to see how many dishes you can fit in there (as is the case with all dishwashers). Bigger items like pots and pans we still do by hand. Also, our big dinner plates will not fit in this machine straight up and down. For the most part, we just use the smaller plates we have.We usually just run it on the ""normal"" mode, which takes about 75-90min I think. It feels a bit long. There are faster modes to be used, but we haven't experimented with those, for fear that they won't clean as well. We use little detergent pods from Costco, and Jet Dry rinse agent, and it does a good job.Overall, we have no buyers remorse for getting this. It's been a great buy."
"I bought this thinking that all kitchen cupboards were pretty much standard.  Silly me.  My home was built in the 40s and my upper cupboards are exactly 17 inches from the counter top, making this too tall to fit underneath.  I purchased a ""scratch & dent"" one, so I'm not sure if it's returnable.  We're going to try to finagle another place to put it before requesting a return."
We got this to replace a similar countertop dishwasher (different brand) that the electronics had failed.  The unit had several areas where it was dented in transit.  As it seems to be cosmetic damage only and getting it unpacked and up 2 flights of stairs was a project enough that we decided to accept them and not go through the process of a return since the likelihood of replacement coming with the same issues seemed high.
"I bought this in February was doing so well i had times that it would stop and not work but was able to reset it then just 2 weeks ago it didn't  want to work i tried to reset it over 10 times.I message Amazon and they refund my money had it for 4 months,it did get my dishes cleaned,i miss it just wish is was not defective."
First one leaked all over first time used. Took it apart to find busted plastic pieces. Box or unit showed NO damage. Had to come from factory like this. Sent back.Second one worked fine. Found hard to load to get arranged. In the end…for me it’s a worthless piece of crap.
"In the time that it was working, the dishwasher was great! It was a powerful little dishwasher and cleaned my dishes well. After about three washes,  the machine began stopping mid cycle and beep. Each time the detergent dispenser remained closed. I checked the hose, looked for kinking, and made sure the water source was on. I even removed the hose to look for obstructions. I tried to run the dishwasher empty for further assessment and the machine continued to beep mid cycle and flash for hours with the detergent door closed.It was an annoying experience. I returned it without hassles which was nice. But now I'm on the search for a reliable dishwasher."
For as large as it is I would think you could fit more dishes inside. Make sure you invest in good dish soap and some finish otherwise the dishes come out wet. I wish there was a heat dry setting for sterilizing. The spinning sprayer inside is very weak. So far no leaks or draining issues.
"So I installed it, ran it with a light load to make sure it will work. Disappointingly is started beeping and gave me an error code meaning a drain leak of some kind. I assumed it was a loose drain hose. So after tightnening it I continued to get the error until i titled it and dumped the water out. Then it would run until it would give me the same error code Flashing Glass shine mode. It did it twice more until I took the drain hose off the quick connect. I laid the drain hose in the sink and turned the dish washer sideways so i can see the back. I come back mid cycle and see there is a little bit of water puddling under the machine 1 little squirt at a time. So.. idk what's going on but I assume something is broken and it's leaking. I don't want to take it apart and void the warranty. looks like I'm returning it."
"Ive had it for 3 weeks and use it daily.  Was great until today.  I turned it on and now it wont change settings , nor will it run a full cycle.  Leaked water from the inside all over the floor."
"I purchased this while it was on sale for $230. When I opened it up the utensil basket was broken. When I started it up it had a leak. I contacted customer service and they advised me to exchange it. Since it's no longer on sale and isn't currently available from Amazon I would have to return it and purchase another one at the current price which is around $330. I'm not spending an extra $100 on a dishwasher when the first one didn't work.I also found it to be a little cramped. My plates are 10 3/4"" and they don't fit at all. I could fit smaller plates with no problem and a few glasses. If you really hate doing dishes and have small enough plates it might be worth purchasing.I will say that when it did operate it was quite."
"The dishwasher was wet with water stains all over the walls upon arrival. The quality of the wash is average as expected, it couldn't clean off dirty dishes well and leaves stains here and there. It did wash off oil quite well."
"Measure the height of the space under the upper cabinets.  Even though it says it fits under most standard cabinets, it didn’t fit under mine.  Fortunately, I can get a cart to put it on, but it was disappointing."
"I wish I had read this review before I purchased this dishwasher. I had Danby’s Previous model and it worked perfectly for 14 years. After it finally died, I decided to purchase the same brand. This one is nothing like the original, and certainly is not an improved model. It is slow and does clean particularly well. The door does not lie flat, so the rack stays on a slant. It makes it almost impossibly to load or unload it easily as the rack keeps rolling back into the machine. Dishes do not fit well, even though they are the same dishes that I washed in the other model. It also leaks- not a flood, but enough to have to keep a towel next to the machine to wipe up the water. I contacted Danny through their website and they didn’t even bother to respond"
this dishwasher is built very poorly this is flimsy and very temperamental if a code comes up you have to let it sit for 24 hrs before it will reset now it has stopped working completely I wish I had never bought this thing it really is a P.O.S.!!! I sent this back 3 times it's my third one so trust me when I say it's not worth buying!!
The dishwasher arrived a day earlier than expected. Fast shipping. Box was sealed and white strapped like new. I opened the box and the plastic cover was wet! Then I pulled out the dishwasher and the back panel was wet. The inside was wet but had all the foam protection pieces like it was new. Then I looked at the faucet connector and someone bent the lip of the threaded attachment and I couldn't even attach the hose! Sending back obviously for and exchange. This kind of business of sending or attempting to send a refurb unit and sell it as brand-new is a shady way to do business! (SEE PICTURES)
Slightly louder than expected when running.No leaks with first used.  This is good.Will report back on cleaning quality after I clean the machine.
"Total piece of junk!I should have listened to the negative reviews here. I noticed droplets of water inside when I first opened it. I figured it was new, they must have quality tested it. But I’m a dumb donkey.Nope. I believe This was someone else’s returned unit. I’d be willing to bet after I return it, they’re just going to throw some new instructions inside and re sell this to someone else.This thing stopped working halfway through THE FIRST WASH CYCLE.DO NOT BUY!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!"
We purchased this unit the first time from Best Buy and it was DOA. When plugged in it didn't seem to receive power since no lights came on at all.  We returned it and re-evaluated what unit we were going to buy. We decided to try again with this unit and purchased it from Amazon.  It worked great for a month and now it seems that the heating element has gone out. We tried running it with the hot water from the tap but the dishes still don't come out clean even after thoroughly rinsing before putting them in.
"not sure why but some days it will run great, no issue. other days it freaks out and leaks a tiny bit of water mid cycle, and shuts off. some times it doesnt drain the water in the machine."
Dishwasher is having the same issue as many others:#1 Came with water in it.#2 Worked fine around 5-10 times.#3. 45 days after return window closed it died.Amazon said contact Danby. Danby said I gotta mail it back at my expense. Shipping is basically the cost of the washer and it'll come back probably the same way I sent it out and if that happens it's on me again to ship it again.Save your money; go to a brick and mortar store with an actual return policy and warranty.
"I was so excited to see receive the dishwasher but was very shocked when I discovered water droplets on the inside. Amazon provided a replacement for us. After waiting for a week, we received the new dishwasher. However, there was water inside this one too!"
It's OK bot what I'm use to but good for a single person
"I do not like this dishwasher at all. I have to rinse my dishes 5 times just to get all the soap off of my dishes and I put very little in, plus it does not release the rinse aid  after the wash cycle. I do not like this and would love to return this product for a refund please. I have hardly used it because of the problems I have with it.Sincerely,Joan Bakerjcbaker56@gmail.com"
"Mine did not work. I got the blinking glass error over and over. It would stop 10 min i to a load no matter what.. Tried all the remedies I read online. Wasted a night messing with it. Packed it allllll back up, it was a huge pain.  I bought the h0me dishwasher, which was recommended by a friend. So far so good.. Good luck in your hunt, you will need it. Godspeed."
"I purchased an adapter for my faucet but to no avail. A plumber was even baffled as to how to hook it up. When I inquired about faucet systems that would be adaptable to the dishwasher, the support system could rattle off that it was supposed to be adaptable to most faucets. I AM INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED!!!! I need packaging along with a refund to return this useless product."
Don't buy this machine!!! we bought this product and had a problem with the machine and draining and cant get it replaced cant hear from the seller and amazon isnt taking responsibility or helping resolve the issue now we have a broken washer and out of money and to my surprise if you look up the seller info online to our surprise google and the internet show many others having issues with the seller and not being able to contact them. Very disappointed and dissatisfied
"Stopped working after two months. I rinse my dishes, but I'm suspecting is clogged anyway. The filter allows things through. I'll try unclogging it, hoping that's all it is.It doesn't fit dinner plates easily. The prongs limit where you can put things. Some openings in the rack are too large and limit what you can put in different places.When it worked, it cleaned well."
I purchased this specific one because my friend has success with it for a while but I ordered it and it would never drain unfortunately but cleaned so well!!
"Fine for casual use/removal of crumbs, but does not get stuck on foods or heavy duty washing done, at all. Rack is also a little difficult to load at times."
It seems the controls stopped functioning. Not just the switches all buttons but the power button fail to function. I opened it up and looked for lose connections and found none. Couldn't find a way to fix it reliably for less than it cost to buy a new one. So I bought a new one with a protection plan. Not many other alternatives.
"When the box was opened, the top of the dishwasher was damaged.  Since the box was not caved in, I assumed the damage occurred prior to being crated for shipment.  While waiting trying to trace my return, I realized I wash more plastic carryout items than dishes, and decided not to reorder."
the washer does not complete the cycle. It stops and begins to beep for eternity. Manual has little to no relevant information on this. Small sentence that states there may be an internal leak and that I should call service. Really disappointing after the second wash to have issues. If I keep adding water manually it will pump it out and eventually reset so I can start a new cycle. This happens every time though.
If I could give it 0 stars I would. Has yet to get all the dishes clean. Half the time the soap dispenser still has soap in it at the end of the cycle. We have tried varying the amount of soap and have used wash aid. All to no avail. Do not buy. I should have returned it when I had the chance.
"This item was a waste of my time, my money, and a 3 loads of laundry for all the towels I had to use cleaning up the messes it made.  I got one and it leaked.  Filed a complaint and got a second one which ALSO LEAKED.  This item is garbage.  But another model.  Don’t waste your time or effort or money on this one."
"I might as well wash my dishes by hand… this is the worst dishwasher in history and doesn’t clean whatsoever. It leaves streaks, food stains, and doesn’t dispense the soap more than half the time. The machine is also very noisy and very inefficient. Wish I could say otherwise, very disappointed in the product."
"Bought this dishwasher, and it failed within the 1-year warranty, Danby sent a replacement. The new dishwasher has now failed and won't do anything, just over the new 1-year warranty. So I have had 2 dishwashers in 2 years and 2 months. Don't waste your money with this unit."
Works well if you have your water at 125 deg. and use liquid dishwasher detergent.
It never ran. Just flashed blue light and filled with water. Cannot get service or help from DANBY. This is a total piece of junk and a waste of money. Do not buy. No one can service this piece of junk.
"This worked great for 3 years, then stopped draining. FRUSTRATING!!!"
I like it just it just came wet and someStuff inside was broken. I wish it came in better shape
"Seller advertises lowest price to get his name at top; then at very end is a $30+ ""tax"". Sales tax in Louisianna is nowhere near 10%. Now at 8 months old, the machine stopped working."
All my fittings I put on were tight. It started to run and dumped water straight out the bottom of unit. DO NOT BUY THIS. I now have to have floor work done from water pouring out of bottom.
"Only used 6 times and in that sixth time it leaked from the bottom somewhere. The connections were all dry, the faucet area all dry, but full water all over underneath the unit, down my cabinet and all over the floor all while I'm trying to get ready for our Christmas. Very disappointed."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            As soon as I turned it on it started pouring water out the front, my whole kitchen flooded! It is bigger than it looks on the outside, but still not a lot of space inside."
almost two years using this and it is gone. started by not getting the dishes clean. even after keeping all the filters and screens clean. Janet just stopped pumping water to the dishes. End of story it's a good deal for a short time. This is my second model will not buy a third
You're the worst machine you could ever buy I got stuck with it because I threw out the box ordered new parts it works for now
"Bought it, connected tight by instruction but immediately started to leak from front door. It cleans good but had to return it because of a leak."
"faucet adapter included doesn't fit our faucet, emailed the manufacture a few times so far over 2 weeks no reply... what is the point if I can't connect it? going to return it"
I had it one year and 6 weeks.  6 weeks long enough that the drain pump failed. Of course it fails on Thanksgiving day. Buyer beware.
Ordered a unit and it leaked everywhere the first time I used it. Ordered a replacement and it leaked the third time I used it. This item was nothing but a hassle. DO NOT BUY.
Thing doesn't work properly unless you tip the front of it upwards like an air conditioner. Also leaks out of it's frame. Junk.
Doesn’t clean well at all.
it will somewhat power up but it will not do anything.
Leaked at the first time. The glass cycle lights were up and there's leakage at the bottom. Foams everywhere.
the darn thing started leaking on the first use. hopefully amazon will let me return it
"Item came with several small dents, scrapes, and paint chipped off, and what looked like water scale residue inside as well as water in the intake valve area which indicates to me that the product wasn't new. Product was returned."
after a month it stopped draining waterit doesn’t display a timerit’s loud
"I don’t even know how well this works, but it gets one star for arriving with huge freaking dents all over it. What the heck."
First one leak for first run. Second one leak for the first run. same spot.
"Awful, don't waste your time please"
Mine leaked from the bottom and from the connecting hose. Just get something else
Never buy ahead of time just installed to use lasted a week won’t flush water.
came broken and won’t work. don’t waste your money.
The rinse cycle wouldn’t run no matter what I tried. The dishes stayed dirty unless rinsed and scrubbed prior to putting into the dishwasher.
Broke after about 4 washed and their customer support is impossible to reach
Doesn’t clean my dishes at all.
i returned it before I opened it. It is too big for the space on my counter.
Agitator arm stopped working after 2 years use.
"First it came used and wet inside. Second, sink adapter was missing pieces."
Product arrived damaged
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong but th dishes aren’t getting washed
This dishwasher does not wash well or rinse clean. Don't waste your money.
"Item arrived damaged and did not work. Package appeared ok, but product was clearly mishandled at some point."
"It was a nice dishwasher when it works, but it died after one year."
Product arrived with 2 dents and a scuff.  I am not happy.
I had it for 8 months and it died! Not buying this again.
"Unfortunately, from my research on countertop dishwashers, this is the best of the bunch. It appears as though all countertops are manufactured by the same manufacturer, and then just appointed with slightly different electronics and faces to suit each re-branding OEM's needs. They're all almost exactly the same size, there's only about 2 or 3 variations on the racks, and they all appear to have the same door/port placement. We had a Danby Designer before this and it recently gave up the ghost after 12 years of faithful service. I now wish we would have repaired that one, because none of the current models are anywhere near as good as that thing was.The Pros: * This is the only model with a heater built in. *However,* it doesn't really get that hot at 165F. Our last model had to settings for heat-- normal and hot-- and the hot setting would essentially steam everything away and scortch your hand if you touched glasses coming directly out after a cycle. * Quiet. I was honestly surprised by how quiet this thing is, and it's been probably the best feature improvement over older models. * Able to accommodate the tallest plates from all the other versions offered. * Has various settings (but, really, you're only going to use one or two).Cons: * Still not tall enough. Our last Danby Designer could easily hold our 11"" dinner plates with room to spare. Now, if we want the dinner plates to be washed, we either have to put them in at 45 degree angles, leaving everything else out, or we wash them by hand. This was a big bummer. * The tray layout is freaking stupid. Like, really, really stupid. I read the directions. I followed the directions, but the layout itself is just dumb, and there's gigantic gaps in the grating where an errant small bowl or cup can fall through and get the washer arm stuck for the entire load. The last model had TONS of options for loading, and the tray grating had no holes for things to fall through. This layout severely limits your options, and you're best to just stick with the recommended layout and do two loads. * While it gets hot, it doesn't get hot enough. If you start a load before going to bed, when you wake up and open the door, everything is still wet and you either have to hand-dry everything, or let it air out for a couple hours. Yes, I'm aware that Jet-Dry and similar products can help this, but I want to use as little chemicals in my foodware as possible, and, frankly, that shouldn't be needed. With our last Danby, you started the load in the night, and when you woke up in the morning and opened the door, everything was just dry. It had a great steam cycle that assured this. * I really would like a timer. This is a feature on some other models (like the SNP), and I didn't know that I would want it. (Again, our last Danby had a mechanical timer you could follow). While this isn't a deal breaker, I can't see this being all that expensive of a part, and I'm kind of sour that Danby didn't include it.Will we return this? No. It's still the ""best"" of the countertop models currently on offer and it cleans dishes. Will I complain about this for the next however many years we use this. Absolutely. It's a startling thing when you have a decent product produced by a manufacturer, and you purchase their newer model which is obviously inferior. I understand that the market for these things is limited, but that doesn't mean that progress should be cast aside.You're going to look at the market for countertops. You're going to see a complete lack of information on all these different models. You're going to confuse one SNP model that you were looking at for another. You're going to realize that the specs you thought you were looking at for the Magic Chef were actually for the Danby. You're going to go to each manufacturer's website to look for the missing information from the product page, and you're going to realize that the manufacturer's websites don't have this information either.Then you're going to realize that only one company manufactures these things, that the industry doesn't care about this segment, and you're going to go with the Danby because it is the only one that offers a water heater.Then you're going to install it, and use it, and after not too long you're going to b***h about it because it's *juuuuuust* right on the tip of something good, but simply not there. And then you're going to come to the reviews section and say the same damn thing I just said."
"Ive only had this dishwasher for 2 months, and have discovered a major design flaw: if the spray arm is obstructed (like if something falls down into the basin by mistake, or the edge of a bowl dips below the tray slightly), the machine will continue to complete its cycle without stopping from the error. The cycle will continue, and your dishes will still be filthy at the end. Since then, I’ve run 3 cycles and each time, dishes do not come out clean. I’m going to run a cleaning cycle (with vinegar) and see if this helps. If not, I’ll be sending this back. A shame!"
"The dishwasher worked fine for a few days, but in less than a week it stopped working completely. I contacted Danby for support and they said that the unit needed to be fixed. I would have to take the dishwasher to the closest repair center (which is not in my city) for the repairs. Instead I contacted Amazon and I am returning the unit for a full refund. I am so glad Amazon's customer service is so much better than Danby's."
installed brand new did not work & had to return. replacement unit stopped working less than one year after installed. so disappointed.
"At first I really liked it, it did the job. However 4 months into using it, it broke down and would flood out the bottom seam. Directions were followed exactly and it would not drain because it would get stuck on cycle. I proceeded to contact customer support and did what they required, emailed photos of my serials and purchase receipt. ONE MONTH LATER I’M STILL WAITING FOR AN ANSWER ON HOW THEY ARE GOING TO FIX OR REPLACE MY WASHER. I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN AND HIGHLY ADVISE ANYONE ELSE TO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF PURCHASING ONE OF THEIR PRODUCTS."
"It doesn't actually clean that well. Yes, if you have caked-on food, it's expected that you will need to do at least a little surface rub before/after you put it through a wash cycle. This machine will not clean anything that won't come off quicker with a scrub of a bare hand."
"This dishwasher worked fine for about a year.One day it said E4, which meant it had a leak, after that the electronics never work right again.I'm very disappointed, I really liked this dishwasher.☹️"
"I had bought and identical model many years ago.  It cost about the same then.  I needed something for a condo we just bought and it worked like a dream.  Did a super good job and lasted for many years after that.  I ended up giving it as a gift to a friend because our family had grown substantially and I needed something bigger.This one we bought on June 14, 2019, installed it about a week later and it has stopped working now 2 weeks ago. Initially it showed some water leakage on the ""sensor"" which the book said to fix by tightening the water connections.  There had been one that leaked a bit.  Then the machine just went crazy.  As soon as I turn it on all the selection indicators go racing around the control and you cannot chose any washing cycle at all.  I have been in contact with the manufacturer; the waiting time for customer service complaints and warranty requests was 1.5 hrs!  You could not have anybody call you back, if you hang up you go to the back of the line.  All the reps are very nice, the first one miswrote my email address, so I waited a couple of days until I got the promised email.  It obviously never came so I called back and this time we did get an email right away and send them our receipt.That is where we are now.  This was a week ago and we have not heard back yet as to any action that will be taken with this issue.  I am hugely disappointed and I would definitely not buy again from a company who has so little regard for their  customers!"
"We've only had it a couple months so I can't speak to longevity.  Its 7 c. max fill line is about 1/2 way- but you can see in my photo, boiling water doesn't bubble much over that at all. So why the extra glass? Just extra weight. It's ok using to lift it empty, but it's pretty heavy after adding only 4 c water, so I need to use both hands. To fill our 43 oz coffee press (shown on the left) doesn't it filled above 4-c on the Cosori. (and it is pretty heavy to me only filled that high) Unusable height above the fill line makes kettle too high to slip under an 8"" water spigot like ours, (shown on the right).  I do like that the strainer is built on the lid- it's out of the way when the lid opens with a button on the top of the handle. The Cosori replaced a stainless steel Hamilton Beach kettle we'd used for 15 years (shown far-R). The H.B. contact finally became intermittent, but it never rusted (new models seem to rust or corrode). I read reviews on so many competing kettles- it seems HB isn't making them like they used to. I decided on the Cosori  even with a few complaints about water spots on the bottom heating plate- yes ours shows them already, but that doesn't matter to me.  My complaint is weight/height. You'll probably need to use both hands to lift or position under a faucet. We have a dedicated water spigot at the sink for filtered water- very handy and the old kettle could slide under it without having to hold in a tilted position, or even lift, just slide over. I miss that."
"My first 1L kettle developed a corrosion ring on the bottom metal plate in  about  6 months... this 1.7L Cosori kettle developed a corrosion marks on the bottom in just 3 weeks of use. I use it 2x/ day and I wipe it dry after each use, I dont let water to stand in it. City water  where I live is good.I wonder Is the corrosion / mineral deposits  a big problem in most of kettles?? Is it safe?  Is there a remedy to remove it? I had no luck scrapping  it off."
"Used to boil water for hot drinks and to cool hot water for drinking.Like it boils quickly and the water is very hot.Don’t like. Can only fill half way, it is too big and heavy for me to pick up.  I didn’t open the box or use it for a while after I bought it and now  it is too late to return it."
"I really wanted to love this kettle. I did so much sleuthing before I bought it—even ordered and returned a different one before I settled on this one—and there is lots to love. No plastic in contact with the water. Beautiful blue-lit boiling water you can see through the clear glass. But golly… the longer I use it, the worse it leaks while you pour. If you’re pouring a small amount—one mug, for instance—it’s fine. But try filling a teapot quickly (as you should do, since you want the boiling water in contact with the leaves) and you have a lake on your kitchen counter. This has been happening in moderation from the beginning, and I’ve dealt with it, assuming the spout is just not made to pour quickly. But the last few days it’s gotten ridiculous. Not sure what’s changed, but I am beginning to wish I’d stuck with something less pretty and more practical."
"The electric kettle was put in a very old, used box. I am not sure if it is a brand-new product. For this reason, I give three stars."
"I liked my tea kettle while it worked. It lasted 13 months until one morning it just stopped working.Calling customer service to find out if I was still covered proved to be a waste of time.  One message says "" Due to a high volume of calls the calling center is closed.  Leave a message,  we will call you back within one day"".  Another says "" Call us during normal hours"", but when I called, it said that the calling center is closed. So here what I have a problem with: are they hiding from buyers who's tea kettles stopped working? So many products require assistance  that they had to close the calling center  "" due to a high volume of calls""?  If they cared about customers and servicing their products,  they would have double the time the calling center was open.  This set up just doesn't make sense.Update 12/13/23:After over a week of emails and phone calls, I finally received an email stating that my tea kettle is on its way.  So now, for over 5 days, there is no update on the status of the delivery.  I have been without a tea kettle for almost 3 weeks now.  The phone calls are returned, but it is apparent that the people returning phone calls have not listened to the messages I left. They call back to the number on the caller ID, not what was provided in the message. They call and ask me how they can help me, while in the message  I specifically ask for certain things. Also, it would be helpful if the return call started with a phrase about ""returning a call from you"".  There are tons of phone calls from solicitors that I get, so it is confusing.Bottom line:  the trouble of getting a new tea kettle worth under $30 has become an issue worth of a month of phone calls and emails, and inconveniences for not having a proper kitchen equipment.  If it wasn't for the fact that mine broke 13 months after purchase, I wouldn't be dealing with all of this. Totally not worth my time. I could have gotten a new tea kettle on Amazon 3 weeks ago and would have forgotten  all about that.  My final question to Cosori: why not just give a refund so I could just go and purchase a new one?"
"Reviewed: Oct 14, 2024We bought this for our downstairs kirchen. We didn't need anything fancy since it wouldn't be used much.Your settings are, boil, and that's it.I do like the lighted feature on it, and it looks pretty cool at night boiling. I find the water comes to a boil very quickly.It's size is just right. The price was extremely low on sale and I couldn't pass the deal up.It was about $56 less than our other one which has many settings for specific brewing. Timer, etc."
"I liked the features of this kettle (glass carafe, quick heating, easy to clean) but was incredibly disappointed when it died after year after purchasing. I’ll be looking for another option with better longevity."
"It was great for 1 year and then one day, it just stopped turning on. Outside return window, so I'm out of luck."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Not sure where they got that two nut minute number from. I typed it on my stopwatch and it was nine minutes and 50 seconds to a rapid boil where it automatically shut off. Overall I like that it’s all glass I feel like it’s pretty large and takes up a lot of room but overall it’s pretty definitely heavy because of Max capacity, I overfill it just slightly passed the line for some reason is like really low halfway down it I like the spout and filter is on a hinge so it gives you more room to fill it under a water dispenser"
It is a good product. The color is nice but after boiling the glass does not maintain the heat.
I loved it until it quit working. Lasted a little over a year and a half.
"I bought the one with the temperature buttons (the one that's 54 dollars). It looks REALLY cool with the blue light, and I like the fact that it's easy to see if it's dirty inside (my previous electric kettle was silver on the outside and you couldn't see in as well as this glass one, so I really like the glass). Also, this is super easy to clean, with white vinegar in the boiling water.I really don't like the three loud beeps that it makes when the water is at the correct temperature. I wish there was a setting to turn off that sound. However, I've found a way around the beeps. The device always makes two quiet clicks, within a second or two of each other, just prior to the three loud beeps which begin just a split-second after the second ""click,"" so I've learned to listen for those two internal clicks and I immediately pick up the kettle on the second click. Additionally, I've gotten used to approximately how much time it takes to get to the green tea and white tea levels anyway, and I know when the water is about ready so I can walk back over to the tea kettle and be ready to pick it up on the second click sound. So this is how I avoid hearing the beeps."
"I purchased it 2 years ago, and it broke this month. It wouldn't turn on anymore, don't know why. Also, when I pour water from it, it spills all over the place. There is some scum on the bottom after 2 years, I cleaned it with lemon juice only a couple of times.Suprisingly, the cost of this kettle hasn't changed since I bought it, it was 27.99, and still is."
"The unit works very well. It heats up fast.  I gave it a 3 star because it works so well but it doesn't have a temperature control.I knew it didn't come with a temperature control when I bought it, but the unit is so good that it should have one.If you don't mind the 0 to 212 range then this is the unit for you.  I thought I could be that guy, but it turns out I'm not."
Seemingly larger kettle than needed but the maximum water level (1.7 liters) is only half way up and that takes seven minutes to boil or more than three times the advertised two minutes!  I also worry that the glass kettle may break when filling it from a metal spout.  False advertising but as yet no regrets sufficient to return…
"I'm returning because it's just too large for the available counter space. I underestimated the size as compared to what it was replacing.Out of the box, it's cheap and wobbly. I saw someone in the reviews gluing feet to the base, which seems like it would work... but why should I have to do that?"
"I’ve had this about a month and like that it’s glass so I’m not boiling and drinking plastic.  About a week ago, it started making this big clunk noise when I use it… still works & was never quiet… but the clunk has got me worried!"
"I like this kettle... it worked well and I WOULD have bought it again, but looking at my purchase date... just LESS than one year, it ""died"" completely and no longer works.  I expect a longer life than that."
It does not have variable heat settings. It boils water. Period.  We bought it to replace a similar one and neglected to see that it only boils water. Our other one had different heat settings.
Ot is only ok. The cons: when boiling starts it takes long time to turn off. After about 2 years of use the plastic base started melting.
"Love it but the kettle turns off instead of keeping the water to temp for the hour, how it says it’s suppose to on the Manuel."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I thought the whole kettle died but it was just the blue light. Still low quality after one month. Missed return window by 3 days
"Photo is taken of the inside lid.  I circled the part in blue that is clearly black plastic.  There is a metal strainer attached but does not flap over or cover the plastic in anyway.  I purchased this in order to avoid the heat and black plastic combo, replacing my ninja coffee maker which was plastic along the entire path of the water heating process.I purchased this because it clearly said that the blank plastic does not come in contact with the water.  I think anyone who understands how hot water behaves would know that any plastic on the lid would come in contact with water since the hot water steams and bubbles raising to the top, collecting on the lid and running back into the water.Most black plastics are made from recycled electronics not intended for use with food and treated heavily with chemicals and flame retardants since they didn't want your VCR to catch fire.  Now we get our to-go food in this same gross plastic.  It is becoming a real challenge to avoid these plastics, especially when companies are lying."
"This lasted a bit over 2 1/2 years when we noticed the water would shut off before it bubbles. This has happened a bunch of times, but I want it to really boil to make my coffee.  I'm debating if I should keep using it  as is or buy another one before it might get worse. I love the glass look with the steel inner lid and spout. This the only one of its kind out there."
"It boils in 2 minutes, but it does not keep the water warm ."
I bought this kettle just because it says no plastic.Unfortunately the cap still has plastic ( exposing to the steam from the boiling water ) around the metal.Also where the handle attaches to glass part of kettle is plastic and this also exposes to hot steam:(Hopefully they can produce a better version with no plastic exposing to the water/ steam.Still skeptical on keeping or returning.
"The kettle works well and boils water efficiently. However, it lacks a notification feature, such as a beep sound, to indicate when the water has finished boiling. As a result, I often forget that the water is ready, and it cools down, requiring me to reboil it. Adding a simple notification function would greatly enhance its usability."
"Ready? Ok, here I go:I chose this kettle over my old stainless steel one because of the aesthetics probably because I was spending too much time at home. I thought the blue light would be nice ambience in the kitchen. After months of giving this kettle the side eye on the daily i’m finally writing the review to put it out in the universe that I really don’t like it. One of the main and justifiable reasons is that the lid doesn’t unlock/ lift/ open/ or function safely. Anytime you press the lid release button it doesn’t actually pop up it just unlocks it, barley. Like it’s a two handed job to open the kettle with one hand on the unlock button and the other hand risking a steam burn on any given day.I’ll give you a little more detail so you can visualize.So let’s say you make a cup of tea and afterwards you want to boil an entire pot or just refill it? You need to stick your finger in between the pour lip and the lid, keeping in mind there is still hot water and steam on this area of the kettle for quite some time. Even when I’ve used the entire kettle to brew fresh tea the manner in which you need to finagle or that you have to stick your finger up into the narrow spout to get the lid open is hot and dangerous for, we’ll, a while. This obviously a major design flaw and a safety hazard from the steam and heat. I couldn’t be bothered to return it and that’s my bad because I use it too often to keep it around. My original thought process was I’m the only one using it so I don’t have to worry about someone else getting injured since I know about the flaw. But if you’re like me and you brew a pitcher of tea a couple times a week, maybe have some tea or Coco before bed, have Ramen… All the things you would use a kettle for it’s just going to irritate you. So like 12 times a week I get mad n give it some side eye…my bad. I had my last one for six plus years. When it comes to kitchen appliances it’s just better to make the investment, spend the $70 and be happy for years to come or spend $40 and have a dangerous blue light you resent sitting on the counter.As for the temperature control, once it’s hit it’s temperature you have it set for (and no I did not break out a thermometer to test the accuracy I am willing to bet it’s not spot on) it doesn’t necessarily maintain that. Meaning if you don’t get it when it first reaches the boiling temperature you’ve chosen it will cool down then re-boil but it never gets as hot as the first go around. It may seem like a small tick but when you need your water boiling for Ramen and it won’t get to that full on boil because it’s thermostat is wonky it’s just poo poo. If you’re going to advertise the feature it should work so you don’t have half cooked Ramen or have to wait 10 minutes. So if I want to boil some water for my hummingbird feeder but I get caught up on a phone Whomp whomp.. it’ll be hot but it’s noticeably different.The only other feature I can appreciate is the soft alert which is a light “beep” sound it makes when ready. Its is not annoying nor loud similar to a flat iron alert.  So there’s the compliment sandwich.But you should buy something else… That’s me leaving you with the dry crust on the sandwich"
"From the moment I unboxed my COSORI Electric Kettle, I was impressed by its sleek design quick, efficient operation. The LED lights added a modern touch I didn't know I needed, illuminating the kitchen with a soft glow that made early mornings a bit more bearable. Its 1.7L capacity was perfect for my daily needs, easily accommodating multiple cups of tea or coffee without the need for a refill. The speed at which this kettle brought water to a boil was nothing short of remarkable with it's powerful 1500W heating element, saving me precious minutes during the morning rush.The volume of water it held was just right for my use, ensuring I had enough hot water for both my breakfast and a to-go cup for the office. Additionally, the stainless steel inner lid and filter were standout features for me, offering peace of mind knowing my hot beverages would be free from BPA and other unwanted chemicals. The automatic shut-off feature I found nothing short of essential.However, my experience took a turn about 8 months into using the kettle. Despite what I would consider moderate use, the lid broke clean off one day as I attempted to open it. This was a disappointing and surprising development, especially considering the overall quality and performance I had come to expect from the kettle.In summary, while my COSORI Electric Kettle delivered on many fronts—speed, capacity, safety features, and aesthetics—it was ultimately let down by durability concerns. This incident has left me with mixed feelings about the product, as what began as a seamless integration into my daily routine ended in an unexpected inconvenience."
This product works fine but I can't imagine that it's going to last very long. Seems rather cheaply made.
"Lasted little over a year and a halfNow continously boils watter when plugged in, will not switch off"
looks nice I don't understand why a kettle is so big if you can only fill half of it
"So disappointed that these spots developed after a week or so because this kettle worked perfectly!  I was trying to get away from microwaving water and I'm not fond of cleaning stove top kettles.  I read the reviews and noticed others had issues with spot however I thought I would give it a chance.  😐PROS:  Although it's light weight, the glass appears to be very durable, and I felt safe using it for that reason.  Boils water fast no matter how full.  It has an automatic shut off feature once the water has been boiling for several seconds. It's light weight and the base and handle do not get hot in case you need to move the kettle around the counter.  The top opens wide which makes it very easy to clean and dry.  Even though it has no significance, the beautiful blue light that indicates the unit is on is quite relaxing.  It envelopes the room in a calming blue  glow.  *ZEN*CONS:  THE SPOTS!!!! UGH! 🙄  I would have suggested this kettle to anyone if the spots had not appeared.  I purposely kept it clean and dry to avoid any chance the spots would appear.  SUUUCKS!  I really liked how this kettle worked and I bought a Cosori because I have their air fryer which I love.  Such is life.UPDATE: Ever heard of ""contempt prior to investigation?""  Well I did some investigation on the spots after I realized many other kettles were having the same issues.  Obviously the common denominator was lack of investigation about the water.  Yes, it was the water that causes the build up in the bottom of the pot after use.  It is just what it is.  Again, this kettle did everything I need it to do.  I may consider upgrading to a temperature control model since I now know that residue is almost inevitable, even with distilled water I've noticed.  There are various videos on youtube that show how to clean the residue.  Cosori thank you for making quality products.  I will continue to consider the brand in the future."
"I love the look and capacity but when it is turned backwards with the pour spout tilted up it leaks down below the handle. Not sure why that is happening and doesn’t seem like a good thing.  It heats well, it keeps the water hot for a bit, the blue light is cool, and it looks good,  if the bottom didn’t leak it would be a five star review."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I love this thing. For the price, quick delivery and reliability... you can't go wrong. I just wish the lid would open wider. S Update on my review. -->>> This is my 2nd one. Since the 1st and now the 2nd one have melted on the stove. It's no ding on the manufacturer since it was our fault. But... in the event you accidentally place it on the stove, look out, the bottom will melt off!!! Seeing as this is our 2nd one, I will need to replace it with an entirely different model  since we're accident prone."
"I had a Magic Mill kettle (from Aldi) for years that I loved. Unfortunately, it just stopped working one day right before Christmas, and I had to have a kettle, so I purchased this one since Amazon recommended it.On my Magic Mill, the handle had two buttons; one to open the lid and immediately below that, another to turn the kettle on, which made for easy use. I like that design much more than having the button on the base to turn it on. It appears flimsier and I'm concerned that it will break at some point. I also don't know if the base gets hot or not, but worry about the potential for burning myself if I'm boiling a second pot right away.Another thing I don't like is that this kettle produces a ton of condensation, so when the kettle stops boiling, the only part that is clear is where the water is. The rest of the kettle is clouded with condensation drops. With my Magic Mill, there was never any condensation.However, I do like the metal strainer on this one; not that I've had any issues with a plastic one.The advertising for this says that it's dripless, yet it's dripped at least one drop almost every time I've poured hot water, my guess is that it's from the excessive condensation.  Again, I never had issues with drips from my Magic Mill.So overall, I'm not really thrilled with this unit. How much of that has to do with comparing it to something I really liked, I don't know. This kettle does a fine job of heating water, which is what it's supposed to do. So I have no complaints about that. But I think there are better kettles out there. And if I can find another one like my original kettle, I will certainly be replacing it."
"It’s such a cute addition to my kitchen, but I wish I bought another one.The “filter” isn’t secured in place to effectively filter the water. Also, when you open the top after boiling the water, the hot water runs down the top and WILL BURN YOU. BEWARE!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I purchased this kettle October 2022. I have loved this kettle and it works great - until it doesn’t. The kettle died on me July 2023. It gets to a point where it malfunctions and turns on and off constantly without getting to a rolling boil. Customer service was great, the kettle has a two year warranty so they replaced it. After another year and 3 months the replacement unit broke in the same way. Per Cosori support the replacement unit does not have its own separate warranty and is only included in the original 2 years. So now in October 2024 I am one week past the two year mark and have a broken kettle with no warranty. It’s a shame, it is a nice kettle but I need one that works for more than one year. Sure I could buy a new one, it being inexpensive, but I don’t want to add a Cosori kettle to the landfill every year. Going to try another brand."
"It works great, however I havent had it very long and the glass is discoloring, it looks like mold but its not.  Only water has been used in it.  Not sure if I will continue to use."
Had this kettle for 3 years of part time use. During that time it did its job well but after three years it has stopped working completely. Would expect better from a $50 tea kettle.
"When you first get this, you'll be put off by the apparent low quality of the materials used to make the kettle.  Please dispel that feeling and put it to use!Updated review:  This kettle lasted 3 months.  Just today, while in reheat mode, all the lights lit up, it started boiling, and then all the lights went out and it continue boiling.  It then boils the water clean off.I unplugged it for 30 min, refilled it and started it up again.  It came to a boil and then switched into reheat mode like normal.  The first time it tried to warm back up, the lights on the handle all lit again, and it began a full boil.  Lights then went off completely, but it remained actively boiling and didn't stop until I unplugged it.At this point I can see that it's a logic sensor that has failed, and as such this is no longer safe to use.  YMMV, but I no longer recommend this kettle.Original review is below:This is a relatively quick boiling kettle, with no-rim design meaning you can fully empty it.  It has a one hour standby which is on by default but can be disabled.  Unlike my previous kettle, this one works every single time!  Glows blue while heating, then goes white at the desired temperature (has six selections for temps).It's also the best kettle I've used in terms of dealing with hard water.  Easy to clean, and the particles are generally tiny (not flakes) but do not pass the screen, allowing you to use most of the water you boil.  I can't tell you how rare this is--I've probably owned four different kettles in the past 15-20 years, and this is frankly the best of the bunch from the hard water perspective.The only con--when the unit is low on water (last pour or two) some steam escapes from the top of the handle.  Be wary of that and you'll be fine."
"I loved this kettle and used it daily. I particularly appreciated that it had a stainless steel spout rather than nylon. However, my last kettle lasted 5 years and this one lasted 18 months. It turns off early with the water barely warm. I've tried taking it apart to figure out the problem, and the bottom seems to be glued in place in such a way that removing the screws isn't enough to get to the important parts. I didn't have success in repair.We loved it while it lasted! But, I want a product that will stand the test of time and/or that is consumer repairable so I'm not contributing as heavily to our landfill."
Not as described without plastics. The seal is exposed to boiling water.
I loved this kettle & purchased a 2nd one as a gift. It just stopped working right around the 2 year mark. It has a 2 year warranty period. I had a lot of things going on in my personal life when it went out so I'm just now looking into it and I am a couple months past that so can't do anything about it now.
"I purchased a Cosori Electric Kettle in November 2023, but it stopped working just a few weeks ago. Now, as I search for a replacement, I noticed the Cosori Electric Kettle is still highly rated, and I’m curious why it remains so popular. My previous electric kettle, from a different brand, lasted almost three years, which makes me question the durability of the Cosori kettle."
"This is a lovely appliance sitting on the counter. It is large, holding a lot of water, yet the long sturdy handle can accommodate both hands if needed. It heats quickly, the led light color changes to a lighter blue when the selected temperature is reached, and the stay-warm feature lasts for 60 minutes.The screen at the spout to control tea bags is a nice feature. All of the many option buttons are on the upper portion of the long sturdy handle, and the print is large enough to be read easily.The one and only negative is the light gray discoloration,which looks to be pitting, on the base of the inside after first and continuing use. We only use FIJI Water, and are therefore surprised that a higher quality of stainless steel is not used.While we love the product, how it heats and performs, we are concerned if continued use will erode the inside base further to a point we are drinking metal infused water, and wonder if there is an upgraded version."
"I liked this kettle a lot.  Reliable and quick to boil, if a little heavy to lift.  Until it started to be kind of iffy at a year old.  Then totally failed at about 15 months.  Perhaps this is the shelf life of a tea kettle.  But it seems it should be longer."
"Difinitely would break if it got dropped on the floor.  my current chefman has thicker glass.  I Don't think its Borosilicate glass.  can't be.  after first pot of water,  I smell plastic.  But not sure where that came from as there is very little plastic in the cap.  so second patch of water I kept the lid open,  found out it doesn't click off stop when lid is left up.  But it didn't stink like burnt plastic that time.  so it was the steam getting to the plastic in the lid.  Then when I emptied it I made sure all hot water fell on the plastic lid.  and opened it up.  guess what it smelled like burnt plastic again.  The little bit of plastic on the lid doesn't seem to like heat.  so the only way to use it,  is to heat water with lid up.  turn it off myself,  and have lid up while I'm pouring the water out.  alot of work.  and thin glass. and another thing...the strainer would not hold any small tea leaves,  it has opening on the side, would not work for anything the consistancy of roobios.  You would need to use full tea leaves.  there has to be better ones out there.  that is all glass and steel."
I've had lots of electric kettles and even the cheapest lasted longer by years. Today mine just stopped working. I think to much of the electronic parts are exposed in the base. They seemed to have corroded. And no it's not in water or anything just normal use. I'm very disappointed.
The tea kettle looks good but once it starts boiling it continues boiling for another 10 mins or more before shutting down. Why not stop? I would not have bought it if I knew about this flaw
"We used this kettle on a daily basis for two years, and then one day it stopped heating water. The light still lights up but no heating happens. Tried troubleshooting everything with no luck. :/"
"Was a great electric kettle....while it lasted!  Just stopped working. Plugged it in a couple different outlets.  I liked the auto turn off feature, and it being glass for level checking.  I used it a few times a day every single day.  It heated quickly, it was a bit noisy when heating. I liked the wide top so was easy to wipe it out every day since mineral built up quick from my water.  I expected it to last longer than one year. What good are all these features if it is short lived.  Disappointed"
Other things are good one thing i found about it that it makes the water to smell like cloride when you let the water in it which make the water taste so bad.i wanted to return the item but i found the return window is close
"This glass electric kettle was everything I hoped it would be! It had all the different temp settings at the push of a button. All glass and nowhere would hot or boiling water contact plastic. Everything seemed perfect until I pressed a button for the first time. For some a light around the base of the pitcher seems harmless. To me it is infusing my precious morning tea water with obnoxious (not to mention bad for the eyes), bright blue, led light pollution. I am disappointed, truly, and must return this otherwise perfect electric kettle."
"It’s a nice good kettle, that does its job, no complaints. But in 1.5 years it just refused to turn on… 🤷🏻‍♂️"
I think it is an okay product. It stays foggy with water for a long time for some reason.
"I bought this kettle because it advertised as All glass and steel. However the lid , even though it has a metal plate in the middle is plastic all around the inside edges.Condensation from the boiling water collects here and on the plastic hinge for the metal strainer, then drips back into the kettle.We don’t want to drink plastic water!Too bad, it would have been a great, A+ plus, kettle."
"We loved this kettle for everyday use--pour over coffee and tea for our studio. Stayed warm, worked great.Then one day, later in the morning, it over heated, boiling incessantly.Cancel button had no effect. Unplugged it. Let it cool off. Power button showed white light, then went to boil again. Left it overnight,then in the morning, Blue light came on, then nothing. Light went off. No heat to core. Nothing looks amiss in the base. Left it to sit for a few days, still no heat, just blue lights then off. We particularly liked that it was glass. It's a shame to trash it, as we have had it less than a year. I'd love to know it's the base or thermostadt."
"I bought the electric Kettle model GK172-CO (black) Batch 289Q60N2, which lasted approximately 1.5 years, and the bottom switch stopped working. I'm going over the warranty which lasts 2 years. I'm hopeful that I can get it fixed or replaced."
This was working great until it started smoking while heating up water. We bought this in May and it worked fine until today (7months). A little scary to find it smoking and unfortunately I probably won't get a refund.
"I did like this kettle quite a bit, it boiled very fast and looked good doing it.BUTIt stopped shutting off after 3 months of use (2x a day). I tried to file a warranty claim. But guess what? Cosori has no warranty, and does not stand behind their products.The wiring is probably faulty like it was on their massive recall of their air-fryer last year. No more Cosori for me."
This was a replacement for one that stopped working and we have had it for just over a year.  This morning it was boiling and there was a bang and glass flew out.  Amazon were great and refunded without an issue.  I have also contacted the manufacturer. I presume there was a fault in the glass.  Hopefully this is a one off.
"Support page on amazon takes you to a 404 Not Found Website, after finding COSORI is china based and only way to contact these people is email i already knew this would be an issue, after 2-3 days of 1 ended responses they asked me to take a photo and send to them via email with the cord cut off from the base.My kettle has stopped working after few months and did not work or light up or heat up when plugged in, beyond having to deal with this awful companies warranty system i went ahead and sent the photo, now nearly a week later i still have yet to get a response for my 2 year warranty as promised from initial date of purchase.AVOID like the plague, kettle is cool and nice but clearly made with faulty and cheap electronics as the bottom plate of the kettle the heats it up broke after 2-3 months of normal use.WARRANTY is beyond horrendous and unresponsive, I'm afraid i probably wasted my time trying to talk to these people.and now have a useless pitcher that just holds water on my table with a bottom plate with the cord cut off somewhere in a E-Waste dump..."
I bought this at $53 a little less than 2 years ago in June 2022 and recently the temperature settings stopped working and the kettle would automatically boil the water at the highest temperature. Really shocked that they are charging over $90 for this now in 2024… definitely not worth the money if it’s only going to last for less than 2 years
"Poorly engineered unit where water does not flow uniformly from the spout when pouring from the kettle.Also, when lifting the cover, water tends to leak out to the outside and on to the counter!The unit looks attractive and colorful but as far as functionality and design, there are plenty of QA/QC need to be performed."
I use the kettle multiple times daily.  I am on the third one.  None of them have had a one-year anniversary.  It looks like planned obsolence after so many uses.  This is another cheap throwaway product for our landfills that works really well until it dies.  I would love to find a more permanent solution.
It boils water. Yes!!  But definitely doesn’t do it in 2 minutes like advertised. It also has a plastic base so it looks cheap and rocks when it’s placed on the base (so it doesn’t fit snuggly on the base).I do appreciate that it boils water….but I personally wouldn’t buy it again.
"While the product did heat water quickly to boiling, and had great capacity, the Consori Water Kettle only lasted 11 months. It does not heat water any longer. I purchased in July 2023. I will not purchase again, but look for something that will last longer."
I like this kettle and it gets the job done but I do notice the cord gets really really hot when I'm using it and i have never had this happen with an appliance so I think it is a fire risk.
"Is it just me that expects a product of this price point to last longer than 2.5 years? It suddenly stopped heating this morning. Nothing changed, it wasn’t jostled or dropped or surged. Just sitting on the counter, doing its thing last night perfectly and this morning… dead. I’m so disappointed."
"We LOVED this electric kettle.  So quick and easy and convenient!However, about a year after purchase, it literally exploded, sending glass all over my kitchen.We're getting a new kettle, but probably not this one."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The kettle was working fine until yesterday, a bit too loud sometimes but that was OK.All of a sudden it decided to join the philharmonic and started ""whistling/shrieking"" when turned on. (Watch video).Cons: a bit too loud sometimes, takes a bit too long to stop boiling.Pros: Stopped working properly 1 day before the return date! :-)))))"
I like it very much. But recently I saw some white stuff coming out from the bottom of the pot. I just wonder it is safe to use.
"I've bought three of these open box, all listed as like new condition- without box damage mention.  Mine was beautiful and works well. Sure wish I'd saved the box bc for my parents I received these- first and second attempts for theirs pictured here. Is someone purposefully ruining the box to designate it a returned item before reselling it?  Awful to call this like new condition. And neither kettle is in like new condition- very good for one, good for the other.  I'm out of time so keeping the least bad one but I'd say only buy this new, which is sad bc the price point sold me on giving electric a try!  But buyer beware on the Amazon warehouse versions. A bit of a shame, bc I tend to do well with those normally!"
"While the kettle worked ok for one year, today, after a normal usage of boiling  water a few times a day, the sensor stopped working and does not turn it off after it boils. I am buying a new one, not this brand for sure."
"The glass spout cracked and broke around 40 days.  Other than that, it was fine, but most of the teapots I've had manage to make it a few years before either the electronics fail or the lime scale builds up.  This was a huge disappointment."
This was very strange.  This electric kettle had so many reviews.  I should have read some reviews.  Most likely would not have purchased.  The box says that it contains BPA and the lid only partially opens.  I returned it for a refund.
"The cord is very stiff and was apparently crimped when screws went in the bottom. This makes it difficult to get cord to come out of the notch made for that. Also, the lid only opens halfway when you push the lid release, so you have to manually open it to fill or clean. One reviewer said the sides did not get hot, which I was skeptical of. They DO get hot, so just be aware of that. This is my first electric tea kettle and I love the idea but am not terrible impressed with this one."
Love the quick heat up but it has a flaw the handle to the glass at the top developed a stress crack! After a year!
"I purchased this as a replacement of a pot I had for about 8 years.  Within about 20 months, the blue light quit working, and now, it fails to get water to a rolling boil. In defense of this manufacturer, my water is above average hardness and that might have something to do with in only lasting 28 months.  I cleaned it regularly using vinegar to soak for several hours, so I can’t imagine that causing a problem."
"I opted to buy this product as “Brand New”. Upon receiving my box, I peeled the tape off the Amazon box and to my surprise the Cosori box had a giant gash cut into the top of the box. The clear tape holding the box closed was barely doing that. And there were disgusting smudges and finger prints around the base of the kettle. EW. I tried to get beyond that and wiped the kettle down I did the initial water cycle as instructed in the manual. And after just that one cycle (with filtered water) I was left with a bunch of spots on the bottom of the kettle. I expect this over time but not on first run. I would like to have the brand new kettle I paid for and not something that was previously used.Heating was pretty fast, it did auto shutoff once water was heated, the light ring is really pretty and a great indicator if I am across the room.Update: 01/2023 Kettle works well most of the time. There are issues with it seeming to heat up but cutting off before before the water is actually heated. I have to press the button for it to run again in order to heat the water. While it doesn’t happen all the time it happens enough to be noticeable."
"The only flaw I’ve noticed is with the lid. After boiling, when I go to pour the water, condensation from the lid tends to drip off, but not into the cup, it ends up on the counter. It seems like a small inconvenience, when it happened every time it gets very annoying.The kettle itself is like any other kettle is is pretty fast, a little noisy for a quite office space but does its job to deliver hot water."
My package arrived the day it was expected in perfect condition and the delivery driver did a great job hidding the package from others.  I was super excied to get this product since it will make my morning routine way easier when packing my kiddos lunch and my hubbys morning coffee. The package for the kettle itself was also in great condition once I opened it and it looked great once I put water in it I noticed there was a small amount of water on the base and right infront of the kettle.  I double checked everything wiped everything the counters down and made sure once again everything was dry once  I put the kettle on the base I noticed more water still a small amout but with it being electrical I didnot want to risk it called my husbnd over he looked at it and confirmed the water was leaking from the inside of the kettle to the bottom and thats why the base was getting wet. I will be returning it and hopefully I find something better.
"The inner lid has plastic to it. They claimed that the water would have no contact with plastic but it would steam the plastic while boiling and eventually, it would mix with the water. This will return. I want to buy the $39 that’s says upgraded and it looks like they updated the lid, but I cannot be sure. I tried to find a way to contact the seller but I don't see it anywhere."
"I was in love with it at first, but when it came time to clean the kettle (calcium deposits build up from boiling) it became clear that there's no way to do it.  The lid does not lift high enough to easily access the inside of the kettle, and does not detach.  No choice but to throw it out and get another.  Disposable consumerism at it's finest."
This kettle worked great - boiled fast - but died in its 20th month. It was used almost every day and usually multiple times a day. I guess less than two years is now the lifespan of these types of appliances.
"We had this product, and just past the warranty it stopped working. I've heard that the problem is easy to fix if you know what you're doing. However, I do not.  So when I re-ordered, I bought the extended warranty.As I needed to pay extra to feel like I'd be able to use this for a reasonable duration, I feel it's earned a reduced rating. When it works, it's fine. I just say make sure you get this version that has multiple temperature settings, and not the single setting one."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Boil water.  Gets discolored- is this normal?  I dried after a days use.
"I got this to replace my last kettle that I had for over 3 years due to getting the rusty/burn marks on the bottom, usually it takes forever to get that. I had this kettle only a few days before it got the rust spot on the bottom and the spout cracked! I took a steel mesh and scrubbed it after soaking with vinegar didn’t work. It was clean again, one use got the spots back. The water looks murky not clear and clean when using it now. I contacted support which was great and they sent a replacement. Only took another few days to get the rust spots again. The spout stayed intact but when you pour it’s not a straight stream, the spout makes it dribble everywhere. I miss my old kettle and will be buying the Queenie brand kettle again since this was a waste.Update: 2024 the blue light stopped working so now it’s hard to tell if it’s on. I’ve been suffering with this kettle for a while now and I will finally stop being cheap and buy the other brand that is way better."
"very useful, high durability, light weight,  beautiful  modern appearance"
"Thought it was great...looks good/sturdy/easy to set up, use....however, returning because there is plastic that can be found under lid/under stainless filter that comes in contact with water, while pouring.  Only small piece of exposed plastic....but, I need NO plastic contact."
"Updated: One star added for Warranty and Customer Service.I checked the warranty on the Cosori website, and it turned out the kettle (and all or most of their products) comes with a *two* year warranty. I sent an email describing the problem and attached a pdf of my Amazon invoice for the original purchase and a photo of the label on the bottom of the base. They replied asking for a short video showing the problem, which I sent. They shipped a new kettle the next day.The good: They stand by their warranty.The bad: The process took about two weeks, and I’d already purchased a new Cuisinart electric kettle with temperature control. So, I guess I have a spare.Original review: We loved everything about this electric kettle. Heated quickly. The temperature controls were great. Easy to see and measure the water. However, it just died after about 13 months of use. The blue light is on and nothing happens. Considering its cheap Faberware predecessor lasted five years, this is unacceptable."
only worked for one year
"I used to love this kettle, been using it for year, but each time i order it the quality drops down. I just got my new one and the kettle doesn't seat well on the base and the lid doesn't open fully. It's a shame loosing quality in every single product this days."
"This item caused a steam burn when I picked it up to fill with more water. It had been several minutes since boiling finished and water was poured. The burn caused me to drop the partially full container onto the floor and it broke. Not a bad product, but not user friendly in some areas."
"I have had the kettle two days and love its ease in use, However despite using filtered water and wiping dry after each use the bottom edge has become discolored!  Why? Photo is  attached. Two days and frustrated"
"I do think this electric kettle is oversized but that's just my personal opinion. The minimum line is more than a normal cup of tea size is, leading to an inevitable waste of water when I dump the extra down the drain. However, I couldn't find any similar products that were smaller so this is what we get. Now, it claims that water boils in 3 minutes however that is definitely relative to how much water you're trying to heat. When I first got it and was heating water according to the included instructions to clean the kettle, it took way more than 3 minutes- probably more like 7. If you're heating the bare minimum amount of water, it heats very quickly, but a lot of water takes significantly longer.That said, I typically only heat the minimum amount of water so that's not been a problem."
"Minus two stars because the plastic spout either leaks or somehow gets condensation behind it and then dribbles water all over when you go to pour water into a cup. This would in all likelihood pertain to any kettle that has a spout that is affixed to the main water reservoir, not just this brand. It’s a bad design. Eventually I will get sick of it, toss it in the bin, and get a different one. I advise only getting one where the spout is part of the glass reservoir, or a stainless steel design where there is no plastic spout to leak. Pip pip."
"Purchased it due to stellar customer review, but returned it because there are several areas where the boiling water will come in contact with plastic."
"Even though we have a whole house filter and I used an additional water filter to fill this kettle, the first time we used it, there were discolored spots inside the kettle. There’s also a strange, thick lip around the top inside portion of the kettle so the water doesn’t completely drain and it’s hard to clean. It boils quickly, so it functions correctly, but there is definite room for improvement in the design. I don’t like that the lid and spout are plastic, so when you pour boiling water out of the kettle it passes across plastic amd this is a health concern for me. I would not buy this one again because I would want one that was easier to clean and had metal rather than plastic parts."
"It boils water, quickly, which is good.  But you can't pour all the water back out, which is bad if you have minerals in your water.  I have to take a cloth and dry out the inside of each of the two rims that trap water when you pour.  The water can't drip out or be shaken out, because the rims are cupped too deep toward the bottom of the kettle and they trap it.Another poor design point:  it has a screen to filter water as you pour it out, but the screen is so fine that water only goes through if it is more than 1/4"" deep.  I have to remove the lid and pour out through the opening.  Otherwise, even more water I have to dry out.It does boil water quickly, so that's a good quality.  But any kettle boils water."
Product arrived refurbished but I was charged full price. The amount paid is not worth the trouble of exchanging it and the item seems to be working properly. But still.
"I wanted to love this kettle. Unfortunately, there are several ""misses"" that prevent me from giving this a top rating.HITS- Size (1.8L) and sturdiness of build are great.- Heats even a full pot of water quickly. Love the red (heating) and green (ready to serve/keep warm) light ring.- Base plate plugs into the wall and remains on the counter - pot can be easily lifted off the base plate for filling, serving and cleaning.- Lid and diffuser easily and securely snap into place.- Diffuser and lid (only) are easy to clean.- Diffuser is extremely fine and prevents small particulates of loose tea from seeping into the water.- Additional fine mesh screens at pouring spout virtually guarantee a particulate-free drinking experience.- Volume markings are clear and easy to read.MISSES- Pot itself is difficult to clean. Insufficient room to get a hand inside.- Volume markings are on one side of the pot only and thus visible only to right-handers. Would prefer markings on both sides of the pot.- Volume markings are in liters only. Would prefer additional volume measurements (cups, quarts).- When filled to the maximum (1.8L), the water often boils out of the lid and spout, creating a mess.- ""Keep warm"" function is very poorly designed. When the light ring first turns green and the pot is removed for serving, replacing the pot to the base activates the keep warm function - but only that first time. If the pot is subsequently removed from the base plate for additional serving, the keep warm function does not re-activate. I would expect the keep warm function to work on some sort of timer - say 2 hours - no matter how many times the pot is removed/replaced during that time frame.Overall, I had very high hopes for this kettle but was ultimately disappointed - particularly with the poorly designed keep warm function. I would not recommend this kettle for that reason and will look for a different product when it comes time to replace it."
"It is a great purchase for the price. However, when trying to pour the bottom of the coffee pitcher the grounds clog the filter and you are not able to pour the coffee. Maybe if there was an insert to the pot to prevent the ground coffee from clogging the pouring spout."
"This review is both good and bad I suppose, have two of these one from a couple of years ago and this one recently 6/24  the older ones takes about 7 minutes to boil but works great. This one heats in about 3.5 minutes and keeps the water warm .. however this new one has an odor that I thought was cat food or tuna or something my kid left molding someplace... Turns out when the new one warms up it smells horrible around the plastics , where my older one doesn't. I don't know what to do... I have about a week to return it.  I thought it would go away with use but it's not.  It's fast it's efficient it's very useful...but it smells badly  taking away from the experience of a cup of sou or tea or Instant coffee or whatever .just .loses its appeal"
"Very light base - slides around as you're returning the kettle to the base.  Turns off once temperature is reached, doesn't keep water warm.  I should have read the description more carefully.  Everything is plastic.  On/off lever doesn't feel secure."
"Love the look, style and the quick boil. But if you have arthritis in your hands, look at a smaller one. This one is too big and too heavy and the handle too thick for those suffering from arthritis."
"On the plus side, this electric kettle boils water, lights up blue, and has a removable lid; all the things it says on the box. The downside is that as the water boils, the metal ring at the top of the glass expands slightly, so when you pour the hot water into something else (like a teapot) it leaks boiling water. This may just be an issue with the one I received, and it isn't a huge amount of water, but it is something to potentially be aware of if you are thinking of purchasing an electric kettle."
"It works and you can see the bubbling, YaY.BUT the pour spout aims all over the place when the water is low so be careful."
I use it to heat my water for tea in the morning. The handles feels a little too bulky for me.
"The pour spout makes it difficult to aim into smaller vessels, so the three stars reflect that frustration with the design"
This was pretty much the cheapest electric kettle available.  My only criticisms are that1) the plastic tang that turns it on/off is very flimsy and too long which makes it likely to break long term.2) this unit boils for way too long.  It doesn't shut off until the water has been rapidly boiling for a good 30-40 seconds which is very energy inefficient.You get what you pay for
"It's a magnificent product at first and being made of borosilicate glass contributes to decreasing chances of toxins entering the tea during brewing.  This kettle was on many best, non-toxic kettle liats.  So easy your daily tea becomes an adventure in steeping.  About 2.5 months in after 2x/day use with the diffuser, the plastic diffuser locking mechanism built into the lid snapped preventing correct use of diffuser.  Contacted Chefman and they wanted a video, which in the original warrsnty request was optional and you know they get a TON of this issue due to the wimpy construction.  As everyone knows it's not always simple sending videos due size limitations on various email servers.  While trying to figure out how to compress video my morning tea leaked all over the counter from the bottom of the kettle.  I lost about half the liquid.  It's beyond Amazon returns time but I am pursuing replacement through Chefman.  Will update once complete.  Will try a different kettle in meantime."
"The kettle is good, but has a smell. Water smells too a little bit"
"Overall, I guess I'm happy with this kettle but I wanted one with the pretty blue light and the one I received has a green light instead. I can live with that but I don't like how it has all the measurements in metric and the thing that disappoints me the most is that the 1 hour auto keep warm feature is useless because it automatically shuts off once the kettle is lifted from its base! (Wow, that is really stupid.) If the Amazon description had mentioned this, I would not have purchased this one.... but returning stuff is such a pain. It makes good tea so that is the main point but I am disappointed. So, if I'm having people over for tea, the minute I serve one cup of tea, the water will start to get cold anyway, just as if it had NO keep warm feature at all! The keep warm feature will only be useful if I am waiting to serve ANY tea at all. That is such a HUGE design flaw!"
"Good appearance but stopped working, ( bad switch??) at about 1 year but company replaced it as it came with a 2 year warranty.The customer service was great.The blue light while operating is a nice touch"
"The kettle functions well. However, I don't like that the lid is not attached. You have to remove it completely to add water. Also, where the tea infuser attaches to the base started to rust shortly after purchase."
Lately things I have been ordering on Amazon have been coming in a used condition. This tea kettle should have been in pristine condition but instead I got it covered in oily finger prints and looking like it was just taken out of a dirty dishwasher. Really disappointing because my last one came in fine condition and we loved it until it broke bc I inadvertently hit it in the wrong way when putting a pan down next to it. It works well and get the job done without a ton of noise. I want to give this 4 stars at least but can’t see past the filth.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I’m returning because it’s damaged at the base.  It will be on top of my counter, I want it to look nice."
"The kettle is unreliable as the auto shut off fails to work.  The kettle will keep on boiling and the cord will start to get hotter than it should.  You definitely  do not want to leave it unattended.  I contacted the company for product support and sent them the requested info… proof of purchase, picture of the label, a video of the kettle boiling not  shutting off…and then got ghosted.  It’s not worth the time or energy to pursue.My last electric kettle was a Hamilton Beach that lasted for several years.  This one barely made it 4 months.  I should have gone with my gut and just bought another HB - of which I will do now.  Lesson learned."
"For all intents and purposes, the kettle worked really well. Water boiled quickly. The lid was good. The only problem is that I  started noticing this white rubber material  at the bottom (inside) of the kettle. It started to become uneven, so I poked at it with my finger to press it back into place. The white rubber material started to just crumble apart by just touching it. This must have been slowly flaking off into our water for who knows how long..."
Started leaking in the crease by the spout a month after having it.
I was really thankful that the product wasn’t damaged during shipping. Amazon can do better at making sure there are standards how how items are packaged when shipped. You can see in the picture that the box had opened up then re-taped. Otherwise product works great. Water heated up really quickly and the pot and light turns off once it gets up to temp which I like.
"Love how fast it boils water...My only ""however"" is that the thermostat apparently quit functioning properly (purchased it about 3 months ago), and it boils for the longest time and then may shut off. Typically, I have to manually flip the switch to the ""green"" stay-warm function. I'm sure this is rare  - will likely order a new one after Christmas because it is so inexpensive! Will let you know how that works out!"
"The product is great, but got deliver like this in its original packaging. The box was upside down, completely mangled and thrashed, and was already opened on my porch. We thought it was trash and almost threw it away when we first saw it. Thankfully the product was in perfect condition but the delivery process was pretty awful."
"Sometimes it randomly seems to boil too violently and the fluid inside end up bubbling over onto its base plate and then pools all over the counter. i made sure not fill it up to the max line and it still happens sometimes. so, now i have to watch it the whole time, or run it inside the sink. neither option gets 5 stars. aside from the boil-over problem, it otherwise seems decent. i just wish it would auto shut off a tad sooner."
I like everything about this. Large capacity. Heats quick. Attractive. But I have had it for 6 months now and it smells like burning plastic when it heats up. It is coming from the lid and base.  I do not know what kind of plastic is used but typically non toxic plastic does not smell like that.
But it’s not the best and I still got it but don’t used it too much !
"The kettle works great, it’s exactly what I wanted. But is no one concerned about the P95 Warning sticker on the bottom? After researching a little, I see this is something that California does (I’m in Texas), and I’m sure there are numerous things I come in contact daily that don’t have a sticker on it.The kettle is so easy to use and works fast. I really love it!"
This kettle is great. Heats up water fast. Only one concern is keeping me from giving 5 stars. I cleaned it out and there seems to be a plastic white ring at the bottom on the inside and I can't tell if it is peeling. There are a few whites specs that I can see. The screen filter on the spout is keeping them out of our hot drinks.
It didn't work after one year. Quality is not good.
"I was quite pleased with this little water heating kettle, modest in features as it was.  And then, just yesterday, it started itself up without my touching it and I thought, well, this is strange.  Then today, I went to heat up some water and it just sat there, like a bump on a log.  I flicked the switch a couple of times and one time it went on and then promptly turned off.  Very disappointing as in general, the reviews are positive.  Unfortunately, the return window has closed (just two weeks over the limit) so ... what a waste."
"This was a great electric kettle--it looks great, heated the water to a boil, shut itself off when the water was done and it worked really well-- until it didn't. With that said, I purchased it on 11/23/2023 and one week ago it just stopped working.I've ordered a different brand altogether. I hope it lasts a lot longer than this one."
"I usually just heat 1.5 cups of water for my morning coffee, this requires 2 cups minimum. I also wasn’t able to find and option to keep the water hot."
"It's nice how fast it does get to boiling. BUT it leaks when you pour from it, seems to leak between the glass and the upper plastic bit. So we will have to replace it soon, because it's annoying and makes a mess. I would not buy this kettle or this brand again."
"Overall, I like this tea kettle, but find it heavier than my previous one. Also, the handle is thick & makes it bulky to handle."
"I’m only giving it two stars because we can still get our water hot with it. However, it leaks out of the metal band above the glass body and spills alll over the counter when we go to pour the water, so we have to pour it over the sink.It also will sometimes not turn on at all and we have to move it around on the base and try again until it turns on. Sometimes it will also just turn off on its own in the middle of heating up."
Leaks from the top rim between the silver ring and the glass when I go to pour it. Already threw away the box and such. Imma throw it out and buy another one from wal mart. Gave it atleast 2 stats cause it does heat water fast.
Thus kettle worked fine until one day it just stopped in under year!
The kettle broke within 30 days of purchase. I woke up one morning to make coffee and it didn't work. Bad product. Will never purchase again.
"Just went to unpack and use, like the look etc, but went to pour the water and leaks like a sieve all over the place !"
This kettle operates well however the on off switch is weak and could easily break. I am returning it because that switch is too vulnerable.
The “keep warm” function does not work. Otherwise it is ok.
"This is a sturdy kettle that boils the minimum amount of water in around 3 minutes. It has a removable lid, which makes the kettle easy to clean.  This feature was the reason why the kettle was purchased, however,  it was also the reason why it was returned.  Although it is a great feature, it was impractical and extremely inconvenient."
"Worked great for 9 months. This morning, just won't click on. Checked everything on it, only adults using it, etc. Just broke. Dang."
The pot worked fine for 1 month or so but now it will come on with no water in it without pushing the on switch. Also after reaching temp it will not shut off. And of course it’s just out of the return date. Loved it when it was working but wouldn’t recommend due to shot lived life span.
"I purchased it in July, recently moved to our new home in October and now when warming up water, it leaks through the sides and it sad because I was happy I finally had one!"
Looks great; beautiful design. It is short & round so it was too heavy for me & took up more space than I expected (I didn't take into consideration the weight of the glass.) I can't say anything about quality b/c I didn't use it.
"After using this everyday for 2 months, the lid has developed some rust. It rust too fast."
"I love it! It's a lovely sleek design, and the lights are fun. It seems to take 6-7 minutes from start to a full rolling boil. Perhaps it's just my unit? Either way, I love it....but detest exaggerated claims."
"It's louder than I expected it to be but worked well. The top seal is now leaking water when it's poured. There doesn't seem to be a way to easily fix it, so it's probably just trash. I wouldn't recommend getting this if you want something that lasts or isn't super loud."
"This kettle looks nice, boils water quickly, and has a high capacity, so I want to like it. But, there is a sensor inside the kettle on the bottom that rusted almost immediately. I'm slightly concerned because every time I make hot water now, it is exposed to the rusted, corroded part."
"Got this to use with my French press.  Only need 4 cups but this thing holds nearly 2 liters of water. It heats up faster than any other method I've used to boil water in my life. It's efficient. It's fast. It's for a high capacity. The lid stays on. It was only 21 bucks so the price is hard to beat. It's sturdy and doesn't wobble on the power base. Easy to remove pitcher from power base and attaches with no effort.Safety first:Make sure the pitcher is on the base before plugging it in because the power switch is on the pot and the base is a live electrical connection with no power control and can only be used safely when the pitcher sits directly on the electrical connection. And keep your kids and pets away from this device and you'll will love it.***I've used this pot to boil water about 15 times at the most. I noticed particles in the water once it cooled down. After inspecting it, I discovered that the steel pan that heats the water is peeling off! The painted the inside of this device to look like steel and now it's peeling off. This cannot be healthy to me and other consumers and the manufacturer needs to be held accountable.***"
"This is a nice kettle because it boils water quickly. I was impressed by its speed of boiling. However, there's a silver band at the top, and it has started leaking where that band meets the glass. I've never filled it to the max level. I use it a lot, at least twice a day because I like tea. I wanted to give it a better review because it's nice looking and boils quickly."
This works fine but slow to get boiling.
"Nice kettle , cool design. However, there is a strong taste of plastic in the water after boiling. I discarded the water first couple times and was expecting the plastic taste gone. But it’s still there which strongly disappointed me"
"Very attractive and efficient . .. . EXCEPT After second use, kettle began leaking around the top of the glass carafe when pouring. Two days later, began leaking around the bottom of the glass. What  ! ?"
"The top rim of this kettle is sealed with rubber caulk sealant! This material is not resistant to the heat tolerances inside of the kettle and leaches into your boiling water! It is an extremely toxic material!Bought this for my wife to make her tea. After a while she developed severe stomach pains. We tried everything we could to work out the issue. Until what I noticed when cleaning the kettle… What I originally thought was typical limescale build up turned out to be white builders caulk! Which at this point had become so brittle it crumbed as soon as I barely touched it. This harmful material had been leaching into my wife’s tea every morning, essentially poisoning her and we are mortified! This product is extremely harmful, we cannot bare to think of the damage that has been done and the cost of the tests and treatments she will require.We should be seeking legal action fromThe manufacturer, seller and Amazon themselves for letting this product through quality control."
"After the first use, the bottom of the inside kettle began to rust. We noticed calcification build up no matter how much we washed it but that could be from our tap water when we washed it. We always used filtered water when we boiled it. Now because of the calcium build up/ stain and rust on the inside, we only use it to boil water to clean out our cast irons and stopped using it for teas/ coffee French press. Definitely have to look for a new one again but in store instead."
Eventually  with age I would fear the top coming off when pouring because it just pushes in. The inside top I don't like because it has a ridge that could catch anything other than water making it harder to clean.But I'm happy for the price.
"UPDATE: I have gotten zero assistance or acknowledgement from Amazon or Chefman regarding this issue. This is a faulty product - they know it and they don't care apparently. Do not purchase.I didn't open the package for a while, as my old kettle was still eking along and I'm allergic to throwing things away when they still have some use left. I opened this up two weeks ago, and have used it in line with the instructions. ALREADY the glue connecting the glass body to the plastic top has started to fail. I didn't notice it at first, until I realised that beads of water were COMING THROUGH THE SEAM as the water was coming to a boil. The kettle was only half full at the time - so this was steam pushing through the seam and condensing on the outside. This means that we were likely getting industrial solvents in our morning tea - UNACCEPTABLE. Don't buy this product. It's probably poisoning you."
"I bought this electric kettle recently. It works alright, boils the water. But the net or sieve in the kettle gets cloudy easily whenever i use it. I have to use pressurized water to clean it well."
"When I inspected the water after just a few boils, hundreds of little plastic chips floating in the water. Despite hands washing multiple times, even more chips break off despite the mesh filter I’m sure it is highly unsafe to consume. Worth the extra few bucks to buy a no plastic contact electric kettle with stainless steel lid and gasket, it isn’t worth ingested a cancerous level of microplastics every time you want coffee. Not sure if I revived a kettle with a defective gasket, but if it’s that easy and common (as noted by some other reviews); wouldn’t trust it."
"I loved the kettle when I bought it and think the light on the bottom is great.  However, this kettle leaks horribly. I wish I could return it..."
"Personally, it does not have the features that my last kettle had and I plan to return it. There’s nothing “wrong” with it but I’m used to a kettle that keeps the water warm, boils at different temperatures depending on what tea type, and a lid that pops up."
Lid opening is not convinient and may get lost or displaced
"Product was being used to make tea, while it's quick to brew it did start to leak after about the 5th use"
Here I was loving this kettle and then it started to leak. I'm very annoyed because the window for returning it is closed. Don't buy it ! Too much money to waste on something that doesn't hold it's value or water.
Short circuited about 2 mos after buying. Not worth the money
"Be aware, the boil-dry protection doesn’t prevent anything from boiling “over”. It has to be continuously watched or it boils over each and every time I use it. It then kicks itself off with the auto shutoff, but the mess is always sitting there all over our countertops and lower cabinets and floor to clean up.Pro: It boils pretty quickly."
"This is a simple machine. The only thing that this machine should be doing is boiling water, letting us know when it’s hot, letting us know when to use and to turn off when it’s done boiling.  Second day of Use and the light Doesn’t work, which is on the handle and smells like plastic after use. Pay more for a better product."
"This thing turns on by itself and the auto shut off did not work. If I look on the inside, it started melting the plastic so hopefully none of that has been getting into the water. Very unsatisfied customer. We had to unplug it when we were done using it otherwise it would randomly turn on itself"
"It is a terrible kettle. It leaks through the union between the glass and the metallic border when pouring water. If it wasn't because I don't have time, I will definitely return it . Not worth the money."
"The tea pot stopped working in two months. Just dead one morning - imagine waking up, dark outside, you want to make your coffee or tea, and nope. Super bummer. So we did the trouble shooting steps. Still nope. So we applied for a replacement or refund. THAT process requires taking video of the trouble shooting process and writing a bunch of stuff, so I thought, ""Well, at least this will speed along the process!"" During the 30 minutes of my life that took. NOPE. It takes them a few days to ""review"" and THEN... you get to mail it back to see if they'll do something. All this time, you're without a tea pot. So, surprise of surprises, we bought another one. And THEN it's a big rigamarole (2 days each email back and forth) to get a refund instead of replacement). A month later we finally have a refund. What a crock. The Chefman tea pot we bought before this lasted only a year, so just plan on it being disposable."
"I bought this one to replace a kettle that had slowed down after a few years.  This one worked great for a couple of months, now it's getting slower and slower.  try a different one."
Received this product in damaged packaging. Product itself was damaged as well. Looked like a good item but unfortunately it has a cracked Handle and did not work . Unable to return product as it was sent overseas and is too costly to return.Update:Finally was able to connect with someone at Amazon and received a full refund for damaged product. We were not able to process through our orders due to the fact the product could not be physically returned as it was sent overseas. Return would have cost more than the physical product. Amazon representative was very helpful in processing our refund.
I liked it but it did not even last a year. Getting different brand.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Leak starts at the top side. Used it 3-4x since i bought it. Dont know if its still eligible to return. Its nice boils really fast but disappointing that it leaks.
This product works well but I love my tea warm and this doesn’t have a keep it warm setting sadly
"From the reviews, I expected this kettle to be fine. I needed a new one because the last 2 I’ve had (Hamilton Beach) have died very quickly with no warning.Well, this Chefman kettle hasn’t died. But it leaks every single time you pour water into your cup or teapot. Each and every time I use it, every day, I have to stand back, make sure there are no cats or dogs in the vicinity, and then pour, over the sink. Scalding water will come dripping out, heavily, every time.I can’t be bothered to try to figure out why, because a tea kettle simply shouldn’t do this and I have intention of trying to somehow “fix” it. It shouldn’t be “broken” in the first place.So, I will be purchasing a new kettle sometime soon, but it won’t be a Hamilton Beach or a Chefman."
"It worked well, but I went back to the regular Keurig maker"
"The product looks great however its safety is non existent! In its very first use, at the moment right before it reach its shut off where the water is at its hottest the glass kettle shattered nearly scalding my legs and hands as it started to explode on my counter. Literally bought it and decided to use it and the very first time it’s used it nearly gives me third degree burns. So I’d say most definitely not worth its money. And the company is avoiding customers when you call their number they say sorry we are training please refer to support online only. And let me tell you they don’t make it easy to do so there either. They make you choose model number for what you bought and if yours isn’t in the list then it sends you into troubleshooting with no resolve. So I basically threw my money away and nearly got severely burned and hurt by this companies faulty and dangerous product that they have released to the public market it’s unconscionable."
Loved everything but how loud it was.
"Research p65warnings.com for more info. I’m sending mine back. I was happy with my purchase until I turned the unit over and noticed the warning label. You must read the web page listed here, but this label doesn’t say “risk” of cancer and reproductive harm..:it simply says “cancer and reproductive harm”…because they are 100% certain materials used cause cancer. I know some people won’t mind and will still buy it, but, i just want people to be aware and make an informed purchase."
"nice tea kettle.  however, the lid is not attached to the pot.  it’s already been lost a couple of times as i keep it off the kettle so the inside should thoroughly dry.  and with that, it doesn’t totally dry as the water doesn’t evaporate quickly.  another problem is that it doesn’t ring or ding or anything to tell me the water had come to a boil.  sometimes, i’m busy and unless i hear a bell, i’ll keep reboiling the water again and again to get my cup of tea.  pain in the neck."
The kettle started leaking from the bottom when pouring the water out of the kettle.  I have to use a towel under it when I pour the water because it leaks so much that the puddle on the counter begins to drip onto the floor. Try the Meuller kettle.  We still have one from six years ago in my mother‘s house.
"I was so hopeful that this would be a great product because of the good reviews, but I must have received a defective one. This leaked out the bottom and all over the warming plate, my counter and the floor when I picked it up. Fortunately, I was able to unplug it quickly and did not get burned by the hot water when it leaked everywhere. This is a huge safety issue. Will be returning!"
The kettle started leaking after so many uses. Not too happy.
"I anxiously received this kettle, only to find it defective.  Yes, it boiled quickly, but to the extent of spewing boiling water everywhere.and never moving to the keep warm setting. I contacted the company.  While chats were professional and amiable, they insisted upon too many have to's to fulfil their insurance company requirements:  Pictures of base and bottom of pot and a full video showing the item from start to finish when started - though I didn't purchase the insurance!  Only speculation, but believe I was provided an ill-functioning item to begin with and they stand firm on no return or replacement unless I go through the hoops requested - though they state free returns.  I'm old and technologically changelled, which I did express to them, but fell on deaf ears.  They truly have no true care for their image, customers or reputation."
"I have been using this kettle for months now and clean it every now and than, I started to notice the the bottom where the plastic white ring is, I think is the light but I started to noticed around it, it started to have black little things around it and I don’t know if it’s from the glue they used in there? But what a waste now I don’t want to use it anymore…"
This kettle worked very well until it stopped yesterday after only seven months. I don’t recommend it. I will now buy the Amazon basics kettle.
"i bought the kettle with the thought of using the infuser once in awhile.  So I tried to remove it and it didn't budge.  I cut my finger very deeply on the surrounding metal.  Finally after thinking about it for a few weeks and allowing the gash to heal, I used a pot holder to hold onto the infuser and turn it til it released from the lid.  So be very careful and maybe use some cloth or clean dishrag or a gripper to help you get the infuser out or to put it back in.  Otherwise I guess it works ok."
"When I received this kettle it worked perfectly.  It boiled water quickly and didn't leak.  But after 2 months of daily use it developed a small leak.  At 5 month,  more water leaks out of the kettle than I can pour into my cup.  Whatever bonds the glass body to the metal rim at the top has has failed and now leaks boiling water."
"I'veHad other electric kettles , and this one is very heavy and awkward. No tea diffuser. No push button lid or pour spot. I should have spent the xtra $7-10 dollars  for a better user friendlyproduct"
"I really liked this electric kettle, especially the feature that lets you keep water hot. Unfortunately, after 2 years of daily use, this feature is no longer working (or I should say I am unable to turn it off). I now have to keep the kettle off the base after use or else it will continually heat up, which is a bit of a safety concern. Looking for another brand now."
"While the Cuisinart 1.7 Tea kettle worked very well, I did not like the fact that there is black plastic piece down inside the front of the spout where a removable filter sits. This black plastic part does come into contact with the water when boiling, something I did not want in a tea kettle. Also the lid top opening where you fill for water is small and if you like to clean your kettle by hand you would need a child's hand to get into it."
"Overall this kettle is well made and sturdy. I paid a premium for this thing because I want it to last for years, which to be fair I expect it to.So why only three stars? Because it's SOOO frustrating. It has multiple settings for different temperatures of water. Handy, right? Making green tea? Use that setting. Set it to boil, and it will boil like a champ. Until it randomly forgets what setting you set it to, and Cuisinart inexplicably made the default setting 160f (the coldest possible). Why not set boiling as the default when that's what 99.9% of the time most users will want?The other setting is ""Keep Warm"", or as I call it ""Poltergeist Mode"". It just keeps turning itself on to keep the water at temperature, which is a colossal waste of energy. And again, the default setting for this mostly useless and electricity-hogging feature is ON instead of OFF.The upshot is that three or four times a week the damn thing's goldfish memory strikes and I have to reset it to boil and non-haunted mode. It might not sound like much, but it gets really old, really fast. And all this user frustration could have been easily avoided by sensible design choices. Avoid."
"Purchased this March 2022.  In September 2024, the sensor that detects when the pot is boiling started failing, and twice we caught it boiled dry and had to dump it. An expensive purchase for two and a half years of service!During its short life, my wife really appreciated the different temperature settings.  However, it had a few nagging issues even when working.  The 'keep warm' button is on by default, so the kettle repeatedly heats itself after you've poured your drink.  And it defaulted to the lowest heat setting after being off its base for a minute or more.  Meaning that I usually had to press three buttons 'Start' 'Boil', and 'Keep Warm' (the latter to turn it off, not to turn it on) just to get a cup of boiling water.  Finally, it seemed to have real trouble pouring the last bit of water - would get stuck somehow in the base of the kettle.  We're replacing it with something with a more classic and hopefully robust design."
"Just below the pour spot is a protrusion on plastic of about 5/8"" that blocks water from leaving the pot when there is about 1 to 1/2 cups of water left. when you tip the pot too pour the water backs up behind this piece of plastic until you tip the pot way up which then cause a bunch of water to rush out onto the counter. It works as advertised but I would not buy this again."
"I received this as a gift for my birthday from my family, and I really love all the settings, and it is not as quiet as I thought it would be, but it’s not super loud and it does boil the water so quickly that the loudness is over really fast anyway. The only thing is, it is a little awkward to fill, and you have to fill it to the max line, if you go over the max line, it won’t even start the process of boiling, it will just blink at you. As long as you don’t go above, the max fill line, it will work perfectly. Also,  when you click the warm button, it will keep it warm for about an hour, and then it will shut itself off. I’m not thrilled about that, I’d rather it keep it warm until I turn it off manually. It was a little bit of a learning curve to figure out how to get it to work, because it is quiet when it first starts out boiling, and then gets loud. So, at first, I was pushing buttons all over the place trying to get it to work, and then realize that it was working. It was just too quiet for me to hear it. And then gets really loud, and then shut off quickly. it’s also difficult to fill, and it’s very heavy. So it gets even heavier when you fill it with water. If anybody were to get this, who has arthritis, or joint problems with the wrists, or weak arms, I would not recommend this one. Are used to be able to fill up my electric kettle with just one hand, I have to use both hands, and I’m not a weakling, but I do have wrists that sometimes ache. So, I have to use two hands to fill up this kettle. Overall though, it works very very well, I’m excited to have something new and I am hoping with the price, my family paid for this, and the brand, that it will last a very long time. My old kettle was around for many years before I finally broke down, and it was very simple, only had one setting, which was to boil, but it works just fine for me, and it was very light weight. However, they don’t make it anymore. But I’m happy with this one overall.Update: I was reaching past the kettle the day before last and my arm barely touched it and got a third degree burn. The app won’t let me share the fresh pics but I took a pic of the scar now. I’ve touched hot kettles before by accident but none ever burned me like this. There should be a caution sticker or imprint or really a temp regulator for the outside. I am shocked, honestly."
"I have had this kettle a few years, so maybe it is just old, but it no longer turns off, but keeps boiling water even when I switch it off. I have to unplug it to get it to cool down. Not great."
"This is a wonderful product, but so difficult to get inside the walls of the kettle to clean it. So for me it doesn’t work. I also wanted a kettle with an infuser and this one didn’t have one. Also be careful don’t double boil, it will spill out and burn everything on your countertop. It’s a no for me."
We use this every day. Most people do. It worked for only 2 years?! I am going to look into what brands the Brits use.
"I purchased this product over a decade ago it worked wonderfully the entire time until it didn't. Purchase this is a replacement it's the exact same product however immediately upon opening and using the lid isn't functioning very well, this product was on sale when I purchased it these might be faulty ones."
"Purchased one of these around 6 years ago and used the heck out of it. It saw daily use with multiple rounds of tea/coffee/cocoa etc. Solid machine that stopped working, possibly after I boiled water at a level below the recommended amount. There was no question we'd get another. The build quality on the new machine feels cheaper; the lid rattles and there's loud clicking noises when you change temp settings. Its heating the water so it gets 3 stars, but I feel like I should have tried something else."
"This unit functions great, however I am disappointed in the points of contact the boiling water will have with plastic.  There is no way to fully remove the spout filter, only the fine screen.  The lid is metal for show but seals to the inside with a plastic face. Even part of the temperature sensor appears to be plastic."
"Unable to pour slowly for pour over coffee, get a bonavita instead.Built up limscale on lid and bottom which was impossible to get off. Temperature settings wore off on buttons after about a year. Not idea."
"1. temperature control settings are questionable. I make Americanos and the coffee setting is WAY too hot. So is 200 for that matter. I finally settle on 190 degrees so that I could actually drink my Americano without scalding my mouth.2. the pot is WAY WAY too heavy and I'm not a weakling. But I don't have right neck pain so I try to use my left arm to pour if 1/2 or more full. Can't imagine an elderly person or really anyone without much arm strength comfortable using this. I'm quite strong despite my neck pain. I just prefer not to aggravate it and this pot definitely does!3. pour spout is OBNOXIOUS. If pot is very full then it's very challenging to control the flow as it comes out forcefully. if pot is low filled then it's hard to get water to empty without tilting the bottom 180°.4. lid does not come completely off and opening is small so you won't get even a med size woman's hand inside to clean it.I REALLY wanted to love this kettle as it's my 3rd one. None of them with temp controls so far have been worth the excessive cost. I thoughtly surely Cuisinart will be a winner but nope, worst one yet.Now I'm just gonna buy the cheapo deluxe Chefman and cross my fingers since I've had good experiences with their crock pots. We shall see..."
"This is a great electric kettle for coffee and tea drinkers, probably the best on the market, but my 2nd purchase just died on me. They each lasted approximately 5 years. Eventually they start to leak and then will not heat anymore. For $100, I’m not going to bother with another 5-year lifespan. I’d rather pay $20 for something with less bells and whistles and then I won’t care if it breaks after a couple years."
"I bought this based on the recommendation of Wirecutter which appears in the new York Times website. I had dropped (and broke) my very inexpensive basic Hamilton Beach water boiler. Rather than just buying the same unit, I researched and chose this recommended unit, based on the temperature control features.After using the Cuisinart unit, I discovered the following issues:1. the water dribbles and pours out of the spout inconsistently. The is due to the design of the spout which has a screen and plastic ribs on the inside. I find this to be a huge omission buy the Wirecutter testing team. How did they not see this?2. I found the unit heavy and difficult to pour due to all the electronics in the handle.3. I thought that having different water temperatures is a nice feature, and if you drink a lot of tea, I guess it's beneficial, but in my case, all those added electronics in the handle made lifting it clumsy and heavy (and my palette is not that sophisticated).4. Even though the product states that is has ""free returns"", the Amazon seller tried to charge return shipping. I had to ask Amazon to intervene, and eventually theseller  agreed to pay for the return shipping, but said they would be charging a ""restocking"" fee which would be at least 15%, and could be as much as the entire cost of the unit, if it had been used and not returned in the original box. I appealed to Amazon to assist, but they declined and said that I had not contacted them within the correct time frame for a return (I had)., but left no other option, so I have the unit sitting on a shelf in the pantry. Oh well, live and learn.Moral of the story: Buy from a local retailer such as target where returning an item is easy and a no-hassle event"
"I am comparing this to my Braun (German-made) electric kettle, which stopped working after 20 years.  Braun no longer makes an electric kettle for America.  First, the design.  The window for seeing how much water is in, is under the handle.  This makes it difficult to see, as your hand is there.  The Braun had 2 windows, one on the left, and one on the right, so  you can easily see as you fill it how much water you are putting in. Second, The Braun had a filter in the spout that prevented anything other than water from pouring out of the kettle; for instance, calcium deposits from hard water.  I have hard water,  and this means I have to clean the Cuisinart more often than I did the Braun. Third, you have to have at least half a liter in the Cuisinart, whereas I only had to have 6 ounces in the Braun.  I make a 12 oz. coffee in the morning, dripping directly into my mug, so I have to eyeball the level in my mug.  These things might not matter to you, and maybe Cuisinart has a more expensive electric kettle with these features corrected.  On the plus side, I can program the Cuisenart to keep the water warm."
"This electric kettle is pretty good but not great.  It was also not cheap.  My old one wore out after a few years; I hope this one doesn't.  What doesn't work well?  The buttons are on the back of the handle, harder to reach than on my old kettle where the buttons are on the side.  having buttons where you hold the kettle makes the kettle more awkward to use.  When you put your kettle back on the power source (stand) after using, if it is dry it lights up because it overheats and then you have to unplug it until it cools and press start for a long time for it to reset.  My old one turned off when I took it off the stand.  So that was convenient and what I was used to. And this one was much more expensive than my other, off brand kettle.  I just hope it lasts a long time; the other one lasted a few years and then just died.  I have only had this one a few months."
"I had a simple glass kettle for years, until I dropped it a few weeks ago. I thought I would ""upgrade"" to this highly-rated version, but I wish I had stuck with my original.  Here's why:1.  This things beeps so so much.  Beeps when you turn it on, beeps when it reaches temperature.2.  It's hard to see the water level through the little window by the handle.  I'm always boiling more water than I need.3.  Most frustrating is the actual use.  So many buttons, and it's been annoying to figure out which to press and when (and I promise I'm not an idiot - PHD and all).  But for some reason, Cuisinart decided to make boiling water a multi-button-press process.  And when you return the kettle to the stand after pouring your hot water, it sometimes, but not always, reverts to heating the water again!  I'm sure there's a way around that, but I'm sure also that I have more than enough to do without trying to mind-meld with the designers to figure out their intended use process.If I weren't so cheap, I would just toss this thing and get my original simple, ""click here to boil water"" version.  But if you think you're getting more by paying more, that's just not true in this case."
"Inside is Hard to clean. There's plastics at spout, think it could be toxic? Functions are good."
"I’ve used two of these kettles now, and have always been very happy with the functionality, but unfortunately both reached the end of their lifespans in the same way: First, the spring-loaded mechanism in the lid failed, so that it stopped popping up when opened, and you’d have to open it manually with your hands or a utensil. More worryingly, both kettles started leaking water all over their electrical base/mount. So, unfortunately I can’t really recommend it as it seems to become dangerous with age.It does seem like the lid consistently fails before the leaking starts, so if you’re determined to get it, I might recommend treating the lid failure as a sign that it’s time to replace the kettle, because at that point, it’s only a matter of time before the leaking starts."
"I just bought my second one of these kettles after the lid mechanism on the first one fell apart after about five years, which is a bit disappointing considering the price. I'm hoping it's a bit of a one off, but upon taking out the lid mechanism of the old one I saw so much plastic that I was not surprised a couple of those hinge parts eventually broke with the constant heating/cooling cycles.It still blows my mind that manufacturers will not use more metal parts instead of plastic in such critical areas. The hinge arms of the lid are metal, the hinge pin is metal, and the springs are metal, but those metal parts rotate on/in plastic and are held in place by plastic (the lid broke because one hinge pin holder fractured and one hinge pin retainer fell off). It would be so easy to make those key structural parts of the hinge mechanism metal as well and would probably cost pennies to do so. I've kept the old kettle and might try to re-engineer the lid mechanism myself because the rest of the old kettle still works fine."
"When this kettle works, it's great. The features are great. But an important part of a product is reliability, and when a product fails, whether the company stands behind the product and is easy to work with on replacement/repair is essential. On that count, Cuisinart fails big-time.My kettle stopped working about 3 weeks ago. After pressing the START button, it would appear to be working for about a minute, would beep four times - not the three beeps you expect when it reaches temp - and then shut off (all lights go out). So, being well within the 3 yr. warranty, (and living in Calif., where we don't need to pay for shipping to return an item for warranty repair/replacement), I called the toll-free number in the instruction booklet.After going through the regular script of ""did you check this, did you do that?"" we got around to returning my unit to them and getting a replacement sent to me. Well, the replacement is on ""back-order""... Amazon and everywhere else has them in stock, but Cuisinart doesn't, and they can't tell me when they might be getting them back in stock. Okay. So we move on to returning the dead unit to them.They wanted to issue a call tag for UPS to show up at my door at some random time on some random day (totally not going to work for me), so I asked instead to have a label emailed to me so I could drop it off at a UPS Store which is more convenient. Sure. They take down and we confirm all my info over the phone. I was told they ""would send an email."" Great. (No mention of how long it might take to get the email, but I'm assuming a few hours. This is 2014, after all.)After 3 days, no email. I called again. They asked if I'd checked my spam folder. Yup, done it already, not there. They said they'd sent it, but would send it again. Waited 6 days this time. Still nothing.Called again. Same routine. Still nothing.Called this morning. Was told I should allow 3-5 business days for the email to go out... was told that previous reps had ""lied to me"" (exact words) about how long it might take to set up the service tag, send out emails, etc. That even 3-5 business days was a little too optimistic.I told them I had gone through this several times already, and asked to speak to a manager... well, they put me on hold for several minutes and come back and inform me that's going to be impossible, the ""the person who knows how to do that"" has just stepped out. They're (supposedly) sending an email in 3-5 business days hence (saying it was impossible to put a rush on it or push it through whatever incredibly stupid system they've created).So, here I am, waiting (as I have for the past 3 weeks) for them to do whatever it is that they do that takes 3-5 business days to send out an email, thinking that this time will be different. I know that fits the definition of insanity, but that's what happens when you deal with Cuisinart warranty service. They will drive you insane. And you're stuck with a broken appliance and very little hope of ever getting it replaced. And when it is replaced, after a few months, will I be faced with this frustration all over again?So, yeah. One star ... it would be zero if that were possible.UPDATE (6/18/2014): Just hours after submitting the above, UPS delivered the replacement. The replacement kettle that just this morning, when I was on the phone with Cuisinart customer service, was ""still on back-order/out-of-stock"". Astounding, the technological ineptitude which this company displays. They have no idea what's what going on or how to do the simplest ""customer service"" things. The replacement unit appears to be actually ""new"" but it does also appear to be less carefully made than its predecessor... comparing them side-by-side, there are a number of fairly rough/sharp spots on the inner part of the new handle (poor plastic molding or lack of finishing work), the new buttons look cheaper (almost like they're going to fall off), etc. I've fired it up and it appears to work okay. So, now, I'll wait a few days to see if they ever get around to sending me an email with a label for UPS, and make sure this replacement isn't a total dud. And then call. And then, when they start to inform me once again that the replacement is ""still on back-order/out-of-stock"", I'll correct them. Someday, I'll get a return label... maybe. And then they'll get their defective product back. At some point, however, I will give up on this process, as I've long ago given up on Cuisinart as a brand... because they've wasted much too much of my time."
"This kettle is probably great if you don't mind the features our previous (Frigidaire- no longer available) kettle had that we miss. First- we want to see the temperature in the kettle in real time. I use it for hot water bottles, mixing pet food, and many other applications for which it doesn't need to be at a specific temperature, but for which I want to know what the temp is RIGHT NOW. It seems that is not a common feature in kettles today. Madness!Secondly, the pour: you either get a little trickle (what you want for tea, I guess), or a great gush if you tilt the kettle more. Neither serve the purposes for which we use our hot water.Finally: the kettle does not turn off once you have used it for the reason you heated the water. It goes right back to reheating it. No thanks! I will tell you to do that if I want you to (and this is with the keep warm button off!).The world does not need hundreds of kettles specifically made for tea. The perfect kettle would show the water level and the temperature in real time, and let me set the temperature I want in small increments."
"I was excited to have a kettle with all the preset temperatures and keep warm function and all the things it does; i bought it  march 2024 and in September 2024 it started to leak out of the bottom.  Since it probably isn't a good idea to plug in a leaky kettle to an electric outlet i had to throw it away. i bought a Brentwood stainless steel kettle for $28.99  in 2016 and it still works great - it just doesn't have all the preset temps, but it is much more reliable and quieter.  First time i have had a bad experience with Cuisinart. This kettle disappoints and is not worth the price.  I could buy 3 of the Brentwoods for the same price."
Have had it for a month. It heats up well. But the spout with filter causes water to come in more than one stream. For the price the spout design is poor. Have had better spout designs for lesser money kettles.
"This was actually a really great kettle... for eleven months. Then it became convinced that it was empty no matter what the water level was, and the 'boil dry' protection function began kicking in. Sometimes after it was almost boiling, and other times after it operates for a few seconds. It now does it all the time and I am shopping for a competitor product.Very disappointing, because, as I said, for eleven months it was the best electric kettle I ever owned. And I have a lot of other cuisinart products which I am happy with, although they don't get the multiple uses per day of an electric kettle."
Had lots of great reviews.  The on/off button got stuck two weeks after purchase.  Returned
"I bought this after reading several glowing review. For the price, it's a disappointment. On the plus side, it heats quickly, and the various temperature options are nice. However, fit and finish aren't really premium. The flip top, while sealing reasonably well, doesn't align perfectly with the body. The metal body shows every little stain, so unless you are the type of person who wipes down every device daily, don't expect the kettle to look as pretty as in the pictures. The electronic system is not intuitive at all and every once in a while, it will decide to reset itself to make 160 degree water instead of boiling. Worst of all is the aggressive beeping, which can't be disabled. Not sure about you, but the last thing I need in the morning is a kettle that beeps at me like a commercial oven at Subway. As far as I can see, the only way to get rid of the noise is to kill sever the connection to the beeper.I'll keep using the Cuisinart because I have it, but I miss my simple $30 Amazon Basics kettle."
"My previous water kettle's lid no longer lifted on its own so I decided to buy a more expensive one hoping it would be better quality. The kettle itself is sturdy and the settings can be nice if you need it, but the pouring is awful. When I pour the hot water, the water splits into multiple streams and it's very hard precisely pour into my thin bottle. I have spilled the hot water multiple times because of this :("
"Let me say first this is the second time I have bought this product, I like its options and they work well, the first time it lasted more than 10 years - the first version I bought was the Stainless Steel Option.This time I paid $16.60 above the cost of the Stainless Steel version for the Brushed Graphite Gray version.  The photographs and the description on Amazon fail to show/mention that the Brushed Graphite Gray version still has a Silver Lid, Handle and Base.  This make the item look as if it has been made up of spare parts.The pictures of the Brushed Graphite Gray version are taken with a shadow and that distorts the color of the handle and lid.  Making it look like those two parts are also colored Brushed Graphite Gray.BUY THE STAINLESS STEEL OPTION - the variation colors still have a lot of silver in them."
"In 2015, I purchased a De'Longhi electric kettle. After 8 years, it stopped working. As that particular kettle wasn't available anymore, I read some reviews and decided on a Cuisinart.  In April 2023, I order a more basic version of this Cuisinart kettle - with  an on button at the base (and no differing temperature settings). That worked until July (3 months), when it wouldn't turn on anymore. I was able to exchange it for a new one, figuring mine was just a lemon. The replacement  lasted about 6 months before it had the exact same problem. past the return date, I purchased a cheap no-name kettle at my local big box store to replace it. It works great but it doesn't hold quite enough water. In May 2024, I decided to get a nicer kettle. After reading reviews on Wirecutter, I decided to take a chance on this Cuisinart, despite my prior experience. The on button was different from my other Cuisinart kettles, so I was hoping this would be an improvement and less likely to fail. At the end of July, not even 3 months after purchasing it, I went to turn it on. The lights were on, the start button was blinking, but it wouldn't heat up. I contacted Amazon and it was just past the return date (by a week!) so they suggested I contact the manufacturer.  After contacting them, they wanted to send me another kettle, but as this was my 3rd Cuisinart kettle to die quickly I declined. I contacted Amazon again to see if I had any recourse. They agreed to take the kettle back, minus an $18 restocking fee. I decided to cut my losses at that point, returned this piece of junk, and purchased a kettle for less than $20.  If the cheap one lasts at least 3 months, it will be a vast improvement over my experience with Cuisinart."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            UPDATE: I am updating this review after discovering a dangerous flaw with this kettle.  The kettle is supposed to shut off automatically when it boils, and it usually does, but every couple of weeks it just doesn't, and just continues to boil, even though all lights are off.  Luckily I've been home every time this has happened, and so I unplugged it to turn it off.  Even lifting it off the base doesn't turn it off, as it just starts boiling again when you put it down.  If it was left like this, the water would all boil away, and since the kettle thinks it's already off, I'm not sure what would happen at that point.  It has a feature that turns it off when there's no water in it, but that works when its on, and I'm not sure if it would work when it thinks it's off.  I reported this to Cuisinart customer service but other than offering me a 20% discount on a new one, didn't seem to be too concerned.I had high hopes for this kettle, as it had some features I wanted, but in usage its not all that great, and the durability is poor.  The first issue was the warning sound it makes when it boils, a critical feature.  Its pretty much inaudible, 3 beeps from a circuit board mounted device that can't even be heard over the boiling water its so quiet.  Since it auto shuts off once boiling, you end up walking over to it to check on it, and then have to restart it and wait for 30 seconds as it reboils.  As well, all the lettering from the buttons wears away within a few weeks, and now my lid has failed, and won't open when I hit the button, so I have to pry it open with my fingernails.  The lid can't be removed for cleaning inside.  There is also some kind of dark stain on the bottom of it even though its only ever had tap water in it.  Not sure what this brown stuff is but given all the other issues, this is not a kettle I would recommend, and now I have to buy another kettle after spending a lot of money on this one.  I have Milwaukee power tools that cost less and have a 5 year warranty, so I'm not sure why Cuisinart can't do a little better."
"UPDATE on NOV 19, 2014.2-star review upgraded to 3-starThe problem with the pour I mentioned in my original review can be somewhat mitigated by completely removing the mesh screen. This improves the pour greatly if your kettle has enough water. However, the last half pint or so of water in the kettle will still pour out in a messy, multi-stream fashion. This is due the the fixtures built into the spout to hold the mesh screen in place. This mesh screen is an example of over-engineering a solution to a little problem that ends up creating a much greater problem. It should be kept simple  - like the Hamilton Beach kettle.My makeshift fix has made this much more usable so I've upgraded the rating from 2 to 3.-----------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW 2-starsI also own this Hamilton Beach 40882E Stainless Steel 7.2-Cup Kettle:http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-40882E-Stainless-7-2-Cup/dp/B004XJWQZQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1415988475&sr=8-3&keywords=electric+kettle+hamiltonThis Cuisinart kettle is better than the Hamilton in three regards:1. The Cuisinart has multiple temperature settings2. The Cuisinart can maintain your water at one of the set temperatures3. The Cuisinart has a nicer closing mechanism (it requires just a light touch)But in every other regard, the Hamilton Beach is superior. Here are a few of the important ones:1. The Hamilton won't burn you if touched by accident. The Cuisinart either is not insulated at all or has poor insulation. Several members of my family (me included) have accidentally burned ourselves when our hands brushed against the Cuisinart. This NEVER happens with the Hamilton. The Cuisinart requires caution that is inconvenient in comparison.2. The Hamilton pours MUCH better. Due to the use of a water screen filter on the spout, the Cuisinart pours miserably. It pours like 5 separate scattering streams of water in different directions when you pour water out. It's incredible that this design flaw somehow got past the product team at Cuisinart because it makes the kettle so hard to pour. The Hamilton has a straight forward, smooth pour that is expected of any Kettle. Cuisinart is just terrible at pouring and can spray water out of your mug accidentally.3. The Hamilton is confusing to use. When you put back the kettle onto the base after pouring out freshly heated water, the background light indicator goes blue. I have no idea what this means and the manual does not describe it either. Neither the ""STart"" nor the ""Keep warm"" button lights go on, so I'm not sure if it's keeping warm, reheating or what. It certainly doesn't look off because the blue light indicator is on. So this forces me to press the ""Start"" button to turn the ""Start"" indicator button on again, and then re-press the ""Start"" button again to shut off ALL the lights. This is the only way I can be certain the kettle is off after use and it's very inconvenient. Granted extra features add complexity, but this is still poorly thought through design that got past the product team.There are more smaller issues but they are not substantial.Hopefully either Cuisinart or a competitor comes out with an improved version of this soon."
"I bought this as a replacement for my favorite Cuisinart that has been discontinued.  Why I don't know - it was perfect.  All of the features work as advertised.  However, this kettle is very heavy and difficult to pick up when full.  I only use it to boil water, so I have to remember to click off the reheat function.  Otherwise I am wasting electricity.  It also feels like it takes about a minute longer than the previous kettle to boil water.  It could be because the element is not exposed directly to the water.  This may prevent scaling in the long run.  I end up just heating a liter at a time if I am in a hurry to make coffee.  I'll be looking for a lighter kettle and would not purchase again."
"NONE of ANY manufacturer's offerings of Electric Kettles are worth cr-p, and this one this Cuisinart is no exception.  They ALL are designed to fail in a year or two.  Lid failures are number one (and this one has a fancy pop up lid); base failure/connectivity are number two (it looks like Cuisinart made the center post on the base higher for this reason, and this could be a ""plus"" for longevity).  Problem is there's other stuff:  The pour spout being quite wide at the tip, combined with an unusual ""lip"" or ""baffle"" inside the vessel makes pouring erratic and uninspiring.  In fact, when the vessel is about half full, it can commence pouring quickly and with considerable volume with the slightest tip. Not something I like when I'm pouring water over coffee grounds in my single serve coffee filter (it sloshes).  The large diameter handle is also cumbersome.  The temp selections work well for now, but I have to wonder how long the contacts inside these will last.  Seriously, all these kettles are junk, that are DESIGNED to break, but some are better than others (for awhile).  For $100 Cuisinart could have put one of their better engineers on this; clearly they did not."
"This is a good looking pot and the kettle produces a great amount of heat in a short time. It is really convenient that you have many preset temperatures that you can choose from. The kettle looks sleek and is easy to clean. However, it is hard to see the amount of water in the kettle as the clear part is small and somewhat opaque. My biggest complaint is the product is dangerous to have the kettle automatically keep the water warm. There is no option to have the warmer on or not, so the kettle will continuously try to heat the water even if there is nothing in the kettle. This is a major downfall since there are not any clear safety features to ensure the kettle turns off when it is done heating."
"This kettle is very disappointing. Leaks from the top part of the pouring spout when low water level.I did thorough research before buying a new kettle to replace my 5-year-old amazon basic kettle.I looked for 3 main features: fast heat up, temperature control, and elegant looks. In addition, I was looking for a stainless steel kettle to avoid the plastic odor.Most kettles with temp control look very rough so I decided to purchase the Cuisinart.THERE ARE SO MANY BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS KETTLE so it is hard to pick the one to start with.1. It is very slow in boiling and noisy. My amazon basic kettle has the same efficiency.2. It leaks from the top part of the pouring spout when low water level.3. The kettle body is hot.4. The blue light is annoying especially because it doesn't turn off when the boiling is done. It takes a couple of minutes for the light to fade away.5. The ""stay warm"" button is on as a default, so you have to turn it off actively, otherwise it will continue to perform rounds of heating indefinitely.6. It beeps like a body thermometer!Good things:1. No odor2. Looks OK, but still not elegant.The bottom line,  I would not buy this kettle for that price with all the listed bad features. The real problem is that there is no good alternative. Probably I would go for something cheaper with fewer expectations."
"This electric kettle is pretty good, but it's definitely not my favorite. My old electric kettle was all tempered glass and, in my mind, perfect. This works well, but I don't like that I can't easily clean it or even see if it's built up scale deposits. In addition, if put back on the heating element with too low of water in it, it starts beeping that it's too hot and there are a lot of cracking/snapping sounds. This won't stop until you remove it or unplug it, even if the heating element is off."
I thought all the different temps would be cool but turns out I don't drink that many kinds of tea so kind of a wasteful distraction. Wish I had bought one with simple on/off.  But it works fine otherwise so if you drink a lot of different kinds then you might enjoy.
"I have used this pot quite often since I bought it in Sept 2023. Today I looked inside, not sure why I did, but the inside was disgusting. I am not sure how mold like this formed when I only put water in it and it boils all the time, but there it is. I will be tossing this thing and never buying a non-clear kettle again."
"UPDATE: The kettle still works well but I am very disappointed it is rusting at the spout. Yes, I use it daily but stainless should NOT do this. I've only had this since July, 2024!I am a big hot tea drinker. Love that this keeps the water hot for a bit after pouring my first cup. It also keeps my tea hotter than when I was microwaving."
I’ve had this kettle for a year now. After a few months I noticed spots inside the kettle. Upon further inspection I noticed it was rust spots! I have tried everything to remove them. I wanted to love it. The selection of temperatures is what sold it. But I don’t want to drink rusty water.
"This was an alright kettle, with a sensible selection of temperatures for my teas and coffee.  It heated water in a reasonable time. (I never boil water for tea/coffee so I can't say hew it would fare in such use.)  There was nothing stellar about it but it was fine, it worked well.  It did at times fail to shut off at the right temperature (but would rather boil and then shut off) but this was very rare, so fine.  It was pricey at $70 when I got it.After about two years it broke. It stopped shutting off reliably so that it would just boil sometimes regardless of temperature control and a few times it didn't even seem that it would stop so I had to shut it off.  What finally did it is that it started leaking, nearly every time it's used.  And these were good leaks, the counter would have a little paddle. One can see scale from leaked water all along the edges of the bottom half of the window and handle.  So it started breaking up at the seams, literally.  It is far too early for a product with the prime price to break apart like this after two years, I think.I'd like to add, I didn't abuse it in any way. It was used a few times a day, nearly every day, to warm up water to 175 -- 200, for (green/oolong or black) tea and coffee.But then comes the kicker: the 3-year warranty?  Well yes I presume, but you pay all shipping.  It actually says this loud and clear. Go find the warranty information on this page and click on it and read the page.  (Also, at least one other review talks about it.) So I'd be  paying altogether at least a half of its (then) retail price -- so that they take care of their faulty product.  A little funny isn't it.  Needless to say I'm buying another, and not this brand unfortunately.Altogether, it worked OK (4/5), broke up too early (-1), warranty is misleading unless you actually read it, what most people don't do (-1) -- the fairest I can do is thus 2/5."
"I hesitate to call this kettle ""bad,"" but it's definitely overpriced. As someone who consumes copious amounts of tea on a daily basis but has only ever used really cheap $20 electric kettles, I figured I'd treat myself to something more professional when I made my purchase. While the Cuisinart has a variety of options for different tea types and heats its water very quickly, it also has a lot of shortcomings that have long been resolved by other, cheaper brands.The most obvious design issue is the spout: it is wide, awkward, pours very unevenly. This often results in a lot of wasted water, either left in the bottom of the kettle or spilled on your countertop when you try to completely invert the kettle just to shake the last remaining bits out. And while I appreciate that the kettle with automatically reheat any water left in the pot when it's placed back on the hot plate, it will start the reheating process even if there is nothing left in the vessel, making it somewhat hazardous for first-time users.Overall, I'd say save your money and purchase something much cheaper. Like I said, I've been using cheap $20 kettles my entire life, and I honestly can't tell the difference between the water boiled in those, and the water boiled in this fancy schmancy one."
"1/13/24: Well the new replacement lasted two weeks. It did the same thing the first one did--I emptied it out, put it on the base, hesitated for ONE SECOND and heard a click, and blue lights started flashing and it is no longer usable. Will not stop blinking and flashing. So I am done with this one. Really sad too because I liked the presets. I drink a lot of different kinds of tea so it was so easy to use. Even if they gave me a new one replacement (which I don't know if they would), I would not take it. I need a kettle that won't blow on me after a two weeks.We really like this kettle. We have had other ones (different brands) that didn't last. The day before Christmas Eve, this one, went haywire on us, all lights blinking and it wouldn't work at all.. Naturally this happens after I had replaced my automatic coffee maker with a Large French press that I was planning to use with the convenient boiled water I would get from this kettle. ! I called customer service at Cuisinart and did not expect them to be helpful. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I was just within the warranty replacement window (I think it's 90 days), so they sent me a new one. A brand new one arrived New Year's Eve! Kettle is great for making all kinds of tea and boiled water for coffee or anything else you want it for. I drink a lot of Asian teas and there are very convenient settings for white, green, black, and oolong. Highly recommended.!"
"The lid hinge broke less than a year after my purchase. Contacted Cuisinart for a replacement as this product supposedly has a 3 year warranty. After having me cut the cord of my unit I was asked to send a picture to them showing it was trashed. I never got any confirmation they received the email so a few days later I called them to confirm they were sending me a replacement. After being on hold for an hour, finally a very rude individual picked up and before I could even finish my introductory sentence he cut me off asking for my name and phone number. He said I needed to send them a picture of the disabled unit. I told him I already had and had the proof it was sent right in front of me. He told me to send it again. Awesome! Three days wasted because they don't check their email. I asked if there was any way I could confirm they received it so I didn't have to go through this again. He said I'd receive a tracking number when it ships, that's all. I re-sent, waited another 3 days and called back again to check status having yet to receive a tracking number. Waiting again for only 30 minutes this time.... The representative that answered told me they received me email and I'd need to way 7-10 business days after receiving a tracking number. Tracking number came a few days later so I thought I was good.Package was delivered to my local USPS this morning to be delivered today but they immediately shipped it back to the sender because of an invalid address. Are you kidding me!? I call Cuisinart again and tell them the situation. She ""looks into it"" and comes back announcing another shipment will be sent to me and to expect it in the next 7-10 business days. Um what? I ask her what address they have for me because they clearly screwed up the first time. She reads me back my correct address.So what the hell happened? It dawns on me that they have no intention of replacing my broken unit and are just stringing me along. When this package arrives here in 2 weeks it will miraculously have an incorrect address and will be sent back. I repeat, do not buy this product or anything from Cuisinart. Worst consumer experience I've ever had."
"Very disappointed, a lesson that popular brand like cuisinart doesnt guarantees its product quality. so beware.I see  some rusting inside by the cover."
"Some design flaws with this kettle. It doesn't pour well at all with the filter; water gets caught on a plastic lip on the inside and comes out at the sides if pouring even slightly fast or to empty it. Not comfortable with the amount of plastic in contact with the boiling water. The water level gauge by the handle seemed a little detached at the top and would get foggy/water droplets clinging to inside top of it and I barely used it. Easier just to open the lid real quick to check water level. All that said, it successfully boiled water at varying temps. I ended up returning it for something else though."
"We like it overall. It has a 'keep warm' button which sounds great and ok, works. But after a month there's no rhyme or reason to it and it just stays on every time you make tea until you turn it off manually. Lots of whistles and bells but little effort to make them tell you what they mean or whether they're even functioning properly. Not a great value."
"First one failed at 2 years old - base station dead. Second one, replaced under warranty, failed after 2 years- lid mechanism, kettle can’t be opened. 3 year warranty from Cuisinart clearly not long enough, product quality at this premium price"
"A full-featured and well made product, with the exception that it doesn't do the basics well, which is boiling water and turning off.  When selecting boil, once reaching full boil, it will continue at a rolling boil for 30+ seconds, which is far too long, spewing hot steam until it decides that it's really boiling before turning off."
We use it daily (sometimes more than once a day). It does the job but I wish we can see the temperature of the water like our previous one. A feature I don't like about it is that it's very difficult to see how much water is in it when you are filling it from the sink.
This is a beautiful tea kettle and does heat the water. The problem is the outside of it is extremely hot. I have grandchildren here often and for me this is dangerousness
"We've had this kettle 2 days now and it definitely is superb with regard to heating water to the best temp for the kind of tea you drink. In fact, I can honestly say now that green and white teas are definitely wonderful when brewed at the proper temp - I never would have guessed. However, I have yet to figure out what they mean by ""delicate teas""??Meanwhile, here are the design flaws that bug me and my husband:* The outsides of the kettle get super hot and you can really burn yourself seriously if you accidentally touch the sides once the kettle has boiled. The handle, of course, is fine, but it is easy to brush against the sides of the kettle with your hand.* Another problem with the kettle is the lid for the top opening: if you have boiled water, the lid gets hot like the outer sides of the kettle. This poses a problem if you have run out of water and need to refill -- you pop open the lid with the ""open"" button, fill the kettle, then you have to use your hand to push the lid closed. BUT... the lid may still be hot from the recent boil and you can actually burn your fingertips slightly!!* I find the kettle is weighted poorly when filled with more than 1.25L of water and it can be very difficult to pour - a dangerous problem when pouring hot water.* I personally find the opening at the top of the kettle is a bit too small. I filter my water and fill the kettle from the filter pitcher instead of the faucet. I find the kettle opening is too small to easily pour into from the pitcher, causing water to spill outside the kettle and onto the base (which is not a good idea). I am learning to stop and take careful aim with the pitcher when I fill the kettle - a really annoying inconvenience.* The beeps that sound when the water is ready are very low in volume and barely audible, even if you are standing right next to the counter.So, beware of these problems, esp. the first three items that I noted. As I indicated in the title, the kettle functionality is excellent and I am now getting to enjoy certain teas more than ever. As we have only 2 adults in our household, we can deal with the dangerous problems, but you need to decide if you want to introduce that into your home."
"It heats well. The I like the temperature selections. It is fairly quick.Of our Prior 3 -  two of them stopped heating (one was a warranty replacement within a year), and our last one the lid will not open.A staple in our house and we really like it; hopefully this lasts longer.Also the outside gets hot so only touch the handle, and make sure you don't over fill it.Only 3 stars because they only last a few years."
"Looks the part, but has gone up over $10 in price since we purchased it 17 months ago. I certainly wouldn't get it again. It looks nice, and the blue glow is pleasing enough, but for what it is and seeing people struggle with it, nahhh.It comes down to poor design, not the functionality of being able to change the temperature of water. For an old tea-bag like myself, I have to wonder whether the designers actually ever used it to make something as simple as a cup of tea.Once the kettle has more than a teaspoon of water in it, people tend to hold the handle much higher up due to the displaced weight and the required manipulation, combined with wrist strength when holding it in the middle or lower end. You won't want to hold it near the bottom, it's hot, and that makes for a burny-burny boo-boo.Having over 30 years experience of kettle manipulation for lots of ""cuppas"" (tea), the weight balance is very poor. I can cope, but my wife, her mother, her father, and any visitor (welcome or not) clearly struggles to not hold the handle at the top when it's not near empty. And guess what? The top is where all the temperature and keep warm buttons are. I.e. anyone that isn't the spawn of Xena and Hercules is going to constantly be crushing the buttons while they move or use the kettle. Which means putting it back on its phallic charger base protuberance with undesired settings EVERY TIME!The actually container shape is also complete rubbish. When it contains plenty of water, the pour is fine and consistant, but as the water depletes, the water doesn't pool sensibly inside when poured. The top is thinner that the rest, this creates a reservoir of water below the regular pour-line. Bionic individuals can anticipate what's going to happen and react the femtosecond in question, but puny mortal humans will discover a 0.00001° change in inclination at this point will transform the escaping water from the mere dribble to a torrential deluge shaming Niagara, and over-filling the desired live in the mug.tl;dr: it boils water, it's ergonomically challenged. I like the blue illumination."
"I purchased the kettle in June 2023, after reading a glowing New York Times 'Wirecutter' review.  That was a mistake.First, when filling the kettle with water, it is impossible to see how much water is in it until you set it on the base and let it light up (the fill window is behind the handle, making even a lit kettle volume hard to see). Take a look at the photos. This means filling it to a certain amount can be a multistep and slow moving process if you do not guess right the first time. The inconvenience of this process is increased because the kettle is heavy.Second, the kettle is very slow to heat up the water, so be prepared to wait far longer than you would for a different kettle.Third, it the kettle ""boils dry"" and shuts off automatically, there is no way manually to reset the heating element. You just have to wait and hope it decides to work again. I write ""boils dry"" in quotation marks because if you use the water and just return it to its place, the heating element automatically triggers, so it can ""boil dry"" when you don't want it to boil at all.Fourth, all the temperature settings are more or less for show. I seriously doubt any of them are exact, given the overall operation of the kettle. If we are serious about our tea steeping correctly, we should use a thermometer, not kettle with questionable accuracy. We drink coffee using a French press, as well as various Chinese and Japanese teas, but the boiling water heat for oatmeal appears to be about the same as the other settingsIt seems that this kettle is built and marketed to appeal to our insecurity and vanity because the user's manual is more like an introduction to tea drinking than a manual providing operational information, like resetting the heating element after it shuts itself down.A replacement at a quarter of the price does a much better job. There are $20 kettles with a thermometer in the cap."
"I’m usually happy with Cuisinart appliances but this one has two features I dislike. Good news first: nice that it can be programmed to different temperatures and heats water fast. But the opening is a bit small; if you use a mug to measure water volume you need to exercise care not to spill. And the memory function should not turn the unit back on after it has reached temperature and beeped. You have to wait at least two minutes before putting the unit back on its base or it tries to boil again, even in the absence of water. If it just remembered your last temperature setting and delivered that the next time you hit start, that would be fine. There’s no way to change the memory function, so we quickly learned to set it on the counter after use."
"I purchased this kettle in 2010. That may seem like a decent life for an electric kettle, but it has been failing for years. I have to keep the cord curved in a slight half circle to get it to work and, even then, it only works sometimes. When it works, it is a great kettle. I would use this multiple times daily for tea but I can only get it to work every few days. This has been an issue for years. Since its purchase, I have made sure that I never leave water sitting in this kettle when not being used, I only use reverse osmosis water in it, and I frequently run the kettle with RO water and some vinegar in it to keep it free of mineral buildup. I only use a damp cloth to clean the outside of the kettle and it has never been submerged. The kettle has always been on my kitchen counter so it never gets bumped around or hit, nor does the cord get bent. I am the child of an Electrical Engineer so I know how to properly care for electrical appliances. For what this kettle cost, I expected a much longer, episode-free life. I called Cuisinart's Customer Service twice and was told that I have had this kettle for years and I should not expect that long of a life from an appliance. Both reps expressed surprise that it has lasted me this long, despite it's sporadic performance. Both offered me a 20% discount off a new $100 dollar version. Cuisinart's temperature variable kettle is not inexpensive. I expect more quality from a product priced as high as this kettle is. If I am only to expect a short life from a Cuisinart product, I will not make the mistake of buying another. I bought a different temperature variable electric kettle as a gift for a family member at a fraction of the price of this Cuisinart unit, the gift kettle has all the same functions and none of the performance issues. I will replace this with an inexpensive temperature variable electric kettle."
"Purchased back in Nov 2018, when it was only $60. About two months ago, the kettle started to leak. Well, at first I didn't know it was a leak, I just saw water pooled around the base (see photo), and I spent quite a while blaming everyone else in the house for not being careful when filling the kettle and spilling water all over the electrical base, which you can imagine is pretty dangerous.......all suspicions toward my family members were assuaged one day when I filled the kettle with all care, set it down to heat, and when I picked it up - water on the base! When I went to pour water from the kettle, that was when I realized it was dripping from the bottom of the kettle.After some intense detective work, I deduced, my dear Watson, that the Kettle would leak only when filled above the 1L level (max is 1.7L so this is nowhere near max). This is fine since we rarely use more than 1L at a time anyways.... that is, until we started having company over and needing to serve hot water to several guests at once.Lo and behold, when I went to look for a replacement, I was hit by sticker shock. $99, are you kidding me?? Then I looked up the warranty. 3 years! Wait a minute, I realized I literally had two days left before I was over the 3 year warranty.I've since contacted customer service at Cuisinart. The warranty claim process was actually not too bad - until we got to the part where we needed to cut the cord on the base and send in a photo before they'll send us a new unit. Well, around the holidays during winter season is a terrible time to be without a kettle, so that's kind of a pain. I understand the policy, but it's still a pain.Will update when I've received the new kettle. In the meantime, if you have one of these and it's been almost 3 years since you bought it..... check for leaks. And have your receipt ready."
"*Update 8/29/19: I thought I would share that I emailed Cuisinart through their contact form on the Cuisinart website. A representative responded to me and asked for the date I purchased my kettle, product serial number, and my mailing address. I responded. Two days later, I received another email asking me to send them my original receipt. I responded accordingly. Today I received a third email from Cuisinart that explains my kettle's manufacturer's warranty lasts only for 3 years and is expired, but that I am within a 6-month grace period. If I'd like, I can mail my kettle to an address they will provide to me at my own expense. This is all well and good, but I'm very frustrated that it took three email to tell me that I have no recourse for my suddenly broken kettle. Again, I've had enough of small appliances made with substandard materials that cost more money than they're worth. I'll be going back to basics with food preparation and will support any decent, consumer-friendly company that will manufacture a simple tea kettle or coffee maker with quality stainless steel and quality components. I hope more consumers will do the same. I'm sorry to say it, but products made in China are not made well nor are they made to last. Consumers have the ability to take a stand against poorly made products with their voices and their wallets.* Update 7/11/19: This is a review of my third kettle. My first experience in 2011 was so good, I just had to try again. This kettle worked flawlessly for three years. Then suddenly and unexpectedly, the base went out and the kettle is now useless. Three years is not long enough for an $80 kettle to last, in my opinion. I'm moving on from Cuisinart.2016: I actually purchased two of these kettles, the first in the fall of 2010 and the second, one year later. The first kettle worked great in every aspect, and is still working perfectly today in year 2016. No rust ever, but occasional mineral deposits that are easily removed with a vinegar rinse. The second kettle regrettably never worked, not even for a moment. I'm not sure if the kettle itself is faulty or if the problem is in the base. Due to my locale not having access to regular mail (extreme rural Alaska), it was simply too difficult to try to return it. My husband is still optimistic he can do something to make it work. If nothing else, perhaps the working part can be switched out with the first kettle when it finally fizzles out, whenever that is. So I have a mixed opinion: one kettle rates 5 stars while the other rates 0 stars. I'll be generous and give a mean review of 3 stars for the two. I'm interested in buying a new kettle to use while visiting family during a lengthy stay, but am concerned whether I'll receive a 0 star product or higher. Consistency in quality seems to be an issue, reading through a number of reviews. Here's hoping...  By the way, I'm extremely appreciative to those genuine reviewers who are not posting as a result of obtaining their kettle 'with a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased' review.' If this is where Amazon sellers are headed, I'm not biting."
"Purchased this kettle in 2016.  It has worked mostly well over the years except for two major issues.First, the bottom of the unit where most of the electronics and the heating element are is not sealed from water intrusion. Had the main power relay get wet causing it to short. It was an easy repair to replace the component if you’re handy with a soldering iron. I added silicone around the electronics to seal them from getting wet again.Fast forward to this past week when the kettle was found to be leaking from the inside and out through the base. The internets led me to removing the handle to find the plastic water level indicator cracked on the backside. When removing the indicator the inlet orifice broke apart leaving plastic dust all about. The plastic that touches the water through the side wall had completely disintegrated. The photo attached is of the broken part and the plastic dust that easily brushes off of it.I will never be using water from this kettle for consumption again and you shouldn’t either."
"I used this electric tea kettle daily for two years. Last week the top broke and does not flip up, anymore. I’ve had trouble with the lid sticking on and off for at least a year, but worked with it. However, this new rendition of that problem is unacceptable.For the high price, I expected more from this product. Do not recommend you wasting your money on this expensive electric tea kettle."
"1/ The first one leaked from the bottom. Got a quick replacement.2/ The lid on the newest  one doesn’t open easily.3/ It is difficult to figure out the max fill level because of the position of the fill indicator window and no visible marking inside the kettle.Otherwise, boils in a reasonable amount of time. I like the different temp presets. The kettle is attractive."
"Ok, for the past 6 years I have had a Breville kettle and crew been very happy with it. I use it many times throughout the day as I am an avid tea drinker. When its lid broke I had to buy a new kettle and the Cuisinart has great reviews and is quite a bit cheaper.It does the job. And if I didn't have my breville to compare it against, I would likely have been satisfied.. The prosLike the breville it has settings for different temps which is good for teaIt has a bell to let you know when it's reached tempIt has a small footprint on the counter.It has a very visible window to let you know how much water remains.The consIt's noisyIt doesn't stay to temp as well and isn't automatically keeping it to tempThe top opening is small, making cleaning more difficult.Since the temp. selections are in the handle it is fatter and less comfortable to pourIts has a tad cheaper feel to it than the Breville.I will keep it but, I wish i had just swallowed hard and paid the extra 40 bucks"
"I've had this kettle for 9 months. It's my go-to kettle for tea because I love having several options of temperatures, and I love the keep-warm feature which allows me to easily brew several small infusions of tea over 30 minutes (or more). Also it's very quick to come to temp, and I like the audible alert when the water's ready. BUT:This kettle is dangerous. I can't believe this isn't mentioned in every single review. This kettle is a single-walled, stainless steel design. Stainless steel is a fantastic thermal conductor. If the water inside the single stainless steel wall is 212 degrees, what temperature do you think the outside of the stainless steel wall is? About 212 degrees. I'm serious. Do not touch the walls of this thing while water is boiling in it! Or even near boiling in it. How did this get approved for sale in the US? Do not let your kids anywhere near this while you're using it! I don't have kids and I know not to touch it when it's operating (guess how I know!), so this is okay with me since holding it by the handle is perfectly comfortable. But really, I'm stunned that it's allowed on the market.Also, the last ounce or two of water does not pour out cleanly, and you simply cannot completely drain the kettle. This is due to the plastic clip that is bolted over the pour spout on the interior. The clip holds the filter, which is meant to keep flakes from hard water build up from ending up in your cup. But whether or not you use the filter (I don't), that clip interferes with the stream of water in such a way that the last ounce or two of water pours out not in one coherent stream but in 3-5 separate trickles, one of which drips down from above the spout! And the last tablespoon or two of water simply will not come out no matter how you hold / jiggle / shake the pot. Very annoying.Despite those two design flaws, one of which is IMO very serious, I still use it because it's the only option I've found that lets me quickly bring a small volume of water (less than 1/2 liter) to any of several different temps and hold it there for 30 minutes (or more if you hit Start again). But if there was a comparably priced alternative without these two major flaws, I'd buy that one instead."
"Probably like many others out there, I've used a $10 electric kettle for years, it gets the job done. I decided to upgrade to this electric kettle hoping that the extra features and quality would be worth it, but my experience with this kettle was very poor for a few major reasons.1) The pouring spout is HORRIBLE. The spout itself is way too wide, and for some reason just never pours in a steady stream. I think this is due to the design of the mesh filter and all that plastic that gets in the way of a smooth pour. It's like nobody ever tried pouring with this kettle before.2) The ""Keep Warm"" feature is a scam. You can set it to keep warm at different temperature points, so I assumed that the kettle would keep the water at that temperature, for example 190 degrees. But that's not what happens at all. Instead of constantly applying heat to keep the water at a certain temperature, what the kettle does is turn off completely, then turn back on when the water temperature drops below a certain point, and heats it back up to your designated temperature. That's not keeping the water at the selected temperature at all!3) It actually boils water more slowly than my $10 kettle. I boiled 1L of water in both, and this Cuisinart one was just slightly slower, but slower regardless. Come on!4) Minor complaint, but the beeping sounds when the water is ready are pretty annoying, I wish I could disable that or at least make it just one beep instead of 3 or 5 (I don't know why it does 3 sometimes and 5 others).Overall, I expected a flawless and well-designed electric kettle for $100, but what I got was one that I wouldn't even use over my $10 one I got right after college. Would not recommend."
"I have mixed feelings about this electric kettle. On one hand it has fancy temperature controls but on the other hand electronics is a bit finicky and durability is not great.First issue is the design of a handle and location of ""keep warm"" button. Button is at the very bottom of the controls and handle is quite slick with no stop before controls. So, if you do not have a firm grip and lift the kettle, your hand will slide up and you will turn on ""keep warm"" feature which is very annoying. This always happens with my kids when they try to lift full kettle.Second issue it that often electronic freezes and none of the buttons are operational. You have to lift the kettle from its base to reset.Lastly, it does not seem to be all that durable. Granted I had it for 3.5 years now, but right now lid does not open and does not close properly. To open it you have to gently pry it open and to close you have to push it to a side and down.So, considering price, I am not too happy with this model. My previous kettle cost me third of this and lasted twice as long -- did not have multiple temperatures though."
"Heats water fine, however, the lid constantly pops open while heating. I have to place a heavy item on top of it to keep it shut, definitely a design flaw"
"Had our CPK since May of 2012 - using it 2-4x per day without a problem - just failed today not quite 3 years old.  Would give it 3.5 stars but had to commit - so only 3.Like the kettle very much - was clear what temperature you have selected, beep to indicate temperature has been reached is fairly loud but not obnoxious.  Keep warm is nice but being able to have it shut down when temp is reached is very good as well.  Handle remains cool even after repeated uses (we often would boil water to use for cooking / makeup of loss when preparing food for company).Having said that there are issues to be aware of.Less than 3 years of use before it failed (not a statistically- significant sample size of one unit - should see how many folks have had failures and withing what length of time).Numbers/text on the buttons is silk-screened. Numbers on the most used buttons wore off in about 1 yr.  After a year or so of more of cleanings the balance of the numbers and text wore off.When hot the lid would stick shut and required a tap in order to pop open.Never had any other issues - looking for a new electric kettle and depending on available capacity and features may buy this one again.== 6/1/2016 Update == Bought a replacement February 22nd 2015 - this one worked until May 25th 2016.  Daily use - actually 2-3 x per day is pretty typical as we are a familiy of tea / coffee drinkers.  This unit's numbers stayed on - no issues. Lid also sticky hot or cold but worked better than the predecessor.  Will attempt to get warranty replacement / service but will order a replacement unit in the near term as it is now an integral part of our lives...  will add to this update after trying to get service.  Stay tuned..."
"I had the same module before, use it for 3 years, what is not bad. The problem is: in description it's stated kettle should automatically shot down when there is no water. It does no, and  it should be done manually."
"I like the size of this cattle!!It holds more than 3 cups of water for tea, but it does get extremely hot to the touch so make sure you hold it by the handleI do find the different parts of boiling water to be an overkill, one button should be enough"
"We purchased this kettel to replace a Krups kettle that just failed after 4 years. The only thing we were missing in the Krups was a water level indicator. It had everything above this one as it was insulated,  had unlimited temperature settings and a readout that told you the temperature as it was climbing to your final selection. I will miss it and now my wife wants me to find something similar. Unfortunately I threw out the packaging and doubt if I can return it."
"It looks good.  It has actually useful and worthwhile features (temp, and ""keep warm"").  My coffee really does seem better at 175F (aeropress).In use though, you have to 'learn it'.  Not hard, but bearing in mind we're not doing anything even a tad complex, seems a bit unnecessary.  At the start there was a lot of trying buttons and not being entirely sure whether it succeeded or not.For example, my first use: hit the temp I want.  It should have started, but it looks like it hasn't - heh, ""Start"" is unlit, press that; hey - now the temp is flashing, wtf?  looks urgent, I have to press something...  Hit the temp again...  nothing changes.  Oh, perhaps it just flashes like that in that urgent looking manner for no reason...  Well, not too painful.  Wait, I've finished with it, how do I make it stop...?  What?, I really have to manually turn the thing off every time?This is all in the manual and not too obscure, but really, how much should I need a manual?  How confused should a guest in my house be by /an electric kettle/?At this price I expect someone to do a quality design of the controls, not just the aesthetics.  I do like the kettle and I'm feeling generous so I'm giving it a 4, rather than a 3, but it's a close thing.Review Edit: definitely dropping this to 3 stars, might contemplate 2.  My wife and I, who are pretty tech-savvy, get caught out by the silly interface for this frequently - both intending to turn it on and failing, and failing to turn it off when we're finished with it.  Added to that, and it's increasingly failing to shut off from the boil setting in a timely manner.  I think it still shuts off, but takes a couple of minutes of boiling.  Overall, it's a nice looking product, but the user experience was not designed properly at all, and the performance is questionable."
"I bought this kettle as a NYT Wirecutter recommendation when my last one gave up the ghost. Imagine my dismay when I woke up the next morning to find the kettle and the base sitting in a giant pool of water! 🙀The base was plugged in, and I was originally angry at my roommates for being so careless. But I set the kettle off to the side, away from the base (which I had unplugged). When I came back several hours later, the kettle was sitting in another pool of water, and the bottom dripped water when I picked it up off the counter. I didn't want to return it to Amazon because the product was unsafe, and I was afraid they would turn around and sell it to someone else. And Cuisinart customer service did honor a warranty. Hopefully the replacement item they send is safer. Usually Wirecutter picks are fantastic, so I'm holding my breath that this was a one-off incident. If anyone else has the same thing happen DON'T RETURN IT TO AMAZON. Cuisinart needs to know this is happening with their product and get. it. fixed."
"I wanted to love it. Nice color, good temp control and water capacity. However, after every use (no matter the temperature setting) the water tastes like burned plastic. We used it for months and the burned plastic taste never went away.  This is more than an inconvenience. We can’t use it at all. The water tastes terrible. The kettle is stainless steel but the inside of the lid it is black plastic. For this brand and price I was expecting a great product. I wished I return it, but I thought it was something temporary.I had tu purchase another electric kettle from another brand that is stainless steel outside and  inside the lid and it works great."
Love the kettle and features. Top got stuck open within 2 weeks but the return and exchange process was easy. The kettle itself is great. Hoping it holds up now with the replaced one.Edited - received our replacement quickly and it has been great now for almost 2 months. Heats quickly. Love the temp settings.
"BUYERS, BEWARE! CUISINART'S ""LIMITED WARRANTY' MAY BE LEGAL, BUT IT'S NEAR-FRAUDULENT!I bought this kettle in September, 2015 and it failed in December, 2015. The one-year warranty is USELESS. When I called for troubleshooting, they shipped me a replacement for the base. The replacement took almost a month to arrive, and was dead on arrival. It may have been defective, but most likely, the kettle was at fault. When I called to request that they replace the kettle, I discovered that (1) I'd have to ship the kettle back to them first, and (2) I'd need to enclose an extra $15 payment to cover Cuisinart's return shipping expense for the replacement unit...because the kettle only has ""a limited warranty."" So (counting $15, plus my own packaging and shipping cost) I'm being to told to expend at least $30 in order to get a replacement for a unit I had for three months--a unit that has never been abused or mistreated in any way.This is a PREMIUM product. It should have a PREMIUM warranty policy--just ship me the replacement, place a hold on my credit card until I return the bad one in the replacement packaging, etc. And the manufacturer pays for shipping both ways. This is common practice for other high-end products (and most Amazon returns), and I think it's inexcusable that Cuisinart takes an approach that seems DESIGNED TO AVOID having to honor their warranty.The representative was polite and professional throughout, but could not allow me to speak to her supervisor ""because of the heavy call volume.""She gave me the runaround; it's not her fault, she's just doing her job. Like any employee, she has to carry out her employer's policy. But Cuisinart's policy in INEXCUSABLE; it's not worth paying to replace the unit, and I'm never buying any Cuisinart product again.DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT IF YOU EVER EXPECT TO NEED SERVICE UNDER WARRANTY!!"
"Short version: I liked the kettle when it was working, but it stopped working and after I sent it back, Cuisinart waited out the warranty period and said they wouldn't do anything for me. So basically they took my money and left me with nothing. 4 stars for the kettle, -4 for malevolent customer service then +2 just to keep this out of the hater category of 1 star.Long version: I was impressed with this kettle when visiting my brother so I bought my own. Simple to use, well marked temperatures and tea types. Looks nice. It worked as expected for a couple months then stopped working. No indicators of declining function, just wouldn't heat anymore one day. I called Cuisinart and followed their instruction about cleaning the unit in case a temperature sensor was blocked, but no result. Sent it back to Cuisinart and didn't hear anything for months. Almost a year, actually, which is when I called them to see what was up. As with probably most other busy people out there, an automatic tea kettle is not my top priority, especially when it's just a convenience over the standard tea kettle that is still on my stovetop. In any case, I was told that a ""referral to corporate"" was being made and that I would get a call back in a couple days. No call. Now, three months later and no returned calls and I called them today and was told that it's now past the warranty period and because I didn't call within a month from the original claim, they don't consider it their problem so they are not willing to do anything for me. Keep in mind that the kettle supposedly carries a three year warranty so one might think this is still under the warranty period. Also, when I called three months ago- under the ""one year"" they keep claiming is preventing them from taking action- the customer service rep said nothing about their expected protocol from customers or about a kettle which they now claim was sent to me via USPS with no delivery confirmation. This last claim was made by a customer service supervisor moments before ending the call and was not mentioned in any previous interactions with them, an action which gives me no confidence that they are telling the truth. Now they say the best they can do for me is give me an address for their corporate office to which to lodge a complaint, though given their tactic of doing nothing until the problem (ie customer) goes away, I have no faith that my letter will produce any results. For future kitchen appliance needs, I will avoid Cuisinart and recommend others do the same."
"Bottom stays cool, but metal side walls do get hot.And they are LOUD. Really loud.But it does the job."
"After all the glowing reviews of it in the media, we thought we'd try it but it's only marginally better than our last bare bones one button kettle and it takes a longer time boiling water. Not to mention, we do see spots on the bottom once a week which means it needs vinegar to clean it and we didn't expect that kind of maintenance."
"Comparing to  KRUPS BW730D Breakfast Set Electric Kettle with Brushed and Chrome Stainless Steel Housing, 1.7-Liter, Silver        .This kettle performs exactly the same - when set to Boil, it boils 1L of water in exactly the same time as the KRUPS.Ergonomically, the handle is less comfortable than KRUPS - you can't reach the Open button as easily.I like that it turns on to the last setting when you pour some water in it and put it back on the base - no chance of forgetting to turn it on, which I do on occasion.  I also like that it beeps when it's done - 5 quiet chimes.  I definitely like that the lid is insulated, and doesn't get very hot.I don't like that the scale is on the back - when you pour water into it while holding it in your hand, it tends to read low (the kettle tends to lean forward, due to the handle not very well designed).  Have to adjust to pour less water into, in the hopes that it'll be correct when it's back on the base.But there is a problem: the lid sticks when the kettle is hot.  Sometimes it takes a few seconds to open, sometimes it doesn't open at all, and you have to wait for it to cool down (or pry it open with something - when is risky if you choose your fingers or nails).  I ordered a replacement./edit Replacement arrived today, and I see the problem.  There is a slight difference in alignment of the lid.  My first kettle has the lid shifted off-center maybe about 1mm toward the front of the kettle.  This is enough to make it bind when it's hot.  The second kettle lid is right on center, so it doesn't bind.  Buyers beware."
I ignored other reviews that said it was heavy when filled. My bad.It is heavy without having to fill.Love the temp options but not enough for battle lifting and trying to do a pour-over.
"We have owned two of these kettles. Pros: reasonably priced, the water temp variety is helpful, the design is sleek and modern, the beep for when water is heated is helpful, the automatic keep warm feature is handy, the handle is cool to the touch, the touch pad is easy to operate. Cons: each of our kettles lasted about 5-6 yrs. and then quit boiling; when full, the kettle can be on the heavy side; short life. Other highly rated(and slightly more expensive models) have been reviewed as lasting 10 yrs. If I have to buy two of this model in 10 yrs, it's more expensive than the one model that lasts 10 yrs. Plus I save time having to shop for another kettle. I'm trying another model next time."
"This kettle is incredibly frustrating. It is always boiling at the wrong temperature or boiling when you don't expect it to be.After removing the kettle from the base and using the boiled water, the kettle does not automatically disable the keep warm function. So, it'll be boiling again without much water in it once you've got your drink and gone to sit down. What's the point of that? And it'll keep doing that until all of the water has boiled away. In addition, somehow, it keeps forgetting that it's job is to make hot water, and the temperature resets to 160 degrees from 200 every so often. Yes, we leave it plugged in and on the base.Noise - seems quiet, but often it's only boiling to 160, so that's cheating.Overall, the behavior of the Keep Warm and variable temperature is a frustration, because every interaction with the kettle requires active attention to stop it doing the wrong thing. Other kettles like the Kenwood SJM610 just do the expected action by default.We brought this as a replacement for the Kenwood SJM610 after the Kenwood developed a leak. Overall the Kenwood was a far better kettle, until it began leaking."
"I recently purchased this kettle because my old kettle stopped working. I did some research on different types of kettles and decided to purchase this one. Here's what I found so far.The look:I really like the look except for the fact that the window is hard to see so when pouring water into the kettle, you actually have to be very close to the window. This morning I had hard time even seeing the amount of water because the window was all steamy. Even though we haven't used it over night. They should definitely consider moving the window to a side.The feel:This kettle is made of metal and feels a little heavy. After a few minutes of pushing the ""start"" button, it gets real hot and makes it impossible to touch (even the lid), but the handle stays cool.The functionality:When I plugged in the kettle to the outlet and put it on base, the blue light in the window turned on and stayed on for about 10 minutes. There's no way to turn it off other than to take the kettle out of its base. I guess the light is useful if you want to see how much water you have in the kettle, but it is only useful when the kettle is on the base. I poured water all the way to the max, set it to ""boil"" and started the process. The buttons are not easy to press, sometimes it takes me a few times before it responds so I have to push the buttons harder. In a software age where gadgets like touch screens make it so easy to touch and expect an immediate response, I'd say this is a big flaw in the kettle. It took about 7.5 minutes to boil water at which point the kettle beeped softly three times and stopped working while the temperature ""boil"" and ""start"" buttons started blinking. If I was in the next room, I wouldn't be able to hear the beeps. I poured a cup of water out into my cup and pushed ""keep warm"" button a few times until it was lit. About a minute later it turned off so I wasn't sure if it was still working so I pushed it again a couple of times so the button lit and then it turned off again. I poured all water out and wanted to test ""boil-dry protection"" feature. It took maybe half a minute for the kettle to realize there's no water inside and it shut off and all the buttons started blinking. I took it off its base and put it back on hoping it would reset, but it didn't. I started pressing ""start"" button (according to the manual, pressing ""start"" will either start or stop the boiling process), but it didn't help. So I took the kettle of its base and left it on the table for about 10 minutes after which point I put it back on the base and it magically reset. I guess the two minute memory feature prevented the kettle from being reset.Overall, I would say it's a safe to use kettle if you don't touch it while it's hot. It definitely boils water fast and signals when it's done."
"Our previous electric kettle after 8 or so years died, and I loved it. Since that kettle is no longer available we ordered this as a replacement. It's ok. I had to carefully read the instruction guide to find out that to turn it off you press ""start"" a second time. You have to press the buttons firmly, occasionally it doesn't register that you pressed a temperature button. The casing is metal, as opposed to the plastic of my previous kettle. I reached past it to get a teabag and brushed my arm against it and felt like I burned myself. Luckily there was no mark on my arm. It has a water level guide under the handle which is hard to see where it's at unless I jiggle the kettle or pick it up from the base to make it light up. And lastly, if I have a low amount of water in the kettle when I go to pour it I guess condenses on the lid and pours weirdly, like from both the spout and the lid.But it does heat the water for my tea, seems a bit hotter than the previous kettle did, even at the green tea setting. Gets the job done and that's what counts, I suppose. Still wish I could have gotten my other kettle again instead."
"PLEASE READ CAREFULLY! Low grade steel that corrodes easily when subjected to chlorine in tap water or even filtered water that was especially if salts were added.There’s different grades of steel and this is a low grade. There are many different types of corrosion, but the two most common types are general corrosion and localized corrosion. General corrosion is when the entire surface of the metal is affected evenly. Localized corrosion is when only certain areas of the metal are affected, usually due to factors like chloride ions in the environment.One of the most common causes of localized corrosion is chloride ion contamination. Chloride ions are found in many places, including seawater, de-icing salts, and chlorinated water. When chloride ions come into contact with stainless steel, they can cause pitting corrosion, which is a type of localized corrosion.Pitting corrosion is when small holes form on the surface of the metal. These holes can eventually cause the metal to break or crumble. Pitting corrosion is often difficult to detect because it occurs beneath the surface of the metal.So, does salt corrode stainless steel? The answer is yes. Salt can corrode stainless steel. However, not all types of stainless steel are equally susceptible to corrosion. There are different grades of stainless steel, and some are more resistant to chloride ion contamination than others.Update: Received a replacement and in 5 months corroded again. Not safe for kettle water human consumption"
pretty convenient while it lasted.  But it wouldn't turn on this morning..  :(
This is my third kettle but first of this brand. So far so good! Seems to be holding up after a month now
"Nice looking, but...it doesn't have and auto OFF. It does shut off when water has reached the desired temperature, however, it'll keep turning on and boiling it again and again, unless you actually press the Start button again. Another thing, if it's a START/STOP button, it should be labeled as such. It isn't. Didn't leave up to my expectations."
"I absolutely love this electric kettle. I purchased in March 2023. Unfortunately, after only 8 months of use, rust spots showed up on the inside bottom. I don't need rust in my water/tea/coffee! I've now read many users' reviews complaining of rust in various spots inside the kettle. Of course, it's made in CHINA. So go figure. This was the most expensive kettle I could find. I hate things made in China."
"We got our first iteration of this kettle over six years ago after having two less 'fancy' kettles quit on us after ~2 years. The first kettle (bought at Bed Bath and Beyond in-store) was amazing, never had any problems with it until it finally started to leak. Since it lasted so long, we decided to buy this kettle again; however, the one from Amazon lasted about 5 weeks before it broke, signaling that it boiled dry even when it was full of water, never heating again. Didn't matter if we unplugged and plugged back in, dried it out, etc., nothing worked.Gratefully, Cuisinart replaced the kettle under warranty and the replacement kettle we received from them is working well. I don't know what caused the issue in the end, but just beware of buying electronics 3rd party, I suppose."
"Did well  with this electric kettle for 3.5 years, averaging 1-2 uses per day. Now it’s rusting at the bottom of the water chamber (stainless steel??), and I set it to boil and the temperature never gets above 200F before it beeps. Time to move on. Don’t think I’ll buy another."
"The good: heats up the water quickly, i like the buttons that allow me to choose the temperature. The keep warm button is also helpful. Looks nice.The bad: The light is ugly and useless, and it stays on even after the water is no longer hot, and turning it off requires pressing the start button, or the keep warm button, or some combination of the two. Seems like every time i want to turn off the light i have to just keep jabbing at those two buttons randomly until it goes off. Also, sometimes the water just dribble out of it instead of a nice steam.Overall it’s good though and i’m happy with it. just takes some getting used to."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I literally just had this arrive on my front door earlier today and it already stopped working. Cleaned it/rinsed it to test boiling feature  and it worked but took about 3-5 mins. Then when I washed it, left it alone for an hour to cool down to test again, and the temp sensor suddenly doesn’t work or the heating element ?? Totally weird… maybe I got a dud? Returning to get a new one but if the new kettle doesn’t work either then I’m just going to go back to a cheap Hamilton beach kettle honestly …"
This is CPK - 17 model which is discontinued by Cusinart. The latest model is CPK-17P1
"My kettle broke 2.5 years in.  $100 for a kettle that doesn't even last 5 years!  It also broke in a very dangerous way that could easily cause a fire: it started boiling any time you returned it to the stand.  (And yes, I've used this 3-5x daily, so I'm very sure that it wasn't on the maintain heat setting.)Their crappy warranty also didn't even offer to cross ship.  I had to buy another kettle in order to get a replacement... as it turns out, I bought a kettle because I, well, use a kettle.My T-Fal lasted a decade and cost 1/3 as much money.  I'd strongly recommend not patronizing this crappy brand."
"A good kettle overall... Until it starts leaking. Had two of them, both had the same issue. One day, maybe in a year, maybe in a few, you wake up and the water is outside when it should have stayed inside. And you have to buy a new kettle.Another issue is, the paint on the fancy buttons eventually comes off, and you have to remember what to press. But the good news is, it may start leaking before that, so you'll have to throw it away with the paint still intact."
"Kettle is, I assume, like most others you'll find on Amazon. What I liked was the glass, the different temperature options, and the 1.8L capacity. The tea infuser is a nice perk, though I would have been fine without it.The worst part is the beeping sounds, and this is the primary reason I've given only three stars. When you set the kettle on the base, it beeps. When you press a button to either start heating or switch to a different temperature option, it beeps. When the kettle is done heating, it beeps.I like my appliances to be quiet, and this beeping, for me at least, serves no functionality. I am pretty assured that I have placed the kettle on the base correctly. The click of the button is enough for me to know I've pressed it. And the LED lights indicate to me what temperature setting I'm on. No beeps needed. Maybe someone appreciates it, but not me. I can tolerate it when I'm by myself, but if I live with others, and maybe I want to use this kettle while someone else is sleeping, I would be less drawn to using it.There are other less perfect qualities. The LED lights are almost gaudy in my opinion, or toy-like. Also, it doesn't boil as fast as advertised (at time of ordering they say ""as little as 3 minutes""). I know that means it can take longer depending on how much water you have, but at the minimum amount of water needed to use the kettle (.5L), it still takes just under 4 minutes (3min 52sec to be precise), not 3 minutes. At maximum water capacity (1.8L), it takes a little under 10 minutes.But I can put up with those things. 4 minutes is close enough to 3 minutes for me. I'd probably still give it five stars. But those beeps are annoying enough for the rating to take a hit. If I was an engineer, I'd want to see if I could somehow disable the sound, as I would be quite satisfied with the kettle that way. Alas. I will keep the kettle, simply because I'm too lazy to do a return and try another kettle just to possibly find some other flaw that would annoy me. The other features are still pretty much what I want from a kettle. So the kettle remains, sound and all."
Can you stop with the beeping?  Its like its set loud to wake up the whole house!  Im standing right here.  My hand is on the pot.  I can hear it.  I just put it back.  The beep doesnt have to be that stupidly loud.  Im trying to make coffee at 4 a.m. but Im really waking everyone up!It doesnt keep warm at certain levels.  And it isnt clear what the keep warm temp is.  Hold the button down for the keep warm setting....and hope its right.  The Old model had a digital readout and defaulted to a keep warm state. Easy peasy. Unlike the old model this model just has lights and stops.  And other than a light and a guess you have no idea what temp the water is.  Especially because the light turns off.  So its a weak offering.
"If it would shut off automatically as advertised, I would give this five stars. It heats water quickly, and I love the glass container and the LED lights. BUT it will not shut off automatically on anything except the lowest (green tea) setting. That is a safety issue, given that I'm 72 and easily can forget things! However, I didn't realize this until I had already destroyed the box that it came in, so I can't really return it. I just wish it would shut off as it is supposed to. We are at a mile-high altitude so maybe that has something to do with it. ?"
"I was looking to replace my Cuisinart electric glass kettle with temperature  control.  With use, it had developed defects on bottom, probably from thermo- cycling. I loved it and couldn’t live without one.I thought I’d try this Chefman. It is half the cost of  a new Cuisinart; unfortunately, it costs more everyday, taking twice as long  to heat as the Cuisinart and lacks the keep warm function, which would have been  handy,  because it takes so long to heat.  Wait a little longer and get the Cuisinart if you can. Oh well."
"I use the kettle every day to heat water for either coffee or tea, and like the different temperature options.  Once it's up to temp, it has a pretty loud beep and then shuts off.  That's nice for single use, but if you decide you need more water awhile later you have to go thru the process again.  I like the glass, but it has no insulatory properties, and the unit itself doesn't have a 'keep warm' feature.  For the price, it's good enough.  Next one, will have some of those additional features."
"To remove the tea infuser, I had to actually take the lead out with the infuser, flip it up side down, and then basically unscrew it. Also, do I have to hold/touch the entire infuser and then put it back into the water along with the germs from my hands ? What they show on the second video is not entirely true - maybe it's an older or newer version... Not happy with the infuser at all.Buttons + lights are cool. Let's see how long they last.."
"So I turned the kettle/water boiler on while I write this review on my phone. The longer I write means the kettle is still working to heat up the water. Heating to 212 degrees.It's a nice looking kettle but it doesn't do what it is supposed to do. Heat up water.The first time I used it, I thought maybe it's one of those ones that need to run once first. Boy was I wrong.I tested this 5 times and the time is getting longer! Imagine that when I times it with a stop watch. The time increases about 2 seconds everything I use it.While the kettle still works, I would like to mention that the temperature buttons are a nice feature. It's nice to know what degree of water I am putting my tea/coffee/hot chocolate in. The infuser is just like any other kettle infuser out there. Not a game changer.Lastly, the cleaning. I am not sure what parts can be in water and what parts cannot. For example, if I clean the inside and outer glass, can I also clean the bottom (where the charging port is at) and can i clean the handle (where the temperature buttons are at).Seeing as the kettle is producing small bubbles, I am gonna write my conclusion and verdict along with the time. It's an okay basic kettle. It's like buying a decent stock car on sale. Out of lets say 10 options, I only got 1. That's how it feels. And it just clicked off. Bye 👋Scientific mumbo jumbo below.RESULTS:Heating to 212 degrees (highest):full 1.8 liter (60 oz)Time: 11 min 54 sec.Temp of water: 208.4 degrees0.5 liter (16 oz)Time: 5 min 36 sec.Temp of water: 206.9 degreesCurrent ambient temperature: 65.4 degrees.Faucet water temperature: 64.7 degrees.Score: 4/10Remarks: Debating on returning it.Hope this helps~"
Wasn’t aware that it has California 65 warnings hidden in the instructions. The spout for this one is plastic and the water directly contacts the glue (not sure if it’s silicone or food grade because there’s no information about the materials used to made it) at the bottom.
"I like the tea infuser,  i don’t like that there are only four temperature settings and it takes longer than similar products I have owned to get to the boiling water temperature."
"This is a great kettle, large enough for several cups of tea, temp control and easy to clean and fill.  However I did notice for some reason that rust has appeared at the seal of the inner metal steeper.  I detached and tried to clean, but it is rust stained.  I use filtered water so I am not sure why the metal steeper would have rust stains on it and it appear at the where the seam of the metal occurs.Sadly, this was one of the best features for using with loose leaf tea."
I haven't tried this product yet but this will be the last time I want it coming in it's own box no other kind of protection no directions came with it the box had been torn opened & then taped back up it may be simple to some but I don't know how to get the infuser off  I did follow the arrow but still won't come off. I have having to return products it's very hard for me to go do it myself I do not want to send it back unless the whole thing doesn't work when it gets picked up the base comes off immediately maybe it's supposed to be that way no directions  so I do not know
You need to use paper towel to dry the inside. There is no way you can empty all the liquid. There is a flaw in the design.
"The pot works well, but the quality could be better.  The rim on the tea basket can fall apart."
"This kettle gets the job done. It seems to heat water fairly quickly and it has adjustable temperatures. But as an early riser with young kids, the surprisingly loud beeps (when you turn it on, when you adjust the temperature, when it arrives at the target temp) are loud enough to wake my kids. Unfortunately, we are returning it because of that.  There's just no reason for that kind of loud sound."
"There are a few design features that make this a little less desirable than was advertised.The base element doesn't have a ""guiding light"" for placing the carafe onto (I make my coffee at 5am).The ""tea stem"" can be awkward to remove (I don't make tea much, just boil water for coffee).I still don't know what the second, right-hand button on the handle does.....But, it gets the water hot."
"I liked many things about this kettle. It was adequate and did boil water quickly for about 11 months, and then it just would not turn on anymore. The light began to flicker on and off and then about a week after that it would not work at all. I will not be buying another of this brand. I expected it to last longer than that."
"Since in today's America false advertising,,,, oh I mean misspeaking about one's product's performance is the norm we didn't truly expect the boil in the time suckers, er victims, oh consumers should think the kettle will boil a whole pot of water at their location.  Maybe we are just using the wrong flavor of water.  Oh well in our real expectations of it taking a bit longer we are not disappointed because I'm sure my clocks and watches run at a different speed than those in some test labs somewhere.  Still it actually is a very useful item in our kitchen as we enjoy some tea at the end of our day here in beautiful south Florida."
"Purchased on January 4, 2022. It is now November 4, 2024 and after a few weeks of strange noises it is dead. I would expect a longer life than 2 years. I loved everything about this kettle from the looks, lights, pre-set temperatures and ease of use. If your considering this kettle you must decide if the price justifies the 2 year lifespan."
"This is an ok product l, takes on avg of 9 mins to bring the water to tye right temp.Brewing tea at right temperature is important for flavor and taste, this does the job of heating water to the right temp, keep in mind though, this has 5 fixed temp settings only so if your tea need slightly different temp that what's preprogrammed, you have to use the closest setting available and it may affect the flavor.The biggest issue with this tea brewer is the insert when you put in the tea for steeping. I do a tea by weight to water volume ratio and if I don't want the full 1.8l tea, my tea leaves won't fully get submerged in water, so I end up with heavily watered down tea. If I put in like 30g of tea leaves for 1l of water, only 50% of those leave are actually in the water, this I think is because the tea strainer insert is very narrow. To get my tea right, I ended up putting the tea leaves directly into the kettle, but cleaning after is a pain, other than that for the price, the quality is great, I hope it lasts a while though."
Heating water for tea also tried to make tea in it the metal stained the connection sounds awful I washed it according to directions and yet the sound setting kettle on stand was awful made me cringe and the metals inside the pot stained just from making tea still works but dang that sound
"I bought this to replace a Chefman's glass kettle that I broke, but didn't look closely enough at what I was buying and don't like it as much.  It doesn't have the digital temperature control and doesn't keep the water warm after reaching that temp."
"Product works great, no complaints about functionality. However it looked like it had been used when I took it out of the box (residue and finger prints on the base and inside the pot/steeper). Had to give it a thorough wash before using."
"I like the glass kettle however it stopped working after a while, not sure if it the heating element, looking for a small appliance shop to have it checked out un my area, Glendale Az."
The look and initial working of this tea kettle was great. Three months in the lid randomly pops open when pouring boiling water. My poor husband burnt his hand.  The lid is not a good one on this.
"This is a Christmas gift, therefore there is no review. Came on time packaged well looks good. That’s the best I can tell you."
"I'll keep this one short. The product works great, but it seems they may have sent me a product that had previously been returned and was reboxed and sold as new.Now I'm not saying that's what happened, but the packaging looked it had been retaped and there are scrapes in the outer glass of the pitcher. Unfortunately, they're so fine, it's almost impossible to pick them up with my phones camera.So again, product works well, but buyer beware when thinking you're buying a new product. Next time I'll definitely spend more money on a name brand.Oh well. Live and learn."
"I bought this 28Sep2024. It took 9 minutes to boil the water in the kettle. The brochures says rapid-boiling technology, but my previous kettle (it died) would bring the water to a boil in less than four minutes. The keep warm feature is handy which makes up for the slow boil except that you have to restart it after taking it off the base each time."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So I purchased this in 2024 to replace an older kettle that I purchased in January of 2019. The older kettle still works great only someone broke the spring lid and it's no longer available. The first words under the ""About this item"" of this new kettle, says ""FAST BOILING"". I did a comparison of my old kettle and this one using equal amounts of water and the 195 temp setting. Took this pot 9 minutes, 55 seconds to boil. The older one took only 8 1/2 minutes. That is not my definition of fast boiling. Other than that, the only other drawback is it does not seem to have a ""warming"" feature. if you don't mind waiting forever for your water to boil and don't mind that it does not have a warming feature you will be satisfied with this."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I purchased it because the price and the amount of reviews on this. As far as boiling and timing goes it worked perfectly. I struggled for a bit on how to disconnect the infuser to  put the tea in. The instructions were not clear on that. I was afraid of breaking it while trying to twist it off.* to use the infuser you have to slide it to the side and then slide it back into the cap. Don't twist or pull.Tea came out tasting good but I lost alot when I went to pour it into the jar for some reason it leaked from the bottom of the kettle and it was a significant amount. I made a thai tea which stains so it stained my kitchen counter. I thought maybe I overflowed it but I did it again with much less and the same issues with leaking. I did end up returning and took a change on a kettle that had very little reviews and ratings compared to this and have been very happy I did.
I like that it turns off automatically but it takes just as long as my standard stovetop kettle (plus more counter space). I use it but probably wouldn’t order again. Maybe ok for a dorm room though.
I thought my dog would get used to it. After few days the beep can be heard from 2 rooms away. Does anyone know how to mute the beep before I return it ?
"Delivered as promised. In good condition. Love the stainless tea infuser but no keep warm feature. Too loud when On.Boils easily, cord should be longer. Slimmer size preferrable"
It is great with whatever I use it for but it got an orange ring on the bottom in the first use…. Nothing is taking it off
Needs to last longer than 5 to 6 months. this is our 3rd one so far. I'd buy a different brand but haven't found one that isn't ugly.
"I received the Chefman Kettle in less than 24-hours.  The product box had clearly been previously opened.  The tape across the box had been cut—it was opened & not sealed.  Looking at the kettle, I could not ascertain if it was a “previously returned” item or not.  I washed it and will test it out.  If there’s an issue, I will return it ASAP…but why charge me full price and send me a “possibly” previously opened (used?) kettle?"
"I was really excited to get this and especially excited about the price. When it arrived I immediately boiled some water to test it and to start cleaning. I love the LEDs in the temperature control, although the beeping when you set the temperature seems to be louder than the beep when it's done boiling, which is kind of weird.However, the problem came when I tried to open the lid again to rinse the kettle and add more water. I had noticed when I first put water in it that the button on the lid was in kind of a strange place for a kettle, since it gets warm and is a bit hard to press, but I wasn't too worried. However, when I tried to open the lid after boiling water, it didn't open. I tried a few times, pressing about as hard as I had when I opened it the very first time, but it still didn't open. I switched my grip so I can press my thumb down as hard as possible on the button, and it still didn't open. Okay, this thing's obviously defective I thought. I tried one more time, and the lid finally sprang open, and splashed both my hands with droplets of steamy hot water! I actually have a small burn on one of my thumbs.I don't know if the kettle I got is defective or is this just a design flaw, but I will definitely be returning this kettle. I'll spend a few bucks more and get one that has the button on the handle like my old Chefman kettle did. Even if it opened readily, having the button placed where it is on this particular model seems like a really poor idea, given that if you've recently boiled water there will still be hot droplets clinging to the lid."
The description says you can heat from 160 degrees up. There's no setting for 160 degrees. Lowest is 175.
Worked great until cracks in the base were discovered with a chuck falling out.
"kettle worked fine, but the tea strainer rusted within 2 days"
The water doesn’t stay hot all day
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I like this product but it does not auto shut off when boiling at 200(purple) and 212(red) degrees. All other temps settings DO turn off automatically. I will be keeping it because i usually use the lower temp settings.
"I had an older electric kettle from CHEFMAN I received as a gift, so I figured I could get a new replacement from the same brand for good quality. I ordered this model a few months ago, and I’m finding it’s not as great as my old one.1) the boiling is very loud. We don’t have a large living space, but we can hear it across the house. It’s almost as loud as the dishwasher or washer.2) the beeping is irritating. I try to heat up water for bottles while my child sleeps, but as soon as you place the kettle on the base or start heating water, it beeps LOUDLY once each time.3) it’s faster than boiling a pot of water, but it takes a while to achieve a rolling boil.4) it accumulates so much buildup. In our area, we have somewhat hard water. If we didn’t use bottled water, we’d have to descale the kettle once every two weeks. The instructions may say quarterly, but it will definitely build up sooner than that. To clean it, we’d have to boil vinegar water in it and it takes so long to boil and rinse multiple times."
"This kettle has a terrible chemical/plastic smell. I assume it is a coating on the kettle's parts. I ran, cleaned, and soaked the kettle multiple times to remove the smell. I used white vinegar as well. However, I could not remove the smell. I used it once for my tea in an attempt to see if it affected the water's taste. It did. The water/tea tasted like the chemical smell. I ordered this based off the posititive reviews and the price. I am shocked none of these reviews mention the horrible smell and taste from the kettle. I cannot recommend. Retuning it."
Heats up fast but it beeps too much and is too loud. Wakes up others in the house. It cannot be turned off. Wish the keep water hot mode would work for other temperatures and not just the hottest one.
"Bought this kettle at the end of March and it's just now the second week of July. I noticed in May that the bottom of the kettle started to get a little discolored. I don't leave water in it and keep it dry when I'm not using it but the bottom of this kettle has continued to deteriorate. You can see where the heating component/base is because of the discoloration ring. Although it has a filter on the pour spout some of these pieces that are flaking off have been getting through that into the cup. It was an inexpensive kettle but I certainly didn't think it would start showing signs of wear after less than 2 months. On top of that there is no way to silence all the beeping it makes when you turn it on, set the temperature and put it back on the base. This one heats well but it does take a bit of time. With inflation (or corporate greed) the prices of kettles has gone up exponentially so I guess I will have to pay a lot more money to match the quality and features of my previous kettle which lasted for several years."
"So far I got this all set up and used it to make tea. I have an old electric kettle pot that started to have problems and was time to retire, plus it didn't have the insert to make teas and I was very interested in that as I'm trying to do more teas for my health.Pros: great looking device, love the LED lights, and the clear glass. Large capacity, easy to remove lid, and the tea insert, and easy controls.Cons: According to the instructions, the device will beep, turn off the lights, and shut off when at desired temperature. For me, none of that happened. You can clearly see the water boiling and I gave it at least 10 mins and it wouldn't shut off. I had to turn it off manually. Also steam was pouring out the top even around the top that I had pushed on until I heard it click into place. My old device, steam would only pour out the spout, even though the top on it was broken and that's one of the reasons I wanted it replaced. Of course all the steam pouring out made the lid incredibly hot, the whole lid, even the handle. I had to use a rag to lift the lid off. I then attached the tea insert and let the tea steep. Is this normal? Is anyone else's unit doing this? My old kettle is still working just has a busted lid. . .makes me wonder if I got a bad unit? I'll keep trying to use it but if this is how it works, I may have to send it back and keep looking."
"This tea kettle works fine except that the auto-shut off doesn't work.  The Chefman website states that if the water is boiling at a lower temperature than 212 degrees, the auto shut off feature will not engage."
"It looks really nice, love the colors, but it randomly leaks from the bottom. Not every time we pour, but it's happened 3 times and we have no idea what causes it to leak from the bottom of the glass. Then, we felt like it took forever to heat water up. So we actually did a race with our old kettle with the same exact amount of water, both to boiling, and this new one took over a minute and 40 seconds longer to get to boiling. Not worth it!"
"I got this kettle for my mother because I love my adjustable temperature Chefman with infuser.  What I didn’t realize is the infuser is stuck to the lid.  I guess that’s for safety. The problem is you have to figure out for yourself how to get it off the lid.  Just in case you are in the same position, you slide the infuser away off the lid. I don’t like this feature and would buy an old model just to avoid it. Otherwise, it heats the tea great etc."
"One of the chief benefits of using an electric kettle is usually the speed at which it heats water compared to a kettle on the stove. THIS KETTLE DOES NOT HEAT WATER QUICKLY.After filling the kettle to the Max Fill line with hot tap water (the cold water in my building smells like mildew, i know usually you'd want to use cold filtered water), turning the kettle on, and fumbling with my phone for a minute or so before getting the stopwatch started, it took over 7 minutes for the kettle to boil the water and shut off.Another thing that nettled me about this kettle was that when cleaning water gets stuck inside the lid, which could potentially result in soap contamination or mold growing, etc. I only rinsed the components, nothing was submerged at any time. I'm a lil extra sensitive to off-flavors and the idea of contamination so that might not be a big deal at all for most but it's a deal breaker for me.The tea infusion basket is difficult to install efficiently because rather than drop it in from the top you need to jam it sideways into some tabs on the underside of the lid, which is super hot from the water you just waited like 13% of an hour to boil.Besides that, it does heat water and turns off when it's done. The packaging is nice and seems to protect the kettle pretty well. Mine arrived with a large scratch on the spout, not sure where that came from but I'm returning it anyway."
"Just bought it and did some comparison with other 2 cattles with different brands.  This one looks very nice with some temp control features for tea and coffee.  However it takes significantly longer time to boil the water,  around 25% - 30% longer in 1.8lit and 1.2lit cases.  Conclusion:is it good if not use it as a tea pot?  it really depends on your patience.  Saying this it could be good if you regularly serve group of people for tea."
The lid broke after a month of use
It's not as fast as I was hoping for. I did a comparison with the one in my clubhouse. Heating is a little poor 1 liter took 06:07 to boil and the other took less than 5 minutes. It looks okay to leave on counter. The lid has a tea strainer that isn't removable which I do not like. That said the value for me is not good.
"The preset temperatures are useful.  It would have been nice to have a feature to adjust to a specific temperature too.Note that the power cord is a high gauge two-prong instead of a lower gauge 3-prong cord like the Veken (which we also have).Overall, good electric kettle."
"Very low quality material, I had to shut off manually because otherwise will continue boiling for long time. If you fill up a little bit much will spill all over the counter."
"I really wanted to like this pot. However it beeps every time you put it back which is a problem if you live in the house with others and you're trying to get ready for work while they sleep. Additionally, when on keep warm, some LED lights flash (weird) like it's having and emergency and it only keeps warm on the boil temp. Unfortunately I'll need to order a less flashy pot. The worst features are the beeping and only one keep warm temp."
Returned - it looked rather large on the kitchen counter. Wish they made a smaller size with the same features.
"I was under the impression that I was buying this brand new, but there is grease, water spots and gunk stuck to the bottom. The box had looked nice on the outside but pieces of the inside were torn leading me to think this was a return, Which makes me feel like I should’ve gotten a discount on it.I’ve yet to use it but a friend of mine has one and loves it so I hope I will too after I clean it."
"It lasted slightly over a year but had heavy daily use by multiple family members.It was nice but it does have a sharp ""beep"" when you set it on the stand and when you start it so it can awaken sleeping family members. An option to turn off the beep would have been nice. The fact that it lights up when working is great and is all you need to know that it's working. No beep required."
"Upon getting a few other-buyer questions after my review, I see Amazon is not aware they are confusing this item with another similar Chefman kettle.  Therefore, my answers may be beyond unhelpful to these people.  The one I got will NOT hold a temp.  It just shuts off.  The on/off button sets it to boil, and a temp button lets you select 4 other temperatures by pushing it a number of times.  The lid and infuser are a different design, though the rest of the device looks identical, except for the control pad.  Both seem adequate to the tasks they have, BUT!  The product description for what I bought says it will maintain a temp for an hour.  It will not.  And I believe I have incorrectly answered two questions people had about my items fraternal twin.  Amazon should be a bit more aware of what they are selling...I wanted that hold temp feature!Original review: A hold feature would be nice, and custom temperature selection.  It bothers me that I use this twice a day, and only use one button, that I need to press 4 times for my desired temp.  No doubt this button will wear out long before the unit itself stops working."
"A lot of features in a reasonably priced kettle.  Good design, nice temperature controls and quick water heating are awesome.The critical flaw (and also highly annoying) is the tea steeping process.  The spot for the tea leaves needs to be unscrewed from the inner part of the kettle top each time.  This is NOT easy and we’re one muscle twitch away from snapping the dang thing off each time.  Seems like the strangest oversight in the design given how great the rest of this kettle is."
"Bought the first one to try and it broke within weeks.  The company sent a replacement in, which also broke in several weeks.  So, the company sent another replacement.  A little over a year later it stopped boiling the water.  Not sure if I want to get another Chefman kettle at this point if I have to keep buying a new one every year."
5 different temp setting is borderline useless as it does not keep up at that temperature like other kettles do.You'd think you can select 170F and kettle to keep the water warm but no...
"The kettle has the same functionality as the previous model, but the only issue is that the top is removable, so you have to take the top completely off in order to refill with water. I prefer the hinge top.  Also - filter replacements is not existent for these kettles, so if your filter crumbles (which they often do due to the calcium and other minerals in tap water) you have to buy an entirely new kettle (which is why this is my 2nd kettle).  I use this about 4-5 times a day, so the first one lasted about 1.5 years - then the filter crumbled. I had to buy an entirely new kettle b/c filters for this model are not sold."
"Who would manufacture a product that is specifically designed to heat water, but the instructions say not to immerse the handle in water?  Yes, you guessed it.  While the product is actually a good heater, I can’t get over the fact that I’m not supposed to get the handle wet."
"Bought the kettle for temperature variability and auto shutoff (requirement for work to have in office). The kettle doesn't shut-off when is starts to boil as advertised. Troubleshot at Chefman website. Their response was that this is due to being at a mile high altitude. So if you live in the mountains, choose a different kettle."
This product boils water as expected. But water smells like some chemicals if i keep water in kettle for 5 min even kettle smells same after rinsing it with hot water + vinegar. Also i observed rust spots after using twice. Also infuser ends are not closed tightly. Unhappy with the product.
"Just looked up when I bought this pot it was January 13th, 2024, I just changed my rating to more + because the problem I was having was that as soon as I would turn on the power the pot would shut back off less than a month after I bought it. It has sat for a day without use and now it's working again, the heating element is in the pot and the bottom was wet from I think a leak, I have made my review more positive because of the price. But this is a problem that needs to be addressed."
I had them twice. Look great but never passed 2 years old before stop working. My parents have a cheap plastic kettle that runs perfect for over 10 years.
I love the pot. We drink tea in our home not coffee. Only complaint (and it’s a biggie) is that the base is poorly made. Most of the pots seem to have the same type of base though. There are tiny electrodes that engage when pot is placed on base. They keep falling out of place. The makes the pot inoperable. I threw the last one away and replaced it. This pot is to replace the same (2nd)  model. Now have two pots 1 base. I’m sure base won’t last long. There MUST be a better design!
I was using this kettle on a regular basis but after 2 months somehow it cracked during heating process & spilled water all over my counter.
We used this kettle twice every day and it only lasted 18 months. We only used it heating water. I wish they made it more reliable.
My only gripe with this kettle is that it doesn't allow for manual temperature controls. I live at altitude where the boiling point of water is lower then the 212 degree setting. If the kettle is set to this higher setting it will continue to boil the water and never shut off. When we use the lower temp settings it works just fine and will shut off. If you like your water to be as hot as possible you may need to look for another option.
Works well but leaves the water with an odd taste. Slightly bitter. I couldn't get it to stop doing that after throughly washing it.
"Well, it lasted 7 months. I liked that it came with the tea strainer.  It boiled water quickly and was very convenient.  Then it started shutting off before completely boiling.  It would finish boiling if I manually held down the switch on the handle.  Then yesterday it decided to stop working altogether.It was nice while it lasted but I’ll get a different brand this time.  Didn’t even last a year.  Very disappointing.Edit:  Finally called the company and they sent me a comparable replacement kettle, since this one is discontinued.  So, I changed my rating to 3 stars due to good customer service, but I think it might make the overall average misleading, as the rating is supposed to be for the kettle and that product was disappointing."
"Description says 3 min to boil.  I timed it--it took 8 min., 12 sec. to boil!  I get that if you have a full kettle it takes a bit longer to boil.  I had an older Chefman electric kettle and it was significantly faster than this model.  Disappointing because I liked that it had different temp features, but since I use the boil feature most, this model wasn't going to work for me."
This pot heats water quickly but the handle is bulky and the unit is heavy.
"This kettle is a great idea. It boils very fast - I timed 1.7L (max capacity) at about 7 min, which is much faster than my stove. The handle is cool to the touch, and I like the LEDs, which let you know it's still on if you're at some distance. I like the glass so you can see it boiling. This model doesn't have a flip-open switch for the lid, you have to remove it.Like other commenters, I had issues with the auto-off spontaneously switching the kettle off well before it boiled. This seemed to happen more often when it was full, but always at or below the max line.But the biggest disappointment was that the kettle failed after about 7 months of use. It will not turn on anymore. It's within warranty so I'm told I'll get a replacement. However, it took a few weeks to hear back from the company to approve the warranty claim, and it's now several months with no replacement sent yet."
"I bought this kettle because I started using looseleaf tea and liked the idea of the temperature control settings for each kind of tea. The kettle heats the water very quickly, and I love the different colors for the different kinds of tees. However, filling the kettle can be difficult because the top does not come off, and so makes it awkward fitting underneath the faucet . This also makes it difficult to properly clean the inside as a kettle in order to properly remove any water scaling. Unfortunately, I also find it difficult to use the infuser. Because the lid cannot be removed, it makes it difficult to easily put in or remove the infuser in order to make looseleaf tea. It’s just easier for me to heat the water in the kettle and then pour it over another kind of infuser."
"I have sensory issues & hearing the loud beep especially early in the morning or at night before bed if I want tea is very annoying, otherwise I’d have given this 5 stars. I wish there was a way to turn it off. If companies are gonna make things that are beeping then give an option to turn it off. Gonna be purchasing a silent one soon."
"I did a test, it boiled water 45 seconds slower than the kettle on my stove. Will be returning,"
Hello I have this 1.8 cordless electric kettle love how fast it brings the water to a boil.  Caution alert while cleaning the kettle the inside rim where the glass meets to top stainless steal rim is super share just a tap and it sliced my hand. Be careful. Great product just either a defective one I have or poor quality finish design?
"Funny thing is, my wife tells me the leak comes and goes(?)"
Struggles removing the lid.  Fast warm though
"Water takes forever to boil, even smaller volumes. Needs de-scaling every 3-4 days, even though we only use it once a day. ""Silver"" coating on a cover started to come off a week after receiving the item. I like that it can boil 1.8L but want to return because of the above."
"Like how quickly it boils water and that it has different temperature settings.  Don't like that the lid is in two pieces, often comes apart, and the 3 little spring loaded internal bits fall in my water.  Also wish there were cup markings in addition to liter markings."
"Concept is great, heating component functions wells.  But it is difficult to clean and the exterior is poorly designed. The setting buttons are on a slanted handle, causing the thin plastic protector (same as on oven timers and microwave controls) to shrivel up after only tow months daily use."
"I purchased the pot in Oct of last year. I use it about once a week to make tea. It has worked good until today, when the handle came off, therefore I am giving it 3⭐. (And the design for opening the top is not the best.)"
"I had high hopes for this product but as soon as I used it, I knew that this product is not for me. For starters I see that people give it 4 or 5 stars not because the product is great but because it has pretty lights, but let me tell you. Product/people safety was not factored in when this product was designed. When filled to the max with water it takes 10 minutes to boil not 3 minutes. The entire pot remains boiling hot including the top cover, the handle is the only piece that doesn’t heat up. If you are not careful you will get burned. Its not safe around children or animals. After the first use the inside bottom had yellowish spots that cannot be removed by washing with soap or by boiling water and vinegar. The tea infuser tube is a twist on and off the cap contraption. Be careful that you don’t break the thin tea infuser tube while trying to disconnect it from the cap, you do need to use a bit of force to remove it or put it back in place. The infuser is twisted on and off very small plastic notches on the cap.  Chefman should be ashamed for selling an inferior product"
Got this kettle thinking it would be an upgrade from a 10-15 year old kettle. Not so much. I've never had a kettle take so long to boil water it was 2x or more slower then the old kettle and even slower then the replacement I just bought. On top of that it is really loud for a kitchen appliance. By far the loudest beeps of any kitchen appliance and up there with power outage beeps on an APC. The LEDs are fun but that is pretty much all it has going for it.
"The kettle works but the different temps are not accurate as it seems to vary with water amount. Also, it is challenging to clean. At just over a year something came loose inside the bottom of the kettle that sounds like a small screw rattling about. This is the kettle, not the power base. My detailed questions to customer support were not answered at all. They sent a boilerplate response asking for a lot of hoop jumping for making a warranty claim. That indicates to us they lack the courage to point out that their warranty is only one year and we are sol being just past it. Now I read they are reluctant to honor the warranty in some reviews even when it is not past it. We will buy a different brand to replace this one."
"This kettle was great for about 3 weeks and good for about 4 months.After 3 weeks the inner bottom of the kettle started to brown. I thought it might be from tea staining the plastic inside but I'm not sure.It kept working as expected until the 4 month mark. As of this morning the glass cracked along the base and leaked water all over the counter.Fair while it lasts, but doesnt last nearly long enough."
"This looks great, but seems to take too long to boil the water and turns off too quick after the water starts boiling. I am used to electric kettles, that boil the water for at least a minute. This one does not.Also, it adds a strange oily smell and taste to boiled water. This is not the case with the other kettle I have, and this remains a mystery to me. Maybe the manufacturer can tell how to fix this?"
"Why does this have obnoxiously loud beeps every time you push a button, and every time you set it on the base?"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Pros:1) good price for the value..I returned a $60 electric one that rusted on day one!2) easy to operate/navigate.3) safety shutoff after it reaches desired temp.4) no rusting yet - I’ve been using for couple weeks I haven’t brewed tea yet with the infuser but no rusting so far. I also don’t leave water in it for long periods of time after I’m finished. I do think leaving tea in it does show rusting more. I’ve also reached a conclusion that I’m not going to die from rust and most will rust even the expensive ones!5) Diff color lights indicate did temperature and I like that bc most times I don’t need it at 212 which is hottest temp for black tea, but I can do first or second temp option which works for coffee.Cons:1) the lid on top only opens a limited amount so I can’t even fit my hand inside to wash2) as much as I like the safety shutoff I would have preferred “stay warm” option. I will say the water does stay warm for about 30 minutes so while I get my next tea or coffee ready I just hit the power button and it heats up fast in like 1-2 minutes."
"The kettle's lid opens easily, but when you place a tea bag in the infuser and pour hot water, the lid tends to fall off. This can lead to potential burns, so be cautious, as I almost burned myself!"
Took over 10 minutes to full boil on max capacity. Would be faster on the stove top.
"It has five set Fahrenheit temperatures: 175, 185, 195, 200 and 212 (boiling). It is supposed to automatically shutoff when it reaches the selected temperature but it doesn't. Where I live water boils around 205 degrees so it never shuts off on the boiling setting unless it boils dry. When I set it at 200 it still doesn't shutoff even after the water starts boiling. If I set it at 195, it doesn't shutoff until the water is boiling. I haven't checked the other two settings.  It also doesn't have a ""keep warm"" feature which limits its usefulness when you want hot water for other than brewing tea and coffee.  On the positive side, it's made of polished glass and has a wide opening so it is easy to keep clean."
"I just received my new Cosori kettle. I haven't even turned it on yet and I'm already having regrets.There are poor design decisions all around on this model.FIRST, THE LID:The lid had to be pressed firmly in place. There's no hinge, and you can't easily lift it without also holding the kettle itself (and not just the handle, unless you want to risk the hot lid also flinging up at your hand).Why is this a problem? Well, the capacity is severely lacking. This kettle barely heats enough water for 2 cups of tea or coffee, less if you use larger mugs like I do. That means if you're a heavy tea or coffee drinker, and you need to refill this frequently, you have to wait for it to cool before you can get that tight lid off and add more water.After just removing and replacing the lid about a half dozen times, I'm also hearing a slight crackling sound in the plastic of the lid's handle. It's not inspiring confidence in this kettle's longevity.CONTROLS AND SETTINGS:The control design is also not great -- on the kettle base, haven't tried the app yet.Cosori's fallen into one of the worst trends in electric kettles these days by offering presets and no manual on-board temperature controls.These are rarely accurate or adequate.This model, for example, starts at 180F, which is a bit high if you drink more delicate teas. Sure, there's the app. But why should customers be wed to yet another tool that can become buggy or introduce changed features without our knowledge or consent at the time of purchase?Kettles should be designed to last. Apps often are not. So if something happens to the app's development, or to the company itself, you might suddenly lose the extra control you're paying for when you buy this kettle.It's one more potential fail point. Fine for convenience. But granular temperature control shouldn't be limited to that. An LED screen to show the current temp and simple up & down buttons should be a priority over separate buttons for each manufacturer-chosen preset. A decent design would have fewer buttons with more customer control.This might not seem like a big deal if you only plan to use those presets. But I've used several electric kettles, and I can tell you they're very rarely accurate.Even when they're accurate at the point of the temperature sensor, that's not the same temperature of water elsewhere inside the kettle. And when you use electric kettles to brew pour-over, French press, or AeroPress coffee like I do, you'll want a very precise temperature. You can't rely on presets. You learn about variations in your kettle, then you tweak the temperature manually to account for any differences between kettle and cup.OUTER FINISH:The outer finish is another poor design choice. It came already scratched, and there's no way to fix that with this kind of finish. More, if it scratches deep enough to the stainless steel below the outer finish, you'll see it clearly due to the color contrast because this is so dark. The scratches on my lid are like this, and it doesn't seem to require a particularly deep scratch for it to be blatantly visible.THE OPENING:The opening is also less than ideal. You're unlikely to fit your hand in there for cleaning, and even a dish wand or bottle brush would be awkward given the curve of the wall.And I'm not sure why they have a rough texture to the inside of the lid unlike the more polished-looking stainless steel in the body. But the inner lid, while metal (which is good), also seemed to come coated with a dusting of some light kind of powder. The lid in general is a real disappointment.SUMMARY:Look. I have no doubt this little kettle will heat water just fine. But whereas this seems to be Cosori's ""top of the line"" electric kettle, it feels more like a ""lite"" version of what a proper kettle should be.If you're a light or casual tea drinker who doesn't mind the pre-sets and/or doesn't mind literally watching your water boil on an app, this might be great. But if you drink more than a cup or two of tea a day, drink tea or coffee quickly enough that you might have to refill this before it fully cools (so you can safely remove the lid), want real control of your kettle ON your kettle and not through a separate app, and don't just want something that will look pretty on your counter, you can find better.This does have potential to be improved. But that would require at a bare minimum a more reasonable capacity (which would also solve the narrow opening issue potentially), a better lid design, and better manual on-board controls.Still not sure if I'll even fire this up given how many problems there are after just unboxing and inspecting it. Given how long I searched for a new kettle, I'm beyond disappointed at the prospect of having to return this and start my search over from scratch. This brand came recommended, so I had much higher hopes for Cosori."
"I thought I had reviewed this product, but it must have been the previous electric kettle I purchased.  I bought this originally in 2020.  I used it for about one year because I bought a second electric kettle.I recently took this off the shelf when a friend started staying with me.  Our coffee mugs are glass mugs that hold 22 ounces, so the one kettle I had been using wasn't enough. It only holds about 28 ounces, so not enough for two cups of coffee.Within a couple of months this Cosori stopped heating.  So, I got a bit more than one year of use out of it.  It's out of warranty so I'm stuck.But, I had taken temperature readings on all settings, and then checked the temperature when I used the ""Hold"" button to see if the kettle would maintain the right temperatures.  The digital thermometer I used was a $99 Thermopen which is among top of the line used by chefs.  None of the settings except for boiling ever hit the mark.  All were off at least +/- two degrees, and more of a temp difference when I used the ""Hold"" button.  I'm not sure if that temperature difference really makes a noticeable taste difference when making white or green tea, but this product doesn't really meet up to its advertised settings.What I found most annoying is that there is a ""Max"" fill line which is inside the kettle, but it's in the back of the kettle, so when you're pouring water, you have to actually turn the kettle almost all the way around to see make sure you haven't gone past the maximum fill.  It is important to pay attention to that, btw, because if you fill over that, you can easily spill boiling water on yourself.  I know because it happened to me when my friend filled it too high.I wrote to Cosori, but there's nothing they're going to do with the pot out of warranty.  But even so, think about this...even if I HAD not put the kettle on the shelf for two years, the useful life was less than 4 years.  Planned obsolescence?  My sister-in-law had an electric kettle (different brand) and hers also lasted less than 4 years before the heating element burned out. I doubt these are made for long-term use.I need another kettle, with a larger capacity that also has variable settings since besides my beloved coffee in the morning, I enjoy a wide variety of green, white, black, and herbal teas which all need to be seeped at different temperatures.  But, lesson learned on this brand!  I won't buy it again, and all I can do is give you my experience."
"I like the style and how fast it heats up, but it never reached 212F, which is why I bought it, but will be returning it.I used 3 different thermometers 2 like the one in the picture and a candy thermometer.  All read at about 205F at the highest temperature."
"This kettle is a looker, but unfortunately that may wind up being its strongest point. After only a couple of weeks, the buttons (which ofc are necessary to use it) now occasionally refuse to turn on. If I unplug and replug the kettle, they work again. Given some of the other recent reviews, I expect the buttons to completely/permanently fail in the next couple of months. It seems like maybe a recent production run of this kettle had defective button circuitry?  It’s also finally registering in my head that I have many herbal teas stamped with a 200 degree temp pour, but this kettle only does 195 or 205. Not a huge deal, but it stands out when you buy a fancy-pants temp control tea kettle that can’t hit the recommended pour temp of the tea you’re actually brewing. It’s a shame about the buttons because otherwise I would be very happy with this purchase, even with unavailable 200 degree control."
"The kettle works, and is programmable from a phone app, but I was, and believe many others will be, disappointed by the implementation and description of its features:1. The ""Hold Temp"" feature should be called ""Waste energy."" For this kettle, ""hold temp for 30 minutes"" only means 30 minutes if you don't pick it up. Generally this feature refers to a kettle keeping water at an expected temperature for the duration of, for example, all the various iterations of a tea ceremony. This is more just keeping it warm and wasting energy while the user is doing something else.2. While not explicitly stated in the description, this is the first ""smart"" device I've ever owned that is not recognized by the Google Home app (including several devices that do NOT state ""works with Google Assistant""). So you do have to download yet another app for nothing more than controlling this kettle. Used once and deleted - waste of time/effort.So not a terrible product, No major concerns (after 2 days) but features seem demonstrative of a lack of planning, thought, and knowledgeable people on the product team."
"Ordered this 2 months ago and it had been working great - really appreciated the options and ease of use - but the top is really tight -- kind of hard to get on and off -- especially if you are wanting to heat up more water when it's still hot from first batch. Trying to push on the tight cap this morning, the handle broke right off -- kettle fell with water spilling all over my kitchen and it seems irreparable -- needless to say, very hard to pick up and pour without a handle. Lesson if you still have yours: push the cap on only when it's already down on the counter -- not while holding it."
"Worked very well for 4.5 years, then the heating element or part of the circuit for it died. Cosori customer service (which has their business set up in the US but whose products are made in China) has no repair shops they recommend, and no repair shops in my big city are willing to work on it. The heating element, circuit board, and screws are proprietary, meaning this was designed to be used a couple years, then go into a landfill, despite the fact that fixing that one part would mean another few years of use. It was a good kettle but not worth throwing all these perfectly working electronics away so soon."
"A drop of water on the pedestal or moist fingers will turn this kettle entirely off. It might start working again even if completely wiped dry, the power cord unplugged, and plugged in. Even then, it is not guaranteed that you won't have to repeat that procedure again. How would that work for your morning schedule, which likely depends on every minute? I tolerated this poor design and annoying misbehavior for about two years, but I have had enough. With my thumbs firmly down, I am dumping this kettle and getting a replacement."
"This kettle lasted for just over 2 years before the thermostat started failing, preventing the kettle from fully boiling water.Additionally it has a few design flaws:1. The vent on the lid is too close to the handle pull, causing hot steam to burn you while you pull the lid off.2. The touch buttons can be frustrating. They don't work well when your fingers are even slightly wet. An actual button would have worked better.While the quality seemed ok, 2 years out of a $67 kettle is pretty disappointing.The worst sin of all is that Cosori is not making it easy to replace the thermostat or even inspecting the kettle because they use proprietary triangular screws to prevent you from fixing your own device."
"Love the different temps for tea and it heats up quickly. The downside is chipping has occurred on the outside rim, even though It is hand washed. My biggest issue is the notification sound no longer works after only 6 months."
"I have owned this kettle for about 18 months now. Being able to heat water to the optimal temperature for French press coffee and various teas is a necessity in my household, so I love an electronic kettle with precise temperature control. This one hits that mark with added features of temp hold and a lovely design. The base is fairly compact, although the kettle's gooseneck makes it less space-saving than others I have used. The small capacity is not a problem for me, as it heats plenty of water for my 17 oz French press.Over my 18 months of having this little beauty on my countertop, I have developed a love-hate relationship with it, sometimes making me wish I could have my old Cuisineart back. First of all, because steam emerges from two different places, I have a hard time figuring out where to place it under my cabinets so that the steam doesn't damage them. If I keep it aligned horizontally (per its design), I invariably burn my hand as I am reaching for it with my dominant left hand. Moving it out onto the counter and turning the handle outward when it's in use solves this problem, but it would be nice if it could stay in one place. The lid's thin material makes it feel a little chintzy and, more importantly, difficult to remove—making it almost impossible not to burn myself (again) if I want to refill the kettle while it's hot.To summarize:Pros:Precise temperature (perfect for different teas and no-more-scalded coffee grounds)Attractive appearanceCons:Burn hazardThin lid material makes kettle difficult to open (leading to more burns)Difficult to position under cabinetSmall capacity (for some applications)That said, I am shopping for a kettle for my college-freshman son, and I will not be buying this one for him."
I LOVED my electric kettle from cosori and used it daily! Around 8 months in I noticed a water bubble underneath and suspected it was leaking but wasn’t sure — now it’s a full on leak and I need to buy a new kettle around a year after buying.
"After 4 months of use there appears to be rust and mildew inside the pot. I wash the pot pretty regularly and dry all parts accept the spout because there’s no way to do that. I guess I assumed the pot was stainless steel.Updated review- I contacted Cosori about the rusting issue. After a few conversations via email, the company sent me a new pot. I thought they were going to send a new pot but they replaced the entire unit. While I was totally disappointed with the purchase I was completely satisfied with the outcome and the Customer Service. Thank you"
It has worked great for about 18 months. I'm so disappointed I bought this in April 2022. About a month or so ago 2 of the buttons stay on constantly. Although my anal mind hates that it still worked so I tried to ignore it. Yesterday hearing to book it kept going off after about 15 seconds. It took me 20 minutes to get tepid water. The wifi feature is great if you love in cold weather but I moved a year ago to Costa Rica so heating it before I get out of bed isn't a big deal. But now I have to get a new kettle. Not sure I'll buy another.
"As is the case for probably a lot of people here, I am using this kettle to heat the water I use to brew my coffee with. I thought the presets were just that, presets, and that I would be able to select a specific temperature to brew at should I have wanted to do so. That is not the case, however. You have the presets and nothing else. Now, the presets do cover the most base needs, but even minute adjustments to temperature will have an effect on the flavor of the coffee and I don't think it is an oversight on Cosori's part not to include it for this kettle, however, you can find electric gooseneck kettles with a temperature control feature for a very similar price and for that I have to deduct some points. My second issue with this kettle is descaling it. I have no problem doing so, it's just that even though I have done so as prescribed, my kettle did not maintain a pristine condition past these 3 months. That being said, it is mostly clean and I am very proud of that. All in all, a good entry level kettle if you want to keep things simple but for 15 or 30 more bucks you can get one that lets you control the temperature and cleans up better which will go a lot farther in my opinion. I will definitely be upgrading in the next few months and may even stick with cosori given the quality of the build itself."
