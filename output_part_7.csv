"I got these on a really good deal and figured I wasn't out much if they didn't work well.Pros:These seem to sound better to other people than my previous (more expensive) ear buds when I'm using them to answer a phonecall.The sound on playback seems to do a good job.The case is pretty compact.Cons:They are a bit hard to get out of the case. They get pulled in by a magnet so they don't shake out, but breaking the bond takes a bit and if you've got big fingers, or long fingernails, it will take a bit of work.I'm struggling with the fit in my ears.  There's a weird pressure point which seems odd since they're pretty low profile.  Must be the shape of my ears!The tips aren't very easy to exchange.  After going for a sealing version and not liking it, I put the original tips back on. Pro tip, there's a front and a back side on that set!All in all, they get the job done.  Not sure I am going to be able to wear them comfortably all day, but I'm not sad about the investment in them either."
"Handy, they hold the charge quite well, and the charging case also holds its charge for a long time. I did have trouble getting them to stay in my ears, though. The fit is not snug, and I've tried all the different sized attachments. It's like they have powder or something that keeps them sliding out. (There is no powder of course, but that's what they feel like to my ears.) There's an app you can use that is supposed to help you figure out the best size for your ears, but I don't have the patience to do that, I just tried all the sizes and kept having trouble with them staying in no matter what, especially the left ear. Never had that problem with ear buds before.UPDATE: I've tried all three sets of earbuds that come with them and none of them are snug in my ear. They are elliptical shaped, not round like most. That is a cool look I suppose, but apparently not designed for fit. They just don't stay in my left ear for whatever reason. I tried other attachments from another set which fit normally, but I can't close the charging case because they stick out. Should have returned them long ago. Again, sound is good, noise cancelling is good, they hold the charge well. They just refuse to stay in my ear"
"Bought to replace my previously owned model the JBL Tune 230NC that I think jumped out of my pocket at a gas station one evening. I hope someone found them and got some use out of them but probably just got run over and thrown away. In my estimation this JBL Tune Flex model is inferior to those earlier ones in every way except for lightness and battery life. On their own merits they are decent non-apple airpods. Get them for an upgrade from stock hardware you may have. If you don't have anything to compare them to they're an ok all around performer. Compared to all the other JBL earbuds I've had over the last 10+ years these have the worst audio, surprisingly so. Really missing that good bass I've become accustomed to. Microphone pickup is ok for calls but aggressively cuts off quieter sounds. They feel fussy and prone to accidental touch input. Even the case is fussy and oddly sharp. At time of writing these are half the price of the earlier model and I can see why. Take some time to make sure these are properly fitted and use the JBL app to dial in the audio especially if you're getting these for music or video."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update: I originally gave these 3 stars and now I'm changing to 5.  I have used these for 6 months and the tabs were on improperly. They would fall out of my ears while running and the sound quality was good, but not great. The noise canceling didn't properly work; I heard everything around me in the grocery store. However, I adjusted the tabs and now it is like I have a new pair of headphones. I don't hear anything in grocery stores. I still can't tell the difference between ambient aware and noise canceling though. Yet, The sound quality is so MUCH better.Make sure that there is no gap on the outside of the tabs of your earbuds and you will get the full quality of this.Update: I really want to give these headphones a 5 star rating, but I can't. If it's not one thing, then it's another. I dropped the case once or twice, and now I have trouble charging the headphones. These have good sound quality, but I now deem them unreliable. I need good headphones for running long distance and I might need to buy a different pair because of this."
"I ordered these after losing my AirPod pros. The sound quality is great for music. I have my phone, a tablet and a tv in my office. Everytime I want to listen to a different device I have to pair them all over again. Very frustrating. It typically makes me give up. It may be more of me being used to something else more than the product. I wouldn’t purchase them again and I will be getting more AirPods."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I treated myself to an upgrade after using a $20 pair of Soundmates earbuds for the past +4 years.  The Soundmates erbuds worked pretty good, all things considered.  But after four years the battery on that set began to die after about 60 minutes of use.  So I picked up these JBL earbuds.  I figured I'd spend a little more and get a ""good"" set.  They worked well at first; the battery lasted upwards of two hours and the sound quality was good.  But nothing really stood out.  Other than battery life they were no better quality than the Soundmates pair I had been using.  And it never really bothered me until now but the case was bigger and bulkier than the cheap pair.  Wouldn't be an issue, if not for the other problems I've had.  Purchased the JBL earlier this year.  It is not October and one of the ear buds will not take a charge.  I've tried pushing it down into place but they don't seem to charge when the lid is open, so I have no way of pressing it harder into place so that it connects.  And yes, it is clean.  There's no gunk in the case preventing the connection.  So one ear bud lasts for maybe 5 minutes now and after a few months use a full charge gives me about 90 minutes of use on the other.  Was a total downgrade from the $20 Soundmates pair that I am going back to using now.  Very disappointed in this purchase."
These sound very good for the price. No problem setting them up. What is awkward is getting them out of the case. The shape desing is not an easy fit.  I was on the subway platfor and the box slipped through my hands twice. I gave it to my wife and asked her to take the pods out and she had the same trouble. I can't wholeheartedly reccomend but similar headphones cost way more.
"Bought these trying to get a cheaper option to the flasgship ear buds from Samsung/google/apple. These are just OK. Build quality is good. Bluethoot works fine but a quick note on the connection dropping for a second very rarely... it does continue playing after one second, so no big issue. Sound quality is OK on the bass but NOT good at all on the mid/highs. Volume doesn't get too loud but its OK , even more considering the ANC. ANC itself is ok but doesn't mute every noise, works more like a exterior volume reduction. I expected more from JBL at this price point. Wouldn't buy again."
"They sound ok but not very loud which is okay for me. The issue is when I put one in my ear, the sound is very low, I take the second one out of the case and the first starts working normally, then I put the second one back in the case, and the first will continue to work normal."
These do not have the bass I was expecting. They also are not anywhere near loud enough. The noise cancelling feature is not noticable to me at all. I can still hear a bunch of outside noise whether noise canceling is on it off.Lastly the fit is not good for me at all. They constantly fall out of my ears. They are very touchy. I'm constantly having to adjust them so they stay in my ears and that just triggers the settings each time I have to touch them.Very average earbuds so for JBL's these are disappointing. The price slash of 50% to $50 is still overpriced for these earbuds in my opinion.
"The sound is great for music yet when I make a call there is no noise canceling, it's more like noise amplifier! I put the talk through option on and there was a cricket in the background, i heard it but it was not that loud...yet...the person I was on the phone with said it was so loud they could not hear me and I had to go inside to finish the call! They are also hard ear structures and hurt me compared to other brands that have a softer insert."
I was hoping these would be an upgrade from my old JBL TWS ear buds since they were released a few years more recently. Unfortunately the noise canceling is not even in the same league. The TWS's would cancel out my lawn mower and I could listen to music at half volume. With these even at full volume I struggle to hear a podcast over the mower.Battery life and sound quality are good.
"Overall the quality of these headphones are decent especially for the price. The sound is good the bass is amazing, but the charging design for these is just plain bad. The little charging port in the headphones constantly gets clogged, so I have to get gunk out of them all the time but after a while the dirt and stuff in there prohibited me from being able to charge them, and unfortunately the customer service from jbl is terrible. I called them twice to get the warranty activated (which the warranty is actually amazing they said they would completely replace them for free) but they said they’d send me an email after 48 hours and I never got an email on two occasions.Overall save your money and buy a better quality longer lasting product unless you want to change headphones every two months."
"I am compelled to write this review mid-run:Indoors, these earbuds work fine. Great, even. They’re lightweight and they connect easily. If you’re a lifter or a yogi, or if your significant other finds your media choices “distasteful” and relegates you to individual quiet time, go for them.If, however, you plan to spend time outdoors with these earphones in any climate beyond the gentlest of breezes, you might consider alternative options. The current 7 mph wind on this jog has rendered a podcast entirely cacophonic, and should I dare attempt a phone call, there’d be little to differentiate it from a distress transmission from the top of Mount Everest.If our nationwide windmill strategy proves inadequate, I have no doubt the physical shape of these earphones could become the basis of a viable alternative. They are simply incredible at catching the wind and harnessing it to drive me insane.But hey, like I said, look no further if you’re an indoor cat."
"The sound quality is what you'd expect from JBL, but you have to have the right size/shape ears for these. The standard buds are too loose and the smallest adapters are too big. I tried to like these, but they just didn't work for my ears. I gave them to my dad and he likes them."
"I purchased these to replace my Airpods (2nd gen) which quit working. I generally stay far away from Apple products but I had Airpods because they sound good and they stay in my ears without the suction/ear plug tip. Since I am loathe to buy another Apple product I looked for a similar product.Pros:-Similar shape to Airpods-App to adjust settings/preferences works with Android (unlike Airpods)-Sounds pretty good to me but I'm not an audiophile and mostly listen to audiobooks-Nice options for choosing touch gestures-Good battery life-Uses USB CCons:-Case is the same style as Airpods and it's a bad design, hard to open and get them out with one hand. Also it feels a little chintzy compared to Airpods-They are a little bit bigger than the Airpods, which for me is a con-They are more touch sensitive for gesture controls than Airpods which can be annoying-When you pause with gesture controls there is a excessively long delay before it actually pauses, which is hard to get used to. This was not a problem with my AirpodsAll in all, they are pretty ok, but not great."
They activate in the case while it's closed. Sometimes they turn google assistant on which is supposed to be turned off on my phone. They battery life is short lived and sometimes last just an hour. I've had these 3 months  and lots of issues so I can't recomend
AS STATED ABOVE.....WHILE THESE ARE GOOD EARBUDS.....THEY WILL NOT PAIR WITH MORE THAN ONE DEVICE.....THAT IS WHY I RETURNED THEM.....THEY WORK GOOD IF YOU ONLY NEED THEM FOR ONE PHONE.....I HAVE TWO PHONES AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT I CAN USE EITHER PHONE WITH EARBUDS WHEN NEEDED.....THESE CANNOT DO THAT.....YOU CAN ONLY PAIR THEM WITH ONE PHONE.....WHICH MEANS YOU CAN ONLY USE THEM WITH ONE PHONE.....WHEN YOU TAKE THE EARBUDS OUT OF THE CASE.....THEY AUTO CONNECT.....WHICH MEANS.....YOU HAVE TO DELETE THEM FROM ONE PHONE.....THEN RE-PAIR THEM.....BEFORE YOU CAN USE THEM WITH ANOTHER PHONE.....B-T-W.....THE AP IS USELESS.....MOST OF THE TIME IS SAYS THAT IT CANNOT LOCATE THE EARBUDS (WHILE I HAVE THEM IN MY EARS).....
"These are the most expensive Bluetooth earbuds I've purchased, and their sound quality, fit, and battery life are significantly better than the ones I've had from unknown brands at half the price. I also like the app and the ability to function to help find them.However, there have been some frustrations, and I would probably get a cheaper burner pair to replace these.1. You need to wait for the lights to come on before removing them from the case. If you remove them too quickly, they'll still be off. And there is no way I'm aware of to turn them on without putting them back in the case and taking them out again. There's no touch motion or anything to turn them on, which all my cheaper pairs have had. It's not awful, but a little frustrating.2. I have only had my a couple of months, and at first everything worked well. But now about 10 to 25% of the time one of the earbuds won't actually charge in its case, so when I get it, the battery is still essentially dead.3. This is closely related to 1 and 2, but sometimes when I remove an earbud from the case, it just doesn't register, so it won't turn on, and there's no other way to turn them on. Sometimes putting them back in and taking them out again works, but not always. Sometimes you just have to forget about it and hope it works later. The troubleshooting guide mentions cleaning the buds and case connectors, but there's no visible issues and my other much cheaper buds didn't have this issue at two months.4. I lost the small tip for the left bud. It fell off in my pocket or something. It doesn't seem too easy to remove, but it's tiny and gone now. They don't feel bad without the tip, and I still have the larger tips, but it is frustrating."
Let me just start by saying that the battery life is amazing but the sound quality is terrible so you get what you pay for in that regard. I recommend buying a more expensive pair of wireless headphones if you want or are looking for better sound quality.
"I own two pairs of these, and they're a great deal when they're half off. I wouldn't buy at full price.PRO: They work great for making phone and video calls; the mic is MUCH clearer than my Apple airpods and airpods pro.CON: Very short range, you basically need to carry your device with you. And after 2 months, one of the earbuds stopped charging, and I have to send for warranty replacement."
"Pros- Theres an app that you can use to change the bass/mid/treble for the headphones .- No issues with them staying in my ears, even while running. Plus it comes with three different ear bud sizes.- Definitely sweat/water resistant- I've had the headphones for about a year and they still hold the same charge and take no time to charge.Cons- If not in the charging case, the headphones will continuously search for a device until the batteries runs out.- After a few months, the connection between the case and the headphones has become finicky, so i can't tell if they're actually charging. Half the time I take them out in the morning, I'm immediately met with a ""Battery Low"" warning.- When running, the amount of wind I can hear in my headphones almost drowns out some songs/podcasts.- $100There are headphones out there that are just as nice, but half the cost."
"These are okay, they stay in my ears fairly well but the sound and noise canceling is disappointing - I expected better from JBL. I got them on sale and they are fair for the price however I would not buy at full price"
so i have had these sense Sept 5. so far one ear (left) does charge int he case. and usually goes out. the sound it good and they stay in my ear just fine. even during my workouts. My main issue is getting the left side to charge. I figured out how to work the app which shows you if its charged and how much battery everything has and it just the one ear. Having it a month and still have to buy different headsets is the most annoying part.
"These headphones are not good at all. I have been using them for about a month and I have encountered the following problems.1. The headphone case often emits completely random ""beeps"", the Customer support believes that the problem is due to the headphones not being charged correctly and suggested to clean the case, which is false because the headphones are charged perfectly, the case is clean but it emits rings anyway. Even when there are no headphones inside2. The gesture controls are made by a complete idiot. The JBL application does not allow customization of the different gesture controls but only a choice between 3 different modes (one worse than the other). Furthermore, there are non-modifiable gesture commands for resetting or turning off the headphones. I cannot tell you how many times, taking off a headphone and holding it in my hand for a few seconds, it has disconnected from the phone or turned off and returned to factory settings.  The gesture command in question is too simple (touch + hold for a few seconds) and I'm sure that all users have done it by mistake at least once while holding a headset in their hand.3. The shape of the Case is not comfortable. The door that opens to remove the headphones closes too easily. I have used several headphones in my life and this is the only case in which I have to use 2 hands to insert or remove the headphones.4. It is not possible to turn off the equalizer. The application allows you to choose between different equalizers (Jazz, Club etc.) and allows you to create custom ones but it is not possible to turn off the equalizer.The only good thing about these headphones is the audio quality, that's the reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. Volume is not great either"
"Not sure why one earbud doesn't charge, I've left them in the case for hours and seems like the left side isn't charging....unless I wiggle it in the case. The sound quality is good though."
"The sound is not the best but given the price it is satisfactory. It even has an equalizer in the app that lets you fine tune better. I have no complaints regarding that.The battery life is also good enough. No problem with that either.However, there are many user experience problems and some are deal breakers for me.1. The noise cancellation - It is very generous to call it noise cancellation. The difference is almost imperceptible at times. It only works if the sound is coming from a specific direction (in which cases the noise gets reduced, but not cancelled). I don't care too much about this feature, but if you do this is not the product for you.2. The touch controls - You will activate the touch controls to remove the earbuds from the case. There's just no way around it. The only point of contact to remove the earbuds is where the touch controls are. When removing the earbuds you will turn on/off the noise cancellation, start/skip a song, activate the assistant etc... I have no idea how this issue passed QA/QC testes.3. The assistant - If you use assistants, it's great! If you don't, there is no way to turn it off. Holding the touch control WILL start the assistant. You can only choose whether you want google's assistant or the native one.4. The fit - This is my first earbud. I knew I would hate the fit, but I tried all four tips and regardless of the size of the tip the earbuds kept falling from my ears. I guess earbuds are just not for me?"
"When I first started using these headphones I thought they were a good upgrade from the previous brand I was using. They are more comfortable than others I have tried and the pods don't fall out of my ears which was my biggest concern when purchasing. However, now that I've been using them for about 3 months there are multiple things that drive me crazy. 1) The Bluetooth DOES NOT disconnect when the pods are placed back in their case, or the pods will randomly connect to my phone when never being taken out of their case to begin with. It's incredibly annoying to have to turn off or disconnect my Bluetooth every time I want to listen to something without the pods. 2) They don't charge very well. I will say the battery life does last a long time when they're charged, but I'll have a fully charged case and the pods have been in them for a full day and I'll pull the pods out and one of them is dead. 3) They really do not work great on calls. Some calls work perfectly fine and others there is a delay in hearing sounds from one ear to the other, or things get super crackly and you can't hear anything. Overall they're not a bad pair of headphones, but for a few more dollars you could probably get a pair that doesn't have these same issues."
"Gotta be honest the audio quality blew me away. Phenomenal audio quality and with the JBL app which has many unique tweaking features to make sure the headphones are exactly what you want them to sound like. Very good quality of life features for those of you who really enjoy your tunes. This product only gets three stars from me because of durability. I've had to return my first purchase of this product after 2 weeks because I dropped one of the buds on the ground and completely broke the main speaker of the headphones.  I thought it was a fluke, so I returned and got another pair. After a month, I accidentally dropped it again and same exact problem. Main speaker broke. If you aren't prone to clumsiness I STRONGLY recommend these headphones, but if you THINK you're going to drop one within 3 months, find something else"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            i’m a dog groomer, and i often need my hands free as i’m working with dogs and i have to be honest im not a fan of these earbuds for many reasons. i have very small ear canals, sadly not many ear phones fit my ears if they aren’t in-ear designed. i still have a hard time keeping these staying in my ears vs airpods.i wanted to try something new. i like the soft (silicone?) material of the buds, but i do believe i am having an allergic reaction to them. since wearing the flex tune my ears itch and formed a  dry rash, never have i experienced this from earbuds/earphones. let’s talk about the battery life, my case stays connected to a small power bank i carry with me, the case charges while i use the earbuds during my 9-5 shifts. as you see in the video when i get to work i pull my JBLs from my bag, case is fully charged & like clock work within minutes of using the buds ALWAYS my right one yells  “battery low” how when youve been sitting in a fully charged charging case overnight? so usually i have to depend on my left most of the day. throughout my shift i have to switch between buds as the other one charges, sometimes they will be in my ears completely dead. sometimes putting the right one in the case and then right back out will turn it on.. weird.volume i am not a fan of, my job is loud and i have to pause what im listening to a lot, when i hit resume the volume decreases drastically for some odd reason, often having to long hold one of the earbuds for it to return to a decent louder volume. i’ve been using my jbls may 4th. next time i will stick with something more familiar. i really wanted to write a good review but the bad tops the good. the case is cutely designed, i’m a big fan of the feel of the material like i mentioned before, sucks im possibly allergic to ising them."
"My specific device is probably a lemon. I’ve had it for a few months now, and I’ve had a persistent problem with the left earbud connecting to the case’s battery to charge. It doesn’t sit well within the socket, and bc it doesn’t identify the connection, it stays connected to my phone. I lose my place when listening to music/podcasts, and more importantly the battery does not charge. The left earbud dies quickly, doesn’t connect to the charger, doesn’t disconnect from the phone, and won’t reconnect to the phone when coming out of sleep mode. The worst part is that I haven’t found a customer/technical support for the device, so I haven’t been able to fix what could be a simple problem."
The sound was decent but the left ear is already not working. I have to buy more headphones
"I’ve only dropped them one time when removing a sweatshirt. The left one survived and the right while functioning as a pause and play, stopped playing sound. The fit isn’t very snug but I imagine much bigger to snug the fit up would probably make them less comfortable too."
"They're not very good workout headphones. They're pretty okay to use on hikes, but they're terrible when you're doing the dishes. The open ear tips are great in terms of sound, but I can't see myself constantly changing back and forth with the sealing tips, so I'll stick with the sealing ones.The one really bad thing about them is how often I put my earbuds in the case, but they're still connected to my phone. I have to fidget with the earbuds multiple times or just turn off my Bluetooth altogether."
"I got these earbuds to replace a pair of Apple AirPods Pro 2nd Gen, ONE of which is lost (naturally) and doesn’t show up on FindMy because it’s out of power. Didn’t want (can’t afford) to spend $300 to replace them…Soooo … I chose these as replacements. The earbuds arrived when promised, well packaged, looked fine. Now for the details:It’s kind of annoying to have to download JBL’s app, but at least it’s free. The earbuds themselves have great sound quality, and the mic picked up my voice OK when I had to take a call in a crowded area and wanted to speak softly. Those are the pros.The cons, for my particular situation and tastes: I chose these buds for the noise cancellation feature, and guess what? The tips that support that feature are not on the buds when they arrive. The installation diagram was confusing to this late Boomer, and I didn’t want to ruin the things, but I finally figured out that … Yes, you have to pull off the tip which looks as though it’s part of the bud in order to install the noise canceling tip.That problem solved, I moved on to pairing, which went OK, although I had to do some setup both in the app and my iPhone Settings. Annoying, but acceptable.The real problem with these earbuds is this: Whenever I touch a bud to adjust the fit, or replace it after it falls out (which seemed to happen more frequently than with my AirPods), it messes up the playing of my podcast or YouTube video. Sometimes it arouses Siri. Once I get the bud(s) seated firmly again, it will sometimes play some random thing that I never heard before and don’t want to hear again. Worst of all, several times I had to re-pair the buds through Bluetooth. I attribute this issue to the earbud controls. I don’t really want to use on-bud controls. When someone calls, Siri says: “Call from Xyxyxy. Answer it?” And I can tell her yes or no or whatever. I never had to re-pair my AirPods.Someone will probably tell me there’s a way to configure the JBL app and/or my iPhone Settings to eliminate this problem, but I don’t have the patience to deal with all that stuff. These buds are going back to JBL and I am ordering a replacement pair of AirPods Pro — Used - Like New — from a seller with good ratings at a decent price point and delivery date.Overall, these earbuds are great quality for the price, and would probably be perfect for someone who actually wants and uses the earbud controls (unlike me), someone interested in music streaming or video gaming. I hope some other buyer will give them a happy home. 😸"
I bought these as they were on sale.  They do work but not very well.  When using them for a phone call I can not get the volume up loud enough to hear.
"Sound quality is excellent. Noise cancellation is my issue. App settings don’t change much if any for cancellation, wind noise is amplified if outside, speakers pop and crack to try to adjust for loud noises even when on hear through mode. Comfortable fit, good battery life, and reasonably priced but would not recommend for outdoor or active use, best for in home/office"
"The sound quality is fantastic and battery life is also pretty decent unfortunately it has major charging issues, like 25% of the time one of the earbuds will not charge."
"I’ve always used Plantronics and the noise cancellation that I am interested is during phon calls. I want to try something new due to the boom mic. The JBL have real good sound quality but if the wind is blowing or if your outside people complain about all the noises they hear in the background. I can care less about noise cancellation with music on. I can be an a tractor bushhoging with a 10 foot cutter Using the Plantronics, and no one even knows I am on the cutting. They would be a 4 if they had noise cancellation during phone conversations In the control buttons was not quirky. Maybe even a 4.5! I’m sending these back and getting something if someone knows something about the level two or three on the same models that may have what I’m looking for please let me know."
"Too big and falls out, but the option for in ear tips sounds like the sound was playing through a tin can. I have small ears but they hurt as soon as I put them in. Even with the smallest tips or open ear tips, still hurt immediately. I expected these to be much smaller. Returned within first couple days."
"Okay so the sound quality and the way these headphones fit into my ear are all great.  But if you plan on trying to pair this device with more than one other divide, maybe think again?  Anyone else facing the problem of struggling to pair with multiple laptops and such?  The device does not show up in the bluetooth finder for other devices once I have it paired with my cell phone.  Advice welcome.  Would hav liked to give this 4-5 stars but alas."
"While the overall sound quality is OK, and the battery life is great, the fit is the issue. Using all the provided ear pieces it still never fits perfect quite right for long term listening. Biggest issue is that it does not seal out sound so the noise canceling doesn't do much. Shows why it's such a cheaper unit. But last two sennheiser units died so tried cheaper and wasn't fulfilled."
Good earbuds. Been using JBL since before Bluetooth was a thing. These earbuds stand to their quality. My only con with these earbuds is figment. They probably work better for some but not for me. Probably has to do with ear shape and what not. I tried different sizes included but couldn’t get a tight seal around the ear without them slipping out. I ended up using round cushions from another set of earbuds and got the seal I wanted. They sound great when sealed properly but before that there was almost no noise cancellation whatsoever.
"I bought these earbuds for two reasons. First, I needed something to replace a very old pair of JLAB that lasted over 6 years. Second, I was limited by budget. I saw a couple of reviews and thought I'd give them a try. I've regretted the choice and should have sent them back. Sound is mediocre, they pick up a lot of outside noise, they are not even close to noise canceling, fit and touch is very sensitive. On a positive note, the price was good and the battery life is great. They are very good for phone calls. And I've been told the voice quality on the receiving end is very good. The app that supports it allows you to adjust the EQ but that's about it. You can't even control the volume without using phone. They might be good for someone to give to a young person who breaks or loses things easily, but for anyone looking for quality sound this is not the one. Move on."
"The right side speak is getting quieter and quieter. I keep and have kept them clean of earwax. Never got them wet. I got them this year in January and it is now the 1st of August. These are the second pair I got since I thought the first ones died within the year and I thought it was just a faulty pair. Turns out I’m 2 for 2 with the bad ones. I do love the finding feature. They squeal really loud so you can follow the sound. One fell into my car door slot and I couldn’t find it cause I didn’t even think to look there. Also, noise cancellation only work when both headphones are in. Not a big deal, just something to note"
"They're ok, If they're not on sale though they're definitely not worth it, but for 50 bucks it's passable, still a lot better options out there."
"First this is I am mostly returning them due to a problem I have with them cutting the volume capabilities without the max volume limiter on. I try turn them up as loud as I can and it stays the same, a phone call seem to be the only thing that fixed it on the go. Secondly they are very huge for my little ears compared to something smaller like the Apple headphones, they have fallen out of my ears. Make sure to keep your hair or any other object off of the head set you'll hear the rubbing coming through the buds! Most other big dislikes it my calls are not quiet on the other end I can hear the other person nicely but if you're somewhere load, bird chirping, and/or cars driving by they can hear it and it will stomp down your voice. I truly wanted to like them because they were the same shape as my apple headphone."
"As the title suggests: the sound is great and the battery life is good too. They charge fairly quickly. I don't have many negative things to say about the quality other than the fact that it took about 2 months for the ear buds to give me trouble as far as charging goes. They wouldn't always connect in their box and sometimes they wouldn't charge at all. It would take a bit of wiggling, but they'd eventually charge.After about 6 months the right ear bud stopped charging altogether and now 7 months later they both don't charge at all.All in all you won't be disappointed with the sound and battery life, up until a certain amount of time."
"I bought these to replace a lost pair of Apple Airpods. They do the job and the sound quality is good but they feel very cheap and are clunky compared to my airpods. They do not stay in my small ears as well either. Overall, I wish I would have just spent a little more and bought Airpods again."
"So, these were particularly appealing to me because I can't stand full in-ear earbuds. It's not easy to find semi in-ear earbuds and when you do they are usually pretty low quality. These 'looked' a step above that, I was definitely wrong to think that.Pros:Battery LifeANCApp is decentBuildCons:Sound. While the sound wasn't bad there is a small caveat, something is wrong with these earbuds, I've seen a few people mention this, but whether it's a frequency thing or they are just poorly made, every so often they will blowout the sound and make a loud what can only be described as white noise. This happens more often than I would have liked.Overall longevity... I've used these pretty frequently in the 4 months of owning them and I can't say that I've ever dropped either of the buds or did anything egregious to them. That being said, after 4 months, right earbud no longer has sound out of the tip, sound comes through the speaker on the inside of the earbud. Renders that earbud all but useless, while you can still hear sound from it, it's low volume and muffled.Tried cleaning, resetting the earbuds, re-pairing etc. JBL approved an RMA for them, I will probably resell the replacement at a loss as I fear these are just flawed by design and will just happen again."
"I bought these on sale during one of the deal days so I wasn't expecting the greatest product. But even at the discounted rate, I don't know if it was worth the money. They're definitely better products out there for similar or cheaper prices (compared to the full price of the product).The audio quality is better than a pair of $10 wireless earbuds, but aren't a true JBL experience. The only difference between ambient and noise canceling is that with ambient, the outside noises are projected through the earbuds. But otherwise the noise canceling aren't really noise canceling at all.As for the hardware itself, they aren't very comfortable even with multiple cushion sizes. The earbuds have a hard time connecting with the charging prongs in the bottom of the case. So often your earbuds don't realize they're in the case and should be turned off. So then you wake up with one earbud fully charged and one on 5%.The tap interface is really well thought out but poorly executed. The same taps don't all work with every app. The pause/play and skip features on the earbud don't work at all with Spotify. Which is a major oversight considering it's debateably the largest music player for phones. And the command to talk with your phone changes depending on what type of phone you have. And it changes based off of what app you have open.It is by no means a horrible product, but you should explore other options before deciding on this one, unless you find it on sale."
"These earbuds are of a good quality, the sound is good. However, the noise cancellation could be much better, even on the highest noise cancellation level I can still hear outside noise. The comfort level and fit is good. What would make it better though, is a wireless charging capability."
They render a good sound but it was not my priority.I wanted to replace my old wired Bose earphones. They are still much much better than JBL ones.Thus I will not bring the new JBL Tune flex with me when travelling. (especially by flight).
Not impressed I mean it’s good for the discounted price I got it at not impressed I loved their other speakers and ect and the last ones I bought like this but these ones feel uncomfortable sound is not where I thought it would be
Sound is good...but they are hard to get to stay in your ears
"I bought these to replace a $12 cheap off-brand set. The sound quality was definitely improved. Pairing was irregular. Some days it doesn’t want to pair. Some days only one ear bud will pair. Sometimes I can’t get it to unpair. I’ll put them in the case and close the lid and they will continue playing music. Sometimes the case doesn’t recognize the headphones and won’t charge them.  The active noise canceling is probably better than nothing.  If I get them just right in my ears, I can notice a reduction in noise. They pick up wind though and make a buzzing sound. When I say wind, I mean the air movement from walking around the office causes buzzing. It did work to reduce engine noise on an airplane, but it’s miles from the reduction I got from my Sony headphones. They weren’t worth the $50. I honestly preferred the $12 pair I lost."
"My pros and cons.... the cons out weigh the pros (battery life and clarity) so I will only list the cons.I have only had these for 1 month andAbout 60% of the time one of the buds does not seem to have charged. And I have to put it back and try again later.  About 80% of the time one bud will not connect and I will have to put it back in the case and take it out again, sometimes it takes a couple tries for it to connect.Theses are also hard to get out of the case if you are not super careful you will touch the control button and activate the controls like skip, pause ect..The app can never find the earbuds so I can't give any comment on that.I will not purchase these again because they are too frustrating."
"Not quite like the Air pods, but do work.  My daughter wants the air pods and says the sound is different and they don't stay in her ears as well."
"I'll keep it simple. With or without the tips I found them to have relatively weak bass and low volume if you turn up the bass EQ in the app to compensate.Otherwise they're comfortable. FYI they're good for sleeping on your side as well, and the touch features work very well. Battery life at 6 hours is good, and the ""low battery"" announcements are discrete, didn't find them intrusive like some other earbuds I've tried."
Sound is ok for the price range. Connectivity is always good for JBL. Only problem was they do mot stay fix in ears. Very hard to use in gym.
"i have small ears ,it can't fit"
"The headphones worked amazing at first, I do use these while I'm working and while at the gym. After about 5 or 6 months the right ear bud no longer works as it once did. There is sound but it is very low, so now I am down to only one earbud. Not sure what the warranty is on this product but I am disappointed."
I actually do like these. I use them mostly for Ms Teams calls on my pc. For that these work really well. Unfortunately after a couple of months I started developing dermatitus in my outer ears. A strong antibiotic would clear this up and within a week of using them again it would come back. I found a group of users experiencing the same thing after a week or so of searching. That at least let me know I wasn’t going crazy. Moving on to something else.
"The only issue is they don't stay charged as advertised and once one goes dead even if the 3 lines are lit they do NOT charge the dead headphone until you have the 3 lines, which is so weird so I don't know if I got a malfunctioning pair or not but if you use off and on they work good."
"The price was great, but you get what you pay for.These earbuds are difficult to remove from the case.If you need to adjust in your ear you inevitably end up turning off or changing from ambient aware to noise canceling.Lots of wind soundWill be returning and getting another set of theJBL Tune 225TWS"
"This earbuds had a good sound quality but they lie about the ANC technology, they're dangerous because if you are in a working area where a decibels are higher and you wearing this with the ANC activated, instead protecting you from higher decibels they're amplifying the noises so be aware about planing to used for that application."
"I read such great reviews and did not expect to have any issues until I tried connecting on a call. At first I thought it was the other person on the end, but after several issues with different callers, I realized the headphones were the issue. Very disappointing as it is difficult to find fitting earbuds such as these (without the adaptable pieces). Do not waste your money unless you only plan on listening and not using it to make calls or commands."
"You get what you pay for. Be prepared for NO noise cancellation. I can't tell the difference between ambient and noise cancellation. The volume quality is not great so I have to keep it at the highest level to hear clearly since background noise cannot be minimized. Also, as some others have mentioned the earbuds seem to easily fall out of your ears and are not very stable.Some annoying features:-When I take the earbuds out and sit them down, they don't stop playing, so the battery continues to drain on both my phone and the earbuds and content is playing with no one listening-I have to manually ""disconnect"" from Bluetooth when not using the earbuds so they don't automatically connect while they're in their case when I get a call-When a setting is changed on the earbud with a tap, there's an audio dictation announcing the change - very jarring if you're asleep with the earbuds or trying to focusI'm giving these earbuds 3 stars because they work, but they're average. Do they meet my expectations? No, but at least I didn't go broke paying for them."
"Good sound. Like others have said, the right ear bud stops charging and stops working all together. Bought in November 2023, it’s only August 2024 and the right ear bud is useless. Unless customer support helps, will not buy again and will not recommend."
Could not get silicone buds on ear buds to make a more secure fit. Ear buds did not stay in ear comfortably.
"Was excited when I first popped these in, (using indoors) the sound for music and podcasts was fantastic, better quality than Apple product.  The case is compact, that's a plus --  It does not wirelessly charge (which I knew buying), that's negative.  The app for the buds is good, but doesn't add much value -- the ANC/Noise cancel app function seems worthwhile upfront, but ultimately doesn't work properly.  And with that, the BIG NEGATIVE:  when using outdoors, any slight breeze/wind causes terrible feedback into the earbud speaker, even when running when there's no wind outside, it's hard to hear music over the noise feedback of the wind hitting the earbud mic.I wanted to love these things, but had to return due to the design flaw of the mic feedback."
Battery life did not meet standards and my right earbud no longer functions. It won’t charge nor connect.
"Great sound quality as expected of JBL, the battery life with the case I have been able to go two days without charging and still have the buds at 100 percent also has a nice app to control everything with a lot of features including using the app instead of the bud taps and a nice eq. The talk through is a handy feature and the mics are awesome quality and taking calls with the buds in is no issue. As good as they have been the fit is always a bit awkward, this not only leaves me constantly readjusting them but also makes the noise cancelling not great unless you blast the music. The last issue with them is they don't sit well in the case either on occasion leaving them to not charge and be a nuance and for 100$ I didn't expect to run into the same problem I had with a 30$ pair of off brand earbuds I had before this."
"At first I was really excited to transition to these and leave my AirPods in the past but sadly these didn’t reach any of my expectations. The best part of the earbuds were that they did fit comfortably and that was one struggle of mine when trying to look for new earbuds. While using these they would buffer and lose connection with my phone pretty often and sometimes just stop on its own and I’d have to pause what I’m doing to figure out why. The other sad thing was the sounds quality, for it was not loud enough and I’d see that most of the time I’d have the volume maxed out to get some kind of quality audio. The crisp of the sound wasn’t there, sounded sort of muffled and I did make sure it wasn’t just me by having others in my family try it and compare them to the old AirPods I’ve had for a long time now. Ended up returning them."
I had no issues with the earbuds until the 3 month of using it. The left earbud began to have a problem connecting with the audio and there was delay between the right and left earbuds. I was able to get a replacement for the headphones however the case will not charge and the battery level runs very quickly.
I’ve had these headphones for about 8 months. The sound is fine. About what you’d expect. However a couple months ago the right ear bud stopped charging in the case. Now my right ear bud is rarely charged and it takes a while to get it in the perfect spot to charge at all. Music continues playing in the ear buds when I put them in the case because of the connectivity issues. My phone stays connected. The whole thing is a pain. Disappointing for a product that cost this much.
Bought them because they were good but had to buy a 2nd pair because the the left earbud in the 1st pair wouldn't sit properly on the case and it wouldn't turn off.
The sound quality is good but they began to hurt after a hour
"If you’re planning on just listening to music these are fine. If you’re planning on making calls I would highly recommend not buying these. A slight wind from a fan or the wind makes these unusable during phone calls. As all you will hear during the conversation is “I can’t hear you”. As all these extra microphones that they put in, pick up everything but you when there is any disturbance. Also they constantly disconnect during a phone call adding to the frustration using these for a phone call."
Worked for about 8 months then one ear wont charge and the other produces little sound. Ambient aware and noise cancellation are identical so no difference in sound. Decent quality. DONT RECOMMEND BUYING UNLESS ON SALE
It was a gift but one earbud would not maintain a charge.
"Noise cancellation on airplane is terrible, use the 130 TWS for airplane"
Battery life is not what I would have expected from JBL
"The sound quality is great, the fit is good and the controls are nice and responsive.  The problem is the earbuds charge when they feel like it. Maybe mine is defective but I’ll put it into the case to charge sometimes no problem other times I’ll be ready to go to work put them on and just to hear battery is low and I get to enjoy a long train ride with no music.I really want to like these headphones but it’s really frustrating."
I don’t like that it doesn’t stay connected to my iPhone
Wouldn't pay full price. the app is basically worthless. have to be cleaned with alcohol to remove oils to prevent them falling out. volume is terrible and has to be turned all the way up.
"I will say that the sound quality is decent, I haven't experienced any ear pain from their weight or shape while in use. However, there is non existent noise canceling. I think it might have kicked in on accident one time while I walked from my car to a building. Otherwise zero noise cancelling even when cycling through the audio options multiple times in app and the tap feature. I've tried to like these so much but this is a half baked product. The earbuds will randomly register as in use while in their case and play whatever audio app I have in the background. This has been extremely annoying when I put them away after listening to audiobooks. (Since they register as still active while in the case the audio book keeps playing and I have to hunt for the spot I left off on, this has happened at least twice a day for months.) Because it registers as in use, the batteries drain while in the case and I'll wake up the next day having to plug them in to charge. Yes they charge at a decent rate but the purpose is defeated if I'm constantly having to recharge them when they shouldn't've been on in the first place. Another thing is that when you take them out of the case and put them in your ears everyone once in a while they will blast your ear with their initial audio prompts even if you left them at a low audio setting. (I never have the volume above 75% already but it sounds close to 100% volume when the issue does occur.) I don't like leaving bad reviews and try to tough things out but this product has been a thoroughly unenjoyable purchase. I do not recommend this to anyone."
"The earbuds are ok, I guess for the price they are pretty ok,the noise cancelation though, is pretty bad, I cannot tell the difference when it is on or off.They sounds real good though, the reason why I am giving them 3 stars is because a) the noise cancelation not as good as other brands, and b)  the integration with iOS is pretty lackluster.Perhaps I should have gotten a pair of Beats, (my Air Pods Pro got water damage and I was in a hurry to get some new buds).Also, the app is very very lackluster, not good, they recognize the earbud whenever it wants even if they are on and playing music.the UIX is pretty lame. I can't believe Huawei makes better apps for their ""freebuds"""
"If your headphones turn off and you do not have the case, THERE IS NO WAY TO MANUALLY TURN THEN ONgiant flaw."
"They'll cancel sounds in a quiet room well enough, but the house music in the gym are as loud as if noise cancelling weren't on."
"I picked this product based on the majority of the reviews were positive.The best part about these earbuds is they were easy to sync with iPhone & Windows PC.  I was able to easily sync one earbud with one device and another earbud with a separate device.  This allows me to use one earbud on two separate devices at the same time.Ears are shaped differently, so when I put the earbuds in my ear I complained about the fit, however my wife tried the earbuds and thought they were a perfect fit.The design showing the charging status of each earbud is perfect.  The individual controls on each earbud are easy to operate and respond well.  I received these earbuds two weeks ago and tested them on a phone call and listening to a podcast.  Their ability to hold a charge is impressive.Let’s talk about sound quality, the volume and sound works well, if the earbuds are worn correctly.  When talking on the phone I was told that I sounded like I had moved away from my phone.Overall when you compare cost, comfort, fit, sound quality, controls & ability to easily sync  with other devices you are purchasing a good product."
"If you pay around $25 for these earbuds and your ears are the right shape, you might be extremely happy with these earbuds.  My ears are not the right shape, and I had to return the earbuds.When the earbuds arrived, I tried all three sets of eartips.  I often have to use the largest eartips, and the largest were the best for me in this case.  (I'm a 6' tall man.)  But even the largest eartips were far from good enough.  I did hear strong bass if I tightly held the earbuds deep in my ears.  But if I let go, almost all the bass was gone.  I immediately initiated a return and bought another brand.Before I returned the Aptkdoes, however, I noticed a pair of very old eartips sitting near where I set the Aptkdoe box down to remember to take it to the car.  These eartips may have come from an iPod 25 years ago.  (I've used them with other newer earbuds, though never before with ""true"" wireless earbuds.)  Perhaps I noticed that the iPod eartips are larger than the largest ones that came with the Aptkdoe earbuds.I decided to try my old iPod eartips, and I was shocked.  I wouldn't say that these earbuds have a premium sound, but with my old iPod eartips, the sound was outstanding.  The bass was strong, and I loved it.  They're very loud, but they don't have to be loud if you turn down the volume.  The range, balance, and detail are excellent.  I say that they don't have a premium sound because the sound is slightly muddier than premium, but for an inexpensive pair, they come amazingly close to premium.Unfortunately, with my old iPod eartips, my left ear hurt constantly, and my right ear hurt a little occasionally.  I replaced the left iPod eartip with another from my collection that was slightly smaller but still bigger than the largest ones included with the Aptkdoes.  The sound was still excellent, and my left ear hurt less than with the iPod eartip.I went for a run and made a phone call while on the run.  The person I called thought that the noise suppression might be slightly better than with my previous earbuds (Treblab 3 Pro--before they ""updated"" them to a cheaper construction).  To me, the voice of the person I called wasn't exceptionally clear, but it was perfectly adequate.  The person I called said they heard me more clearly than with my previous earbuds.Once I got home and removed the earbuds, however, I realized that the pain was too great, and I initiated a return.  I didn't want to start hunting for eartips that would make these earbuds both comfortable and sound good.  I don't know if that would have been possible given the shapes of my ears.Except for the reviews that appear to be professionally written, I believe the reviews from people who rave about the sound quality of these earbuds.  I can easily believe that the sound quality is outstanding if your ears are the right shape.A minor point:I don't think that there's a way to turn these earbuds off besides putting them back in the case.  If you sweat like me (or at least like I did when I was younger), you won't want to put them in the case immediately after a run or workout.  So all you can do is pause or stop your music app and let them dry off while turned on before you put them back in the case.  (Can you swab the charging contacts with alcohol while the earbuds are on?  I don't know, but there seems to be a consensus that swabbing the contacts with alcohol prevents oxidation that interferes with the ability to charge.)However, I'm a little confused about whether they can be turned off when outside the case, because I did hang up on the person I called when I was trying to lower the volume.  But when I was done with my run, I couldn't find any way to turn them off.  I wrote a question about this on the earbuds' Amazon page, but no one has responded."
I like everything about these ear buds except the volume if u wear 1 ear bud u can’t adjust the volume because the up & down are on 2 different buds. This is a design flaw I hate it! I wear my right ear bud while I work so I have to adjust the volume on my phone the left has the up volume right has the down. I’m just happy they connected easily & they last 5-6 for sure I haven’t had them say low battery while wearing them for 5-6 hrs I haven’t exceeded that yet. I don’t think my ear holes can tolerate any longer than 5-6 hrs. They get uncomfortable after that. I have small ear holes & they fit perfectly. I love the purple color as well!
"I ordered this 3 months ago and did not get around to even opening the shipping box until Thanksgiving weekend.  I plugged in the unit, connected the Bluetooth on my phone to the earbuds, but only one earbud works.  I actually can’t tell if it is the right side of the charging device or that earbud that doesn’t work.  It’s my own fault that the return window has closed, but it still is disappointing to receive a defective product and have no recourse.  The one earbud that works is nice.  I have small ears and have never found regular earbuds that stay in my ears.  Wish I had 2 of them that work."
"First impression is that these are made cheaply.  I haven't even tried them out yet, but upon opening them I could see blue on the bottom of the box.  When I flipped the charging case over I could see a defect in the finish. I rubbed it with my finger and my finger had blue on it. So I used a dry paper towel, and even more blue came off. I'm hoping the headphones won't turn my ears blue, and I'll definitely be cautious of where I put the case. I'll update the review once I have a chance to actually use them."
"So far they're great except that for some reason don't work when I do video calls. They work great, when I put music on or make phone calls. The notification sounds don't come through either. I work from home and got them so my hands would be free. Mic quality works great. Noise canceling part works well too. Would give it 5 stars if it would work with all sound and audio. I did make sure they were connected. I'll be getting something else for work, but if you just need them for music and regular phone calls, they work great."
"For the price, the sound output of these headphones is great. I was able to take calls on them and listen to music and podcasts while out on my runs and they stayed on my ears with no issue. The fit was nice as well.However, I did notice that they would disconnect if I was on longer runs where I would sweat. The headphones didn’t like to get wet at all. Overall, I got these back in July and as of this review the right headphone will no longer charge more than 30%, the left headphone no longer works on phone calls and the charging case loses full charge after around a day and a half. Regardless of the cheap price, I think it’s worth it to invest in something that will last over 3 months or else you’ll pay equal to or more than the cost of an upper end pair of headphones that will last much longer. I wouldn’t recommend these and I recommend investing in a higher quality pair of headphones."
"I would advise not to buy these for. Many reasons.1. There is no volume control, if a song is too loud you would have to pickup your phone to lower the volume and raise the volume up.2. They disconnect from your phone in less than 15ft radius.3. I put them to charge in their case after gym in the morning and wake up the next day to 97% charged.4. They keep coming out of my ear and have to push them in even after changing the silicone plugs.5. You cannot change to the next song or whatever you are listening.I don't know where these reviews are coming from they are great but 3 Stars ⭐ from me.Hope this helps."
"Good sound? When you turn earbuds on, do not have them in your ears (have them close to your ears) the volume is to high. They will blow your ears out! Adjusting the volume is difficult!!  Charging is nice but that is where it starts and stops! Do not buy these earbuds. Needless to say ""I would not buy these again!!!!!!!!¡"
"They fit well and are not falling out while active. I wish the sound was a bit crisper in the highs as well as deeper in the bass, tho I think this is what you get for $23.  A straight up 3 is my rating - good enough."
I got these buds to replace the in ear buds cuz of buds falling out while exercising. The do stay on but shift and I loose volume and audio quality I have since purchased new tips to replace the ones that came with and got them to work a little better.
"They sound fine.I like to just use one ear bud at a time. I like to be able to turn them off. There is no option to turn these off, so if you want to disconnect from the phone you have to do it through the phone or put them back in the case. They also don't auto turn off as I stopped using one before going to sleep and it was still connected when I woke up.Furthermore, the case is not easy to open one-handed. There are many cheap earbud options out there, and if I could buy again I would buy another kind I've had before."
"The only way I can get this danged case to open is to throw it on the floor, or give it to my wife.  It's infuriating.  Worst case design ever.  Also my wife is a bruja, which is the only reason she can open it so easily."
"Pros: sound is decent after I adjusted all of the settings on my phone for customized equalizer--The headphones off the bat don't have the deep bass sound as it says on their own. Seems to fit my ear pretty well.Cons: extremely temperamental for turning on and off and even functioning at all.  Have to reconnect often with my phone. Many times I will remove the headphones from the charging case, drive to my destination to do my run and they won't come on. When I get to my destination to do my run, I don't want to sit for 5 minutes and try to figure out why my headphones Will or won't come on. And Alas, you do have to press the button 3 seconds on the left ear to get them to come on but even with that they are temperamental. The other thing I definitely do not like is the buttons for turning on and off and pausing are right on the spot where you need to touch the headphones to adjust them in your ear if they slip out a little. So when you go to adjust the headphones you might constantly be touching one of the buttons.I'm on the fence as to whether I am keeping. If these would consistently work when I take them out of the case and I didn't have to go to my plug-in headphones, my decision would be easier."
"Idk why nobody is talking about how big this case is. The noise canceling is pretty amazing! The call quality is awful. You can hear everything. The sound for music isn’t great, it’s just ok. You can tell they are cheap. They do fit snug and don’t move when exercising, but like others have said, they hurt after long term use. I kind of wear them loose not in my ears just enough to hear the noises around me. I haven’t used them long enough to see how long it holds a charge. Might update later, if my ears are not too sore from long usage."
"I am pleased with the fit, I am pleased on how these stay on my ears when I workout, and I am pleased at the sound quality of these headphones.Biggest problem is, they won't 'hang up' when I put them into the charging case. So if I answer a call and I am within 50 feet of my headphones, I end up getting synced to my headphones and the people on the phone can't hear me. I have to intentionally turn off my bluetooth on my phone, which is a minor inconvenience. It also interferes with my car's bluetooth synchronization."
"Easy to pair both to my iphone.  Listening to music on these is incredible!  I love the noise cancelling and bass.  But every phone call I've tried on these, the person says they can't hear me."
"Have not had these earbuds for long.  For some reason the case does not charge the earbuds.  First the right one would not charge, now the left one will not charge.  Time has expired for return."
"Sound quality and comfort are 5 stars. Howver these are advertised as having a noise canceling mic, the reason I bought them. Buyer beware the mic is not noise canceling whatsoever. The only noise canceling is to me the ear bud wearer. So if that's not important to you these are a great buy. But if you are like me and needs buds that you can wear for a work phone call and not pick up all the background noise of the room you are in, these are not it.a"
The talk time is amazing and the sound but it sucks having to grab your phone whenever you walk more than 10 feet from it because the range is garbage.
"My mom came to me asking me to look for earphones for her, these were among the first results and she took em. After maybe 2 weeks of having them I tried them on. I loved them. I like that it wrapped around my ears and with damaged hearing, I thought the sound quality was great as well so I bought myself a pair. I love the case. The digital display is really helpful and the transparent cover looks super sleek.The problem picked up a few days after wearing them. Touching them while wearing them was starting to hurt. After a few more days my ears hurt to touch in general, even moving my head lying down.I gave them to my mom, who doesn't seem to have a problem with them and lost one of her pieces. My ears definitely feel better since I stopped using them."
It is not often that I am disappointed in a product from Amazon. But after a short time the earbuds stopped paring with any of my electronic devices.
"Pros:  good fit over the ear with the loops, battery life of charging case is as advertised, and great sound quality for audioCons: the mic for calls is spotty.  I use this for work while traveling . If you are in any place like an airport where there is a lot of ambient sound, it picks up all those sounds .  The callers on the other end report often that if I am speaking in a normal voice the audio quality is spotty, my mic cuts in and out, or fades in and out.  I have used my iPhone Voice Recorder to record my voice and attempt to guage this and find it to be true .Bottom line: great headphones for travel, but if you want a reliable noise cancelling mic for a lot of work calls, look elsewhere."
Sound is not great as we expect. It's a bit uncomfortable on my ear. I wish I could have try it on prior to purchase it.
"Love the price and the way it fits over my ear, but it keep disconnecting from my phone. I  have to keep pairing it."
I got these earbuds on October 3rd. They no longer work. They simply won't pair with my phone. I'm very bummed.
"In my search I was looking for a convertible  fitting over the ear bud. This earbud is very  small and tight fitting over the ear. The sound is good; However; the distance from my phone base is limited and connection becomes cracky.This earbud appears to have been used, based on the condition of the case.I am not happy, but willkeep it because it was not expensive...I suppose, you get what you pay for."
"It’s snug. Hangs on at the gym. For me, Volume needs to be up to offset gyms speakers and the workout class."
"The sound is pretty great, but no where close to a 75 hour battery life. Probably closer to 7.5 hours."
"Got these a couple of weeks ago, listening to music, or on social media they work wonders. Very clear but, I like to use my ear buds for talking also, the mic is very low. I have been told by many people whom I've called that they couldnt hear me or I was too low to hear. So, good for some things, not so good for others."
Very comfortable however the sound keeps bouncing from right to left ear and stopes on the other side. The rose gold color is more of fair skin color so it looks like you have hearing aids on. So I relaxed to a white color but it has the same issue with only one size plays music all of a sudden for a few seconds .
Good product. Nice bass and holds a good charge. Not ideal for a trucker with a noisy background.
Okay earbuds. No bass...has a tinny sound. Maybe consider upgrading to something more expensive. Look around..treat yourself!
These earbuds were comfortable good sound quality blue tooth connection was okay but could use some improvement seems like if you left room of device connected tothen there is the echoing on phone call and last but not least well after having them about month the case just stopped charging ear buds still working till power rus out
"The case looks great, the size is just right and the battery info is really helpful. Pairing was very easy and they connected quickly to my phone.I specifically bought these because of reviews that said these had good bass, but I found them to have a lot of the high range, moderate mid range but the low end is missing resulting in a thin metallic sound.The earbuds these are replacing have both up and down volume control buttons rather than the touch control, so I wish I would have noticed that when shopping. Typical touch controls respond to sweat, which is a hassle because it is increasing or decreasing the volume unpredictability."
"Even with this thing charged the volume drops after 4 hours and not even continuous use. I have in two of them connected to my pone and persons are saying they cant hear. When a call comes in ""Incoming call"" is so low you have to strain your ears to hear. Micc don't seem to be good"
These are okay for working out but the sound quality seems off.
Do not stay charged for more than 10 hours before they tell you they need charging. Even on standby. Is it too late to send them back. I haven’t tried the other set yet. Other than that they are fine  Both of them is doing the same thing
I like three sound and it last all day.
The did not produce the bass effect as promised.
The sound in these are ok but that’s about all that works on these. Trying to talk on the phone with these are useless they can’t hear you and you can’t talk back tried it like 10 times and it just doesn’t work for phones use.
Volume not loud enough when you’re in a vehicle and want stay on ear too good
"Packaging and build quality are good.  Easy to pair, and they will work as a Peloton headset because it's more important to hear the instructor voices, but the low end bass and overall sound quality aren't what I was hoping for - They're ok."
Bought new I had to double check that I bought new not used because I was able to use a discount but they work great the front clear casing had a nice screen protector film and everything but when I got to looking the back of the case is all scuffed up I’m not to happy about that but it’s to much hassle to exchange the sound is so loud on it’s maximum volume which is a good thing lol the only problem I have so far is the scuffs I do not like that at all
I can't connect to my phone
"I bought these a week ago and have been frequently testing them out and wearing them hours at a time. I don’t know if it’s the fit or the design shape but whenever I have worn them for long periods of time and take them out, my ears end up feeling raw and in pain because of the positioning. I tried switching the ear bud sizes to see if it was the issue. But still seems to be a problem. It hurts! Sometimes the sound randomly will just disconnect for some reason, and I have to  push play again or check the connection.Pros: It is snug and secure. I don’t have to worry about them falling out. The color is cute. I like that the charger tells you the percentage of battery life.I have not tested whether they are water proof or not. I have also not yet tested the microphone yet."
Battery life does not last long
Bought to stay in my ears and for the bass boost. They stay in your ears but the bass boost is non-existant. Very tinny sounding. Even the equalizer on my mp3 app cant make them sound better.
My earbuds only last about 60 minutes before they die and have to be put back in the case to charge.  I guess not bad for the price but definitely not the 15 hours they advertise
"The packaging was excellent. Why is the back scuffed and it’s already at 85% charge? Does this mean it’s refurbished? I like the quality of sound, fit, etc. and the price is great."
"Sound clarity and volume is great, but no bass. It says deep bass, but I hear none. If you don’t care about bass in your music they would be a good choice."
"The description of the product said, ""Hi-Fi Deep Bass Stereo"".  Perhaps I have an over-critical ear, but I didn't hear any bass at all when I tried out the ear buds.  In fact, they are downright ""tinny"" sounding.  I have a pair of wired earbuds that have much richer sound than these do.  - - -  I'll still use them during certain situations, but I guess I was expecting too much; especially for the price."
"I find that I have to 'pair' with my phone almost every time I use them and they are a bit clumsy, in ear. They are a bit big to keep in my ear for any amount of time and the shift. I would like to think I have a mostly normal head and ears but, who knows. I won't buy another set but I am not completely unhappy with them 😁 it's a compromise between money savings and disappointing inconvenience"
"I rate these 3/5 stars because they are loud enough for me, but the highs are too high. I can’t turn it all the way up to hear the mids and lows because the highs scream. They’re decently comfortable but I didn’t receive the different sizes of ear tips in my box. I would like these to be adjustable like the Jlabs I’m used to. The sound quality makes me wonder if the music I’m listening to is low quality (because it’s staticky) or if it’s the headphones. Because my Jlabs play it fine, and it isn’t staticky. It does let me hear it in different layers though, I can hear the guitars, and Voice in different areas better than Jlab. I just wish the sound was adjustable for those Highs"
"good fit, long battery, pairs with iphone fine.  but when i try with my mac mini or macbook it drops signal."
"These earbuds were great until they weren't. Easy to pair, comfortable, and noise cancellation were as expected or better.Unfortunately, they lasted less than a month for me. I wear them 4 times a week for about an hour and a half (at the gym), so they're not used excessively at all, though a great deal of sweat is involved. Despite wiping them down after every exercise, I started having issues with my earbuds about a week and a half ago.It started with the left earbud not turning on at all. I followed the instructions to re-pair the device, which worked the first couple of times. Then, the earbud just wouldn't charge at all. As of yesterday, the case won't charge either earbud and has run its battery down to nothing in less than 18 hours. Before this issue the case's batter lasted two weeks before I had to recharge it.I am very disappointed in this product and even more disappointed that I can't return it."
I have to use these earbuds outside of the water because every time I go underneath the water earbuds quit playing music
"Seems solid but ""meh"" audio compared to others that I've tried.I do like the ""over ear"" option though."
"Thought these were going to be great, but sound started breaking up after only three days of use."
Did NOT INCLUDE 3 sizes of ear adapters as stated - got 2 - but all too large! Charged and paired ok - but right one only worked for maybe 5 minutes & barely at that ( sound was like a whisper) instructions are a joke- do not know about performance when making calls - received & paired too late to call anyone ( main reason i bought them). Tested with just music from my iphone. To big to really go in the ear - just sort of rest there - ok to me- but just so u know - not sure about button functions - instructions didnt provide useable info on that- be prepared to use assist of some sort to try to read instructions - font is minuscule & very fine- VERY HARD TO READ! No idea how long they might last- only had mine a few hours & looking to order something else to compare & maybe return these. How the ratings are what they are is a mystery. Buy with caution - if at all. Noted several other reviews said their right ear bud did not work either- so dont think this is a fluke.Case & display for charging info is nice enough - but doesnt make them usable! Charging cord is unbelievably short - its a joke imho! - good thing i had another right sixe!Proceed with much caution only. (Delivery was FAST - thanks Amazon for that!) NOTE:  might venture to call their support number - experience says tho - that usually involves hours of time & leads to dead end - so idk yet. Its not noted in instructions - but is on their ad listing.
"So at first glance there perfect ! They work good, sounds good. But I’m disappointed that mine came scuffed on the back. They come in a box with another cover so I’m not sure how they became scuffed unless someone else had them or used them. Unsure if im going to keep."
Worked great but my older pair sounded a heck of a lot better but I dropped some weights on them in the gym. I did not pay more for them so expected approximately the same sound but these are to twangy/too much treble and not enough base so 3 stars.
They sound really good for music and movies after a bit of tweaking of phone settings. Not so great for ohone calls. Person on the other end says it sounds like I'm under water and voice is all garbled. Not sure what tweaks I could do to change that.
"I have very small ears and I was looking for some that would not hurt after just an hour but they do like all of the others.They work well. If you don't have very small ears,  you will love them. They are a great deal for the money."
Still learning the process. Seems to be what was advertised
"The instructions are too tiny to read!  I put on glasses, plus a magnifying glass, and still could not read. I sent an email for help and that even took two attempts because the address was so hard to read!"
They advertised these did not have to be completely inserted in the ear. Not true. I just put them back in the box. Useless. I was able to connect them. Could not turn them down to low.
"I was was shocked by how terrible they sound. They are listed as, “ Hi-Fi Deep Bass Stereo and Crystal Clear Calls.” There’s no bass, let alone deep bass. The microphone quality is terrible, too."
They’re ok but after a while the sound starts getting lower and lower. I’ve had to turn my music up louder and louder w few times. And they short circuit every now and then
"I’m senior citizen and listen  to the radio with headphones and decided to try a pair of over the ear earbuds.The over the ear band is soft and flexible, and connected to blue tooth easily.However ;the buds don’t fit in my ear snugly because of the shape of my inner ear.When I pushed and held it pushing in the ear you could hear the bass and sound more clearly.I am ok with the purchase and  will keep them  and use them on my morning walk ."
Nice little gadget’ sound is good’ long battery life. Design in size is great. My only issue’ when I sweat’ they don’t stay in place’ continuously making sure they don’t fall off my ears.
"I like the style and the connectivity and quality of mic, however, it's not noise cancelling and that's the main reason why I purchased it. That needs to be revisited on the description because it's not noise cancelling."
"Tried all 3 sizes of the ear piece and can’t get a snug fit. Sound is good if fit is snug, but tinny if not snug. You get the quality you pay for…"
Sound is tinny. Not robust.
They’re fine earbuds for land but I bought them in the hopes they would be good for lap swimming since they’re water resistant for the depth and length of time described but they end up glitching and the sound going in and out as soon as you’re in the water. If you’re just worried about them falling in the water — they still work fine when you’re on land but not what I wanted to use them for unfortunately.
They're still working
"The sound while listening to music was not bad, and was superior to my Samsung buds which sound comparitively tinny.Unfortunately these are terrible for phone communication.1. There is no sidetone so when you use them during a phone calls you can't hear your own voice through the buds making it sound to you like you're talking with your fingers stuck in your ears. Deal breaker for me.2. The microphone leaves muffled messages on voicemail. Experimented: 3 messages- 1 through regular microphone, 1 through speaker phone and one through earbuds. The earbud microphone left a message with remarkably inferior sound quality.I didn't keep them long enough to get feedback on the quality of the microphone during phone conversations. They have to go back."
Set worked well with calls and music.  If you sweat they stop working 1 at a time.  Not water resistant.
"Ear buds have barely any volume , have to really push into ear , which then hurts my ear … So as of now , note wearing…"
"I actually quite like these headphones for music. They wear well and sound okay most of the time.The audio itself is a bit soft, requiring me to turn the volume up on my devices (phone, pc). The battery lasts a long time, but the volume deteriorates even at mild battery loss.But I have persistent audio lag with all devices I've tried these on. Not a problem for music playback, but any video content can be annoying to have a near 1/2 second delay between the visual and audio feedback. Audio lag also gets worse slightly as the batteries are used up.The two ear pieces can become desynced from each other as well, requiring me to turn them both off and on again."
They serve a purpose regarding hearing what you’re listening to. But they aren’t comfortable and aren’t great for hand free conversations.
The earbuds work fine so far. Took 2 stars off because I expected for them to be new and they were obviously pre-owned.
"Uncomfortable ear plug and limited sound mix for music. Fine for talk shows, podcasts, and news."
"It was chiefly because of the claim - and positive reviews - that the bass was exceptional, especially for the price range. There is very little bass, even when pressing the plugs to my ear it is there, faintly.  I was going to return it because I do miss that full sound when listening to music, but, its okay when listening to movies and audible stories."
I bought them because they were advertised as being loud. Not so at all.
Just received these 9/8/24. I unboxed them and they seem to have been used already. The case has scratches and clear tape looks to have been removed and replaced. The earbuds seem to work fine so far so Ill try them out and update later
"These are fairly descent for the price. I wish the features included wireless charging case. I don’t like that it doesn’t have dual connection features meaning connecting one headphone to a device and the other one for another device. The sound quality is not loud enough for me. If you are riding with the windows down I can barely hear. If you are just looking for basic useage then these are good. I am big on sound, quality, and features for a amazing price."
Good overall sound quality. In water use is average.
The tiny in the instructions is way too small’
Did not provide enough clarity or volume
I like these earbuds. No problem with them.
The part that goes around the ear doesn't feel secure because it is wayyyy too loose.  I have to tuck it under the arm of my glasses.  Sound is good though.
"So these technically count as Bluetooth ear buds, and they haven't quit on me after a month.They're comfortable enough to wear all day.That's the good.The bad, they're not particularly loud, and even with both ear pieces in, I'm frequently told that I'm hard to hear on phone conversations.I guess that means the mic quality is really poor.They've got good range, and if the environment is quiet, they're nice for listening only.Two out of 5 stars, because they're very comfortable, and I use them in a wide variety of situations.  The 3 star loss is because they work poorly on phone calls, and I have them largely so I don't have to hold a phone to my head for an hour long call. Also because even for listening, they're quiet."
Great sound but absolutely no ANC.
"I really liked how the earbuds looked, and was eager to try them. However, I could never get them to charge up right. They never seemed to go to a 100% full charge. I tried it a few ways, but no luck. I also had trouble trying to figure out how to get them to fit in my ears solidly. It just became frustrating to me, so I decided to return them. They look great, and may work for someone else, but I just didn’t feel comfortable with them, especially not charging how I thought they should."
"I loved the look of these earbuds, hated to return product. Sound quality extremely low. Using maximum volume distorted music and voice."
Loved them at first worked great but durability is not good. Had mine for less than a month and the right one won't charge anymore made sure the magnet was clean and free of debris as I am a diesel Mechanic but they haven't even been used much and haven't been put through the element of rough use yet. Just no charge and weak battery after 2 full charges on the left one. But loved the sound and quality before the issues and noise canceling worked great as people could hear me
One of the earbuds didnt last long at all!  I try to contact the company. No reply!!
The sound quality is good but the microphone is weak. Other parties can hardly hear you and sometimes cut in and out.
"PROS:  I like the sound quality and the fact that they are small enough that I can sleep with them (and not be uncomfortable)CON:  Battery life is bad.  Less than 6 hours. The ""low battery"" alert comes on and wakes me up.I bought these in Nov 2023, and the battery issue was annoying enough that I switched them to gym use only. Bought a different brand for sleeping, which kept the charge for the entire night and longer.  Lost those, so pulled the Tozo A1s out of my gym back a few days ago, but I simply can't sleep through the ""low battery"" warning that comes on a few hours into the night.Summary: great sound and fit, but very short battery life.  Good for the gym, walks, and short trips.  Not good for using over longer periods of time."
"Pros:• Compact case size is very convenient• I have small ears and these are one of the only headphones I've tried that fit in my ears without constantly falling out• Pretty good sound quality for the price point• Not ANC but they are seriously noise cancelling because of how snug they fit in the earCons:• After a few months of use, the case needs to be charged every single day sometimes multiple times a day. To be fair, this is the risk you take with something with such a small battery.• Also after a few months of use the battery on the earbuds themselves barely last 2 hours• The squishy rubber part is uniquely shaped to these specific headphones - meaning you can't switch them out with any old extra squishy rubber part that you have around. I tried to put spin fits squishys on these and even the smallest size made it so the headphones can't seat within the case to charge nor can the case even close, super annoying. To my knowledge you also cannot buy replacements of this part from TOZO so if you lose them you're SOL.• The mic on these is absolute unusable trash. These are not the kind of earbuds you can use for calls whatsoever - you either sound far away, distorted, or the person you're talking to simply can't hear you at all. It's a bummer because out of the four pairs of TOZO Earbuds I've purchased, these are the only ones I've had this mic issue with.• Maybe this is just an iOS thing but you simply cannot use voice to text with these earbuds. As someone who uses voice to text a lottttt, having to disconnect Bluetooth every time I wanted to use voice to text got incredibly old incredibly quickly and was the main reason why I switched to a different model.In conclusion, I love TOZO and I think these earbuds are as good as they can get for the price point, I just can no longer use these as my daily riders because of the issues with the mic."
"I wanted to buy a bud-style earbud for better fet and to sleep with so I found these as they got great reviews. While decent for their price (especially on sale) you're probably better off looking at the competition like the Soundcore A20i.Pros: 1. Small form-factor  2. Good app features  3. Lots of eartips  4. compact charging case  5. Decent sound when EQ'ed  6. Good battery lifeCons: 1. Cheap earbud tips makes comfortable fitting hard  2. Even when EQ'ed, they still sound overly tinny and lacking clarity.  3. Charging case lid is too loose, which might lead to losing the buds in the future."
"Overall, a good product and value buy.  The drawback for me is the earbuds are hard to remove from charging station and to handle because they are too slick to grab between fingers.  If the parameter of the earbuds were knurled having small ridges on the edge or surface, they would be easier to grip.  Because I didn't want to send them back what I did was take a small saw blade and etch the sides of the earbuds.  It's not pretty but it is functional and works for me.  What would also work is if the manufacture coated the sides of the earbuds with a rubber coating so the can be gripped between fingers."
"I like the fit, very comfortable in the ears. The price was great and came with interchangeableear tips. As far as the quality they seem to be very well made and i do like the charging case they came in. But seriously a three (3) inch charging cord. With that said,  I can only give 3 stars for sound quality. Sounds like a tin can so for me I find it to be extremely lacking. Maybe it's just the ones I received but I'm not impressed with the sound quality at all. I have tried multiple sound settings and found them all lacking.  For ease of use,  I don't like when trying to remove the buds fron my ears touching the left one will open a podcast and the right will pause or mute sound. I can deal with touching the right to mute/pause. But not the left one starting an  unopend app when trying to remove it from my ear I find that extremely annoying and unwelcoming.  If there is a way to reset them please provide. And yes I have tried switching the functionality of the buttons in the tozo app."
"When the TOZO A1 Mini Wireless Earbuds arrived I was so excited. They would have been my first earbuds without the extra piece that fits behind the ear. The review said they fit comfortably and stay in the ear.  I was very happy they paired easily even with three devices, and that I did not have to worry about powering them on and off because they did that automatically when I put them on or took them out of the case. The price was also great!They fit comfortably at first even in my small ear canals; and, they stayed on. I was pleasantly surprised. The music quality was fine for my needs as I listen to podcasts most of the time, and did not have to consider bass at all.The trouble came when I left them in my ears for about two hours. Both ears started itching terribly. I would have to take the earbuds out, scratch my ears and put them back and then within a few minutes I git the same itching. It did not let up.Another problem I was having was being able to take the earbuds out of their case. They are mini, but my fingers are not. The strong magnet that helps you put them in, also posed difficulty for me when I tried to take them out.On top of that, I found it very difficult to operate the controls. I wasn’t able to determine where exactly I was to tap (not press) to turn the volume up or down or go forward or backward in my podcasts.  And I had to tap quickly and lightly with my fingertip, not the pad of my fingers. Sometimes it worked sometimes it didn’t. Very frustrating.Finally, I was going to send them back for a refund until I realized I was not dealing with Amazon directly.  I saw that I could only return the TOZO mini earbuds if I had a label, the box and bag in which they came. I didn’t have them because I thought I was going to keep them so I threw the packaging away.  Ugh.For these reasons,, I do not recommend these earbuds."
"Really good quality for the money as far as construction and sound goes.  I'm surprised at how much tech fits in such a small space.Battery life is not spectacular but not terrible I usually get about 9 hours, But from 20% battery down till I can't take it anymore it makes weird sounds occasionally to let me know it's dying and there's no way to adjust that.  I'm new to these sort of things but the fact that one earbud will stop working before the other is a bit annoying. When I use them with my PC I have to force the PC to find the microphone so I can do voice to text. When I test the mic on the voice recorder on the PC it's very clear and top notch. On my Android 14 Motorola the audio works fine for listening to music and I can adjust the volume with the earbuds but the microphone does not work with the phone.  Not sure if it's the earbuds fault or Android 14s. All the help articles I find direct me to places in settings on Android 14 that don't exist anymore.  There is no separate option for giving permission to use the microphone on connected devices."
"These headphones have amazing sound quality when it comes to watching videos or listening to music. However, I immediately noticed that while on call, there is buzzing or static in the background constantly and it pops whenever audio ends. If you try listening to music while connected, the static is continuous.I contacted the customer service staff and they were super nice. They’re going to send a replacement for free without me needing to return my defective ones. I’ll update this about the new pair when I get it."
"When I first bought these they were nice and solid, but after a while they had this problem where it wouldn’t connect both earphones at once. Now it shows two different Bluetooth devices, but they are the same device just different sides of the earphones. They do pop out sometimes when you sweat a lot, so you gotta readjust a lot, especially if you’re running. In the end they still out pretty good I just wish my earphone didn’t mess up as they did."
"The mic is okay for $20 earbuds, same with the sound quality. I had them 6 months and the left earbud has now completely given out, and the right one is constantly phasing in and out of working. They're fine if you only use them sparingly, battery life is pretty good and they charge pretty fast. I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for something long lasting, though."
"Going to get the negative out first, they do not fit my ears very well. They tend to slip out if I move my jaw or anything like that. If I switch which ear I put each in, they fit well. The price for quality is okay. I wasn't expecting extremely high quality. USBC charging port. Touch control for pausing. 3/5 simply because comfort."
"When I got them they fit great into my ear and I was super happy with the sound quality! I thought it was such a great purchase especially for the price because most headphones fall out when I am working out.After 4 days, the right bud stopped working completely and they have now become super slow to charge."
"I don’t know if it’s just me but it hurts having it in your ear and the sound quality isn’t the best but you get what you pay for. It’s really convenient and small it can fit in my pencil bag so I use it for backup, would recommend for cheap earbuds."
"I’ve had these for a year and 5 months and one earbud is completely dead. I started having problems with that earbud after about 8 months of use, but now I get no sound out of it.  I also have issues with charging that started just a few months after purchase. They don’t charge while they’re in the case unless I keep taking them out and putting them back in. Otherwise after a few minutes they stop charging but aren’t fully charged. If you want a long lasting earbud, these are not the ones. As someone looking for earbuds fit for smaller ears/ear canals, it’s a tough market."
"I always read reviews before I purchase something like this and someone mentioned these were not mini earbuds as advertised. I definitely agree. If youre  looking for something small, these aren’t it. I have the Tozo 10 and the quality and function are great but they’re big for my ear and always falling out. I got these to relieve that problem and they’ve already fallen out twice. I’m choosing to keep and using the others as backup. They do fit a bit better and are a tad bit smaller but if you’re looking for something small these aren’t it. However, the quality is exceptional for the price."
"Overall pretty good buds. One terrible flaw - excessive noise cancelation during phone calls. Effectively unusable in slightly noisy environments., like driving a car. All Callers complain they can hear me well when on calls.  Works very well in quiet environments"
"I only use these to get audio from my computer, no high end sound requirements. They do pretty well except they seem to lose connection easily. In all fairness I don't know if the problem is with the earbud or my computer."
"I bought these to replace another pair my wife just bought me that I left in my pocket and it went through the washer and dryer.  I could not get them to connect any longer. They fit my ears well and it is easy to skip songs by tapping the right one twice, so I like the functionality and fit. At least they were on sale when I had to buy a replacement, but as far as waterproof I am not sure. I don't know if it was the washer or the dryer that killed the last pair."
"So these headphones are pretty & have decent sound output. They stay charged for a while & connect easily to my iPhone. They have controls on the headphones which is a little annoying but I guess most people like that. All that being said, I’m a small ish person (not tiny but a smaller woman at 5’1”) & I have small ears. These constantly fall out. I have the smallest inserts in and they literally cannot stay on because there’s still a good bit of space. They come right out and are super loose. I think part of the problem is the bulk is on the top so they’re heavier on the top & since they’re already loose they just flop out onto the ground When I try to push them back in the control on the headphones to pause, go back to the beginning of the song or go to the next song kicks in.These are fine & have lasted a year & seem good quality, but if you’re small like me you may want to seek elsewhere."
"The battery life is not great. It says 7 hours, but for me it was only 4 hours even after a full charge. The sound quality is good though and they’re comfortable, just wish they lasted longer."
Quality -Sound quality is good. Loud and clear.Use - Good for regular daily use. Not very fit appropriate around the ear. Falls off the ear often while running or working out.
"Took a chance on these earbuds.  Great price and the sound quality is surprisingly good.  However, the microphone cut out somewhere around 50% charge.  Would still recommend them."
"Its dumb because You can't use both at the same time, you can only use one at a time. I've only had them for 3 months and one of them already completely doesn't work!"
"I really want to like these for the price and the size of the carrying case, however, they do not stay in my ears no matter what size end I put on them. They go in just fine- but don't stay, so if you bend over- they fall out. If you barely touch them, they fall out...They are super sensitive to touch, so it is easy to turn them off and on by tapping the earbud- much more responsive than the last pair I had. I like that there's an app to use with them, but again- doesn't help with sleep if they don't stay in your ears.I love wireless earbuds and typically wear them a LOT for both music and audio books etc... I wear them walking, mowing, cleaning, etc and I don't feel like I can wear these everywhere because you don't always feel them fall out and then they're gone."
"Nice earbuds, just lack any kind of bass.  Good for working out or perhaps on an airplane, but not much more than a solid 15.00 pair of buds."
"For $19.95 these buds are a good deal. They probably won't compare to $150 buds, but I didn't need to spend that kind of money for my needs."
"For me, the device is easy to connect and sounds great, but after 4 months of daily use - the sounds are now crackling on both sides."
"This are great, except that they are very small and smooth, so your going to occasionally drop them.  And, when you do, they can't handle it from normal operating heights, so they break and you'll need new ones because they aren't built to last or withstand such normal use.In addition, when you are listening to something and place the earbuds into the charger without stopping the audio transmission, the audio can often continue playing from the device for everyone to hear on speaker.  This can be very bad if you are in a quiet location or listening to something private when around other people.  So, be mindful of this and always remember to stop the audio first.  Good earbuds don't require this and always stop the media from playing if they are placed in/on their chargers"
"I love the color, design and look of these headphones. I have changed now to the smallest earpiece and it hurts my ear after about 30 minutes. I keep wearing them hoping they would be with me for a long but I cant wait to take them out. Not sure if its my ears or not but I am not in love with these. Economical and cute but hard and hurt."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So I purchased these twice this year and they both got me through until November 24 but they both stopped playing music with very low low sounds for about 4-5 months each time I purchased.These are great if you need a cheap pair for a few months but I’ll invest into something more expensive for longevity moving forward.
Here’s the job done for the gym.But the have connection issues. Haven’t had for long but you get what you pay for.
"For price they are great, people will hear you like you in another room, no noise cancel"
The technology worked well but despite finding the right size ear cushion they kept falling out.
"Hands down the most comfortable bluetooth earbuds I have purchased off of Amazon to date. All others I have received have made my ears hurt so bad after only an hour or so of use. I like to listen to music and podcasts during my workdays. I also like how these are not extremely sensitive to touch. The touch features are a lot easier to control and use. Also, the price is good as well!One big issue for me reducing my rating by 2 stars is that, my left ear bud is wayyyy quieter than the right. For a while I though the left one just didn't work. However, when I took the right one out and/or put it back in the case, I could hear the media from the left, just at a much much lower volume than the right. When I listen to media with both in, I don't hear anything on the left side at all which throws the balance completely off. I thought I could deal with it for a bit as I received my earbuds about 2 weeks ago, but unfortunately I am going to have to return them."
"I got these on sale so they are totally worth the $16 I spent! They are waterproof and have a long battery life. I definitely recommend these. EDIT: After having these for just over 3 weeks one of the ear buds stopped working while I was out on my walk. I tried while walking to figure out what went wrong and finally gave up. When I got home I went to the ""Support"" on Amazon and read that it might need reset and to push on it until I got a clear light. There was never a clear light. There was a blue and then red then blue again then red again. But, I tested them after that and it started working again. I'm not sure for how long but I guess I will wait and see. I had previously given 5 stars but I had to remove 2 stars because I don't know how long they will work or if I will have to keep resetting it."
"What I do like about them, is that the music plays fine, but phone calls there's too much noise in the background if you're outside all you hear is the wind. There's no noise cancellation for this product. Or I have yet to figure it out. As far as activating the noise cancellation."
"At first I thought I snagged a good deal on these. They felt solid and looked cute and for just $16 I thought these were gonna be great. I was wrong. Yes they're cute but they had a bad habit of slipping out of my ears when I was doing chores or walking, or even just sitting up too fast. If I focused really hard on not moving my head all that much while doing things, then they were secure and I was willing to live that way. But then one stopped working. The audio sputtered out a few times and then it just stopped playing sound. It still connected but nothing was coming through anymore. After literally one month. I've had cheaper ones from TEMU last me for half a year. At that point I just had to give up. They went straight to the trash. I would not recommend these to anyone who intends for something to last. Just pay the extra money for something more durable and long lasting I beg of you. This gets 2 stars solely because I got alot of compliments regarding the color and how cute they looked with my outfits."
"I bought these for my husband and they do not sound very great. It’s static and when he goes to the store and uses it when I’m not with him, it’s hard to understand what he’s saying. They weren’t very clear when I buy them again absolutely not."
"I recently tried these Mini (so they say)  Wireless Earbuds, and while the sound quality is decent for everyday listening, I found them to be way too big for my small ears. They didn’t fit snugly, which made them uncomfortable during longer use.The Bluetooth 5.3 connection is reliable, and the built-in mic works well for calls, but the size issue really detracted from my overall experience. If you have larger ears, these might be a great fit, but I would recommend trying them on first if you have smaller ear canals. Overall, they have some good features, but the fit could definitely be improved."
"Reading all these reviews, I was expecting these to be a lot better the sound compared to soundcore or Apple it’s a little deeper a little more base but a lot more quiet listening to soundcore or Apple at volume halfway these were so low compared to others you have to put the volume at a higher level in order to hear a good sound just not impressed with all these reviews over 80,000 people reviewing I would’ve thought these were freaking incredible but a little too low. I don’t like having to put my volume almost all the way up to here."
These work ok but don't stay in my ear
"First thing to note, I hate anything that requires an app to work. I don’t need any extra junk on my phone. I also hate any extra thing tracking me. Everything tracks us.Second thing I got them for running and they don’t stay in your ear while you’re running, but also it feels like a earplug in the worst way and I don’t want the noise canceling affect when I need to hear my surroundings outside.Last Thing the volume is very low so you can’t really blast out your ears, which is crazy because it already cancels out all the sound so it just gives off this muffling effect when you’re using them.Pros: they keep a charge for a long time. If noise canceling is your thing then you’ll like them. Is all right I just prefer not to have to do anything extra in order for my devices to work. I feel like somebody’s watching me. For the price, it does what it says it’s gonna do."
"They are ok, not the best quality"
"These earbuds sound great, however, they're incredibly sensitive. They don't stay put inside the ear, and the second they have to be adjusted, whatever I'm listening to is interrupted. These are only useful to me if I'm sitting still."
"These  ear buds do not hold a charge very long. Also earbuds are not very comfortable.  I would not buy them again, as I had other pair that were actually less expensive on Temu that were better."
Too big for my ears
"These earbuds offer decent sound quality, especially considering the price, and they're great for listening to podcasts or TV. However, when it comes to music, the bass is a bit lacking. If you're a bass lover, you might be disappointed.The small size makes them comfortable for long periods, but the touch controls can be frustrating—they don’t always respond correctly, and I’ve accidentally turned them off more than once. The battery life is decent, but not exceptional. Overall, they’re good value, but they have a few issues to be aware of."
"I like how easy it was to pair these up with my TV and the sound is pretty good for such an inexpensive set of ear buds.  They fit in my ears and don't come loose.  However, where is the user manual?  I guess I need to learn how to use them by guess and by golly.  When I tap on the earbuds, sometimes the volume changes, sometimes my Roku stops a program or rewinds or something else.  No idea what will happen next."
"Not bad for the price however the most annoying point is that if some damp hair brushes an earbud while it is in your ear, your music will pause immediately."
Alot of times I am caught having to repeat myself as person's on the receiving end are not hearing me clearly. Little disappointed. Music quality is good though.
these  feel like they're going to fall out while I'm walking and when I adjust them I end up pausing what I'm listening to so that's frustrating.
"Everyone raves about tozo, this product was a let down. Get the nc9’s if you want great sound quality. Theyre a little bigger than these and more expensive but much better quality. For the price though, these are a good cheap pair of wireless buds. I just wanted something with better sound quality. They have a good mic on them and calls were clear and they were nice and small and comfortable in my ears. Similar to the everyday raycons"
"I bought these earbuds because I wanted something small and light to carry around. These earbuds perfectly satisfied those criterias, but there are a few things are less than ideal and not what I expected. The battery life is about 6-7 hrs in a single continuous use. The range on the earbuds is about 12 ft before the sounds start getting distorted. Overall, I liked the earbuds but they were just not right for my use cases."
They make static sounds sometimes when in-use. The mic is not the best. Battery life is great. I will stick to my regular wired earbuds.
It does not work with all my Bluetooth devices.  It only worked with my phone and not my TV.  My TV picked it up but the earbuds would not connect.  This is my 2nd TOZO but I had the TOZO T10 and that worked great with my TV and my phone.  I so wanted to love this earbuds. I will be sticking to Tozo I do like the brand.
"The thing that was unfortunate is that the spare ear buds were out loose and fell everywhere. I've been searching for buds to let everything going.The set has beautiful sound and charge noticeably quick. I really do love the set as I continue searching for good buds to fit my ear canals without running away too often.They look great and easily paired with my Kindle Signature and other devices without a hiccup. They're the perfect weight with high quality sound. I love using them for listening to shows, podcasts, and phone calls. Talk about versatility.Again, all the versatility is limited during my search for workable earbuds that fit this baby. Other than that, they look great in my ear and are so comfy when I have pads for it. Ok, I have a pad for the right ear. I'll keep on searching for a left bud."
I wasn't expecting too much from these earbuds they are usable but I do have a couple issuesFitThere are several different size earpieces but none fit overly well and will fall out after some time if I don't consistently readjust themControlsThe controls are simplistic but if you have any moisture on your hands and go to pause or readjust the earbud they will volume up or down till they max or bottom out but that is a problem with most touch sensitive earbuds I thinkOther complaintsThe case feels cheap and and flimsy and the earbuds have a habit of disconnect for seemingly no reasonBut all in all usable and if you need a set of earbuds for the time being they work but I wouldn't suggest for long term use
"It's been about 3 months since I got these (May 21st, 2024)  and they're plenty cheap, I thought I was getting a good deal at first. Later realized I was paying for the quality instead.First month in I noticed that the right earbud wasn't charging properly. It was receiving some charge but not at the level the left one was, and presumably the level it was supposed to be at (example. Left 100% and right at 20% after four hours). I cleaned contacts, tried a folded piece of paper in the lid to make sure the contacts were touching and it didn't seem to work. Month 2 the case itself now seems to have issues dispensing charge correctly.Finally, onto month 3 (Today) the left earbud (which is the only reliable one at this point) is loosing sound quality. I have the phone on max volume, reset the phone to make sure it's not YouTube glitching on sound quality again, and even took a q-tip to the black mesh on the earbud to clean any wax. The sound still sounds muffled and distant. I am unable to hear anything clearly from the left as it's too quiet. I am unable to test on the right earbud since it's perpetually dead and I'm pretty sure lost 10% of charge while in the case (20%->10%) since the last time I looked at the battery.I'm sure they're fine earbuds if you need a temporary pair of Bluetooth ones for less than a month, but long term they suck, and suck bad. Honestly, it's worth giving the extra 10-20 dollars for a pair of better ones on here and be sure you're not getting a subpar product. Because buying these earbuds mean your essentially throwing away that 30-40 dollars you spent on these.I'll only keep using these until I can afford better ones, learn from my lesson and don't bother with these :⁠-⁠("
"Good overall. I haven't called with them to verify voice, just voice mail but mostly want them for music anyhow. Oh, & I bought a pair as a gift for someone who loves them.They do a lousy job connecting to my older phone that I use as a player, so that sucks. They do better with the newer phones. They are alright on the computer as well. The pick up is pretty decent, albeit a bit tinny. Be sure your files are top notch, or you will hear those tiny imperfections. So good there. Cd rips, wavs & wmas are the best, & a joy to listen to.The range is pretty darned good too! Certainly better in the computer, pushing high volume, but I can almost walk around the house which is WAY better than those Lab buds I had! There are very few wireless/blue tooth bumps or rebounds with the Tozo ear buds. I like them so much, I am gifting a couple pair to friends.I find them too sensitive to touch, but that happens with all of these new generation of ear buds. You want to get them in your ear, not change songs or answer the phone.Charging in the case is nice, & convenient. I would like to see an on case USB, but they use any 9-11 pin old style micro (phone) connector, so that's fine. Seeing that they hold a decent charge, I haven't had any conflicts with other items.That's about it. They hold up, & don't really discharge too much between uses. I did a full charge at first, & haven't charged them again, for about two weeks. They get their juice form the case, & pretty quickly turn off or go in stand by.I would have liked to seen a better manual off, than tap or hold. Sometimes I just want to stick them on the side for a bit, not in the case.Bottom line. I like these Tozo A-1 ear buds over many, many others (see my reviews). I have been trying & returning a whole bunch of (other) premium buds of late. All kinda super lame-0. These are very good. I really don't like they are so sensitive to touch that putting them in or adjusting them changes things-ANNOYING."
"These were nice enough but after two years of normal use, one bud will only last 15 minutes after a recharge."
"Sound quality is great. But call quality is not. Most people cannot hear me so I can’t use them for calls. My other gripes, which are on me for not paying closer attention to the features, there is no volume control or on/off control. The range is not great either. Good for the price but all dependent on your needs. Im glad to have them for backup."
Disappointed apple has new charger feature with newer phones. They worked well but didn’t fit for newer model. Buyer beware.
"The wireless range of these ear buds is better by at least double than all of the leading brands I've tried.However, for me personally The down sides outweigh the positive aspects.They do not fit my ears, and the lack of a physical button means that every time I touch them to keep them from falling out of my ear pauses or skips to the next track or some other undesired function.I've had the  for more than 6 months now and the battery in one of them runs dead in about 15 minutes where it used to last many hours when it was new.Considering the cost of only about $25 dollars, I must say that overall they are pretty good"
Im going to be honest… i don’t like these as much. I’m giving it 3 start due to the fact it stays charged for a long time & it doesn’t take long for it to charge. On the other hand when i touch my earphone to adjust it it pauses the music or starts the music over very easily. I do not like that. If it was an actual button to press to pause or turn the music up that would be ok but literally one little touch to your earphone and the music stops. I’ve learned that it’s not as easy to restart the music without having to dig in my pocket to get my phone and hit play again. I’m having to purchase a different brand of earphones that work better for me while going for a run. I’ll just use these when my hands are free. I hope this helps
Sound is great but sometimes a single ear bud will disconnect requiring you to reset with case placement.
"These ear buds are ok for the price , they are comfortable , light , easy to pair , however - the sound quality is not that good - sounds very tinny - no real bass , even after using the Tozo equalizer app , the bass is missing .I will keep for backup ."
"I originally bought these for my youngest child. I have offered to buy her higher priced earbuds before, but she has always said ""No"" because she was afraid she would lose them. So she gets wired ones instead. And she is very particular about how they fit in her ears. I saw that these were on-sale & were recommended by a YouTube presenter I follow, so I thought I would give them a try. She put them in her ears & immediately said ""NOPE !"" because she didn't like the way they felt in her ears. So I decided I would give them a try ...Now, I have NEVER been a fan of earbuds either. Mostly because I don't like having anything IN my ear & have preferred on or over the ear headphones instead. But it had been getting to be an issue carrying my Koss UR-40's with me to work. So I was hoping these would be a suitable replacement.Early observations ... they are not UNCOMFORTABLE. I did change the ear tips out for a slightly looser fit. But I am still getting used to how MY voice sounds when I have them in (I am using them for conference calls over my MacBook.) The sound for a teleconference is perfectly fine. There is a definite lack of bass, but that is okay for what I need. One thing I am noticing is a slight lag in getting the audio to my ears. Not sure if that is the earbuds fault, or my Mac Book. Will give them a longer tryout before I make my final judgement.On the plus side the RANGE of the BlueTooth on these is really good. Not that this would be an issue in the office, but at home it's nice to follow a conversation if I need to step away.I will say this, for the price these are a pretty good value. The sound quality isn't the best, but at this price you can't expect THAT much. And they were a breeze to pair which was always the problem I had with other ""cheap"" wireless buds.Bottom Line, I won't make my final judgement on keeping these until AFTER I use them in the office  a few  times. If they do okay there, I will keep them. If not, back they go. Either way I will update this review accordingly.UPDATE: They are going back. I was dealing with having things in my ears, and they were performing just fine - actually BETTER than they did when I tested them at home. But I hit a deal breaker. I used them from 8:00 AM until 11:30 AM, charged them from 11:30-12:30, and started using them again .... and I got a ""Battery Low"" message at 3:15 PM. I need them to last until 5:00 PM or at least CLOSE to that. If I have to use wired headphones, I might as well use my ""Good"" ones.I'll keep looking to see if I can find a pair with BETTER battery life ..."
"As someone who works from home and has a lot of video meetings, I need a good pair of wireless earbuds. Battery life is important. This one claims to have 7 hours of battery life between charges. Well, I can get about halfway through my day before one (or both) earbuds require charging. That does not serve me well.Then there is the other problem - they fall out. Yes, I follow the instructions on wearing them correctly, and they will initially fit snugly. Then I will smile or laugh and one pops out. That looks really professional on a call with senior leadership.The good is that I like the sound quality and the mic quality. Mic quality has been awful on other ones that I've used, so I was very impressed with these- at least when they work and stay in my ears.Needless to say, I'm returning them. If it were just the battery issue, I'd probably just look at getting one with a longer than a promised 7h battery life from the same company. Now I'll keep moving ahead in the quest to find the perfect earbuds that fit and last."
"Audio listening is good, however mic quality is bad. I did tests with different models and you can noticed the difference in the audio recordings. Also, battery life of the case if low, maybe for 2 or 3 complete earbud charges. I love the tiny size, even I can sleep with them in."
I returned this because the battery doesn’t last as long as described
I only wish they would last 10 to 12 hours at least.
"I had a pair of these for several months and ran into an issue with the right earbud having issues charging and eventually the earbuds stopped working altogether. It may have been due to sweat from when I talked to their support about it. I was using this for running so it was heavier sweat than usual. Not sure if these are the best in high moisture scenarios but don't really see them having trouble under normal usage or maybe just had a bad pair. In any case support was super helpful and they quickly sent me another pair at no cost to me when I reported the issue. Can't say enough good things about the company.  They truly care about customer satisfaction.Edit: while the service is great, the new pair ran into the same issue of being easily damaged by sweat. Would not recommend these for running or if you're doing workouts where you sweat a lot."
"Pro: it's easier to ""pair"" with your android phone. Sound is good for listening to Audible.Can't beat the price.  It's a small fraction of the price of Apple IPod.  Comfortable in the ear.Con: iPod's are better sound quality. Deeper register."
I’m a big fan of Tozo.  These were very inexpensive so I pounced on them.  They work but the sound quality is not very good.  Not much base sound.  Spend the extra $10 to go with a higher quality Tozo product.
"They are OK.  I like that their battery lasts a long time.  But my iPhone and iPad had difficulty finding them at first.  And to connect, it is never immediate.  The sound is OK for listening podcasts but not fine music"
"I bought these in a pinch when my previous pair broke, and they've been alright but I don't plan to buy them again. The shape is honestly inconvenient and it's too easy to activate the buttons. Sometimes I find that it's been playing after I took them out because I touched the buttons while putting them away because of how minimalist the design is. And they still try to connect even when they're in the case and the device is connected to another audio source.And maybe it's just me, but these headphones get dirtier faster than any other pair I've had, including wired headphones, both within the speaker portion and the surrounding areas. The surfaces get gross, and it impedes the volume more than I've never noticed with other headphones. On the bright side, it's a good reminder to clean your earbuds. But while trying to clean the speaker, the felt cover slides out easily which I don't think it's supposed to do.Now, after 4 months of daily use, the audio is starting to occasionally crackle, but I could probably get a couple months out of them if I'm careful with them.And of course, despite the listing, there's no microphone that I've been able to get working. I've connected this to at least 4 devices and never picked up any microphone audio from it or seen it listed as an input option.Still, these were a fine interim solution. They sound fine, the control options are useful and responsive, and the battery lasts so long that a low battery warning always caught me off guard."
"I am not an audiophile and usually don't comment on sound quality, but these are not sounding very good to me, but it could be me, e.g. due to allergy-related congestion, though my over-the-ear headphones sound fine to me.  Still fine for my main usage, which is for background music when working, so I'm not really focused on the audio quality that much.The other problem is that the touch controls, while a good idea, are too sensitive and lead to unwanted actions.  E.g., if I am trying to adjust the positioning of bud in my ear to make it more comfortable, I accidentally pause the music.  I have to be very careful to only touch the sides/edges, which is annoying.  It may have been better to put some small buttons somewhere instead.Other than that they seem good so far.  Haven't really put the battery life to the test yet but the features and functionality are as advertised and they were easy to set up and use."
"They are absolutely cheap in every sense of the word. The do work... but, the rubber  parts are poorly made and dig into your skin, it aslo somehow doesn't fully shut off the earbuds to stow them in the case so you have to manually disconnect or wait till they die, and it's ridiculously easy to trigger the sensor so don't even try to lay on your side with them otherwise you will constantly be having to adjust your positions just so that your volume isn't perpetually increasing to destroy your ear drums or completely silent."
"I like to use wireless earbuds for meditation that considerably help my PTSD-related insomnia.  I had a different version of Tozo earbuds purchased almost 2 years ago.  I've still got them, but one of the earbuds dropped on the floor of one of my apartment rooms, and I cannot for the life of me find the damn thing.  So, I ordered this model.  Oh boy, these are not an improvement in my opinion.  First, I don't like the angle these earbuds are shaped at -- they are harder to pop snuggly into the charger and putting on the rubber tips is a frickin' nightmare.  I chose the smallest size; they were a pain to get on and they don't even make them more comfortable (in fact, these earbuds are quite pokey -- the previous model was more rounded).  Even after charging the earbuds for hours, the battery drains pretty quickly.  If I can get a 2-hour bedtime meditation in, there's barely any battery left.  I also hate that both Tozo models automatically cue your damn iTunes library with the lightest touch -- you can drain your battery and not even realize it, or turn your head the wrong way while lying down blissing out to gentle music for relaxing only for the Ramones to start shouting just as you drop off to sleep.  I think I'm going to try a different brand in the future.  I have not been too happy with Tozo overall."
"Decent price but they never stay in my ears. Constantly re-seating them in position. Don't even think about talking or eating because the jaw movement works them out instantly.The shape and smooth matte exterior texture makes it easy for me to drop the buds. Sound quality is ok. Spend a little more and get something with better build materials, better ergonomics, and better sound quality.For a while I kept them by the bedside since that was the only place I was comfortable with dropping them. Lately, I never reach for them anymore since I prefer a headband headset for sleeping comfort. When I'm on the go I have other earbuds with a better design that I don't need to worry about dropping into a gutter.Would not repurchase this item."
"They really didn't fit my tiny ears and they don't come with smaller pads to exchange out, they do not stay charged as long as the description says, and the sensitivity is aggravating because they constantly fall out."
"Sounds quality really good. Left bud looses power after 3 hours while right one still going strong.  Recharge is rather fast. When in use, I'd say they give the $80 buds a run for their money."
"In general, I thought these headphones were okay. The colors are cute and the audio was pretty good. I found the connection to be a little wonky. Sometimes one of the headphones would disconnect when switching apps (like transitioning from listening to Spotify to listening to an audiobook). To reconnect the headphone, I’d have to put it back in the case, close it, and pull it back out. Kind of annoying. That was my biggest issue. I also found them to be fairly uncomfortable, but I may just have small ear canals. I used the extra sizes to see what works best (which were really hard to put on by the way) but still found that one would pop out often and the other would just hurt a lot. I may be better off with open-ear headphones. Lastly, I found that the charge didn’t last that long. They were fine/good for the price, but there were enough annoyances for me to want to get a different pair."
Oh lord
"Firstly, your sound quality from the other model in the past TOZO-NC9 has way better sound quality than these news ones TOZO-A1. Second, it doesn't fit as snuggly as the TOZO-NC9... which is an older model....... Haven't tested the battery life nor the bluetooth connectivity potential yet. But so far that's just already a disappointment. Also the TOZO-NC9 has a feature for noise suppression to either turn it on or off.... this new one doesn't..... why???? 4 years or so and somehow you guys make a worse model??The only thing that the TOZO-NC9 sucks with is the bluetooth connectivity after a while of use.... it doesn't keep up a stable connection....Like how much do I have to pay you to transfer TOZO-NC9's features to the new one??The real reason I bought this was thinking it might have better bluetooth connectivity because they're a newer version.... They're supposed to be ""better""...."
The only problems I have with this headset is it is too low when the volume is up and at times it takes longer to connect with my phone
"For what they cost they are a deal but I just was not loving them.  I needed something on the smaller end to fit in my smaller ear canals and they did do that.  They however did not cancel out as much sound around me as I had hoped.  They also did not last as long as I had hoped.  Lets add talking on the phone is a no go for these, I heard a lot of what huh what you say... I loved the color as they are a really pretty shade of green.  I equally liked the price as well being as they were to be a pair I would not cry if they came up missing.  Now they just live in the bottom the bag I carry to work. I have to say they aren't great but they aren't the worse thing out there either."
"I like this product, it’s easy to use and charge. I also like the cute blue color and it’s portability. It’s not bulky but very compact."
"I got these to replace my tozo t6s that I'd had for a couple years. They work really well, but the rubber ear pieces are super uncomfortable. I tried all of the ones it came with, and I can only wear them for about half an hour before my ear is so sore it needs a break. If I switch them to the ear pieces from my t6's I don't have a problem, but then they don't fit into the case, so I am just taking the rubber pieces on and off all the time."
"These fit my small ears perfectly and are pretty comfortable and secure. Sound quality was great. Sadly, they stopped working after only 8 weeks!"
"Was hoping this would be a good value for the price but they consistently fall out of my ears no matter what size adapter I use. They’re easy to connect, sound quality is good, and I’ve dropped them several times with no damage- so good enough quality as well. Battery life is also good. Overall these would be great value if they simply stayed in my ears and functioned as they should."
I had high hopes based on the reviews now I'm probably going to return or just give to my kids. They are garbage for taking calls. I constantly get told I'm sounding far away or that its low and it is always cutting out with the connection. Sometimes it will just disconnect during the call all together and i will just have to pick it up on my phone. I will have to just replace my apple air pods going cheap never works lol. They do have great sound for just music/audio though and fit good in ears. I will give that as a positive so if that's all u need then they are great I need both.
One side goes in & out often.Have to put back into case to pair them back up. Often very scratchy sounding.
"Like the size. It is easy to use.It’s ok but there are better ones out there.Would not recommend these,"
"These are okay, but both the earbuds and the carrier run out of battery so quickly, when the full sized can last for days. Also, when I try to pause my music using the earbuds, it fades the noise out BEFORE actually pausing the music, so you can't unpause where you started. It might cost more, but the big ones are worth it."
"UPDATE ON SECOND PURCHASE:The old adage is true, ""Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.""A few days after receiving the latest set, I'm only getting about 3 1/2 hours of charge out of the right earbud. The irony is, if it was the left earbud, I could combine both sets to make one working one. Now I have to print out a return label and drive to a return center. I wouldn't recommend these earbuds to anyone.UPDATE:I wrote a review that never seems to have gotten posted; I now have an update.Originally, I purchased 2 sets of A1s and a set of NC2 earbuds. I had some tip issues and it took many emails to tech support to get a response and then I was asked for a 5 star review.Moving forward a few months, I have left one pair of the A1s plugged in at an airport waiting for a flight and the right earpiece of the second set has lost almost all volume. I have cleaned it repeatedly but it does not help. Meanwhile, the NC2s are working ok, about what I expected for such a low cost. Actually, much better bass than I expected for the money.Even though I've had trouble with the first set, I've recently purchased another set of A1s and hope they will last longer than the first. Here are my reasons:1. They are very inexpensive so worth giving it one more shot to see if they hold up. Also, not TOZOs fault I was rushed having to change gates and forgot one pair charging.2. While they were both working, they were excellent for making and taking calls. I was clearly heard and had no problem hearing the caller, much better than the NC2s. I had to swap the NC2s on calls so often that the A1s became my go-tos for everything but music.3. Excellent for audiobooks, podcasts, streaming media (not great for music as bass response is not great, the NC2s are really much better for music.)4. The A1s fit my ears, and more importantly, they stay in for their charge cycle! This is quite important because I've wasted a lot of time on buds that don't fit my small ear canals.So, why only 2 stars for now? Tech support was very hard to reach, and then asked me to post a 5 star review in response to sending me out a set of tips (which turned out to be for another style), and because the right earbud dropped to about 10% of max volume about 6 weeks in.But like I said, I'm willing to gamble another $17 because there are the first buds to actually fit, stay in and be comfortable all day. If these last for a few months I'll purchase another set so I have all-day coverage for calls and use the NC2s for music in the evening and night.ORIGINAL REVIEW:They are decent for the price, I purchased 3 sets but I need more of the smallest eartips they supply. I have written support a few times to purchase them but no response. I can't agree with the posts that talk about ""excellent technical support"". The buds are fine until you need more tips; I've already wasted the cost of a new pair of A1 buds trying to find the correct tips on my own."
"Pros: great sound quality with equalizer features, great lookCons: the case has open top so could lose earpieces at any moment and not know, not friendly for small ears, bulky, shuts off after allotted non-usage (which could be a pro but reconnecting to device they have to be inserted back into case and taken out again, buttons are capacitive so it's hard to determine your selections ( unless used to such feature)Other than that the battery life on them have been great and I enjoy listening to music on them. They have great sound. At least when they stay in my ears but that's only if I'm not moving around. They haven't been lost yet but came close to only because the case has no lid/cap which is an odd design choice for something like this if you ask me. That's my biggest gripe really is the open case and the reconnecting process after they cut off. There should be a way to connect them without putting them back in the case cause when I work in always doing something with my hands and have to wait most of the time before I can get a chance to do it so it defeats their purpose when you can't listen to music half the day.They are comfortable enough to where sometimes you forget they are there until you have to scratch your ear or something.All in all a good product just wanted to list some precautions if this could mean you also."
"I’ve had these for around six months now. The quality of sound is fine however, these earbuds randomly cut out in sound pretty frequently. They have been doing this since I bought them. When it first happened I thought that I accidentally paused my music. Sometimes it just completely cuts out up to 5 seconds of music/sound. I also know that it is not my phone or my Spotify app because I do not have this problem with other earbuds that have been connected to my current phone. This also happens with any app I use with the earbuds. If I’m listening to something on YouTube with these earbuds, they’ll cut out, if I use audible, they’ll cut out.These earbuds will also tell you literally 10 times that the battery is low before they die which is just an unnecessary amount. Likely if you are using your earbuds you aren’t able to charge them in the current moment so for it to continually stop whatever you’re listening to so it can tell you that the battery is low is really obnoxious. If it only told you 2 or 3 times that its battery was low, that would be fine, however, the amount of times it tells you is so excessive. That being said the battery life is pretty decent but then again, it frequently cuts out on sound, regardless of how much charge it has.Finally, I thought since the case does not have a lid they would have compensated by putting a very strong magnet in the earbud and case. That is not the case. If you drop them in the case from any distance, they will fall out.Personally would not recommend this particular pair. This was super disappointing because JBL is usually really good for speakers and such so for these to have so many issues is very surprising to me. I haven’t tried other JBL earbuds so I’m not sure if they just don’t make very good earbuds or if just this particular pair isn’t good."
Bought these about 6 months ago to replace my old JBL earbuds and these were on sale.Pros:-Battery life is great. I use them for up to 6 hours daily for 5 days a week and usually only need to charge them once every few weeks.-Great sound quality and volumeCons:-They are touch activated which is okay because they aren't overly sensitive but sometimes doesn't catch the taps so it'll stop the music instead of skipping the song.-They randomly cut the music. Not like a pause but it's just a gap in playback. It's not due to low battery because they tell you when the battery is low. Not a big deal but it's annoying and I have yet to figure out what causes it.Overall not bad for the price but personally I'll be paying a little more next time for a different pair.
"I have had a Jbl Bluetooth speaker that has really impressive sound quality and output for its size so I wanted to try Jbl again when I needed headphones…I’ve had these headphones for about 10 months now and I’m frustrated enough now to want a different set..Pros:the sound options and clarity are great (see con below).I like that it comes with a case that recharges the buds*the adjustable settings on the app are pretty cool if you want a more of a pass through sound to hear the world around you, or if you want more exterior sound silencing. I love this because well- kids. lolCons:*The connection randomly disconnects for like half a second. The ear buds are fully charged and is literally right next to the device it’s connected to..*the fit is never right no matter what size silicone plugs I try they fall out of my ears. I think the earbud itself is too large/heavy for it to stay in place for the size/length of the peice that actually gets inserted. Which really defeats the purpose of these at all. I basically am always adjusting them wether I’m sitting or moving around.I will try Jbl again, I just think these are a miss…"
"I'm writing this review because of all of the TV commercials that are pitching JBL earbuds on Amazon. I bought mine several months ago and never wrote a review but finally decided I needed to to warn the public from wasting your money. Unless they've upgraded their technology since I bought them earlier in 2024, I beg you to choose another brand - because although the sound quality was a little bit better than some cheaper ones that I have owned, I can't even get through a song or a podcast without wanting to throw the earbuds across the room. It's like trying to hear someone on the phone who is about to head out of service area and is breaking up. It kind of defeats the quality tone production that these earbuds offer. They also fell out of my ears more than the other ones that I have had. Comfortable fit but not very tight. And I have a small to medium female ears.  I'm actually astonished that JBL hasn't managed to fix this problem. At least not to my knowledge. I used to raise my eyebrows when I would see JBL technology. Not anymore."
"As I mentioned the clarity was great (better than Apple AirPods). What brought the rating down, first was the case. I thought I could get along without having a lid or cover for charging case.  Even though there’s a strong magnetic fit, one bud still came out after that I was paranoid. 2nd down point- if I was listening to music and received a call, the call didn’t automatically switch to the earbuds, I had to physically select JBL Vibe in order to be connected. And 3rd &last down point- I could never tell how charged up they were. Maybe I missed it but I couldn’t determine the earbud charge or the case. For lacking these features, the price should have been lower."
I do not like that the case has no top closure and aftermarket cases have a closure that doesn't work.
Crappy fit in the ear
"Okay, I've owned these for just about six months now and they're the epitome of only fine.Pros:Wireless (duh)Charging case lasts a whileConnecting to phone is easy enoughCons:Random bits of silence while watching YouTube on mobile.Random LOUD squeaking noise (has increased in occurrence the longer I've had them)The JBL app is atrocious, it takes what feels like a whole minute before it responds to ANY input.Open case kind of collects grime.Honestly the app is probably the worst thing about these, but if you have a sensitivity to very loud, high pitched, screeling, then these probably are NOT for you.I work remote and just needed something to listen to music to drown out the rest of my apartment, and it works fine for that.Not the best, or the worst. Probably could get the same quality cheaper. I would probably buy another pair if it was between these and an unknown brand, but with the abundance of wireless earbuds now, probably won't be getting a replacement once these give out."
"I’ve used these for a few days now and so far they seem fine. They sound good, the app is easy to use, the battery life is ok. However there is no lid to the case. So if you drop it or carry it in a bag or pocket or even clip them on something, there’s a good chance you’ll lose one or both earbuds. The buds do attach into the case via magnet, but it’s still a weird design choice to just not put a lid or cover on these."
"This is my third set of budget earbuds (diff. models) I've gotten from JBL. I've owned this particular one for 10 months.My main complaint is how one earbud will just cut out randomly. It is really annoying and disorienting to be listening to music and one side suddenly just lose all sound.Sound quality is average...Okay-ish? It isn't as good as my other earbuds I've gotten since buying this (to fill other niche roles for my daily use) but it does have that bass-heavy sound quality that JBL seems to be well known for.I'd advise against buying these and keep looking unless the >$50 price point is that much valuable to you and/or you're absolutely set on getting something from JBL...Otherwise, I think these are just e-waste. I feel as thought most of the $50 spent on these earbuds just go toward brand recognition. Sound quality isn't good enough to justify sound to be cutting out frequently. I'm using them just now for the first time in months due to the connection issues and I'm trying to decide whether I want to throw them out because quality-wise are worse then the no-name Chinese generic bluetooth earbuds I use."
The right ear bud dies not work and I ordered in July 2024 and it’s October. Unfortunately I can not send back and get a refund or replacement or buy a BETTER  pair.
Easy to pair sound was ok has app but clarity was not as advertised.
"When listening with one earbud these headphones constantly drop 1-3 seconds of audio, which when listening to an audiobook, can be a significant portion of a sentence. less of a big deal with music because its usually not a huge deal to miss a few words of a song. when listening with both, these headphones are 4.5 stars, good sound, good bass. only problem is if you smile or shift your jaw too much they fall out; not secure. also the case only uses small magnets to hold them in place, if you drop them, they get ejected and you have to go hunting for where they went."
"Initial inspection, all seemed well, well built, and the sound quality was great.  Pairing is simple as can be. No long press, when I took the buds out o the charge case, a voice said something, don't know what, but when they first turn on, Bluetooth on the phone automatically saw them.The BIGGEST CON:If you hold the left button long enough on Android, that stupid Bixby thing comes up and I've never figured out how to disable this useless feature of the Android.The serious CONS:I have prescription eye glasses to corrected vision and STILL had to break out a magnifying glass to try and read the ""Quick Start:, the owners manual(?), I just said to heck with that. The graphic ""quick start"" instructions were counter intuitive for me, their pretty lousy.The controls are a big disappointment, followed the quick start, searched Youtube, JBL online support was pretty much same as the graphic quick start, but I could not get the volume down to work for 30 minutes. Finally it just started working, one tap on the left ear button will slowing increase volume, two taps is supposed to decrease volume but its just too flakey and slow, volume down, not very responsive.Most every time I try to adjust the volume, my phone just drops the call and hangs up.When I installed the JBL speaker app, I feared it had bricked my phone, txt msg's wouldn't go out, phone calls could not be placed.The charging box is ok, it does not have a lid to close for protection when carrying the buds in your pack or purse.The the PROS (for me)Ok, they sound very good!Nice to have a stubby short USB C cable, right this minute, that's the best part about this item and purchase.I really wanted to like these and I admit, I didn't know if I'd really like w/less earbuds but I think I will when I purchase a better even more expensive brand. I bought these because of a ""Prime Deal"" cheap.I'm sorry, but would definitely not recommend these to an acquaintance and absolutely not a friend.  Sorry JBL."
"Sound quality is ok, but no matter which ear insert size I try they do not fit well and tend to fall out.  My ears are average size, so they shoud fit, but the bud insertion extension is too short, not allowing a complete seal, so the sound quality is poor unless you use your hands to hold them in your ears."
"The experience with the JBL Vibe Buds headphones left much to be desired, primarily due to two notable shortcomings. Firstly, their inability to stay securely in the ears proved to be a considerable frustration. Whether engaged in physical activity or simply trying to enjoy music on the go, the constant readjustment detracted significantly from the overall listening experience. Such an issue speaks directly to the fundamental requirement of headphones to provide both comfort and stability, aspects which the JBL Vibe Buds seemingly fell short on.Secondly, while seemingly a minor detail to some, the absence of a cover for the case revealed a lack of attention to detail in the product's design. A case cover serves as more than just an aesthetic addition; it's a practical feature that enhances the longevity and protection of the headphones. Without it, the case is left vulnerable to scratches, dust, and other potential damage, ultimately compromising the investment made in the headphones."
"Audio quality is decent. Not great by any means but is quality enough to where its not jarring when listening to music or yt. It does this weird thing where it pauses audio for half a second, I don’t even touch it or anything. I don’t like how theres not a cap to the container they go in either, they’re magnetically in there but I don’t trust leaving them in my purse or backpack without them getting lost. They do tend to fall out of my ears, but that’s probably just me.Great for broke college students who will never be able to afford AirPods like me 👍"
"They work, as in they produce audio from a bluetooth source. Other than that, you can skip this product and get something else. Probably just get the Airpods you were thinking about.Very high latency when trying to use on gaming consoles make them a no-go there.Audio quality is ... fine."
There is no top lid to close the case. The ear buds fall out if you just put in your bag. I had to order an outer case to keep the ear buds in the original case
I did not like when I'm outside on a windy dayThe wind makes the buds a horrible noises  but other than that they are good for the price
"These fit very awkwardly in my ears. I haven't had this issue with previous pairs of JBLs, so I can't really blame myself on that one. But they're kind of big in comparison, and my ears get tired of these very quickly. I do like the way they sound, but it's hard to recommend something that kinda hurts! Also, there's no lid on the container, so they could very easily fall out - magnetism or not, if the case falls off the coffee table, one of them goes flying."
Ear buds come out if moving around.
"Quite frankly, I shouldn't be surprised at the quality, or lack there of with these ear buds.First of all, yes, I should have forgone these based solely for the fact there isn't a ""lid.""YES, IT MATTERS.The claim that the magnets are sufficient to hold them securely in place is a complete false.Once you put them in their cradle, you certainly feel, and hear a click which is supposed to keep them in place.Like most of us do when we are finished using them, we put them in our bag/backpack.Nope...any jostling of your bag could dislodge thr buds from their cradle. You'll instantly hear a high pitched tone/reverb type of noise. This means they aren't secure, nor charging.There's that...As for connecting these buds to multiple sources, (having the new source recognizing these earbuds) you must disconnect them every time from the 1st source.PRO: Charges fastThe earbud rubber covers come off way too easily. Good luck finding them on the ground...PRO: Sound quality is just OK, nothing to be praised about,regardless if you use the ambient or talk-over settings. I use them in my gym, and unlike my more expensive buds...the external sounds drowned out these buds sound capacity/capabilities.Lesson: Just spend your money for a more reputable/established device which is known for their sound/build quality."
"Mediocre all around on sound and comfort and battery time, worse part is the refurbished earbuds stopped charging after the second plug in after a cumulative 10 hours of use."
"When they aren’t cutting out, the sound is great. Microphone not so much, I’ve been told that everyone can hear whatever is happening on my end in the background very clearly. The biggest issue is that they keep cutting out and it’s so hit or miss it’s a nuisance. I’ve tried resetting them and unpairing and forgetting etc etc with no luck at all"
Very good sound but a month later it started to skip songs and pause them by its self
"These ear buds are not for anyone with a small ear opening. They keep falling out of my ears. Inexpensive, but not worth it if you have to keep chasing them on the ground when they fall out."
"So far I’ve had a good experience. Not as I expected from JBL but it’s been fair enough. Very good comfortability while using them, good sound, good charge, fast charging is amazing.One bad thing which is very uncomfortable that happens while using it, they skip sound. Like the sound cut for very short seconds and I have not been able to confirm why it happens. if it’s a problem of the ear buds or if it’s a bad setting up."
"I’ve been purchasing JBL earbuds for years and have been highly satisfied with value for price until this set of earbuds.In general, the battery life, fit, and sound quality of the buds is consistent with past purchases. I think the fact that they did away with the lid on the charging case and I didn’t realize that when purchasing, but that hasn’t actually posed an issue.The main problem I have with the earbuds is that they have repeated issues with cutting out when I have them in mono mode (using only one bud, with the other in the case, which is how I typically use earbuds). These interruptions are short (half a second, maybe?) but persistent and incredibly annoying. This has happened across multiple devices and after multiple attempts to unpair and re-pair. Having both earbuds out of the case (forcing stereo mode) solves the problem, but is not practical for me — I like having one earbud always charged/charging.I’m going to try to get this set exchanged for being defective and will update this review if the new set is better or has the same problem."
Nice battery life.Sound quality is good when audio isn't cutting out
"Good sound quality but this is my second pair with a charging defect. The first one lasted about 2 years before one ear bud stopped charging which is to be expected and I'm completely satisfied with, but this pair arrived with inconsistent charging in one bud, it only charges about every other time I put it back in the charger and I have to kind of fiddle with it to get it to start charging. I really like the ""smartness"" of these and the app."
They worked well for a couple of days then my calls started dropping and people were not able to hear me although I could hear them fine.
The device has a good sound. The no lid on charging station is stupid and you have to use their app to use them  ..an app that forces you to give them access to data they can sell. ..probably going to return them even though they have a great sound
they sound good but they don’t fit in my ears tight
idk if it’s just me but this type of earbuds always fall off my ears so i have to always use some kind of head band so they can stay on.. aside that they work eh. playing music and the sounds goes off and on as if someone if paused the music then continues. not sure if it’s bad cellular signar or the headphones but it’s only happened while wearing these and not any other kind i’ve owned.
These work good but overall there is sometimes the noise goes out a little bit like you can hear like a skip in the music or when you’re on the phone it’s just like a little tone I guess
"For the price it is a great deal! Easy to connect, and has long lasting battery, very durable. The only sad thing is that they are not noise cancelling so they pick up on alot of background noise."
"Decided to try these earbuds because of my heavy respect for the JBL brand and the larger devices that they make. That was my first mistake. The audio quality is mediocre, and the battery life is several hours shorter than other cheaper, better, less well-known brands that I have purchased in the past.The charging case has an open face, which seems OK initially, but is a huge fail once you start trying to carry these around in your pockets or in a backpack. It means that dust, lint, and dirt have ready access to the earbuds and requires extra maintenance from time to time.I’d steer clear until JBL gets their act together on reasonably priced earbuds ."
"So I had high hopes as most of our stuff is JBLAnd we love them all! … But these earbuds leave a lot to be desired. The battery light is ridiculous. I wear them throughout the night and have to charge them before I even leave work. My cheaper ones last almost 15 hours on one charge.They cut out so badly, I have never had earbuds that do this. It's super annoying.,  And why dose the case not have a lid???  I have to keep the case in a plastic bag to keep the charging components dry.I should have just stuck with the cheap ones...I will more than likely send these back if I can find the box.Oh and they got lost during shipping and were over a week late."
"decent buds, they fall out on occasion and will connect to my phone seemingly randomly while they are in my pocket.  they have also fallen out of the case multiple times as there is no lid or top cover.  wouldn't have been hard to add one, not sure why they didnt.  sound quality isnt awful but definitely not fantastic. overall, you get what you pay for."
Headline says it all.  I had perfectly functioning ear buds by another  brand bought these because they claimed a long battery life.  This was exaggerated because the life is less than expected and annoying to need to keep two sets on my night stand.  All I wanted was one set that could stay charged for about 6 hours
They fall out they are top heavy
"These headphones are good for the price but I struggled to keep them in my ear. I even applied all of the different tips and still no luck. Bought some foam ones and they stay in alright. Only other issue I have is that the audio seems to cut off randomly maybe 3 timers per day. Battery however is really good, and the charge seems to be really fast. very durable and other than the tips they fit well."
"Maybe it's my ears, but they do not fit well and the controls suck.  anytime your get close to touching your ear they stop, pause, turnoff, etc.  I gave them to my son and got normal wireless JBL headphones.  Way better."
They sound ok but you can make them sound better through the jbl app. I have had these for about a month now and all of a sudden they just stopped holding g a charge. If it wasn't for that they would be good. They do stay in my ears really well. I hate that they won't hold a charge.
"These a a little larger than expected and the DO NOT come with a travel case. They have a “base” but it’s not enclosed so the buds can easily fall out. The sound quality is good and the come with different ear pieces for fitting. They do have features of tap to up/down volume/mute/off. I made my own travelCase, and it’s works fine so I’m keeping them!"
Lost an earbud due to it falling out of case. Sound was okay but will not order a case that doesn’t close again
It did not come with a charging cable. Efforts to find out if I can get one from JB support didn't help.
"It  sounds  great.  It  also  cuts  off  like  this  review. The earbuds actually feels great and the music is crystal clear. When i started using them they cut off so much, like too much. I though it was my phone, so i got a new one, still does the same thing. I was thinking maybe it was because it was in my pocket but i put it in a table and got the same thing.  I use other Bluetooth earbuds and they connect so much better. I dont know if it can be that it was outside on the rain when it was delivered. the case was fine and not too wet inside. connection wise it is crap, i use the black shark earbuds and get better connection then these. They fit well, and the music is great sounding but the connection sounds like a CD that has starches on it and i either miss 1 second or 3 seconds of what ever i am listening."
Can I still return it after a trash the packaging. It’s frustrating to listen on keep cutting in and out audio
The sound is very good. The problem they constantly fall out.. do not stay in the ear very well..
"They are decent but tend to cut out a lot. Can't really tell why. Decent price,ok sound."
"The earbuds work well and the ability of the app to configure the controls was nice. They don't stay in my ears. I have had difficulties with other earbuds even using their smallest tips. These don't even start to go into my ear canals, and the tips just fold back on the stem and at a random time later unfold ejecting the bud from my ear. I will stick with buds which have some sort of wings."
They work good but I wish they had a lid to keep them from falling out.
Pretty good Price works good. I’ll recommend this product. Good quality sound she is Wireless buds
Sound is solid. Noise cancellation is there. Does the job I need. Solid sound. Slight bass.
does not give you any extra sizes so they fall out of my ears.
My only issue is that they easily fall out of my ears.
Earbuds sound tinny. Little bit on the difficult side to adjust.
Too small for my old fingers  and eyes to use
But these earbuds are not very loud and the charging case doesn’t have lid. It is not really ideal for work. I would use these as back up in a quiet setting when my other head phones run out of charge.
"I’ve had mine since may of this year and have no problem. The battery last all day, they stay in just fine but here recently the sound cuts in and out like it’s being paused and resumed and I’ve found no way to get around it. Very distracting and disappointing when listening. It’s a very big issue of mine when trying to use these. Would’ve given a higher rating if these weren’t having this issue."
"On my 3rd pair of these ear buds. 1st pair was good and lasted almost a year till I washed them.Bought a 2nd pair here and that's where I started having problems.The left ear bud never charged, so it worked for maybe 6 hours before it never worked again. Nothing I did mattered and I was able to do a warranty exchange.The refurbished ear buds are just terrible and I can't get a response from JBL. They are physically fine and charge, but they constantly drop the Bluetooth connection. Paused music? Need to reconnect. Switched apps? Need to reconnect. Lost connection for unknown reason? Well how about a reconnection! Each reconnect takes anywhere from 10-60 seconds. Oh yeah and when you're first turning them on it takes about 3-5 connections before they actually remain connected.I have other over the ear Bluetooth & workout ear buds that have 0 problems."
"I had a different pair of JBLs that I absolutely loved. They broke so I bought these as a replacement. These don't automatically disconnect from wifi if they're not in use. So, if you have Bluetooth on and they're not in use, you won't hear  your phone ring. Phone calls are atrocious. They break up and it's impossible to hear the other party"
People I talk to can't stand how hyper sensitive my buds are to background noise. No way to adjust it that I can find.
My earbuds were great at first. Within 3 months they would randomly cut out missing part of a word. Now 6 months later they are skipping out about every third word. I’m really disappointed.
"These have very spotty connection even when the phone is within a couple feet.  They also won’t stay in ear, even with different sized ear pieces. Finally the battery charge lasts maybe 30 minutes before it has to be charged again.  Also without a lid, the earbuds fall out of the case in your pocket and connect with your phone (while still in n the pocket).  Two stars is generous."
"Even their smallest ear bud was too big to fully fit my ear; I have to position them in a specific way or they will fall out every minute especially when I’m moving. Even when positioning them in the ideal spot they still fall out constantly and need to be readjusted to stay in my ears. When you readjusting you often change the volume but are more likely to skip the song you’re listening too or pause your music. Overall would’nt but again; I love the brand I’ve always had good products from them but I would never buy these ear buds again. I know someone who got their earbuds that wrap around your ear and he recommends them heavily so that will be my next purchase. I tried them and honestly they worked so much better. They have much better headphones that are much more so worth the price. They stay charged for an amazing amount of time but I’m not sure that’s really worth it. When using the headphones the quality of noise is extremely affected when you only are using one headphone; the music will cut out, the pitch will change randomly to a higher pitch, the static will kill your ear drums… extra. I’ve found the left ear headphone works better than the right. Overall I wish I could use just one earbud at times but cannot due to all of the issues that come along with the headphones as a pair and as separate headphones so it’s great. I feel like I wasted my money on this purchase"
"When they work properly they are really good for the money. However, I use one earbud at a time and they do not support that. They will continuously connect to the other earbud cutting the sound off of the one in your ear. They will also play while they are in the case, if a complete connection with any made. The case not having a lid doesn’t help. On the good side they fit nice, sound good, have a comfortable fit and tap functions work well. If you can get a deal on them, they are worth it I suppose, but do not pay full price. Just buy the next step up by JBL."
Like for the 3 days I had but because they have no cover my keys nocked them out of there case well there were in my pocket and I lost them. Major flaw otherwise good product.
"This 2 stars are for the shape of the buds, they feel light and stay on better than all the other brands.The case makes a weird sound when charging it.Really, I need a cover bc of the dust. When buying it, I didn't think about dust and small debris getting into the coverless case but saw the need for a cover immediately after I started to toss it in my backpack or purse. Had to get a little zipper purse and was happy. Couldn't get rid of the nasty sound upon charging. Really, keep looking, that isn't easy to deal with."
"Only weird thing is there isn’t a lid on the charging case, which makes me nervous because I’m prone to losing earphones lol. but sound is good and bluetooth pairing was easy."
"The sound quality is great, when it isn’t randomly cutting out. I made sure the battery is full and no other devices around but it still does it. Comfortable and good quality overall otherwise."
Bass not as good as others
Decent but tricky fit and muffled sound
"Decent sound and bass but stupid case design. I don't know who's dumb idea it was to make a earbud case without a top to shut it close. The only thing keeping these earbuds from falling out is the magnets that charge the earbuds. One drop and these things go flying out of the case. Besides the case, the earbuds aren't bad."
"So I’ve bought JBL’s in the past. Plenty of them (as gifts). These are the worst, by comparison. Every time I try to use a single ear piece the sound cuts off and back on. Fully charged, and near my device. It’s the most aggravating issue with them. It’s not just one, it’s both. My other JBLs never had this issue. I would not recommend these particular earbuds."
No cap gets dirt easily
"I have no idea why the buds fade in and out at times. So, because of this I could not offer a better rating"
Sound quality is great till you go to use hear through tech then it produces a white noise full time jabra did not do this on their old model at least so comparing it to that I can't really rate this high as that's a huge function for me at work and I dont like the white noise
"I was expecting better sound quality from JBL who has been making audio equipment forever.  Also, the ear buds keep falling out of my ears no matter what size I tried.  My $5 headphones have better sound quality."
"Bought these for my husband, after just a couple of weeks of using he says the sound is weak. He is not satisfied with them."
"Bought these in a hurry as I couldn't find my other ear buds and was leaving on a trip a couple of days later.  I down loaded the app and started playing around with the settings and it was kind of cool but all in all the sound was disappointing.  No matter what I set the sound to, it did not give me the sound I was hoping for.  While mowing or being outdoors with these in, the wind could be heard instead of the music and that was also disappointing.  Looking for something else now to replace these."
"To be fair, the audio quality is good, and they work in a pinch, but they're not worth the price.  It makes you install an app which does practically nothing, the shape of the buds is tiny and awkward, the touch controls on th buds don't always work, and they cut out CONSTANTLY.  I'm not even goimg to bother editing this review."
"As a fan of JBL headphones, I was very excited to try these headphones. And well, they aren't as amazing as other JBL products I've purchased before.The Pros:* Good sound quality* Fast charging case and good battery lifeThe Cons:* HEADPHONES CONSTANTLY CUT OUT* Case has no lid* Ear cushions constantly detach from earbuds"
"The earbuds themselves are not a problem, sound is good however if you are working out a sweat they will slip off your ears."
Don’t know if i got a defective pair but there was a noticeable delay
"Used maybe a handful of times, and all a sudden one bud just stopped working.  Very disappointed."
"Very comfy and sound is just as good as a pair of beats but these cut out for like, half a second constantly. I have worn them like three times now because my puppy ate one of my beats and I did not want to spend that kinda money on another pair. Still use the one beat and then use these once my beat dies. I use one at a time due to my job but have even carried the other with me and still the same thing. Annoying but very nice fit and sound 🫶"
"Great sounding buds, but there is no lid.  One Earbud was lost.  Get a container one with a lid."
Works well but bad thing is no lid. So the buds can pop out easy if dropped they will go flying.
Sound quality is decent but when I only use 1 headphone instead of both the signal constantly cuts in and out  ☹️
Long lasting battery for work only down side is there’s no top for the case so you can see the ear buds but they do hold well
"I returned them to JBL. They would loose a second of audio while listening to an audio book. They didn’t disconnect completely, I would just miss a few words. JBL is sending me a new pair. There are several articles about this issue. This was straight out of the box, phone right next to me. I did try what JBL recommended to try and resolve the issue and it did not work. Connected to my wife’s AirPods and they worked fine."
These tend to fall out of my ears FREQUENTLY. I’ve had other wireless earbuds and didn’t have this big of an issue with them falling out. The sound is good and the battery life is great too.
"They are quite large and fill your ears. You do kinda get this head pressure but they silence out the surroundings since they're so snug. The battery life is OK and sound quality seems to be have a lot of bass. Exercising with them is alright and after some days you do get used to their fit. There's no way to turn them off even after following the manual instructions so they're always in the case.However, I did notice that the bluetooth audio delay was enormous compared to some others. Also the mic/call quality is not that great when connected to my laptop/Google Voice. After reading reviews I thought they'd be pretty good but the other person also kept cutting off and I could tell she was receiving my voice as a delay as well. Ended up returning them as also the buttons on the earphones are really sensitive to click. There were times that I was watching a video and the video would pause on its own. I'd say for the price they're alright since they're BT 5.3 but then I went with another brand and much much better only for slightly more."
Very comfortable to wear. White color easier to find if lost. I had been using a $12.00 pair of earbuds before purchasing these that weren't very comfortable to wear but the sound was clear the new earbuds are so comfortable I forget I'm wearing them but unfortunately I must strain to hear when listening to a podcast. The sound is very muffled not clear sounding at all compared to my previous less expensive earbuds even after adjusting the levels to my tablet. Easy pairing battery charging good .I did lose connection while in my home in areas not previously a problem but did quickly reconnect. I will keep for a backup in case I lose my other pair the muffled sound is just too hard to hear to use daily and for that reason I would not buy again.
"These were easy to pair with my Samsung 23 phone, and have decent sound quality. But the battery life is less than stellar. I am a yakker on my phone. I talk with friends sometimes for hours and had been using a corded earbud set. I wanted a cordless, the price was right for these and the reviews looked good. But I have found the battery life not up to what I need. The charging case showed 100 percent on both buds. (Note: I only use the right one because using both at once makes me feel almost claustrophobic, I know sounds weird...) Anyway, I found I only get about an hour of continuous use before it dies. Maybe if I used them for listening to music it would be different, but phone use? Not so great."
"So first off these are cheaply made with it being very light and all plastic so one drop and the buds fly out! And there’s no case that exists for it. Second, the delay between my YouTube videos and the earbuds is VERY noticeable. I was originally using my AirPods but one of the tips broke and I figured I’ll try these. I should’ve just gotten extra tips because the latency is very distracting. Other than those 2 things, the sound quality was amazing. I would say a few aspects of the sound were even better than AirPods. Mostly the impeccable bass . However there is no Spatial Audio so if you are used to that then this may be very noticeable and sound kinda flat with some punchy bass. Connectivity wise, it connects very fast. It’s a bit tough to get the buds out the case but that’s just a minor issue. Great battery life! Better than the AirPods life. And the range is good! Set up was a piece of cake. Wish they had more Colors besides black and red though. I will be returning these but for the price it wasn’t too bad."
"I got these for online school, my old AirPods just wouldn't last more than 30 mins anymore, so I needed a pair that could last 2 hours of online lecture plus 3 more hours of work, and these do. However, they don't go from device to device smoothly (Mac to phone), not noise cancelling like advertised, if you happen to take them off for whatever reason they disconnect completely, and to control by the tapping on the EarPods isn't as smooth. Overall, it gets the job done. They are worth the discounted price, but not the full 100 and some price it's originally marked for."
"Let me just that for the price these are worth the investment. For my purpose didn’t work as I would have liked.I bought these for my aging father so he wouldn’t have to hold his phone on speaker when taking calls or thumbing through his social media, however, the ear plugs are difficult to get out of the case for me, and my dad has dexterity issues so for him it is next to impossible being home alone.  The sound and utility are good and shouldn’t be compared to earpods, but at $20 you can’t beat what they do."
"I can,t rate the product as it is for shift exchange. It arrived on schedule and the price was such that you can,t go far wrong. I may get a pair for myself."
"Easy set up, music sounds good through them, only problem is a couple friends told me I sound weird talking to them and they can hear they're own voice in their phone every time they speak to me. Good thing they're $15(Black Friday)"
They’re ok. Price is good for the product but they’re uncomfortable to wear. I only wore them for a little bit then took them out
"I ordered 2 of this item. One works as expected. The other one had to be returned The charging case showed that the case and earbuds were charged. After you remove earbuds from the case, both earbuds flashed green But then one earbud stopped flashing and could not be manually started again. Would not connect to Bluetooth. They also have a flaw in where the Touch button is located. It is too easy to hit when insert / remove earbuds from ears."
"Sound is just ok, they don’t fit in the ears very well and fall out super easy. You get what you pay for."
Mic is trash but sound is great with music
I was really happy with earphone sound  quality but one of them fell apart and I can no longer use them and I can return them even bought it’s only been a month.  I used them about everyday and the one just cracked.
They have a good sound and are comfortable in the ears.  The shape of the earbuds are such that they are difficult to overpower the magnets to remove them from the charger.  They easily fall out of the ear regardless of what adapter you use.  Will not play over a hour a  half without a recharge.
"These fit well and have good sound and range. But, the battery life is awful. I use them for listening to discord while working. Just listening to people talking, the battery life is 3hrs., no where near the up to 9hrs. advertised"
Don’t always work
"Overall good quality and sound, not great though. These are hard to pick and remove from the case. You also need to remove them from the case to connect, no like apple that you just need to open the case…"
"Update: After writing my previous review, the company reached out to me to help me with the problems I had. They seem to be a very good company who stands by their product and offer great customer service.They fall out of my ear constantly and they hurt my ear. They fit better if I put them in the opposite ear, upside down 🤦‍♀️ I don't recommend."
These are middle of the road ear buds. They connect well and the sound is ok. I would recommend for young teens who loose their ear buds often.
"They’re budget earbuds. That being said they work pretty good, hold a really good charge. Have good distance and are pretty durable. I use them for podcast listening. They’re subpar for music listening"
"Of all the wireless earbuds I’ve purchased, these are the least comfortable. They do keep a long charge though"
"Well the sound is OK, I suppose that is why you get them, but in all honesty they keep falling out of my ear!  So can't really wear them."
The Mico phone wasn’t loud enough for me
Sound quality is not what i was expecting and volume goes up to medium.
the earbuds are good but they constantly fall out of my ears when working out
I have trouble keeping these ear buds in my ears. They fall out easily.  I don't know how to prevent this from happening .
The work and easy to connect to.  They not really comfortable in your ear.  But they work good.
If your around any constant noise the volume doesn't go loud enough to be heard over the noise. So the music sound is drowned out. JMO
"Doesn't work properly, hard to connect to devices."
They are like the ones I bought a while back
"Not too bad for the money, but if you try to increase the volume too much you get a lot of noise and distortion.."
They’re alright for the price. Took forever to get them though. There is a huge lag between the voices and videos. Works good in a pinch I guess
Ten dollar ear buds is exactly what they are. You have resetting the Bluetooth on then.
Was t expecting much for the price I paid.  Even though it comes with extra cushions once you take them off it’s next to imposdible to get them back on.  Now they don’t stay on my ears and I’m sure it’s a matter of time before they fall out abd I lose them.  You get what you pay for  They do pair very easily
They work greatVery hard to get out of case if you have large hands
Quality is very good..I would of actually rated this as a 5 overall except for the fact that I ordered 2 sets and one was missing the charger😩
"Just one problem, I don't like having buds in my ears for hours they hurt after awhile. And for television there was a serious lag. I guess for a phone they are okay but I wouldn't use them for that. So glad I only spent 16.00 for the black ones."
The case is tiny. I couldn't open it at first. It's half the size of my previous ear bud set. The display is to small and hard to read. I like how I can tap them to stop the music.
"The feel like the earbuds made me feel as if my ears were too small, the general size of the bud head felt large even using the smaller ear plugs, the buds felt as they would fall out, they didn't sit well in the channel.As for sound quality, I didn't hear the higher bass as claimed, I didn't like that I didn't have control over my sound.  I realize that price has got allot to do with that, so one has to make their own choices.The one item that I didn't particularly like was the magnet like catch the earbuds latched on to the case, they were hard to remove, I had to use my fingernails to remove them from the case with difficulty."
"I bought these after I lost my JVC HA-A3T earbuds. The quality in these is lacking. If they are already paired with one device (such as my laptop) they will refuse to pair with my phone, even if my laptop is closed up. My JVC earbuds would automatically disconnect with previous devices when I tried to connect another device.I find them decently comfortable, however the left one stopped working after owning them for only a month. I don't use them every day, and when I do its only 1 or 2 hours, max. The case doesn't register the left bud anymore and apparently stopped charging it."
"Couldn’t get more than a few minutes of listening with these before it would start cutting out, sometimes in one earbud, sometimes in both. Usually it was just choppy but occasionally it would cut out entirely, even as my phone or computer were still playing music or videos.Charging case didn’t have much life to it either. Even with only listening for a few minutes a handful of times, a fully charged case would drop 20-25% within just an hour or so.Couple of stars for ear comfort and sound quality when they would actually connect, but very unreliable."
"Falls out constantly, works well enough though"
Odd and annoying that it is so difficult to get the earbuds out of the charger.  They charge quickly which is nice and I appreciate the display on the charger letting me know how much charge they have left.  Good sound quality.
They are terrible. These headphones will turn on any audio it can find even if the app isn’t on.It looses connection if volume is raised during anything. They just suck
"These seemed ok at first, but now after only a month and a half after I got them the battery doesn’t last more than a few hours. Go figure it’s now past the return window.Also the sound on these is not great, a bit muffled sounding.  I’m going back to my cheap Walmart ones that sounded better and lasted a full 8 hour day +."
"The earbuds work well for listening to media, but the volume on the microphone is horrible. The volume fluctuates and is not clear."
The appearance and design are decent but the product functionality is lacking. There is absolutely no noise cancelation so you'll hear everything going on around you. The sound quality is not great and it can be difficult to hear the music. Battery life and charging are ok.
"These earbuds work OK, but the earbuds and the case require charging more often than other earbuds that I have owner.  These are also pretty uncomfortable for me.  I am going to buy some more earbuds and use these as a backup as I tend to lose mine fairly frequently."
Doesn't connect easily. The case is strange. The voice stating low battery sounds gross.
Not for small ears they fall out very easy. Do like the case with the feature showing charging percentage. Glad I got them on sale .
Had an extra wire. The original didn’t fit secure in my charging box . Maybe because it doesn’t come with a box. With my own charging box and wire . It works.
"Requires frequent pairing. Does not stop audio when removed from the ear, which is ok, but the constant pairing just time consuming and annoying . Returning it."
The quality of the speech was lacking.
"These don’t stay in very well at all. And when they are in they are very uncomfortable. Also, every time I paused the book I was listening to, it started playing again in a matter of seconds."
Cannot connect to my older version of ipbone
"Sound is okay, that's the only good thing to say. As far as comfort, there terrible."
"I had high hopes, but the audio to video delay is too distracting. Sadly, I probably won’t use them."
"The Bluetooth fell and broke, it didn't even last six months."
Difficult to remove pods from battery case.  Sound quality and battery life is good
The battery life of the case is very low
Muffle sound with iPhone
Not comfortable. People couldn’t hear me. Okay for listening.
They worked for less than a week!
"Relative to other earbuds I've used, the sound quality is pretty bad.  They don't stay in my ears and are very uncomfortable."
"I treat everything I own very well I don’t know why BOTH pairs are now not working and of course the return window is closed if it was only one pair that stopped working I wouldn’t even worry about it but 2 pairs same brand,same company,same color so don’t buy these because they will break AFTER the return window is closed sounds a little sus to me"
Okay if your not moving
Sound was okay but buds don’t stay in ear.
These only stay charged for around 30 minutes max.
"Earpieces too big, and very hard to change to smaller ones.Once situated the audio quality was very poor.Every time I touched it to try and control volume,  something else happened.  Not sure what, but not what I wanted.Returned this item ASAP."
I’ve never had a problem with ear buds staying in my ear but no matter what I do they just slip out.  Definitely cannot run in them.  Charge is pretty crappy too and I usually only wear one at a time.
I ordered 3. Opened 1. Couldn’t hear very well so returned ALL 3 in the SAME box! Having a hard time getting credit for all 3! Never would order again!! Very disappointing! Still haven’t got credit for the last one!!  Received credit for 2 still waiting for credit on 1!!
Don’t waste your money the sound quality is not clear at all and if your watching a video the sound is really delayed
I dropped the headphone ONE TIME on tile floor and the whole headphone just completely shattered. Now I can’t even use the side that isn’t broken. Just save your money and buy AirPods.
They only worked one time. I got them charged them connected and used them. Went to use them again will not connect and keep saying make sure in range (holding in my hand). Says it’s pairing then nothing happens so disappointed
I wore these for 5 min and they split at the seam of the earpiece junk
Did not fit my ears very well. Tried all three optional inner ear foam pieces. Never got a comfortable fit. My ears actually hurt after using for slightly more than an hour.
Not good for making calls. Sound quality is poor!
"Even I choose the minimum volume, the voice is still too loud. And my ears get uncomfortable if I used it for just 10 minutes."
it took 2 months to finally arrive and i was only supposed to get them in a day. wild they dont even work
Overall low volume and so-so sound quality.  Sound quality is OK for calls but poor for music.  Battery life is HORRIBLE.....you will be lucky to get 4hours of continuous use before you need to charge.
"The buds slip out easily and when one did, it broke. Very unhappy."
Broke after a month one ear bud won’t charge
"Item broken inside the package, waste of money"
"No matter what size earbuds I used from this item, they always fell out of my ears, lost one today, so they're absolutely useless, poor design"
Very frustrating. I would not buy again. Pay more for better products.
"Won’t stay in ear and falls out non stop.  Also they claim it lasts for 9hrs, that’s a lie.  7hrs without continuous use for a day.  No wonder it was so cheap"
Hurts my ears but battery lasts forever
Wish I could give ZERO stars. These are the most uncomfortable pair of earbuds that I have ever worn.  Don’t waste your money!!Should have sent them back sooner and got my money back.
"Have 2 months, don’t work now"
"Although they sound very good for the price, my set didn't included the additional earplugs as advertised. Mine got loose sometimes."
OMG this product is garbage smh. What a waste of money. The sound is horrible.
One of the Bluetooth it only lasted 2 weeks.
the base sound is too much?
I have to pair them everyday they work half the time
"first package was ""lost"" then the replacement was missing the product! only shipped me the charging cable and replacement earpieces.....no earbuds or charging case!!!!!"
I don't like these things keep  popping out of my ear!!
"Don't normally leave a review, but clearly, these are a product of TEMU."
Battery life is not that good
"The Soundcore P30i earbuds are ok, but depending on the shape of your ear and your use case they might not be a great fit (both physically and figuratively). Overall, if you just need some cheap earbuds to wear while studying in a noisy common area or in an office, these might be a good option assuming they fit in your ears. If you need earbuds that you can wear while not sitting or otherwise stationary, or if you want some headphones to wear while going to sleep, these are not a good option.These earbuds have very good sound quality and the active noise cancelling is very good. They don't have physical buttons and instead rely on different tap patterns and touch duration for inputs. The controls are quite reliable and they're very good at rejecting non-intentional inputs.The charging case is nice, and the battery life is good. It's nice that the case has wireless charging and that it doubles as a phone stand. The earbuds' battery lasts for about 10 hours in my experience, and the charging case's battery lasts me for at least a week or two between charges (sometimes even more, depending on my usage). The earbuds also charge very quickly.My biggest complaint with these earbuds is that while they fit alright for me if I'm just sitting still an upright position (like on a plane or working at a desk), the second I start doing any type of activity with even minimal physical movement I find myself needing to constantly put them back in my ear since they keep falling out regardless of what size ear tip I use. For example, sometimes I need to prepare dining areas for events and the small motions associated with wiping down tables causes them to constantly be slipping out. I tried to go exercise with them when I first got them, and they are not suited to that in the slightest. The sweat makes it impossible for the earbuds to stay in, and 5 minutes into my workout I had to stop and grab my old earbuds because these were impossible to keep in my ears.They are also *incredibly* uncomfortable for me if I try to wear them when I go to sleep since I tend to sleep on my side, which end up putting a lot of pressure on my ear. This may not be a problem for everybody since different people have differently shaped ears, but for me personally they quickly become incredibly uncomfortable.Also, these earbuds aren't difficult to clean, but the hard plastic is a strange shape so it takes more effort to clean the entire thing than previous earbuds I've had. The earbuds themselves do seem pretty durable and resilient though, thankfully."
"UPDATE 12/11/24 In under a week the app shows the right earbud will only charge to 90%. Makes me doubt the longevity of the earbud battery. Sound is unchanged but have to go from 4 stars to 3 for the premature decrepitude.Bought the Soundcore p30is to replace 3 year old Tozo t10 earbuds that will not charge. There will be comparisons between the 2 sets.The t10s would immediately pair automatically to the device when pulled out of the base. The p30is need to be manually connected to my  galaxy 21fe for immediate listening, they take a long time to automatically pair.The t10s had a female voice telling you when the earbuds were ready for stereo and when they were connected to your device. The p30is have a faint tone.Base is physically small for the p30is. Much bigger for the t10s.The t10s had no app or settings, the p30is have numerous settings and features (some should be deleted).The t10s had good sound and call quality. P30is have real good sound and call quality.While overall the p30is sound better they both have their pros and cons.I have the p30is on the classical setting and music sounds really good, stereo separation excels and the bass is powerful. Watching shows that focus mainly on dialogue sounds real good as well. I don't find the bass overpowering as some other reviewers. The 3D setting in the app actually makes the earbuds sound terrible. You need to play around in the app to find the sound you like best.Getting the p30is out of the base is challenging and handling them in general to insert into your ears triggers tones and functions. They could be designed to handle without setting off a song skip or some other function. It's best to put in the earbuds then connect the device.The ANC feature works good to cut down on the commuter train noises I deal with.I am pleased with the sound of the p30is and the areas where it is lacking or needing improvement do not add up to a deal breaker for me."
"I wanted to really love these, but I cannot look over the issues that have occurred since buying these three weeks ago. I will say that it has a great battery life and for the most part, the sound quality is decent for the price. But what I have an issue with is the connectivity with my iPhone and laptop. I could be on a phone call, and they out of nowhere, they disconnect for 15 seconds before reconnecting. I could look past this issue if it only happened once or twice, but it happens every day on every phone call at least every 5 minutes or so. Also, I notice that sometimes the sound quality diminishes out of nowhere as well. It's only happened a couple of times and I just put them back in the case and take them back out to resolve that issue. I really wanted to be in love with these, but I do not. For the price, these are good to have in case of a backup or if you just plan on using for a few minutes. Otherwise, I would advise buying something worth more for the buck."
"The Pros: Nice handy case.  Bigger case than my Airpod pros but not too much bigger and not problematic.  I lost one of those and didn't want to shell out the cash for a single pod.  These Anker pods were cheaper than one Airpod pro.  You'll need to download an app to access the equalizer which I think is very good for music and spoken word.  Many settings.  Music or audiobook sound quality is very good.  I've had these things for about 5 weeks now and I have never run out of battery power and neither has the case for recharging, unlike my Airpod pros.  I ride my bike with these on transparency mode and can hear street noise and cars around me.  On the other side of the coin, the noise cancellation is also excellent, better than my AP pros.  Connectivity to my iPhone is instantaneous when I put them in.  Anker case also has a very handy pop out stand in the back that integrates with the case perfectly for propping up you phone for watching video.The Cons:Microphone isn't nearly as good as the Airpod pros.  The AP Pros are much clearer.  I have people asking to repeat things especially if I step outside and there is a breeze.  The other pet peeve I have is that you have to open the app separately every time you put them in to access transparency or the equalizer or want to use the variety of functions.I gotta give the Anker pods a 3 because of the microphone. In my experience it does not function very well, which can be a hassle for me.  For music, working out, flying with noise cancellation, the equalizer settings, the case stand, battery life, all excellent and superior to my AP pros.I also have a pair of Beats headphones that are the over the ear style.  The microphone on that device is also superior to the Anker however, the Beats are quite pricey like the AP pros."
"UPDATE: Ended up returning these. I just couldn't live with the truly obnoxious ringtone supplied. Only 1 tone is installed, and no extra ringtones are available or even able to be installed. Neither does it pick up the multiple custom ringtones I have on my phone. This may sound  like a nitpicky reason, but that ringtone is just so horrible.MUSIC: The sound is good all round when playing music.  I'm no audiophile, but more that adequate for my listening purposes.PHONE: The kicker was going to be the phone sound quality (for the other party). The previous 2 (different brands) earbuds had poor quality sound for the person I was talking to. Did a test call this morning and was told the sound was clear.REGISTRATION: Now the registration process. I give it 2 stars hence the overall 4 star rating. FRUSTRATING. What the heck were you guys thinking when designing the registration? Enter email and PW, click Register. So far, so good. Pretty much straight away I get an email asking me to activate my account. Click the link, and I get back to their site and now it seems they are sending me a verification code to check it's me who already got the email and responded. Really? You aren't a bank you know? Waited and waiting for the verification code. Nothing. Then I noticed it was in the original email. So now I'm int and able to use the app. But really? Why the extra annoying step? Because you can? Think about the end-user.APP: I liked it. Lots of options. Noise cancellation seemed good - not aviation headset good (I'm a pilot) but my aviation headset cost over 10x the price of these. Plenty of sound presets - I chose ""Bass Increase"", but there's a manual EQ as well. You can customize the earbud taps to do various things. One thing I noted when using taps to increase/decrease volume. Don't tap too quickly between sets. I have 1 tap incr, and 2 taps decr. I went to decrease and tapped too quickly and ended up increasing it. I had both of these set to the left bud (you can have different controls for L and R buds). I changed decr volume to 1 tap on the right bud and that fixed that issue.CONS: Not much, they fitted me well straight out of the box. For me, the HUGE con was the sound that plays when a call comes in. Some tinny, cheesy rubbish. Couldn't find a way of altering this. Come on Anker, I have multiple custom ringtones set. Why not just use the phone ringtones? Why reinvent the wheel. This was super disappointing.PROS: Apart from the above notes, these little buds have dual connect. I like that a lot! I use these with my phone but also with my laptop. To be able to have both connected is a huge plus. No more unpairing, repairing, unpairing, repairing...."
"Charging went alright.  PITA to load the app, create Soundcore account and get it to accept my credentials.  (For a good 10 minutes, the app refused to recognize my established and legitimate email address as formatted incorrectly.  Wouldn't accept my passcode; had to reset 4 times.). The moment I was able to connect within the app, I was greeted with a warning to download an update to correct a bug.  Really, the first time I'm using and connecting the device to the app?  And I'm only using the app so that I can the volume to work.  Upon first use, it blasted the sound and I can't reduce the volume from the earbuds manually.  I just got them and I'm already so annoyed."
"I come from Soundpeats T2 and after using these for the last week, the Soundpeats are better.  Here is my overall review for these earbuds:Pros - Look good, great bass, phone stand for the case, battery life, has an app where you can customize controlsCons (compared to the T2's): limited range, default controls do not include volume adjustment (you can change this on the app, but feels like you're forced to download it to implement the most basic and frequently used control option), don't stay in my ears very well after trying all ear bud sizes, overly sensitive haptic systemOn sale for $25 these are decent, but anything close to the $50 they're listed for there are better options on the market"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I have bought these earbuds twice. The first time they never came. And the second time I was impressed. The bass is great- noise cancelling as well. The design is very comfortable and appealing to the eye. I was glad I had gotten them for the price I had. Soundcore also has an app you can use. I had some strange things happen with them though- they can randomly connect to other devices even if you are using them. I will be listening to music and randomly start hearing my boyfriend’s phone through them. The case and the earbuds have no buttons- just a tap feature on the side. Which can be a little annoying because you can’t really tell if what you are doing is working. After a week of usage and proper care the left earbud stopped charging. I was confused and irritated once again, I couldn’t even tell if it was just not charging or if it just wouldn’t connect because at first the case would light up when I tried to reset them- indicating that they were charging- but it wouldn’t connect. I tried everything on YouTube- forgetting the device and reconnecting- but it’s truly hard to reset an earbud with no buttons. It was advised to let them die out which is annoying and could have been avoided if they had buttons. I gave them time and now the case doesn’t light up at all when I put them it. and won’t charge. The earbuds are clean- it goes into the case fine so I’m unsure what happened. They have never left my nightstand because I only use them to draw/read at night. I really wish it didn’t turn out this way- so I hope anyone who buys these don’t have the luck I’ve had, because other that this they are truly good earbuds. (The sound is my fishtank in the background :D )"
"I was super happy as soon as the music came through. Bluetooth connected with ease, nice bass, clear and no distortion sounds. Tested a quick call, clear sound, noise cancelling is great. Overall very happy with it until… I took the right piece off my ear as gently as normally used…. The bulb part came apart and there’s one wire that kept it together.  Price-sound-packaging and device itself is designed well but the build quality in my experience is on the low side. What was I expecting for the price."
"Also... before you say an AI wrote this, they did write the part of the TLDR after I wrote my part. I'm pretty bad at grammar and lazy to check things. :DTLDRThese earbuds are fantastic for phone use, but not so much for gaming on a computer, especially if there's interference.If you're like me and want quality earbuds without breaking the bank, especially with the new Bluetooth 5.4 tech, you've come to the right place.I primarily got these earbuds because I wanted to connect to multiple devices—my work laptop, personal computer, and phone. They sound incredible on my phone, even better than my Pixel Buds.However, I've been experiencing choppy audio at my other workplace, likely due to interference from other devices, including a nearby large radio beacon.At home, I didn't have these issues, but I wanted to adjust the codec to improve the performance of these already great earbuds. Unfortunately, on Windows, you need specific third-party software to do this—thanks, Microsoft.There's a technology called AptX LL that reduces latency, which is great for gaming. The problem is, I can't find any documentation confirming whether these earbuds support AptX LL. Maybe I’m overthinking it, but the official website doesn't offer much information.I'm torn about whether to return these earbuds. They're amazing for phone use, so if that's your primary need, go for it. But if you want them for multiple connections, including gaming, be cautious. I might need to buy another Bluetooth dongle to improve the signal and reduce the choppiness.When they work with my games, they sound incredible, but the connection drops in and out. I’ve spent nearly three hours troubleshooting, and I’m pretty tech-savvy, so it’s been frustrating."
"So I bought this a few months ago and it was great  with good sound quality, great noise cancelling, good volume and great compatibility. Over time it lost volume, ability to connect with my phone (I would have to restart my phone for it to connect Everytime). I didn't drop it often or get water in it but I feel it losing most good things about it over time was not a great experience but I'm hoping this is only for my earbuds."
"After a week, these earbuds are going back. Battery life seems to be good. Sound was great out of the box, but then after a week I started getting some rattle, similar to what a blown speaker sounds like on highs. They sound fine if I keep the volume low but the rattle comes back when I turn up the volume."
"I got these for a trip & immediately charged them up. I tested them several times over a couple days, they’re not holding the full 10hr charge. The battery is going down to 80% within an hr of usage. It definitely won’t last the full 10hrs. I got to 50% in slightly over 3hrs on medium volume & off part of the time.It doesn’t take that long to charge them up.I don’t love the standard earbud they came in for my average to smaller ears but haven’t bothered switching them out with the alternative yet as I’m going to see if I can exchange them.Sound quality is about expected for earbuds. The bass is pretty decent. I listen to everything (like my Spotify wrapped showed over 60 Genres in 6 languages). It’s not going to be perfect quality but I didn’t expect it to outperform my favorite over ear headphones at this price point or speaker size. It’s an earbud it’s never going to be quite as good. It is however good enough for basic listening & taking these on my next flight to stream movies.Noise cancellation is medium but may be better with one of the other silicone earbuds switched out.Pairing was extremely easy & they turn on right away when I want them to. Quick tap to pause.Light on the earbuds case when charging is obscenely bright & I have to cover it. I do like the stand & the magnetic lock in feature as it makes it easier to get them in/out of the case.They do stay put in the ear & I haven’t had an issue with them falling out when walking.Have not played with the call settings yet.Will update the review after I can get Anker to switch these out with a pair that hopefully has a better battery."
"Pros: Great sound quality and noise cancellation, they last a long time on one charge.Cons: The case doesn’t tell you how much battery is left. They are constantly falling out no matter which tip I use. I also have small ears so it may be okay for people with bigger ears."
"I purchased this specifically for calls. It's easy to carry and travel with. Feels comfortable in my ears with the piercings I have and does not easily come off. Stays put well in my ears. Music also sounds great when you listen to it but talking on the phone is a no go. It randomly cuts off, the Bluetooth will disconnect on its own and switch to regular call without you knowing, or you will be able to hear the person on the other call but they won't be able to hear you. I don't use it for very long but the battery does not last as long as it claims for either."
All I buy is soundcore and this might be my weakest set. They sound amazing at low volume but they can't seem to handle bass at high volume with bass boost on. They start to crack and distort and I've never experienced that with this brand until this set.
The first two days the earbuds would connect to my phone automatically and once I’ve put both back into the box they would disconnect automatically which I liked . But after those few days they would not disconnect automatically even after placing them both in their correct spots. And I even tried cleaning them etc. that’s the downside of them . I do like that altogether the product isn’t bulky. Other than that the sound quality is great . But the side buttons are annoying because if you accidentally touch them you can end up accidentally hanging up if you’re in a phone call .
"If not it would be a ""1"" rating.These had a steady beep while I was listening to music. Every time I touched them or my hair brushed into them, the settings changed..  Using for phone was staticky.  Returned these immediately"
"Brief Cons:1. Earbuds and slippery with no rubber texture to get grip to grab2.(The biggest con) Since the only place to grab them out of the case is is the side of the earbud which is also touch sensitive you end up pausing or skipping ahead when you go to take them out of your ears or case.3. The earbuds tend to sometimes just stop using the Transparent mode at random.4. The case being square is personally awkward to hold and open.5. Since these are touch activated, if a rain drop or sweat gets on the side it can activate whatever touch function is on that earbud. Just got back to buttons Anker.Pros:1. Price is solid2. Sound is good with an EQ adjusted in the App3. Can change button functions in App4. Allows you to hear what's around you or go full silent modeAll in all, I feel like every new generation of Anker headphones I buy makes great changes with some really bad changes. I think the Soundcore Liberty Pro 2 were nearly perfect in everyway, until they stopped charging. I would just buy those again if I could and if they added all the app features and transparent mode to it, it would have been the perfect earbuds for me. But these feel cheaper made and the more premium versions seem like they are worth the price anymore from Anker."
"These have excellent sound quality when listening to music, much better than the p20i these replaced. But, when in a noisy work site, the noise cancellation causes a loud whining sound that isn't there when turning off ANC. That's kind of a bummer."
I like the design of this product. The shape doesn’t really fit my ear shape comfortably though. It sounds really static-y on lower volume. I do appreciate that you can go on a lower volume compared to some of their old models. The sound cancellation is pretty good but previous models have been better. I recently learned that noise cancellation works by pumping more ‘sound’ into the ear so the noise cancellation feature can be fatiguing to the ear. I notice that there is a sudden blast in pressure and sound if wearing  and you happen to close the car door. I got these to avoid environmental noise and to be able to listen on a quiet level. So I might return since these issues have been consistent  even with the replacement I got. The touch feature is pretty responsive though and the looks of it is really nice. Works well if you like to listen on a louder volume ( the static goes away).
"These are not noise cancellation at all. Put them in and fit and sound are good, but I heard everything!!! Had to turn music up loud and could still hear outside sounds. Not at all what I was expecting."
What I dislike about the product in terms of sound quality is that the noise cancellation feature did not live up to my expectations.  If I had to rate it it would be at about 75%
"They're not noise-canceling as advertised, but they'll do, for now. I do like Anker products, though I'm having difficulty pairing these earbuds with my tablet. I love the color."
Sound started messing up and you can hear wind blowing in the background at times. Great for a short term fix but not for long.
"After my dog chewed up my Soundcore P20i buds (that I thought were awesome for the price), I decided to give these a try. In theory they should be better than the P20i buds given that they are more expensive. There are a few items that are better than the P20i like the noise cancelling settings, but there are far more items where they are way worse than the P20i buds.1st thing I noticed is that there is a terrible delay in audio. I started watching a movie and audio was off by like half a second. Only way to get audio closer to being real-time is by installing the app on your phone and then putting the buds into ""game mode"". Problem is though is that they don't stay in game mode. So if you are watching a video on your laptop with them, you have to keep opening up the app on your phone to put them in game mode to not have the audio delay.2nd element that is bad is the battery life. Again, you would think that these would be better than the P20i buds, and they are advertised as having a better battery life, but these barely last 24 hours on one charge.I do not recommend purchasing these from my experience. You're honestly better off getting the P20i buds for reliability and they are cheaper."
I've had other soundpeats before and the charge lasted twice as long. It's not just the ear buds but the charging case as well. I end up having to charge the case at least once a day.  The sound quality and noice cancelling is pretty good for the price. Just wish the battery lasted as long the sellers stated it would.
"These ear buds are a disappointment. The audio is thin and lacks any life. Yes, that's after using the app that magically makes these amazing according to reviewers. Maybe I'm a bit more picky from my days editing audio but coming from another mid, the basic OnePlus Nord Buds, these just pale in comparison in audio quality. Heck they even have better noise cancelling and it's not even one of their features!ProComfortableLook niceLast long on a chargeTransparency mode surprisingly works?ConCase sucks, if you carry these we a backup in a pocket they will constantly connect superceding your current headset. It's really annoying, I have to imagine some people will find these dead in a purse and not know why.I can't stress enough how thin the sound quality is.These are a more quiet headsetNoise cancelling mode is disappointing at best and really did nothing in my noisy house.I was expecting better mic quality out of these with their literature. It was pretty mediocre like this entire device.Don't get these go get a One Plus Nord Buds on their website they're only $29 dollars for their normal price and outperform this by leaps and bounds."
Did not fit my small ears and allows a lot of wind noise in ear
These Soundcore earphones doesn’t give me the Sound I was looking for .
"Update - Anker reached out and sent me a new replacement pair since mine had issues. Very impressed with the customer service and will update when the new pair outlasts the old. Thank you Anker!I've had these earbuds just over a month I think and the left bud had totally gone out. Before that they were great. Great sound, stay in my ears, mic works great, and seamless transition between my phone and my computer for work calls. Just wish they lasted longer"
"I have these and the P20i and I have less connectivity problems with the p20i. They both sound good. They fit the same too, but for some reason this style keep losing connection to my iPhone. Easy to pair and the price is fair. But I like the other model better"
Some connection issues sometimes but overall good for the price
"I've had these for a couple of months now and use them a few times a week. I'm a fan of Anker products and have never been disappointed...until now. Like the title says, great for use indoors where there is no wind. When I run outside I get lots of wind noise. I've tried all the different sized ear pieces and none make any difference, still significant wind noise...and I'm not as fast as I used to be.  These earbuds fit comfortably and have good sound. I ended up buying another brand for use outside and relegated the Anker buds to ""indoor use only."""
"They work well especially for the price, but the active sound cancelling is mediocre, and on windy days during my runs the wind noise are very distracting. Indoors they are much better. Battery life is very good for my daily use."
"At first I loved them they held a really good charge, they fit my ear perfectly. Very comfortable. Love the sound and the noise blocking.But now they won’t hold a charge. They fade out when you get a notification on your phone.I cannot get them to link to my tablet or my tv.  Seems I can only link them to my phone.I really have mixed emotions about this one."
"Reviews are correct, not very good sound, I have a set of p3 that I love but these are not good sounding, everything else is great"
"The noise canceling isn't as good as I read. They are just, ok. They stay charge for a decent amount of time. Connectivity is decent as well."
"First I'm gonna say I like Soundcore products. I have the P20i headphones and have zero complaints. These were on sale so I figured I'd test them out. Well no matter what setting I use in the app (wind cancelling, turning the noise cancelling all the way up/down) I can't get the headphones to act like non-noise cancelling headphones. This means, when I'm running, biking, on the air bike, etc I hear the wind noise more than I would if I was just using normal earbuds like my P20i. I use my earbuds primarily for these activities, so I'm not a fan of these."
"Coming from anker liberty 2 air pro, the noise cancellation in the p30i almost doesn't work at all. I confirmed it IS on, so it is ""working"" as intended, but it's extremely weak. Next to a fan it mildly reduces volume. To mow the lawn it's utterly useless (whereas the 2 air pro work quite well for that). I'm returning these."
"I got these for a new job where I would be in an open office area. The people around me are loud and get along well so there’s constant chatter. I figured with the nose cancellation and voice detection these would be the perfect choice. Sadly they are not. I can’t use the noise cancellation while on my computer, only with the phone app so I can hear everyone around me. And anyone I’m on a call with can hear everyone around me very well. They’re still a great wireless headphone for the price but sadly not what I thought I was buying."
"Easily paired with Dell laptop, but not with cellphone or TV."
These earbuds are really nice and with the app you can adjust the eq settings. My only gripe is the rubber ear tips do not stay in my ear after awhile of listening.
"Enough noise canceling to block out my family, not enough to block out my friends. They fall out a little, but they look and feel good. Pairs to two devices at once which is very convenient."
"Music plays very well , lots of base . With regards to talk quality it's so so when having a conversation, the other person doesn't hear you clearly 😔"
"Review after third day of use from a customer who paid for the earbuds:* Great sound and bass is not too overpowering.  Transparency mode is good in an office setting, but probably not while out for a bike ride or run.  I stood in front of a fan and it overamplified the air as if there was a storm!* Great range, I was in a different room 30 ft. away from my computer and there was no disconnection.* Battery life on single charge is ~8 hours, not 10.  Left earbud also loses charge faster than the right... weird.  I'm worried that the battery life would get worse sooner than expected.* Charging case does not indicate if earbuds are fully charged.Overall a 3.5.  I'll most likely keep them, but I wish the battery life was as advertised and that one did not lose charge quicker than the other."
"Form factor is really nice, small case and earbuds are a nice size, stem is shorter than typical Soundcore earbuds. Fits comfortably. The sound is good but the downfall is slight distortion and vibrating sound I’ve noticed in cheaper Soundcore products when volume is a bit up. Even with firmware update, it’s still present. I’d put out a few more dollars for the P40i where the distortion is not present and has wireless charging. If you could combine the size of the earbuds of the P30i with the case and sound quality of the P40i it would be the perfect set of earbuds. But these are going back knowing that there are better Soundcore products that just cost slightly more. I’m someone who keeps track of Soundcore products so I’m always down to test, particularly any noise canceling products. This one to me just isn’t a keeper."
These earbuds work ok from a listening perspective but when I was speaking during phone call I was told that my voice sounded muffled.
"I've had these for a few weeks now and the battery life is actually pretty terrible if you turn on active noise canceling, you'll get like 4 hours max. Also there's way too much bass even with bass reduction set in the software. They disconnect often from devices and you'll have to forget and reconnect them often. I would not recommend them."
"My ears are small. But these were huge and fell out. The only thing that would happen when you touch them is volume control with two taps on either side. But that's it, no volume, no skip, it was pretty useless. I wanted them to be ok but I went back to Raycons. They're still too big but they fit better."
"First off ,I absolutely love anker products .These sound fantastic and the noise canceling is pretty good especially for the price ,however the battery life is a deal breaker ,doesn't last long at allIf the battery life was better I'd honestly give these 5 starsUpdate: Anker contacted me and sent me new ones and I'm happy to say the battery is fantastic ANKER IS A GREAT COMPANY!"
There's a useless flab door on the stand. I bought this for the bass sound. So far so good.
"Loved my over ear headphones from Anker but wanted something with more noise cancelling. Compared to my Apple Airpod Pros, the P30i's sound quality is decent but the noise cancellation is not as strong. These are light, and can stay in your ear if you opt for a larger sized ear plug.Unfortunately, the downside to owning these is the dropped calls and the inconsistent connectivity to computer Bluetooth. The bluetooth range is also somewhat limited, so I'm returning them and looking for something else."
"In addition to using my wireless earbuds for streaming and music, I mostly need them for calls- both personal and professional. While I was very pleased at the fit- probably the most comfortable and secure fit and completely sound canceling, the call quality failed. I was told I sounded like I’m “in a tunnel.” I’m in the process of returning now. I definitely can’t have that. If you’re just looking to use these for music/streaming, I would say go for it or even find something more economical if you aren’t such a sound aficionado. However, if you are looking to take calls as well, I would move along."
"Take heat in this because at the end of the day we're all humans and we all make mistakes. This is a mistake I made that I cannot remedy and it makes me mad. I waited a long while to be able to get these I really wanted them and I thought they looked really good. They have great noise canceling and great audio quality. The only problem is is that I set them down while I was out jogging and I was talking to somebody and I walked away from them and I understand it's my fault for losing them but I still have the case and I've tried and tried countless times to get a hold of somebody at SoundCore to see what it would cost for me to replace the buds and I can't get a hold of nobody I keep getting put on hold I waited 3 hours the other day at 9:00 in the morning to talk to a company that's in California about what it would cost me to replace them. Now the app does not give you the option to replace the buds themselves, it just gives you the option to add things like ear tips and stuff of that nature or a sleeve or case for the earbuds case. I don't want that I just want new earbuds to go with this stupid case that I have. I'm not happy at all this has been a horrible experience and I've always been a sound core believer and I've always convinced my friends and family to go that direction but this time I'm not going to buy another sound core. I've also found some subreddits that have had the same problem so much so that it caused these people that have been true believers of the sound core brand to not buy another sound core device even some of them to the extent of not even buying anything from anchor because anchor own sound core. So take heed in this because being the third's cheapest they are there's no way to track them and that's it you're out if you lose them that's it you're out."
Works rather well when it works as it does quit functioning unexpectedly
"The description calls this “smart and strong” noise cancelling. It’s my first time wearing them at work, and I’m not noticing any noice cancellation. Will update as I wear them more. They are comfortable."
Ok If you’re riding a bicycle with a helmet.  Pass!  Lots of whistle wind noises coming from these guys.  Stick to the other version that is fully contained in the ear.  Hope that makes sense.  Otherwise SQ was decent and fit was great.  Never tried a call but worked well through my iPhone and Wahoo combo. 5/10.
"It just die abruptly without any signs , the earbuds doesn’t last 10hours may b 4 hours at best, other than that it sounds good and"
I own a few pair of different earbuds and comparing this one to others I can say I'm not impressed.The bass is WAY too loud and muffled. There is not a good separation of sounds and the sound is not  clear. I tried to tweak it with the app and it did improve a little bit but not to bring it to a good curve.All in all I think you can do better with a different brand in this cheap price point.
"I was initially very happy with these earbuds. For the first week or two, the sound quality was impressive—clear, with good bass, and the noise cancellation was effective. They were comfortable to wear and felt like a great purchase for the price.However, things took a turn after about a month. One earbud started sounding really faint, and now it’s almost unusable. To make things worse, the other earbud developed a crackling noise that ruins the listening experience. I tried troubleshooting, but the problems persisted.While I loved them at first, the decline in quality is really disappointing. If they had lasted longer, I’d have been thrilled with them. Unfortunately, I can’t recommend these based on my experience with their durability."
"I just began using them for the first time so I can’t really say much on the battery life but they’re not really loud enough at all to me. I was expecting a better sound quality based off of the reviews and I’m a bit disappointed. I do like the design and they are comfortable & will do the trick for now, but I wish I would’ve just applied the $44 I spent on these towards a pair of air pods instead of trying to be cheap lol."
Are you the kind of person who goes outdoors with your earbuds? Do you enjoy eardrum piercing white noise? No? Look elsewhere friend. This is the first disappointment from soundcore but it’s a biggie.Update: there’s an app for that. Wind noise reduction can be turned on in the app. Which seems silly because I can’t think of an application where I would enjoy wind noise. That’s like buying a pair of glasses that stabs you in the eye until you download the glasses app and turn off the eye stabbing function. Sound is still kinda tinny. Decent value for money if you download the app.Updated update: the wind noise reduction is only available when both earbuds are connected.
Don’t fit well. Can hear outside noise. Keep falling out. Lost one already. You have to constantly pushing in ear
"White noise, whenever there’s any sound coming out of them theres an undertone of static, listening to podcasts or anything quiet is quite noticeable, great noise cancelling, sound stage, decent sound depth for the price, but the white noise is intolerable"
"Solid earbuds for the most part, but my one complaint is that, if you're outdoors, these buds allow a lot of wind noise. If you use you earbuds mostly outdoors, I would say pass on these."
"Soundquality wasn't bad, Love the bass charging wasn't bad either, still it takes timing!"
"First of all, they fit very nice. Really comfortable. The sound is amazing. High highs, and lows that vibrate.The noise cancelling is almost non-existant. If the wind is blowing, that sound is amplified in the buds. If you plan on using them outside, find something else.I almost live in my buds because of my job and these let me down and wasted my money."
"The sound quality is good but there’s a weird static-like noise every time I touch the left earbud, I also hear it when I’m on a moving vehicle. I don’t know if my pair is defective or it’s a design issue.Sound quality is good."
"I’ve had these for about 3 months now.(Purchased July 2024)I really wanted to like them but they just don’t cut it.Tried changing tip sizes, but they need constant adjustment even while just sitting still. Forget working out in them as even the slightest amount of oil or sweat will make them slide out.Volume is severely lacking; they have to be cranked all the way up to get “normal” volume.Staying seated the noise cancelling is good in the rare spans they stay fitted; but you’ll get A LOT of body noise if you’re walking/commuting (your own breath, vibration of your footsteps through body).Sadly too late to return them.Maybe you’ll get a better fit but, in my experience, you may wanna look elsewhere."
"It said 45 hrs playtime, I'm lucky to get 8 hrs, noise cancelling works as advertised"
The micropphone cuts in and out when moving
Theses  are defective  the earbuds  go dead way to fast I always  ended up putting  back in the charger  box it last like 1 hour an after that it goes dead. But they are good for phone  calls an music etc.
"Unfortunately very disappointed with sound quality of this model. I own the soundcore 2 portable speaker which is great for size and price. The earbuds have a very premium look and feel, build quality and materials seem to be on level too, however when you're buying headphones/earbuds you mostly care how they sound and not look. That's were problems are noticeable unfortunately. Overall lower sound volume then any random cheaper earbuds, and what's even worse major distortion on max or close to max levels. I ordered A40 and i hope won't be disappointed by that model too. Otherwise not buying Anker for headphones for sure. Do like Anker as a brand overall."
"First call I make or receive, always there is bad static sound. so I have to hangup and make another call. I tried on few different phones with same results. so it is not my phone issue. price was cheap... I guess you get what you pay for.."
"To start off, I'm usually a big believer in Anker products. This is my first set of noise canceling ear buds and that part is great. It only blocks noise but lets the stuff you would want to hear through and is easy to switch modes. However, in the span of month I have started having issues. My left ear bud will just stop playing if I move around (jogging or even just turning my head) and I have to jar it to get it to make sound again. Other than that the  the battery life leaves a little to be wanted but for the cost it is pretty good."
When you put these in your ears be careful of the startup sound .it's very loud and will ring your ears .they fit good and music sounds good  but the start up tone is way to loud and no way to turn it down
"So Im a big fan of Anker soundcore. I own a lot of there products,but unfortunately these don't hold up . There supposed to have 10hrs play on single charge . Unfortunately I only get 6 on normal settings and 4 on ANC . Everything else about them are great. The size and features are very functional for my use . App , sound and everything else they offer 5 Star. I've reached out to the and I'm waiting for a response. There customer service experience is top notch . Any issues I've ever had in the past were resolved above and beyond what I was expecting,that's why I've been a loyal customer for 15 plus years. I own a lot of there products and will continue using them . Ill write a more detailed experience after the resolution."
"The “hardware” is nice, the matte plastic looks elevated; but actual headphones aren’t good. The sound is too “under water” kind of sound. I did mess with the equalizer in the soundcore app, and in the music app but i think it’s just the quality. They skip A LOT so much you get used to it. Every other minute it’s has to adjust the Bluetooth connection; I tried placing the phone every way possible, and no matter what it skips. I payed 30 with the sale price, not worth it. I’ve had 20 dollar ones still better than these."
"I listen to music 8hrs a day at my job & after about 3hrs starting at 100% they die. Very disappointed in these. The sound is great & they're comfortable, but they do not make it through the day on a full charge."
Sound quality is really great. I’ve had these for a couple weeks now and wear them daily. I’m extremely frustrated that they last for a 60-70 minute workout and then 100% of the time they die after 3-7 minutes into a hot sauna session. This is the same sauna I previously used 2 pairs of Apple AirPods and Bose EarPods in over the last 6 years. I keep losing my nicer ones between little kids and dropping them accidentally so I temporarily decided to invest in a more affordable option but they simply do not hold up against the same use that more premium earbuds do
"I bought these a bit less than two weeks ago. The sound & comfort are good, but the battery life is not. I just put them back in to recharge after they went from 100% down to 20% in just 4 hours, of which they were actually in use for maybe 45 minutes total. I've had $25 pairs of earbuds that last significantly longer than that."
"When I bought these 2 months ago I was so excited. I finally found a pair of noise cancelling headphones that were reasonably priced, had a decent battery life and were noise cancelling so when I'm on a phone call person on the other end was not constantly saying I can't hear you there is so much background noise. But alas nothing is perfect and now two month laterthese headphones no longer pair with any of my devices which renders them useless. I always thought Anker had great products unfortunately this not one of them. Very disappointing."
"Update: it's been a few months now and single charge battery life has gone from 6+ hours video play to 4. Downgrading review to 2*Original review: to be fair, it still delivers Anker quality sound but boy, does it feel cheap: the case, the housing plastics...cheapo. still, it does connect to the app and it does delivery that awesome, customizable Anker sound. so if you like Ankers $100 earbuds, you'll get good audio. i don't use these for calls so i can't comment on voice quality."
The first pair I ordered of these were defective. The music kept playing in the headphones even when placed in the case for charging. Luckily I got a replacement pair that worked perfectly….for two months. The left earbud now will not charge because it constantly stays connected to my phone while in the case. Unfortunately I would not buy this product again because of this defect that I have now encountered twice. Otherwise the sound quality was decent. Good pair of headphones if you only need them for less than a year.
"I like the design of the earbuds and case, they are easy to pair, and have a decently long battery. The noise canceling feature is ineffective against wind when outdoors and/or bad reverberation when commuting on the bus."
I got these after I lost my sony xm4 as a replacement. They are way less cheaper and I can't really tell the difference except that these seem to be better when it comes to talking on the phone. I dont listen to music often so I can't speak to that. Also comfortable to lay on a pillow with.*UPDATE*: Have had them for less than a year and the right side is having difficulty charging. I have to push it down to make it have a good connection. I have cleaned the charging pins and magnet area but it is still difficult to keep it charged. Downgraded to 2.5 due to lack of longevity.
"I like them but the sound signature out of the box is bad. They sound very muddy with way too much bass. I also don't like that you can't sync these to a new device without disconnecting them from the previous device. Many earbuds include a sync button on the case, but this case is dumb. No sync button and no case battery level displayed in iOS and Android. Finally, they're pretty big! They just fit into my ears without falling out. Overall I'm keeping them but don't really have anything that positivite to say about them. They're missing features and sound just okay. You get what you pay for."
"The Soundcore P30i earbuds initially offered a decent value, but their performance quickly deteriorated. After just two months of use, the sound quality began to suffer, particularly on tracks with even slight bass, becoming noticeably distorted. This disappointing sonic decline was further compounded by the earbuds' sluggish connection times to devices like phones and laptops, which often took up to ten seconds to establish. While the initial purchase price may have seemed reasonable, the rapid deterioration in both sound quality and connectivity ultimately rendered these earbuds a less than ideal investment."
"I'm a HUGE Soundcore fan with 8 bud sets purchased and other products around the house. Had high hopes for these but alas... solidly constructed for sure. However, the noise cancellation is almost non-existent.  Tried in a variety of settings including on aircraft and the performance was horrible.  Had to return."
"Not sure if it's just the specific ones I bought, but after using them for a few weeks now mainly for when I'm jogging outdoors, but if theres even the slightest wind the earbuds vibrate making it near impossible to hear anything being played.Do NOT but these for outdoor use"
"The sound is good, but there is no difference in the noise cancellation, normal, or transparency mode. They seem to be comfortable. Was hoping for noise cancellation like product described."
"I purchased these earbuds as my old JBL ones were giving out after 2 years. These seemed like an upgrade however, for me, they hurt way too bad after a while. They feel like hard plastic, and that part jist really causes too much pain for me to get the full enjoyment out of these buds. The noise cancelling is cool on it and it has great sound aside from that."
"I like this air pods overall,  great sound, color and features. The left side stopped working after a month and half. This is the first time that I had this situation with airpods as previously I used them for more than a yr with no problem."
I’ve always had great luck with anker electronics to the point that I would opt for them over more name brand companies.  These ear buds have been a huge disappointment.  First off my phone never wants to connect to them. I have to reset both the Bluetooth and the earbuds each time I use them.  Second the battery life is awful.  Maybe a couple hours before they go back in the charger which frequently needs charged too.  The sound is nothing special either.  Hopefully this is just a fluke and not where anker is headed.
"Smallest size tips still too large for my ears - pop out all the time - only used a few times due to fit issue- too late to return, by time problems realized.Easy connect to bluetooth on i phone - but always falling out. Need one that doesnt have to be pushed into my ear - in process - of putting in ear always end up tapping something didnt intend to - so fustrating to use. Probably fine for some one else - just not for me. Hold a charge good though & like the small case. Got the rose gold- pretty & probably more discreet if u want to use while driving - like that can use just one. ( if only i could use them!)Have had ear buds before- without these issues. Need more than 3 tip size choices, imo…And tapping to change things needs a bit of practice, imo. ( easy to tap for wring thing or not enough - idk - just awkward for me - and slightest  touch or movement and they pop right out of the ear.(At least the instruction are large enough to be readable- but prior experience or practice with the tapping part needed- especially if this is your first stick type ear buds- imho.and not good if u have small ears , imo.( especially if the outer opening where u need to stick these is small - i think my ear structure is normal size - but where these need to go - does not fit well.) but hold charge, BT connect was super easy - worked ok with FT for a few seconds was able to try same. Like just fine - just not usable for me. Also ears had an itch after using these - no known allergies & never happened before w other ear buds- only after using these.Probably fine if these are replacment for some similar for u- price seemed good! Fast shipping- on Prime."
"11/20/2024 the seller offered me refund based on my original review, below of 3 stars. I even stated that for the price, the product is acceptable I did not request a refund. This tells buyers how reviews are manipulated. Take the three stars and STFU.11/7/2024:  Yet another poorly designed product.  4 stars for use, 1 star for design, 2.5 stars overall, rounded up to 3 stars.Since each earbud has only one control area (could have two on each bud), leaving the most used selection, namely volumes control, to fully work only with both earbuds in. The right bud controls volume up while the left bud controls volume down. Pause, skip (forward or reverse) both work from either bud. However, I often use only one earbud so I can hear and be aware of my surroundings. I often listen to a podcast on one bud while listening to TV with my other ear.These earbuds work OK, but the design engineers failed to be part of the product testing phase.As others have mentioned, when a user attempts to re-seat the earbud in the ear due to normal loosening/movement, it is natural to press the center of the earbud since it maximizes physical adjustment.  Pressing ""center mass"" is instinctive.  However, this is exactly where the main touch-sensitive ""button"" is located, thus, when attempt to re-seat the earbud, it places the playback source in pause mode.That main ""action button"" should be located at the top of the earbud, where most users would not be pressing to adjust the earbud in the ear, and a design engineer should have noticed this if they had been part of the product testing team.  Since the product testing team is likely paid less than the engineer team, I am not sure I can hold the product testing team responsible for failing to recognize this design error.Barely acceptable, with price being a deciding factor of acceptable use."
"I had high hopes for these earbuds. I read the reviews (always the Most Recent first) and I found many more positive/high-rating reviews than negative/low-rating reviews. After comparing it with other similar products, I decided on the TAGRY X08 Bluetooth Headphones Ture Wireless Earbuds 60H Playback LED Power Display Earphones with Wireless Charging Case IPX5 Waterproof in-Ear Earbuds with Mic for TV Smart Phone Computer Laptop Sports (wow-quite a mouthful for a name). I was excited and hopeful when I hit the ""Place Your Order"" Button. After a quick delivery (PRO), I was soon disappointed with the product.My first major complaint was comfort. I may have smaller than normal ear canals because even with the use of the smallest size ear tips included in the package, I found it difficult to have the earbuds in for long without my ears becoming uncomfortable. When I would wear them, the earbuds would only be in my ears for 30 minutes before I was constantly needing to readjust them to find an angle that was comfortable. The ""Products Description"" and ""Features & Details"" state that the earbuds can be worn comfortably while driving, relaxing, working, or even sleeping. I would NEVER wear these earbuds during ANY of those chill activities. The TAGRY X08 hurt too badly for me to get comfortable enough to relax or do any of those things.The MAIN reason I chose to purchase these earbuds over any others was the COMFORT rating given by Amazon Reviewers. The TAGRY X08 was given an average rating of 4.9🌟 out of 5 for COMFORT. I'm baffled that these earbuds would receive such a favorable rating in this category and would personally score it a 2.5🌟My other major complaint was the ""Smart Touch Control"". I have relatively small fingers, which usually allows me to be able to manipulate and access small areas on phones, earbuds, headphones, or other similar products. I had no such luck with the TAGRY X08. When listening to music or a podcast, it was difficult for me to get the timing down for the earbuds to distinguish the difference between ""PLAY/PAUSE"" (one tap) and ""NEXT/PREVIOUS TRACK"" (two taps). Even when I would remove an earbud from my ear, it was still difficult for me to use so I would end up using my phone to skip or pause the song or show.There were a few positive aspects to the TAGRY X08. The earbuds would charge up to 100% pretty quickly after being placed in the case to charge. However, I did notice that the earbuds would run out of juice WAY FASTER than others I've had in the past. As long as I remembered to keep the charging case with me at all times, I would be able to charge the earbuds after the 4/4.5 hours of use. But if I were to leave the house without the charging case (which, unfortunately, did happen a few times) and be gone for 7-9 hours, I would find myself without the use of the earbuds for 5+ hours.The ""One-Step Auto Pairing"" was SUPER convenient and made me very happy each time I would open the case to have the earbuds always connect to my phone. I also enjoyed the light weight of the case and found it easy to hold in my pocket without much thought to it otherwise.Overall, the negatives outweighed the positives for me which is why I returned the TAGRY X08 Earbuds. Thankfully, I selected to have the charge added to my Amazon balance so it was a quick process (PRO)."
"I really like how these air pods look and the ease of pairing to my iphone. They're much cheaper than other air pods and the sound is just great. The only trouble is that out of my 3 devices- macbook, ipad and iphone--they will only pair with the iphone. No matter what I do they are not discoverable on either the macbook or ipad. I've troubleshooted and followed all the directions and suggestions given for this problem. Nothing works. After literally more than 2 hours, I have given up and contacted the company. I'm getting a replacement because I do really like them, but we'll see. IF the next set they send doesn't pair, then I'll be sending back for a refund. I'm hoping I just got a defective pair. Murphy's Law."
"I love the long battery. Water hasn't ruined them.  However any time they get even a tiny drop of water on them they will power down.  So to me, them being waterproof but not being able to use them in the gym shower means that they aren't exactly waterproof.  I was looking for earbuds that I could shower at the gym with; so I could listen to podcasts and music without being rude, but any slight drip or dampness they will power down.  I have two pair because I thought perhaps the 1st pair were defective, but it's definitely both pair that do this.  They don't completely start malfunctioning after water exposure; which is good, but you can't use them around water because they will shutdown.  Anyway that's why I give 3 stars, because I wanted something for using in the shower that was waterproof, not something that shutdown at dampness, but they did last an entire 9 hour trip from VA to NY, so battery life is really good."
"Purchased these to replace my older pair of Jaybird earbuds. They always connect to my phone easily and I love that there’s no additional app to download to use them. My biggest issue is when I try to use them to talk on the phone. People tell me that the audio alternates between louder and softer and makes it incredibly difficult to hear or understand me. Most describe the audio as “it sounds weird.” I can hear them fine, it's just them hearing me. After the first month, they basically do not function at all for phone calls anymore. I can no longer answer a call with them and when I use my phone to answer, I can’t get the call to play through them (even if I was listening to music through them and try to pick up a call). I am resigned to using them only as earbuds and not to make/receive calls through. They are comfortable and stay well on my ears though, which is why I didn’t rate them lower.Pro: no app to download, work well for music or podcasts, fit nicely and don’t fall out, good price point.Con: audio on calls is terrible and they quickly stop functioning for calls at all."
"No matter what phone or laptop I use, these earbuds just do not show in Bluetooth. There are no lights or buttons on the earbuds themselves, but the charging case says they are fully charged. I remove the earbuds from the case, but they don't show on any device's Bluetooth list. I have to assume they are broken.Update: we located another device that had these paired. After forgetting the earbuds on that device, they showed up in the list on the phone."
"Bought these Bluetooth earbuds as well as a pair of Tozo NC2 earbuds. These fit my small ears better (closer to that of Apple AirPod Pros) but my habit of only wearing one earbud at a time isn’t great. These earbuds are not single user friendly because the right earbud won’t function as a single…tapping doesn’t answer calls nor will it function as a play button, however it will pause the music/audiobook. I tend to use only one earbud at a time because of my constant book listening habit when completing mind numbing tasks around the house. I like to always keep one ear vacant for hearing other sounds around me and being able to switch to the other earbud when the 1st one’s battery dies. It’s equally important for me to be able to pause and restart what I’ve been listening to if someone speaks to me or something needs my full attention since I don’t always have a pocket to put my phone in. These don’t allow me to restart listening to my book/music once they’re paused using the right earbud. The left will work fine for this purpose so I’m not sure if I have a faulty set or if they all do this. The sound quality is great but the pass through of ambient sounds around me are more of an annoying whooshing/static noise on top of my music. I prefer to use the noise cancellation feature for that reason. Phone conversations are great using these earbuds and my husband says that it’s easier to hear me using these than my AirPods because these don’t amplify all the sounds around me to hear splitting noise (turning on a water faucet doesn’t drown out my voice nor does the click of my knife on my cutting board). Would I buy these again…possibly but there are so many to choose from in this price range, I’d probably give a different brand a try first.Edit: seller contacted me to assist me with the problems described above and couldn’t resolve the issues. I received another set of earbuds from them free of charge and this pair will function as a pair or single earbud for pause/play of audio listening but will not answer phone calls. The only way I can take calls on the second pair is to answer the call using my phone and switch from phone to the earbuds. I have also discovered that despite removing the earbuds from my ears they do not have the pause detection of Apple that will automatically pause listening when removed. These will continue playing audio until both earbuds are placed into the charging case. This is not a deal breaker but definitely an annoyance if I pause audio, remove them from my ears and inadvertently touch the earbuds and restart audio while handling them (quite easy to do). I am very pleased with this seller and their response to my difficulties with the purchase, but I’m not really impressed with the earbuds. I do continue to use them since I can get around the problems and I hate to toss out a great fitting earbud."
"The sound quality is good. They are cute.  They hold a charge. I really like everything but, I need to be able to tap to pause quickly and easily. and then be able to tap again to resume.  But these dont work well.  I dont know if I have a faulty pair or if this is norm for this item.  I had my last pair of ear buds for a while. I misplaced them- so sad.  I could wear my old pair while washing dishes or cooking. If I needed to pause I could easily use my bicep to tap my bud and it would pause and I could do the same to resume.  But not the case here. I tap, rub, push, squeeze... its not easy"
"I am giving this product a 3 because the translation does not work.  I had to watch videos to learn about the app to download for translation...but after downloading the app it would not blue tooth to the ear buds.  I fits comfortably on the ear and the sound works well for music, etc.  It just didnt work for translation purposes."
I’ve had these for awhile Pros:Quick to chargeLong charge lifeGreat sound for the priceCons:Does not always connectDisconnects itself during a call without warningRandomly plays musicStill do not know where to tap to answer callHaving to constantly adjust it to keep it in ear
"I really liked these ear pods at first, charging was good, fit well in ear, no issues connecting to iPhone, and sound was great.However, this greatness was short lived.  Within a year they stopped working all together. Unsure what happened.Really bummed out as I liked them."
"I mean..... they $35 headphones.... good in some things like holding a charge but lack luster in others. Sound quality is a little muddy but not horrible. Single ear player is a nice thing, comfortability is a no-go but everybody is different. You'll get by."
"At first glance the ear buds are aesthetically pleasing - but that's as far as the positives go.1. Quality is not as crisp as I would like it but I don't really consider that a complaint what's probably worse for me is how loud sound is even at the lowest setting, so if you're like me and prefer to have it low at times, it might be bothersome.2. I've purchased multiple earbuds before and have been looking for something that won't fall out of my ears as soon as I bend down or do any kind of activity. Unfortunately, this earbud is no exception. It falls out or starts to fall out when I'm doing yoga/floor exercises.3. As pretty as it is, I find it a bit annoying to take out of the case. It's kind of an unnecessary struggle. And the case does not stand up right. Once in a blue moon if it's in the perfect position it might stand up for a brief few seconds (this is me being very critical though)4. It took a LONG time for the earbuds to pair with my phone. I almost gave up before it cooperated. This might be a fluke but it was still a nuissance5. The charge takes FOREVER to get to 100%, it was completely dead on arrival6. Battery life is incredibly short, (the percentage is displayed on the front of the case) and it gets down to the single digits pretty quick. I use the earbuds mon-fri anywhere from 4-8 hrs a day depending on my day and I'm needing to charge a couple times a week or every other day it seems. Though this may seem ""normal"" because of my usage, my previous earbuds lasted for weeks. Very disappointed in the battery life7. Sometimes only one of the earbuds work so I'll have to ""reset"" in order to get both working - take them off, put them back in the case, shut off bluetooth, reconnect, etcOverall, I would not repurchase. I ordered this because of the price AND the GREAT REVIEWS. But it was a disappointing experience for me. I only ordered one for myself and was going to order a 2nd set for my husband if all went well. Guess we'll be shopping for different ones"
These headphones were great - but after just about a year the case will not stay charged and the left headphone will not turn on. Just hoped something would last longer than a year.
"These were pretty good when I had them, but they didn’t charge. It was easy to use, and I liked that the battery lasted a long time. I accidentally dropped them while on a roller coaster though so unfortunately I don’t have them anymore loll"
"These are really nice overall, especially for the price. However, I'm having a frequent issue where they will glitch out and the volume will start going Up Up Up before blasting out my eardrums, and the only way to stop it from raising the volume is to put them in the case and take them back out. If that glitch weren't so... ear damaging, I wouldn't dock it down to 3 stars, but that is a very concerning issue."
"They are okay headphones. They are easy to use and put in. They don't really fit well? But I'm not going to dock a point, yes they hurt my ears but after I replaced the earbud it was fine. The color is okay? doesn't really fit the picture. But that's alright. The touch control is wonderful, easy to figure out. Theres a review on here that mentions that these are ""noise canceling"" They are not. They also have a ringing noise that bothers me. I like listening to my music on low volume and I can hear the ringing. And no I dont have tinnitus. But other than that the sound quality is pretty good also there are a lot of spelling errors on the guide, not a huge deal but kind of silly. Other than that, I'm giving it 3 stars. They are going to be my back up pair if my older ones get damaged."
"I’ve tried with all the tips, and the buds just don’t fit quite right in my ears. On top of that, putting them back into the case tends to be somewhat difficult for some; The shape of the hole for the buds is odd, so getting the buds into the case in the dark is a no-go for me. This may not be an issue if they stayed in my ears overnight. If I have not removed them & put them in a cup, by morning the buds would be missing in blankets.Sound quality is pretty good. Not the best, but for what I paid, it will do.The biggest issue for me is this: I typically have Pandora, guided meditation, or a podcast app playing. Frequently, when I open and activate the buds (insert in ear), Apple Music begins an old podcast. I don’t use Apple Music, & this only happens with these buds."
I think this is my second pair and honestly it take one good drop and boom! Won't work ever again
"These are OK my Apple ones got wet and they went out on me and so I ordered these which were much cheaper. They started out excellent but they’re fading pretty quick they still work but when I get a little extra money, I’m going back to Apple in a pinch, I would buy these probably again but as far as quality fair !"
The audio quality is exceptional and comparable to earbuds offered in a much more expensive price range.  My complaint with this product is that I can’t take them anywhere for fear of loosing them.  They literally fall out of my ears if I simply blink my eyelids. That fact is either a design flaw or an sneaky attempt to increase sales.
"the quality when ur calling is trash. other than that though, not bad"
First set I purchased was great until I dropped one down the toilet. So I re-ordered thinking they were going to be great as well. I was so wrong! About 2weeks after getting them the left one started having an issue charging until it no longer charges. With in a month I had to purchase a different brand.
"THE GOOD:earbuds are comfortable, they do connect to phone when case is open and, from what I can tell, have the typical Bluetooth range. The charging case appears to charge the earbuds in quick fashion.THE BAD:the sound quality isn't what is advertised. when OTP, callers can barely hear my or they say that I sound like ""You're on speaker and away from the phone"". Charging time for each earbud doesn't live up to the hype. I believe each earbud is supposed to keep charge for 6h on single charge, mine need a charge in 3h.FINAL THOUGHTI like the earbuds for comfort, but the sound quality leaves little to be desired. Maybe I have a faulty device"
"It's not the best. It keeps falling, doesn't fit well. Sound is fine.Battery lasts well. But the touch sensors are horrible, and it has zero noise cancelling. Using them for phone calls is horrible.Maybe not bad for listening.It connects okay, it's light, but the worde to make calls."
"Good sound quality in these, at a very reasonable price.HOWEVER, after awhile (and not with a ton of usage - I probably use them 2-3 hours/week on average), I've run into a few issues:1 - As you can see in the photo, the Left earbud isn't charging. Something faulty with it making a connection. I've tried - multiple times - to clean both contact points. Sometimes, it succeeds - but only for maybe a single charge before becoming an issue again.2 - Recently, even after I've disconnected them from my iPhone - and when they are in their container - they will suddenly re-pair with my phone (I don't THINK this is an iPhone thing, because my phone doesn't do that with other Bluetooth devices).3 - And just today, I struggled to get the Left bud to power up, and finally, after it did, NO music came out of it, even though I could use it as a CONTROL (pause music, go back a song, decrease volume). Very strange.All in all, even though the price is good, the fact this pair seems to be shot after 8 months means I won't buy this brand again."
Cons: consistently charges every time you open and close case. This results in recharging the box more frequently.When someone calls it does not tell you who it is. Just says call instead of the phone number.Pro: like the color and style of headphones
"So I've been using them for a couple of days to see what I think about them. The sound is fine. They're not noise canceling while works for me but just in case that's something you might be looking for. I've found that my ears start to hurt not very long after putting them in, and if I like laugh/smile big they get loose and pushing them back in is kind of annoying due to the smart touch technology, I've accidently hung up on calls, paused songs/skipped music, and turned volume down and powered them off all by accident just fixing them back into my ear correctly. I was actually trying to figure out if I can turn that off. I'm weary to wear these at the gym. I feel they're going to pop out when I'm running but I'll be giving it a shot later. I have changed out the rubber ear piece with others it came with even though they all appear to be the same size to see if it makes any difference and it has not. So.. They're cute and functional but im not sure how often I'd use them. Definitely won't use them for calls due to the accidental hang ups/powering off mid call."
"These headphones to me (I guess I have small ears) are not comfortable. I've tried using each silicone end, but the headphones won't stay in at all. Even without any of the silicone ends on the headphones will just fall out when I'm using them at my desk. The sound quality is fine. For $40 bucks I wasn't expecting much, and it's exactly what I got. Also, not a big deal, but I got the purple ones expecting them to be bright purple and they are purple however it is more of a dark jewel tone.  If I ever need another pair of wireless headphones I'll stick with Apple."
"These are okay. The sound is muddier compared to pixel bud and the touch controls are a little flakey. Soemtimes touch control works, sometimes it doesn't.  Not terrible for the money though. If you lose them you won't cry very hard."
"Overall, these earbuds are pretty nice! They were easy to pair to my phone and stay paired, but one unfortunate downside is that they don't automatically disconnect when you put the earbuds in the case, so in order to play anything out of the phone's speaker, you have to turn your bluetooth off or unpair from the earbuds.My biggest complaint is that even on the lowest setting, they are quite loud. On iPhone, you can manually move the volume bar to between mute and the first ""notch"" of volume (one click up on the volume) in order to get the quietest sound possible, but these headphones don't accommodate that, and just mute when you try to move the volume any lower than the first notch. That being said, the sound didn't bleed, and the quality seemed decent.I didn't find them the most comfortable, but I am also super picky about that, so they should be relatively fine to wear for an hour or two for most people. They have a very long battery life, and the case hasn't dropped below 95% charge in 3 days of use.Lastly, the ""one touch to pause/play"" feature is super finnicky. Whenever I'm adjusting the earbuds in my ear, I always accidentally seem to pause, and when I'm *trying* to pause, it never seems to work! Very frustrating.Overall, besides little issues and the volume, these are nice earbuds, and are exceptionally nice for the price! Would recommend, even though I am going to go for a different option (I'm very sensitive to sound)."
Just 1 accidental drop from 1-2 feet from the bed tp the floor. The right bluetooth headset stopped working completely after 8 months of barely using them.UPDATE: YP Tech reached out to me through email with an apology and offered a full refund.
"Whenever I make a phone call, everyone on the phone tells me that they cannot hear me well and too much noise coming. I just use it for listening to music or watch a movie on the phone."
"I still have them, still use them all the time. I've dropped them in water idk how many times and they still work like nothing ever happened my ost wouldn't work after that."
I got my earbud today. My dog found it and made it a chew toy 😣The package comes with a lifetime warranty. Let’s see if it really has a lifetime warranty.
"I was able to pair these to my PC via Bluetooth. However, when I tried to play anything through them, it didn't work. The first time ""sound"" came through, it was static and broken sound for a few seconds, then it never came through again. Also, the headset would randomly disconnect, and then reconnect. I'm right next to the PC so it couldn't be a distance issue. The only thing I can think of is that they aren't supposed to connect to a PC and the posting on here was wrong."
"I love these earbuds! I got them in 2022 and ended up getting two pairs of them - one as a backup that I got on a promotional deal they were running. I only used one pair for the first year and a half until the left earbud shorted out.Since I had the second pair, I started using those. 6 months in and the left earbud shorted out again.Overall they’ve been great and are an excellent value, but it’s a little disappointing that this happened twice."
It's so sensitive when you touch it. I can't get it to stop playing music. I still can't figure out how to increase and decrease the volume.
"I saw this brand and thought it would be an upgrade for my older set of earbuds but honestly I’m not very impressed with the sound quality of this new set.I’ve been using a set of TOZO-T6 brand earbuds for about 4 years, which they still work and sound great, but thought I would get a back up pair for if they started to crap out on me soon as I use my wireless earbuds daily.These do get very loud, but the sound quality sounds slightly muffled to me and the bass is lacking.I will still keep these X08 earbuds, but will probably only just them for situations where I don’t mind if they get damaged or lost as I don’t feel like they’re an upgrade for my older set.You know what “they” say, you get what you pay for!! Sometimes you find something awesome for cheap but these are just meh in my opinion. 🙃"
"After using these earbuds for about 4 months I can now form an opinion on these earbuds. The battery life is infact amazing I once listened to two hours worth of episodes and it still had 70% battery on the earbuds. Once placed back in the case they recharge without being connected. On the other hand these earbuds do not cancel out the noise at all and I have to raise my phone volume to where it's suppose to hurt, but can barely hear in a noisy environment. Also my friends say when I use the earbuds during a call I either sound soft spoken or static which makes it hard for them to understand me. Another thing is when exercising they do tend to slip out or get to a point where they are about to fall out and it happens frequently, but that could also be my earwax."
"They will not stay connected to my computer; I must re-pair them every time and that becomes cumbersome.  Also, they have noise limitations and I originally purchased them for work- I listen to voices all day long with tons of different background noises and need to be able to hear the softest voice with a cacophony of noise in the background.  They work GREAT for listening to music and books on my phone, though, and I do have several pairs."
Volume control is a pita.Battery life isn't great.I use them  for gaming on my computer.
"September 13:I bought these headphones as a gift for my wife. Additionally, I bought some accessories, ear supports to avoid losses due to falls and a case that matches well with the color of the headphones. I put together a complete gift. I thought I had made a good purchase. My great disappointment and annoyance has been seeing how the headphone controls go crazy and the volume goes up and down at will. The touch controls to control the headphones do not work well. It's lucky if they activate the desired function. Don't even think it will control the volume. These headphones do what they want. The battery on the left hearing aid lasts less than half that of the right hearing aid. The headphones turn off when they still have 50 to 60% charge and do not work again until they are over 70-80% charge, and then repeat the same strange phenomenon. Avoid losing your money and investment. Or worse yet, give a gift that won't work. I will return these headphones.Update: September 15, 2023I contacted: Amazon Customer Service, who contacted the manufacturer. The attention was precise and brief. They identified the situation and Tagry almost immediately sent a replacement unit. Thank you so much.This is the type of support and attention that is expected. I congratulate the manufacturer for the excellent willingness to focus on the guarantee of its products. I'm waiting for the new headphones to try them out and see if they work correctly. At the moment a 10/10 to TAGRY and Amazon for the support provided.As soon as I try the new headphones I will gladly update and rerate this review. And I emphasize that no one has asked me to change anything, but if TAGRY deserves 5 stars, I will gladly give it to them."
"I bought these and while they work pretty great (minus the fact that even a bandanna is enough pressure to constantly trigger the side tap functions), they constantly fall out of my ears, to the point where on a plane I had to go half the flight with only one earbud as they rolled back several aisles under the seats. In the garden, they fell out constantly while weeding. I tried to secure them with a bandanna tied over the top and you can see my previous note - not a solution. I think I need to just give up on earbuds, maybe the shape of my ear is unusual but I was sorry these weren't a good solution for me even though they worked well!"
"The first day I received them, the charging case was down to 91.  I plugged it into the charging cable that was included and it would not charge.  It stayed at 91 for several mins.  I kept opening and closing the case still nothing.  I then removed the earbuds from the case and plugged it back.  It immediately started charging.  It charged up to 100% within a few mins.  I used the earbuds that night and the next morning put the earbuds back into the case to charge.  When I connected them to my phone today, my phone's Bluetooth showed the earbuds charged to 100%.  The case itself is now showing it's charge at 86.  So I plugged it in and tried charging it.  It will not charge now.  It just stays blinking at 86 when you plug it in.  I bought a wireless charger, still will not charge.  I have plugged it into a couple different USB-C chargers, still will not charge.  I removed the earbuds again, still will not charge.I actually spoke to their customer service regarding the issue yesterday of not being able to charge the case unless I remove the earbuds. I'm not sure why they're not understanding me, however, the final response from them said it could've been a misreading on the case.  At that time, I just figured I'd deal with it.  Unfortunately today, I'm not able to charge the case at all.  I did register the earbuds through Tagry online, so I will just contact them and see what the next step is.  I will update the review after I speak to them again.  I originally was going to give these earbuds 1 star, but upgraded to 2 stars because their customer service was really nice and tried really hard to troubleshoot the issue.Also there is zero noise cancellation.  I can't remember if it stated it had noise cancellation or not, but it doesn't.  You can clearly hear everything around you.  I also keep hearing a poping noise when I please the earbud in my ear.  I'm not sure what that it.  The sound is alright.  It's definitely not crystal clear and the bass isn't anything to get excited over.  I have another pair of earbuds from another brand that sounds much better.  These are actually pretty comfortable to wear which is what I wanted.  The battery life is ok I guess.  I used the earbuds to fall asleep in and after a few hours they were down to 68.  I was hoping the battery life would've been better.  At least they didn't die after only a couple of hours.  Honestly you get what you pay for.  I didn't expect anything phenomenal, but I didn't expect to have any charging issues right off the bat."
I am using these for meetings on Zoom and Google Meet and the audio is not that great. Not sure if it has something to do with the PC bluetooth or not. Also difficult to control volume. Have not connected them to my phone
I took these out of the box and hooked them up to my phone with no problem. Controls seem to work well but the sound quality was not great. No bass and everything sounded kind of tinny.These will be going right back.
"I bought these primarily to wear when mowing and when sleeping.  Unfortunately they are borderline loud enough for mowing (battery powered mower) and too loud for sleeping.  I believe someone else mentioned the minimum volume being too loud as well.  The touch controls are inconsistent.  On a positive note they are very comfortable.UPDATE:  TAGRY people are reading these reviews!  I didn't ask for a refund but I received an email today from TAGRY offering a full refund.  I'm not sure I have ever received an unsolicited refund on Amazon before.  Since my initial review I have gotten a better impression of these headphones.  The issue with not being loud enough to hear over my electric lawnmower can be overcome by reseating the buds in my ears as I mow - not a big deal though it does sometimes pause the playback or lower/raise the volume.  I have a pretty bumpy yard and I think the vibration from mowing jars the buds just enough to make the sound almost unhearable.  As regards being too loud for sleep, I'm still working on that solution.  I have also come to appreciated the packaging and design of this product.  One change that would be helpful is for the lid of the holder to have a detent so that it will remain open until the user closes it.  The touch controls were too inconsistent to use anymore (except when I'm not trying to use them), so I just change the volume for the device they are paired with.  Note: I have been diabetic for over 30 years and the pin pricks to my fingers to check my blood sugar (scar tissue) may be the cause of the touch controls not working as well as they might for others.  I'd give these a solid 4 stars now."
"They paired with my iphone and tv. Worked well with iphone. Good sound quality with tv, but annoying audio lag. No lag at all with friends Apple Airpods. The return went great, thanks to Amazon."
"Sound is good! My AirPods have more bass but I wasn’t able talking with them but these earbuds made me sound muffled still, I have to talk louder when using earbuds"
The ear buds did not connect.  I returned these headphones and received a replacement. I had to pay to box up the small box it came in and print a label (not just drop it off at UPS as in past returns.  The new pair does work just fine.  Connected to my iPhone right away.  I saved my receipt for the return of the defective pair. Good tHung as it has not shown returned on my account for over 4 days. I bet I’ll have to deal with proving I did!🤔😠
The headphones are not comfortable to wear. They hurt your ears. Good quality audio if you can get over it hurting your ears.
"I have a small head, so presumably small ears as well. These fell out of my ears 3 times while on the treadmill today."
"Now these work as intended I've had no issues with the sound quality of the earbuds. However I'm frustrated by the low battery warning. It let's you know every minute until the earbuds eventually turn off effectively reducing the battery life by an extra 20-30 minutes as you cannot use this last bit of time on the battery for yourself. The battery isn't terrible but I work 12 hour shifts and I must charge them during my shift every day even if I come in with a full charge, so it leaves a bit to be desired.More of a personal gripe but the shape of the earbuds (they have a long, thin tail) catches on hats/hairnets very easily. They are inconvenient to use at work.The touch controls are inconsistent. Another personal gripe as I could probably just buy earbuds with button controls as opposed to touch controls. I have had many situations where I cannot pause a song with the touch controls when I try to, however I often do it on accident. Also; with the touch controls, you'll often adjust volume levels on your phone on accident when you're just trying to hold one of the earbuds for whatever reason. I've almost blasted my left ear out many times while holding or even just adjusting the right earbud as a long press of the right earbud causes your volume to increase.I often have to babysit the case and charger for the earbuds because the left bud decides to randomly stop charging sometimes. No issues with the right bud however.I did not receive different size earpieces for the buds, if you have large ears you will likely have troubles with the buds falling out of your ears.Despite all of these frustrations they are functional and they were affordable. I have had no issues with connectivity, the range at which it loses connection from your phone is fairly average for any pair of wireless earbuds that I've had."
"Like the sound, fit, battery life. Can't figure out the buttons. Not the end of the world, but inconvenient"
"The charging is good, but it disconnects and reconnects multiple times, and the sound is not very clear."
Earbuds keep slipping out of my ears. Tried all 3 sizes provided. I believe it’s the design.
I like it but the voice is annoying why does it talk so slow shut up
I could hear some little background noise in the back…… so bothered me a little.
"for starters, let me say that I did reach out to the company, inquiring about the warranty they offer when you register for rent within 15 days of receiving your item. Maybe I received my earbuds late at night, so I tried them the next day. I had them on almost all day I watched videos, played a game, listen to music, etc. the only thing I haven’t tried with it yet is a phone call. I did voice to texting, etc. and my overall opinion these is, there just OK.The reason for me, saying this is the battery life is pretty great so far. However, I did see other comments, saying the battery life deplete from endlessly over the first few months. I cannot attest to that because I’ve only had mine for 3 days. The sound cancellation is really not  there at all. As far as sound quality goes, it’s lacking tremendously. It is the biggest downfall on these. It constantly goes static he as well as skips like an old scratched up CD. And when I say this, I mean, it skips for a good three seconds at a time and then wait a while and then does it again.my main reason for even trying these out was because I have smaller ears so the AirPods I had really were causing issues. They hurt my ears. These happened to be on the lightning deal so I thought hey let’s try it. Overall, if I did not pay as little as I did, I would be returning these for sure. they do fit better in my ears but they’re still not great. The right side is still a little snug in after so long does possum irritation. The left side is OK, but I did notice after having them in for 30+ minutes they start to fall out."
The blue tooth keeps saying disconnected and seems to not work as well.
"The battery life is nice and they dont fall out easily and they look nice. Thats where the good ends. Their connection is a bit spotty and the sound quality is not great even for the price. You may be able to listen to very low, bassy things with these but they will not achieve a full sound in things with more dynamic or treble end range. They are servicable, but I would not recomend them.For a similar price point i recommend the tozo t6s. The eq is much more full and they have good battery life as well. Only negative with them is that they fall out very easily because they are a bit large.Edit. The company offered me a full refund and dealt with the issue very kindly. Hopefully the next model will be better"
Unfortunately could not register. 6 different attempts at inputting the “order number”.
"Great for phone, but wanted to use with Dell laptop."
"The instructions are confusing. I think it helps to be 25 yrs old or less. A YouTube for seniors would be nice. So far I’ve gotten them to tell me they are both on the right channel. I can’t find instructions to get a left and right channel. I can’t figure out how to pair with my device. I can’t tell if they are usable on an iPad.I used to be able to figure out any electronics, but they have left me floundering.In the morning I’ll get my grandkid to do this nasty task for me.If they can be deciphered I will rewrite my review."
"I recently purchased the TAGRY Bluetooth Headphones, and I'm impressed with their performance. These headphones offer excellent sound quality for their price point. The bass is punchy, and the highs and mids are clear, making my music and podcasts sound fantastic.The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, and the range is impressive. I can leave my phone in one room and still enjoy uninterrupted music in another. Pairing with my devices was a breeze, and the connection remains stable.Comfort-wise, these headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods. The cushioning on the ear cups is soft, and they fit snugly without causing discomfort. I appreciate the adjustable headband, which allows for a customized fit.Battery life is solid. I can go a few days without needing to recharge, which is convenient. The built-in microphone works well for calls, and I appreciate the hands-free functionality.One minor drawback is the plastic construction, which feels a bit flimsy. However, considering the affordability, it's a minor trade-off.Overall, the TAGRY Bluetooth Headphones provide great value for their price. They deliver impressive sound quality, comfort, and connectivity, making them a solid choice for budget-conscious users.Pros:Impressive sound qualityReliable Bluetooth connectivityComfortable for extended useLong battery lifeAffordable priceCons:Plastic construction feels somewhat flimsyI would recommend these headphones to anyone looking for an affordable wireless headphone option without compromising on sound quality"
"Pros:These earbuds are great for listening to music!The charge on the case is remarkably long!Cons:Talking on the phone is very frustrating as the other person on the call has a lot of trouble hearing me and voices seem distorted.The paint chips easily from the case, making it unseemly."
"I really love these earbuds. They are comfortable and easy to pair. The battery life is supreme. Each earbud can last for 10+ hours between charges. I only need to charge the case once every 2 weeks or so. I use these literally every single day for many hours at a time.I have very few negatives for these earbuds. I often pause whatever I'm watching/listening to by touching the side of the ear bud accidentally. There is a low battery alert, but it plays when the battery is at like 1% and it does so every 30 seconds until the earbud dies. This interrupts what you're listening to but does not pause it so you just miss what was just played and have to rewind. This alert is also much louder than whatever is being played. Keeping the earbuds charged makes this a non issue entirely.If you want a reliable and affordable set of Bluetooth earbuds I would 100% recommend these. I've been using them for nearly a year and they don't have any problems.EDIT: it's been just over a year of constantly using these headphones. I still really really love them, but the changing case no longer holds a charge. It's very disappointing because one of my favorite things about these headphones was that I could charge them once every couple weeks and they would keep going that entire time. No longer. I have to now stop using them to put them in the case (both of them, not just one) and connect to power to charge daily."
"They're good ear buds with good sound quality, provided you only plan on using them whilst sedately walking about, or sitting. If you plan on using these in the gym, you start to run into super annoying issues. Your arms being near your head can cause your sound to pause or skip. If you sweat and it trickles down to an ear bud, or your hair becomes wet, hijinks ensue. Sometimes, an ear bud may just stop working completely, or with no apparent reason, the volume will turn all the way down. It's pretty annoying to have to stop your workout to try to suss out why your ear buds are malfunctioning AGAIN."
"Update: The company reached out to me and really worked to make this right.  My hope is that the pair I got was simply a fluke.  I certainly appreciate any company that listens to a customer's concerns and works with them to resolve the issue.I don't like writing negative reviews but really felt I needed to warn potential buyers.  From the moment I got these ear buds, they were glitchy. Since I got them on sale, I figured it's not too bad so I'll just keep them -- especially since I only use them 3x/week for working out.  Big mistake.  The gliches only got worst.  I often struggle to get them to connect properly with Bluetooth.  Then, when it is finally connected and playing, one or both will suddenly cut out. I have to stop my working out to tap at the ear buds, take them out, and/or have to take out my phone and restart the process of trying to connect.  I've only had them 2 months but that means I'm past the 1 month return window.  I'm trashing them and having to spend more money to buy better ear buds.  Don't waste your money like I did."
"I love these. They work so well with my phone. Never had an issue pairing them to my phone. I use them with an Samsung Galaxy S20 fe 5g. The earbuds, come with a cord for charging and 3 different ear bud sizes. SMALL, MEDIUM AND LARGE for a perfect fit for your ears.UPDATE: I started having issues with these earbuds. I'm constantly charging them and one of my earbuds randomly stopped working. I contacted the company, and they did send me a new set ,so great customer service. BUT, im still having issues with this replacement set. Idk, their not worth the money, probably can find a better quality set. Not sure if I would recommend these. I shouldn't be having this many issues for the money I paid for them."
"Had it for a month or so and it stopped charging. I had bought 3, 1 for me and 2 of my friends. Their's are still working and I rarely used mine when it stopped charging."
I was excited about these and needed to replace my Apple ear pods because they are several years old and starting not to hold a charge for very long.  The sound quality is surprisingly poor and I find they don’t hold a charge much longer than my old ones. They were easy to connect…but not super comfortable because of the the piece that comes down…it touches your face constantly.  I cannot say I would recommend these.  They look cool and high quality in photos but feel and sound quite cheap.  You get what you pay for in this case.
"I’m not sure where all of these AMAZING reviews came from, but the moment I pulled the headphones out, I wanted to put them back. The case feels so incredibly cheap, like it will crack open or scuff badly  at the slightest hard fall. The battery life does seem to hold up. I used the medium size silicone ear piece and it fit well. The headphones connect just fine, however, they connect the SECOND you open the case because they cannot sense when they’re in your ear.On to my final note, and why I’ve rated these so poorly. The sound quality is so poor. I’ve been using 2nd generation air pods that were 6+ years old, and lost them somehow, so I decided to go with a non apple product, figuring the technology has been there for so long, surely other brands have good quality sound. I put these in my ears while on the phone and the quality difference was immediately noticeable. It sounded like I was listening through a red solo cup. Anytime I talk, it weirdly echoes back to me, muffled and distorted.Do not recommend."
For the money they work ok. If you're looking for high sound quality these are not it. My biggest gripe is there is no way to shut off the auto play. I'm on IOS and I have disabled all of the bluetooth auto feature and these headphones start Music every single time I pull them out of the case. Even if I'm already on a call they start playing music. It's VERY annoying.The battery lasts quite a while so that is a plus. Again ok for the money but definitely not a high quality sounding headphone.
"The sound is sub par. There is no crispness to the treble, and the base isn't deep enough. Connecting set up are simple, but the sound quality is dull."
"Good things: easy to set up, good sound qualityProblem issue: I tried to use these on a walking trip & it kept cutting off Then I tried using it at the salon & again it cut off; it kept asking me for the wifi which was connected to the the salon’s wifi but it still didn’t work :(I so wanted these to work bc I needed to replace my my expensive Airpod Pros which never gave me a connectivity issues so I’m returning them & going back to my AirPod pro"
Yes the good and the bad that's why I gave it 3 stars because this earbuds are horrible yes they are loud but they be sounding like crap I'm disappointed with people making good reviews on something that sounds like crap for one this earbuds needs like a major upgrade big time the company needs to work harder on this product for one when you turned it up at certain point they start rattering and the sound is horrible thank God that my phone has its own EQ to set the sound a bit better as for bass this earbuds don't have none of that and even on phone calls when you be trying to answer a phone call you can't not depend on this earbuds to answer the phone call you have to press your phone 📱 to answer the call the only thing I do like about this is the moment you take them out they do connect really fast like super fast they do sound good when it comes to phone calls as well as for battery life it's good as well but as for the sound it need a major upgrade big time the company needs to improve this earbuds big time so for those people who are making good reviews on this please stop be honest with your products because people like me will get of a bad products and it's disappointing I don't recommend this to no one until the company improves them.
"The sounds quality is fine, they look nice, I really like the display on the front with the battery life.But, they automatically play whatever you were last listening to/watching when you put them in. The tap play/pause function is incredibly sensitive and can be touched by mistake very frequently.So when you take the earbud out of the case, if you aren't extremely careful with how you handle them, they'll automatically start playing whatever you were last listening to. which doesn't seem all that bad, unless your volume was on high the last time you played something and it begins blasting in your ear.The tap function is so sensitive that I have hung up on calls while putting the second one in, for example.Every time I even touch one earbud, for any reason, I have to pause something on my phone.I just wish I could turn the tap feature off, and then they'd be perfect, but I've dug through all possible settings and it doesn't seem possible."
"sound quality is good with the very inexpensive earbuds.  My only complaint is the battery life, I think I get about 5-6 hours.  I work 10 hour shift, so I have to make due."
"I know you get what you pay for but I had high hopes after reading the ratings. Sound is ok for the price. But none of the ear covers fit they are all too big. The tapping functions rarely work for me, they just start and stop and usually delayed. Also my phone stays connected to them when I put them back in the case. I have to use the phone for control of each aspect which defeats the purpose.  Will be returning."
Music sounds pretty good on them but everyone I talk to has a hard time hearing me
"Works well for sound on videos, but for phone calls, people can’t hear you ."
It’s an alright product; the earbuds are comfortable to wear and the charge last a long time. However I’ve only been using them for a few days and already the earbuds are glitching. In the first day the sound kept cutting out of one earbud or disconnecting. It was never for very long but it’s been fairly constant. I’ll use them for as long as they last but I don’t think I’ll buy them again
Product was fine it just didn't come when it said it was. Before I ordered any of my orders just recently they said they wouldn't be here no later 7/18... that was 2 days. I didn't receive not 1 of my 5 or 6 items on time. What happen. So far the Product I have received is ok but man I made plans.
"I really like the sound of these and how they fit. I have small ears so finding earbuds is sometimes a challenge. Like these. This is my second pair. With that being said I prob won’t buy them again. My first pair I got and same thing. Loved them but after about 5-6 months they wouldn’t charge the right bud. I tried to carefully clean the inside of the case, bottom of the bud and it wouldn’t charge. So I chocked it up to a $30 bud and bought a new pair. Same thing. 5-6 months later it stopped charging the left side. So now I have two cases to charge one pair. So it’s just sort of frustrating and I hate clutter so my drawer just feels cluttered having 2 cases chillin out in there."
"I found these to be anything but all the reviews had to say about them.  SUPER uncomfortable.  They fell out of my ears constantly.  Crackling sound and can't really judge noise cancellation since they would not stay in my ears long enough to judge.  I even took the smallest rubber end OFF to see if I could wear them that way - NOPE, still fell out of my ears.  Since I did not use the other 2 larger rubber ends I gave these to a friend to see what he thought.  He hated them as well.  So glad I did not pay much for them.  I will be honest as far as ear buds go, for me I have tried many different pairs and none of them feel comfortable. It could be that my inner ear is very small? I just know I hated them and so did the friend I gave them to.  I also did not find them to hold a charge very long.  I live in an apartment with 20 units so I left them in an area where we give our unwanted items away.  Maybe someone else will find them as wonderful as everyone else did in the reviews."
"None of the reviews that I’ve seen seem to really mention this. I tested these while running today. If I keep my phone in my pocket, the music starts cutting out a little bit here and there. It’s fine if my phone isn’t in my pocket… but music cuts out quite a bit at times when my phone is in my pocket. Very annoying and it’s a dealbreaker for me as I always keep things in my pocket. Otherwise, they sound great. I’m going to return these unfortunately.Update: I went for a walk and didn’t notice as much of it cutting out… almost none at all. I feel like it was worse during the run, possibly because many other people were around? Not sure, but still a dealbreaker."
"The earbuds look good at first, but connecting is a NIGHTMARE. Sometimes, they randomly turn off without pushing any buttons. Speaking of buttons, while there is a button on the earbud, it doesn’t work. What a waste! The sound only goes up about 50% of a normal earbud. Not very loud and the base is not low. Also, it was almost $50 U.S. dollars at the time!DON’T BUY THIS!!!"
It connected to my phone just fine and functioned. The only problem was that it was loud even on the lowest setting. Eventually stopped using them because I was a bit nervous about what it was doing to my hearing. Stayed in my ears pretty decently though. You get what you pay for I guess.
"The color of the headphones on Amazon is a pretty vibrant color of purple, but as you can see in my photo, it’s a dull purple. They fit nicely and worked right when I synced them with my phone. Syncing was super easy. I’m just disappointed that the color isn’t how they’re shown on Amazon."
"I bought these after dropping my Apple Air Pods in a bowl of marinade (FYI - They are not oil proof). I figured if I was going to be doing dumb things like that, I shouldn't be spending $150 on headphones. So I found these which were a bargain at $30.I've been using them for a couple of months now and I've noticed a couple of unusual things:1. Unlike Air Pods, these will not automatically stop playing if you take one of the ear buds out. The Apple ones will automatically pause whatever you are listening to if you take one out. A couple of times these did stop playing when I took them out, but most of the time they don't.2. I've discovered that occasionally, even if I pause what I'm listening to, take the headphones out and put them in their case, sometimes they will begin playing again all on their own, even though they are in the case. I realized that after I went back to pick up where I left off in my audio book and found that it had been playing for more than an hour and I had to go back and figure out where I was in the book.3. Occasionally, not all the time, after I pause what I'm listening to and take the headphones out, the music or audiobook will all of a sudden start up again but play out of my phone speaker, not the headphones. It's a little awkward at work when that happens, especially if I get up from my desk and walk away only to find when I come back that my phone has been playing my audio book out loud the whole time.4. Most annoying of all: Sometimes I will put the headphones on, and it will start playing really loud and will not allow me to turn it down. The headphones will say ""Volume Maximized"" while it's blasting my ear drums. I try to turn it down on my phone and see that the volume goes down, then the headphones bring it back to full volume and again scream at me ""Volume Maximized"". It's awful.The only good thing I can really say about these is that they were cheap. I would not recommend them to anyone now that I've had a chance to use them for a while. I'm probably going to start looking for an alternative."
I've had these since I believe September of 2023. They used to have a great battery life with around 4 hours half battery. Now after about 2 they give low battery notifications.They're pretty cheap and fit well. But didn't expect battery to die like that. Same for the case battery.
"I was pairing this earpod to my iphone, laptop and ipad mini. It took a while to pair it with the iphone and ipad.  It dis not pair with the laptop. The laptop did not even recognize this earpod at all.  Apple earpods connect easily with any device."
"I tried the various sizes of the rubber ends that go into the ear, and unfortunately none sealed as well as my old ones.  This being the case, there is a fair amount external noise leakage.  The end that goes into the ear is actually oblong instead of round, so perhaps that is why they don't seal very well. There is also some discomfort after having them in for a while.  Regarding the sound quality, they are a bit too mid-range/boxy sounding.  If sound quality, comfort, and/or noise cancellation are important to you, then I would suggest you look elsewhere and be prepared to pay a bit more....you get what you pay for I suppose."
"The sound is pretty good on these earbuds and they fit well in my ears, but the placing of the buttons is SO annoying. Any time I put them in or take them out, I inadvertently push the buttons and turn the sound off or on. I bought 2 pairs and returned the 2nd pair I hadn't opened because I hate them so much!"
"First off pay close attention to the battery life claim. They total hours they show is using one earbud at a time, not both. Each earbud can last 5 hours total and it's pretty much spot on it will die at just over 5 hours.  The volume is quieter than my wired earbuds. I do have hearing loss and with my wired earbuds I can go to about 3/4 volume and that's about as loud as I want to comfortably go. With these bluetooth earbuds, I'm at max volume on almost every call and wish I had some more. I have not seen a way to independently raise the volume on the earbuds themselves, I don't think I can.These do have one weird quirk that if you leave them sitting out of the case for over an hour, the next time you use them with the phone, the bluetooth volume on the phone goes to maximum volume. And when I try to lower it, the robotic voice yells ""maximum volume!"" and the bluetooth volume automatically goes right back to maximum volume. The workaround is to put the earbud back into the case, close it and then reopen and reconnect.The earbuds do work, they connected easily to my Samsung S22, if they had more volume controls and longer battery life I would have rated them higher."
"I love the case and that it charges with the same type cord as my Samsung Galaxy phone. Therefore I can use my car charger on them too, which is very convenient.The sound quality is surprisingly good BUT you have to manipulate the position and reposition the buds in your ears to get best sound and NC. It blocks most external sound to a point. Doesn't allow those around you to hear what you're listening to, thank the Gods because I listen to some spicy stuff along with hard-core metal to get my mojo going for work, walking, shopping without having to ""people.""Great value for your money. Case is lovely and easy to grip without sliding out of your hand, secure lid that stays open and does not break.My biggest issues are comfort in the ear is meh and they fall out easily. In order to get the best sound and block out external noise you have to really push them in there and after an hour or less it starts to hurt your earhole. If you don't really push them in then they fall out easily. My left one falls out more than the right and it doesn't just do it based on movement or bending. It does it even when I am just sitting in the car or on the couch. I am buying a different set of buds for work so I don't have to worry about dropping and losing one randomly. I'm buying Samsung buds as the reviews state they stay in your earholes better. Stay tuned...Overall the price is good for what you get. If they upgraded them to stay in the ear more comfortably then I would have bought another of these vs another brand."
"I wanted these for Teams calls at work.  First, it’s almost impossible to remove the buds from the case, and only slightly easier to replace them. The lid only hinges 90 degrees, so the buds won’t clear the lid when removing them. Very spoiled by my AirPods in this respect.I currently use a pair of cheap Apple wired earphones with 3.5mm cable (the kind they used to give you for free when you bought a phone).  Compared to those…The JBL speakers are tinny and maybe only 1/2 as loud as the Apple earphones, even with volume maxed out.Coworkers keep complaining that they can’t hear me on Teams calls with the Apple wired earphones.  The JBL microphone is a fair bit louder, but still not where I’d like it.I share an office with a coworker, and we’re often on calls together.  I wanted something noise cancelling so that I don’t hear him when he’s taking.  Also, I want folks on Trams calls to be able to hear me better when I’m on a noisy job site.  The noise cancellation on the speakers is just “ok”.  I hear a lot more ambient noise with the JBLs than I do with my AirPod Pros.  On the microphone end, the JBLs do a pretty good job of filtering out background noise, however, when they are cancelling background noise they are also cancelling my voice at those same frequencies.  So in a noisy environment, my voice comes out very choppy on the other end.I think these are decent for someone on a budget, but in the overall scheme of things they leave a lot to be desired."
"The sound quality is decent the app to tune them is nice. But the latency and random disconnecting basically daily at this point is getting a bit annoying. I read a review by a guy who claimed to be a music engineer. I got these to use while editing videos for my YouTube channel and there isn’t much latency but it creates a bit of a lag in the editing software only when these are connected making it hard to use for work. Then lastly, which is the most annoying because it happens constantly, if you wear a winter hat or hoody you have to make sure they aren’t even remotely close to it will constantly mess with the controls. Oh yeah I forgot to mention, occasionally the left one will lag more than the right one and it will have an echo effect. This doesn’t happen often maybe once every week or 2 but still I never had a pair of earbuds do that before. Idk maybe I got a bad pair. But for the price I expected a tad more quality especially from JBL"
I work 2 jobs and I use these a lot. The battery life is very satisfactory to my needs. I will agree tho with everyone else they always feel loose as if they are going to fall out of your ears. The case is not to my liking. It's not designed for easy access. If driving and need to switch them I sometimes have trouble getting them out of their case. Or if I need to charge them I have trouble putting them back in to charge. Since my job consists of much driving I need a quicker access to retrieve or put them in their case. They're ok but I might not buy again for those reasons.
"It's okay, the sound is alright, sometimes while playing music one will go silent for a few seconds and I hate how they try to connect to my phone even when they are in the case sometimes it's very annoying even when my Bluetooth is off I'll see the pop up, I hate that!!!!!!!!! But the battery life is good so I'll give it props for that. For sound I can tell that I'm missing out on some instrumentals in the back ground for some songs. It's just OK that's all I can say about these. And before I forget the call quality is not that great sometimes ppl can't hear me when I speak"
"I don’t know if it’s just me, but this case is too slippery. There’s no lanyard or way to attach it to anything. There’s an odd shape to the fliptop that I won’t allow me to use my fingers because the earbuds are so slippery that they won’t come out if I try to pick them up I have to like try to wiggle them out. It’s a pain in the ass. Normally I would have or a carabiner hooking it onto something so I don’t lose it. This thing just fly everywhere because it has no hook or no nothing to attach to. It’s a poor design. That’s why they’re on sale. They sound great that’s all.did eventually connect to the JBL app so that’s cool I guess  thank God cause I can’t stand the touch controls on most  earbuds but yeah overall they’re too small and slippery. They are worth 30 bucks. because the bulbous magnet is so large, which sounds good thanks —if I touch my ear at all, they fall out because they’re too heavy. In my opinion anyway - enjoy your headphones. Get them When  They are on sale."
"JBL is a trusted name in electronics, so I was confident when I purchased these. However, let the disappointment begin...For starters, the shell that holds the buds is super slippery. I wish everyone would stop that, they are so hard to handle while trying to get the buds out.Now let's talk about the buds. They too are super slippery. It makes just getting the buds out of the case frustrating as all get out unless you have tiny fingers, I s'pose. On top of that, the way they position the buds inside the case for charging is mirrored of how Apple does it, and it's the wrong way. When you take the buds out, they are backwards to how you would put them in your ear. Now I need to spin them around just to put them in my ear, and again, they are slippery! I have big hands, so what might be a simple task for many is not simple for me. I drop them as a result and it just takes more time to answer a call.What's even more frustrating than that is that they do not automatically connect for inbound calls. I always have to answer, then connect them manually. For outgoing calls, it has not been an issue at all.Lastly, the call quality is subpar. My Apple Air Pods had great call quality (yes, I know how much they cost), but we're decades deep into these products, hard to understand why these would not provide a better connection.Disappointed..."
"Disappointing Sound Quality, Unfulfilled ExpectationsI had high hopes for these earbuds based on the reviews, but unfortunately, the sound quality fell short. The audio lacks depth and clarity, with muddy bass and underwhelming treble that makes music feel flat. Even at higher volumes, the sound doesn’t improve and feels slightly distorted.While the design is comfortable and the battery life is decent, these features can’t make up for the core issue: the listening experience isn’t enjoyable. If you’re an audiophile or even just someone who values rich, well-balanced sound, these may not meet your expectations."
"I have an iPhone 14. So I am not sure if it’s the headphones or the phone. The outside noise is so loud that even with the volume at 100% I have to strain to hear my audiobook. If I use my old plug in headphones with the adaptor there is no problem. At this point I am just glad I got them on Black Friday. If you are in a quiet room they sound fine. But I bought them for work, so they are just getting thrown in a drawer."
"For the price, I think the features and sound are adequate; they certainly aren't Sony XM5s, but they aren't bad and better than my 'work earbuds'.However, and this will be subjective based on your finger size I'm sure,  but I have a heck of a time getting them out of the case. I dont like the molding, it encompasses just a bit too much of the earbud and make them, in my opinion, too tough to grip well.  My cheaper 'work earbuds' I have never once dropped/fumbled coming out the case. I fumble/drop these almost every time...to the point it drove me to write this review. Just my 2 cents.Edit:  Not 30 seconds after I wrote this I consciously tried again to pull one of them out carefully - it flipped half-way across my office. -_-  I should add it might be the magnet is just a touch too strong."
"Even though these Bose ear buds come with three sizes of rubber inserts, the overall size and shape of these headphones are too awkward to fit in my ears. They constantly slip and fall to the floor unless I sit very still in a chair. Also, the sound quality is on the trebly end with little low end bass. The sound sounds like poor radio reception. I’m going to have to buy a new pair of earphones as these justDon’t work for me."
"I had high hopes for these ear buds because they had the JBL label, but for me these were a letdown in a number of different areas, mostly in sound quality.I found the sound from these to be very tinny, regardless of how much tinkering I did with the app’s EQ settings. ‘Extreme Bass’ was laughable. I listened to the song ‘Comfort Eagle’ by Cake and it was flat. In order to feel any bass I had to pump up the volume so much my ears hurt—and I’ve heard this song with off-brand buds before and they produced the punch this song delivers very well.And, yes, I attempted a proper fit in my ears and could not find it with any of the provided ear tips.I found it a bit of a challenge to remove the buds from the case, something I’ve not experienced with other buds I’ve owned.Lastly, I knew at purchase that these had to be charged with a USB-C cable, which is not a deal breaker by any means, but with all of the cordless charging available, it was a shame these did not have that feature. Even the off-brand buds my wife got had it AND they had great sound.I really wanted these to work out. I’ve had JBL products in the past and felt these would be great, but they fell short of my expectations."
"I find this product is pretty good sound , specially I can control it via the app to customize the sound . But the problem is the size or design too big that causes they keep falling from my ears . Also when using in high volume, there is distortion from high frequency .  I wish JBL could design it well fit in the ear canals"
"Had to adjust EQ quite a bit to get the desired sound quality, but still not great. But for $25.00, can’t expect amazing sound quality. Biggest complaint is I have trouble getting the ear pods out of the case. I have somewhat large hands/fingers and I struggle removing from the case. Otherwise, they serve my need as a cheap backup to my AirPod pros."
"Overall fine buds but not that impressed. They have a tendency to turn on and connect while they're in the case which just drains the batteries. Sound quality is good if they fit in your ears snugly, but I find they tend to fall out. Overall not bad, but I guess for the price and the brand, I expected a bit more."
Not perfect as expected from jbl first sound Not high at maximum as another brand anker the case is very difficult to put in and out from it.The noise reduction not have levels and it's weak vs anker.The application don't have many options like customise the touch buttons..Really I am disappointed that brand like anker is better than jbl.
"Sound is great, touch features function well, great noise cancellation, good bass & you can hear every detail so long as the buds actually stay in your ears. (Mine are small) For me they slowly fall out even if I’m not moving my jaw or anything. That’s really annoying to me but I can manage by putting a headband on & over my ears, obviously would rather not do that tho.I have iPhone 13 and audio playback lags a lot when watching videos and such. That is annoying as well since I wanted to use these while learning dances and editing videos. Price is pretty reasonable but feels like a waste bc of the lag for me."
Not that quality of headphones to be honest. I would highly recommend trying something else if you’re going pay the price for these. They are unusually awkward and hard to get in and out of the case. Really odd. Sound is ok. Also they don’t stay in my ears very well. Never had this problem before with other buds. I even tried the other cushion cover sizes with them still would fall out if you sweat at all. And when you push them back in to your ear it then will pause the music. Just more cons than pros I’d say that’s why I don’t recommend these.
Seems like an good earbud but I am unable to give a fair rating due to the fact that I can hardly use it. They keep falling out of my ears even after trying the different size ear tips.Paired easilySeems durableCharges quicklyVolume seems okay
The experience of trying to take the earbuds out of the case and fumble them into your ears is a crime against humanity.Seriously... It's not easy or elegant.You cannot simply open the case and place the ear buds into your ear without performing gymnastics. It's terrible.The designers would rather they look pretty in the case than try and make the user experience enjoyable. I'm still keeping these earbuds since they work great...but dude it's 2024 and I look like a cave man when I try and put these on.
"I think my ears must not be the right shape for this type of earbuds. I tried the different sizes, and none were secure. The sound quality had very poor bass and was very tinny sounding. I played with the EQ app for a while and ended up with a headache. I put in a pair of Apple wired earbuds, and the difference was night and day.I also didn’t love the flashing lights on the earbuds, since I’m often listening to something while I’m putting my baby to sleep, so that distracts him."
"had the opportunity to test the JBL Vibe Beam, and I have to say, my experience was quite mixed. As a long-time fan of JBL products, I was excited to try out this new model, especially given my love for deep bass in my music. Unfortunately, the Vibe Beam fell short in that department, which was a significant letdown for me.One of the standout features of the Vibe Beam is its comfort. The fit is exceptional – they sit snugly in the ears without any discomfort, making them ideal for long listening sessions. In fact, I would say the fit is an improvement compared to some of the other JBL headphones I’ve owned in the past. It's evident that JBL has put thought into comfort, which is a huge plus.However, this is where my praise for the Vibe Beam ends. The sound quality, particularly the bass, was disappointing. I found the low-end response to be lacking, especially for a brand that prides itself on delivering great audio experiences. Whether I was listening to hip-hop, rock, or electronic, the deep bass that adds excitement and depth was noticeably absent.Moreover, I encountered a frustrating issue with the volume levels between the left and right headphones. Often, one side would be much louder than the other, which was both distracting and disappointing. This inconsistency greatly diminished the overall listening experience, and I found myself constantly adjusting the volume to compensate.Another letdown was the charging aspect of the Vibe Beam. The battery life did not match the description provided on the website, which further contributed to my dissatisfaction. I expected more reliability from a JBL product in this regard.In conclusion, while the JBL Vibe Beam offers great comfort and represents an improvement in fit from previous models, it ultimately fails in delivering the sound quality I hoped for, particularly in terms of deep bass. Coupled with the inconsistent volume levels and disappointing charging experience, I would recommend skipping this particular model in favor of other options from JBL’s lineup. There are certainly better alternatives that provide both the comfort and audio quality that JBL is known for."
"Bought mine 2 months ago, takes some breaking in. Several bad parts:Battery of case dies rlly easilyBluetooth sometimes cuts out and glitches; seems the chips were the cheapestBad microphone for calls"
"Bass is good for earbuds but I CAN NOT STAND how the earbuds, especially the right one is always falling out of my ear. Didn’t have this problem with apple ones."
"I bought this product because of its low price.  hey, it works.  i can have a phone conversation with noise around me and we both can be heard ok.  It's lightweight, charges fast, has a decent battery life and its very similar to other earbuds in the market.they dont fit snugly in the ear.  even when changing the plastic covers to fit your ear.  it will fall out if you're moving (even walking).  its very sensitive to the touch.  this will trigger the earbud to play music, make a phone call, answer a phone call without you noticing it.  when pulling it out of the charging box its not as easy to take out as other brands.  same thing when putting them away.  if you dont put it in exactly the way it fits, itll give you some problem.overall, its a decent earbud thats cheap and it gets the job done.  but its limited to its use and ease of use.  soo for $30 its an ok buy."
Like with many fine instruments  like you need to take the time to tune these phones in Read the review of a professional dude he'll walk you through every step of the way and even has diagrams and graphs for the nerds I dident not just say that(; like the sound is  killer thay have Bookoo Bass I'm really stoked with my purchase I can recommend themenjoy the tunes Bro's:}PS don't forget to download the app peace
"The audio quality is decent. the battery life: also decent. Not super long but enough.I do have a couple issues. The finish on the white earbuds case is sort of matte and looks dirty very quickly, especially if you carry them in your purse with other things.Also! occasionally the audio will start crackling and then only go into one of the earbuds or start sounding like a weird robot. If I put the earbuds back in the case and then take them out again it fixes the issue. This happens when connected to my iPhone when I'm listening to music or in a Zoom call. Unfortunately this issue happens even when the earbuds are fully charged and sitting right next to the device they are connected to.Overall, 3 stars. They're cheap so I guess you get what you pay for."
"If you adjust the EQ quite a bit these sound almost as good as the $10 corded earbuds I buy from a common retailer.  But to get that you really have to cram these into your ear canal for a good seal which I found painful wth these.  These do NOT have rich or deep bass, and I couldn't get the volume adjustment to work other than increasing volume (not reducing it).  You CAN take much of the grating tin out of the sound, but these do not have a definition and field clarity of the el cheapo corded buds pictured here alongside the JBLsI bought these because they were A)JBL, and B) on sale.  I saw a detailed glowing review on here by someone who claimed to be a sound engineer.  Guess what?  I am too!  And I will probably return these because they sound harsh and flat.  If you have to spend $200+ to get good sound from earbuds I will probbaly stick with corded."
Seems like the microphones have issues. I can hear great using these but whenever someone calls me they have a really hard time hearing me. Not recommended for phone calls.
Heavy on the base but can be adjusted through JBL app. Not user friendly and the ergonomics of taking the earbuds in and out the case is cheeks.
I drop at least one of them every time I remove it from the case; no market research?  Look at the design; no way to grip them to get them out! The lid prevents easy access as well.No bass at all.  Having a bass setting in the EQ is rather amusing and totally useless; bass requires resonant space which these don't have.  Excellent choice for audio books though.  Just not much for low frequency sound effects.
"My expectations for bluetooth earbuds is really low, but even with that, these are disappointing to me.Pros: Build quality is good.  Connectivity is reliable.Cons: 'Deep Bass' description is nowhere close to accurate.My biggest issue is the case.  I somehow don't feel quite right about reviewing the case versus the actual headphones, but since it is an integral part to the earbuds I felt obligated to mention it.  If you have medium to large hands and fingers, I would not buy these earbuds.  The lid does not open far enough get a firm grip on the earbuds when removing them from the case.  I am irritated every time I try to pull the earbuds out of the case. The lid needs to open to 180 deg instead of just 90 deg."
"The sound quality isn’t the best and they look/feel cheap, which I guess for the price makes sense. The bass is extremely low in comparison to my Airpods and even with setting changes in the app it’s still not all that great. The battery life seems to be decent and these connected to my iPhone just fine, but I would not recommend if you actually want to feel immersed in your music."
"Great sound and quality, but they continuously fall out if using for talking even after trying different ear pieces it comes with. Charging is great. Water resistant - well, they did go through the wash a few times and survived. Would love to have the option to put a ear hook on them to use while mowing/working out so they don't fall out as easily."
"Tried to replace the rubber portion of the earbud but only 3 pcs are included.  Battery life is not as long as my raycons. After 2 hrs of listening to music it was already at 50% battery life. The controls are sensitive and only need a quick touch. Sound is good, however I'm sure it would be better if i had the correct size earpiece."
"I got these on sale for $20. I would say they are worth $20, but not a penny more. Sound quality is in and out. Sometimes they echo and you have to pause and resume to get them synced up. Button response works about 50% of the time.  Everything about them is just a little off. But I would say worth the $20"
"I love the JBL brand. Their sound quality is great but they feel like they’re going to fall out of my ears. I’m an Apple girl and these remind me of the Apple AirPods Pro. They do not fit in my ears and fell out, so I wanted to give JBL a try. If you had AirPod Pro issues, these will be same."
"Decent sound, great battery life, but won’t stay in my ears when I’m active. It comes with different size fittings for the ear, but they’re not very different and none worked well for me unless I’m just sitting. **Unfortunately standard replacement ear pieces don’t fit onto the earbuds so you can’t replace them with ones that work better for you."
"I only buy JBL headphones because to me,  their sound is always quality.  These ones, in my opinion are not that great.  There is an option for ""extreme bass"" and it just sounds very loud with low sound quality. They are also a little difficult to get out of the case."
Let me start out battery life is ok does not last as long as my no name brand from China. Quality just as good as the cheap one. Sound is the worst one i have ever bought from a name brand. The only good thing it does have over other cheap one is noise cancelation.
"These don't fit my ears -- they fall right out.  The sound quality is very disappointing because they are not in my ear enough.  If I hold them tight to my ears, I finally get some bass.  Still giving three stars because they'd be a good deal if they fit."
"I have had airpods for maybe 5 years or so and really, really wanted to like these JBLs. I used them a couple times and tried switching out the earbud tips to different sizes, but no matter what I tried, they fell out of my ears. Bummer. Back to airpods it is I guess...."
"It was fine for the first couple days. Downloaded the app as well. But for some reason, it started having trouble connecting to my phone. I'd reset it. Make sure everything is on, fully charged. Nothing. It would pop up when looking for the device, but cannot get it to connect again."
"I dislike the case and ear pieces. Placing the ear buds in the case you fight to place each bud in the slot, the ear piece are too big the sizes offered are not accommodating lastly will not stay in the ear. Sound quality is excellent."
Extremely to soft for listening to music. No way to make louder.
"I think they come out a bit too much for reason, but they do come with different size ear pieces so you can change them to fit your ear (i did that but they still are a bit loose). they connect quickly and they do not disconnect. battery life seems to be pretty good. also they are sleek and very light so that’s good! on top of everything they have basically all the features airpods have with the tapping on them and responding to texts and stuff with siri, all for a fraction of the price."
"Audio quality is sooo good. I have never had earbuds that has true bass, like it is super bassy but my problem is the tail is too fat it never sits in the contour of my small ears, and they pop off, always looking like it's floating, no matter how much I push it in, it keeps bouncing back up and while I'm working, eventually they fall to the ground. The tail needs to be longer and thinner or something. But the design is for people with big ears. If ur ears are small, forget about it. I mean if u don't need to move around it's ok"
I had JBL earbuds before but thise had an option to use rubber ear piece that made it stay in-ear this one came without it and it falls off even when I wear them while eating.
They continue to fall out of my ears. I’m very disappointed.
Not a good choice for hearing aid wearers.
"I changed the ear adapters and there is a lot of inference from external noise, the sound of the music is lost a lot due to the outside noise and they fall out easily."
"Half the time it doesn't pair. But maybe it is user error. But if i can't figure it out from Internet and you tube videos, that's annoying. My Google buds pair without fail."
"I thought these would be much more comfy to wear and higher quality.  Disappointed on both.  They keep falling out and they hurt my ears.  Live and learn, I guess."
"I also have problems with these not fitting my ears well, but the biggest problem I have is that the earbuds will not disconnect from my phone when I put them in their case. My phone will ring, and the sound automatically redirects to the buds... while they're in the case. The only sure-fire way to disconnect is to shut off the Bluetooth on my phone. Seems like a bad design to me!I find the sound quality to be fine."
"They sound great.  I tried each of the different sized ear pieces and none worked for me.  If only they stayed in my ears, I would love them."
"I've purchased a number of JBL products - speakers, over the ear headphones and always been happy.  These earbuds though... I don't know where the deep bass is... Sound overall is tinny.  I've tried to size them to my ears properly and they just didn't seem to fit well.  I've gotten much better quality from classic Tozo T10 earbuds which are under $20.  I wanted something more slender though to fit under my motorcycle helmet."
"I expected more from a company such as JBL but at the same time for that price range you get what, well.....this. First of all earbuds are very slippery and therefore almost impossible to be grabbed out of the case without accidental drop on the floor. Secondly, they dont stay well put in your ear and constantly fall out. Third, they have issues with connectivity - lost connections or L vs R delay is a regular thing. I have had better experience with cheap $20 no name earbuds. Also what it says that it allows you to play it for 8 hrs with another 24hrs of energy stored in the case is BS. If you use them for 2hrs and then put then in the case they will suck the power from the case to the point that after doing this 5 times in a row there will be nothing left and you will have to plug it in. For good is the app. It has EQ and it works with every sound source either it is radio YT or podcasts or your own music. You may even turn them off from app level but you cannot turn them back on unless by putting them back to the case and out of the case again. Also they work kinda like noise cancelling - they can either bypass environmental noise thru built in mic or stay completely ""def"" to the outside noise. Sound is decent but you have to sit and not move otherwise you will hear you own heartbeat and you body movement. Or they simply pop out, and changing silicone tips doesnt really help."
"Sound quality is meh. They fit in my ears very poorly, and have a slight tendency to slide out of your ears every now and then. Especially for someone like me with oddly shapped ears, it is a bit of a hassle to find good fitting earbuds. I will give it to JBL that for this price point they did a really good job with their in-app features and very responsive touch control technology. Bass is pretty good, but vocals are very quiet. Build quality is very good, and case is decent. I like how accessible and easy they make it to access the equalizer for these. Comes with multiple presets and other ""ambient aware"" features, which is essentially just the microphone playing back to you while your music plays in the background. These dont have noise cancelling, so keeo that in mind. If you don't really care about theae things having some poor balance and latency, along with okay, comfortability then go for it. Personally I would recommend  just spending double the amount and get better earbuds from soundcore. Anker sells some really affordable earbuds with great noise cancelling for just $50 more. I know majlrity of people don't want to spend the extra mile trying to get something twice the price, but in trlling you it's worth investing into. Especially if your an audiophile like me"
"If you want dependable earbuds, these will do the trick.  The tap controls are a little bit wonky but overall they have good battery life and decent sound."
The sound quality and feel is great as you’d expect from JBL but it has a problem slipping out the ears for me even after trying all the size
"The audio quality is good most of the time - the enhancement settings do not work if you wear these while running (sounds static-y from the wind).The outer edges are fairly uncomfortable/rigid, too. I found that more than 30 minutes and my ears hurt.I would pony up and purchase the AirPods if I could do it again…but if you need a quick cheap option these aren’t the worst."
"I lost my airpods, looking for replacements, I've always been happy with JBL stuff over the years (awesome vintage L-250 in my listening room!), so at less than half the price, I thought I'd give a try. First impression, I was not overwhelmed by the audio. Downloaded the JBL App, the EQ settings helped a bit, but still tinny in the mid/highs, and the bass does not punch. Overall acceptable sound, not amazing.My biggest issue is just getting them out of the case. They are, for me, difficult to get a pinch on them an pull out. Yes, I have stubby old fingers, but other brands seem much easier. I think the square 'shafts' are the problem. Other brands, I would kind of push, the bud wouldspiral' it's way up and out. These will not rotate, and as I say, not easy to grab.So overall, kinda ""meh"", they'll do for now."
Works until it doesn’t. Is not sweat proof and will mess up when wet. Earphones to use until you get better ones.
"I specifically got these because they hype up the “customizability” of the touch controls. But it turns out they are not truly customizable. There are a few presets that you can choose between, but you can’t decide what each tap/double tap does individually. Very disappointed, and this is the 2nd pair of JBL earbuds I’ve been disappointed in due to the counterintuitive controls. Won’t be buying JBL again."
"** So, my first review on these, I said they sounded bad and had low volume. I have since found a setting on the iPhone that is a slider for “reduce loud sounds.” My new AirPods did not have good volume until I turned that feature off. Now I wonder if these earbuds would have been better had I known about that feature being on , check it first **."
"I was looking to get a new pair of AirPods, as I’m still on the first generation and they’re starting to die out. I found these and am on a budget so decided to try them instead. I really like them, they work just as well as my AirPods and that’s all I cared about! I also like that there’s different earbud sizes, so they fit in my ear better, my AirPods always fell out but these feel more secure. They also come in cute colors, I got the mint and they definitely look more blue than green but that’s okay. Tapping on the side to pause/skip also works way better than my AirPods ever did. I have no reason to not like these so far!Edited: I finally wore these to the office and the sound quality is not as great as I had originally thought, it was almost distracting, I definitely noticed a difference vs my AirPods. I think these would be great for kids or as a workout headphone but not for an everyday headphone."
"JBL is a decent brand with good sound at this pricepoint. But the earbud only fit into the case in a very specific way which makes them hard to put away. Plus the lid gets in the way of your fingers so they are also difficult to remove from the case. Not a great example of user friendly design, but they do the job."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The packaging was ok and the item arrived timely. The sound quality works great but the left earphone falls off quickly. I was hoping to use both earphones but it doesn’t stay intact so I couldn’t use it when moving / walking or running. I wish I could’ve returned it just in time. The battery life is surprisingly fine.
"The battery on these last longer than my last headphones. However, they do not fit well in my ears and  constantly adjusting. If I eat while wearing them or move around at all, they get loose and then I have to push back into my ear. After a short while, they make my ears sore to wear. Sound quality is good."
"Sounds good and battery last long, but my right earbud won’t stay in. I tried all of the tips even."
Con - hard to remove ear pods from case.  My fingers can’t grab these very well so I often drop them on the ground.Con - the sound is good if you get them seated a certain way in your ear but I find that they don’t sit in that position very long during a cardio workout.Con - the ear cushions are only two sizes but they give your three pair.  None of them feel real good but I have learned to live with the largest size.Pro - costPro - battery lifePro - voice aware.  You can hear yourself talk while on callsPro - audio limit optionPro - EQ function
"The sound quality for the price is really good. However, I keep finding that they don’t stay in the ear very well no matter what size cover I put on. I’ve even ordered the foam covers not much better. Also, it’s really hard to get the earbuds out of the case the cover doesn’t open wide enough."
"This was my first purchase of wireless earbuds.  I have trouble with the hard plastic construction.  They do not fit as comfortably as I had hoped.  I love the storage container they come in.  None the less, I have been using them for listening to my soothing Bedtime Stories ap."
Sometimes charge is not enough work great when fully charged n are working just fine
"I have only had these a few weeks, and they seem like good quality and sound quality is fine as well. Only trouble I have is they are hard to remove from case. I have dropped them often as I can't get a grip on the bud as I pull from the case."
I guess they are ok for the price point. Trouble getting out of the case.
First thing I noticed was the cheap build quality. The material and finish makes it very difficult to grip the earbuds. I find myself unable to get them out and dropping them a lot. The design of the case is not great either making it difficult to even get my fingers to grip the earbuds. Not a fan. You get what you pay for.The sound is okay. I've had better and worse. The app doesn't recognize the earbuds 50% of the time and I have to reset them to gain access to the settings.My recommendation is to spend the money on a better pair or earbuds.
"Love them ,although you have to push them in your ear every time you talk"
"I will start with positives: for $25 on sale you won't care if you lose them one dayNegatives:1. When only one bud is inuse the sound is horrible and is like coming from a tin can2. Yes, they fall out from the ears. This is the first ever in-ear headphones that have this problem.3. Absolutely low brow design of the case with respect to orientation of the phones inside. ALL earbuds are situated to have their tips facing INSIDE the case (towards the middle). These are made to be opposite: tips are facing OUTWARD the case. As the result there's no easy way to pull the earbuds out of the case without dropping them. And you have to turn each bud around before inserting into your ear. I have a slender fingers and yet there's no way to work around this problem.Looks for a better deal."
"I've purchased a dozen pairs of earbuds. Various prices and qualities.This was the first name brand (JBL) pair I've purchased the rest have been cheap, with the expectation that their life cycle would be short lived. I've had these about 4 days and the audio seems to cut out and pause videos like it is interpreting any movement as physical input to pause or lower the volume. Which is irrelevant when it seemingly cuts audio for no discernable reason.The product itself won't let you comment via Bluetooth without a Google account.  That's the worst part in my opinion"
"I was at first really happy with the control features and feel of these. Some earbuds you have to tap so hard it hurts your ears and the controls aren’t customizable, so that was all great.Unfortunately when I went to use the product at my gym, the audio kept cutting out and the noise cancelling wasn’t good enough tune out the gym’s music without turning my music way up, which is surprising because that’s not an issue I’ve have with ear buds.I opted to return them, but if you’re just needing these for home use, they may be fine."
Id give this a ten star if not for the connection issues 😔. Seems to be ok at times other times connects n disconnect. Awesome sound it's good in your ear everything else is good about it fast charging just the connection problem
"Bought in November and they no longer charge! I highly highly recommend these because of the price/quality, but just know you'll most likely need to repurchase every year. I wish they had lasted longer, 10 months and they died."
"It has a good clear sound but they are very touch sensitive so if something were to brush against the earpod, it would change the volume, stop playing, or go to the next track. Gets annoying and wouldn't get again."
Not good for running really bad connection after six months.
"Nice set of earbuds,  sound awesome, battery life good, but earbuds cushion size is too small or too big for my ear canal that doesn't stayed in place, more when I working on my garden, easily fall off."
I usually get the generic ugly green ones that several vendors sell and they stay charged for 3-5 yard mows. These I grabbed for second mow and they were dead!! Returned and ordered the cheap generic green ones.
"JBL is a well-known company with a positive reputation, but these ear buds are not good.Reasons:1. Although they paired readily with my iPhone 12 Pro Max, these ear buds always drop connection when I am on phone calls, making them useless for phone conversations.2. JBL claims they have great sound with deep bass, but even with their app equalizer turned up for bass, the sound is thin and tinny.  I find them adequate for spoken-word (podcasts and audio books) but not for music, not at all.3. It's hard to get them out of their case.  Poor ergonomic engineering makes it a hassle to pick them out of the nesting indentations, which although it is a small point, is an irritation over hundreds of uses.My strong recommendation is to look elsewhere.  For example, I have had excellent results from the Soundcore by Anker P20i true wireless ear buds, which are at about the same price point as this JBL set.  If you don't need sound cancellation, the Soundcore is a much better buy."
"Jbl earbuds are not good.  Love their bt speakers. Own an extreme 3, 2 partybox 110s, and a few go's. All fantastic. One of the gos is at the bottom of my local river and still rocking out probably. Their earbuds however, are not reliable and will fail prematurely.  Its very frustrating.  Have had 2 pairs of the 230ncs and both were unusable in less than a year.  We will see about these. But hey, they are cheapish and we like the name brand in our ear."
"The audio does sound really good and so does the base. The only problem is that the audio isn’t synced for videos. I’ve reset the earbuds and everything, there is just a delay in the sound."
"If they stayed in my ears, I'd give them 5 stars. Love the sound quality, and their features, but now stuck trying to figure out how I can keep them in, and continue using."
"These earbuds are definitely not the JBL quality I expected and have gotten from their products in the past. The sound quality is horrible. It’s tinny, soft, lacks base and they are not meant for an environment other than sitting on a couch. The slightest external noise like distant highway traffic while walking in the park drowns out the feeble sound output.  Also, they are very difficult to pull out of the charging case as they are so smooth and packed so tightly into the case that I can’t get a grip to pull them out. The hinged top cover only opens 90° making it a fumbling chore to pull them out. I think the CEO of JBL should have to try their products before releasing them on the market.I currently have a pair of BOSE earbuds which are fantastic, I bought these as a back up but I’m returning them today.  The name JBL used to be synonymous with quality but no longer.  They are pretty to look at, but form does not follow function here."
"Got these earbuds and was pumped because I really like my small speaker by JBL and loved the mint color. However, I'm kinda disappointed by the earbuds.I noticed almost immediately that there's a delay in the audio when watching videos. I like to listen to videos while doing chores or lounging around and the delay is very annoying. I've read that downloading the app and playing with the settings will help, but who the hell wants to download ANOTHER app on top of the hundreds other companies want you to use? I shouldn't need an app for my earbuds to function properly. I also feel like I have to adjust them in my ears often to get full sound, although I need to play around with the earbud sizes to make sure that's not the problem.I will say that the battery life is really good as I only need to charge them a couple times a week. The case is durable and they sit comfortably in my ears for prolonged periods of time.TL;DR: stick to their speakers for now as these just aren't worth the price."
"Yes, I am knocking two stars for the frustrating case design.  The lid interferes with the removal of the earbuds, which causes me to drop one every so often."
"Were it not for the immediately-defective charge maintenance situation I've already encountered on day two of having this otherwise awesome product, it would totally be getting a full five stars. I don't know how common this flaw is. Maybe I simply got a bad earbud or a bad charging case, but my right earbud is dying a lot faster than the left one when both are in use, and possibly it just dies fast in general. I'm running a couple of experiments to see if I will need to try returning/replacing these. I'm hoping this issue will resolve itself or a new pair will behave correctly. I should be getting at least a few hours out of a full charge using active noise cancellation, but so far, a fully-charged right earbud barely lasts maybe two hours and then dies, leaving the left one with plenty of charge left.This strange issue aside, the different noise cancellation modes are awesome! I was able to walk around my house and interact with people with both earbuds in. You can't be playing music and manage to talk with someone, even in transparency mode. The outside noise has to be loud enough to overcome what's playing in your ears, if anything.The app you can get to configure/control the earbuds could use some accessibility improvements for Voiceover users, but it is quite useable for the most part. It took some experimenting to figure out what some of the different tones and beeps mean. If there's a way to switch the buds to voice prompts/notifications for things like low battery, for example, I haven't been able to figure that out yet. They do say ""ANC off"" when you tripple-tap the left bud to switch to normal (non-noise-cancelling mode), so that's helpful.It would be helpful if either the app, iOS, or the earbuds themselves provided an easy way to query the individual buds' battery life remaining. Turning one bud off and checking the batteries info on my home screen does seem to kind of work. I'm blind, so the most efficient strategy for determining the charge on my earbuds is to ask for sighted assistance with the digital display on the charging case.Speaking of charging, I would advise having snug or not smooth pockets for carrying the charge case around. It's kind of smooth in texture, so if you're paranoid about losing it, carry it in a pouch or zippered pocket when out and about.Anyway, as I've said, I would absolutely love to give these their full five stars. The sound quality is excellent, as some other reviews have said. They pack good audio punch for such small pieces of technology! Assuming my issue with this particular set is just a fluke and other ones workperfectly for other people, I would highly recommend them. They stay snugly in place, so if you're doing something active like walking or working out, you need have no fear they will loosen or fall out of your ears. Just be sure to take the time to figure out which eartips fit you best.I will add before I forget that when I first paired the earbuds, the app said there was a firmware update, so maybe that update contributed to the battery life issue somehow. Is the case updateable? Did somehow only one earbud get the firmware? This wonkiness aside, awesome pair of earbuds so far. I hope others are having better luck than I am with the battery life."
"TOZO NC9 earbuds have been around for a while (2021?), and are well-rated and have accessories available like case covers. This earbuds model comes in a box labeled ""NC9"", has ""NC9"" on the inside of the case alongside a Model number of T11124, and registers in the Android App and in Bluetooth as ""NC9"". But these earbuds are different from the popularly seen NC9 model (also listed on Amazon), have a noticeably different shaped case (with e.g. battery charge percentage displayed, unlike the old model which only showed battery charge with 4 white leds) and a different feature set.Tozo's own website doesn't call this model NC9 at all, it lists them as ""Tozo AeroSound"". Has the ANC been optimized for airplane use? The manual and website doesn't mention this if so. The Tozo website claims that these earbuds have IPX6 water resistance, and then lower down the page, IPX8. (And Amazon lists both specs as well.) Which is true? (The difference is, IPX8 can survive a run through the washing machine, while IPX6 can survive heavy rain but not total immersion. I haven't tested mine.)So if you thought you were buying NC9 earbuds, what do you actually get? ANC seems to work ok, although there are ANC modes which are only accessible in the phone app and are otherwise undocumented. (What is leisure mode?) There's a low-latency mode you can turn on for better sync with video for TV watching or gaming, but it's unclear why this mode is optional -- is there a trade-off involved in terms of sound quality or battery life? The documentation doesn't say. (The documentation is written in broken English. In the era of free high quality translation software, it's difficult to understand how this happened.)No wireless charging, unlike the older popular NC9 model which you thought you were buying. The earbuds can't connect to two devices at the same time, unlike their manufacturer's HT2 headphones. And the case is a different size and shape with no silicone case covers available yet.Or at least, that's what the model I received had.  Until Tozo sorts out their product naming and identification, who knows whether the device that ships to you will be the same? Will any of the reviews here even be talking about the same device as you receive? Fix this, Tozo, so your customers can understand what they are buying."
"When I ordered them I was in the market for a electric Bluetooth shooting earbud. I really like how there are multiple sets of foam for different size ears. I used the small and they fit nice and seemed comfortable for the few hours I wore them. After charging them over night I downloaded and sync the app. App it very easy to use and has a lot of different set up options. I am mainly looking to use them for shooting skeet so I have hearing protection but can still hear my buddies talk in between shots. They do have a noise canceling mode which works great, only problem is it's all the time. On the normal mode you can hear people talk but it doesn't seem to muffle the gun shots out. There is a delay so they don't get quiet fast enough.SummaryThe pair with Bluetooth very easyMusic sound is very niceFull noise canceling works wellNOT for hearing protection for guns"
"This is the newest version of the Tozo NC9.The sound quality is decent, I have no complaints despite enjoying a wide variety of audio equipment. I can only knock the sound for it's sharper treble and -3DB EQ after 2KHz did the trick. Overall you should expect a V-shaped sound (extra bass and treble) that has reasonable technical performance. This won't touch wired IEMs for the same price but for what it's worth, it's good enough. Different use cases anyway.As for features, the ANC is very good for lower frequencies but high frequencies like a faucet running will still be clearly audible (typical for ANC tech). Low fan noise is almost completely eliminated. Touch controls are easy to execute and responsive. Battery life is around 4 - 5 hours with ANC off, expect very short battery life with ANC and Transparency mode usage. Speaking of, Transparency Mode is surprisingly clear.The package contains a wide range of eartip sizes, but you may want to look for different eartips entirely if they aren't secure enough for you. If you need new eartips, look for more compact ones so the earbuds fit in the case. The stem of the earphone nozzle is shorter than in ear monitors and a bit small in diameter. Remember that if you need to buy different eartips.An underrated concern with wireless headphones in general is the volume gradations. It's super irritating when you can't find the perfect volume as one click is barely too loud, and a click down is too quiet. This isn't a problem with the Tozo NC9's.Fitment in my ears is good. Once I found the correct eartip size for my ears, they won't come out unless I want them to. Good comfort.In summary, I believe this is a good all-rounder for my personal needs especially for the price. I can't comment on workout usage or call quality. Video reviews typically cover those aspects better. As with any headphone or earphones, your experience will vary to some degree whether that be sound preference and how it fits you.EDIT: I've been having reliability issues for a couple weeks and updated the firmware to no avail. I can hear the DSP take a second to kick in when a video starts, sometimes causing audio to sound very weird. 1/5 the times I use it, the audio drops out completely or only one side works. The stereo balance shifts around when it shouldn't. Today the earbuds SCREAMED in my ears when I turned on ANC, that really hurt!While these are good for the money, the reliability problems with my pair is a huge concern and I may try getting a refund. If your Tozo earbuds have none of these issues after a few weeks, you're hopefully in the clear. Unfortunately my experience has differed. Tozo, please address this if you can. I'm not sure if it's a hardware or firmware issue, it's very strange and unacceptable to happen."
"The sound is clear, but the bass could be better. They are compact and I like the case. The app and features are great. The deal-breaker is they keep seperating from each other. The right earbud will start to sound like you're in a huge open room and the the left earbud will lag way behind. You'll hear a small pop, then they go back to normal. This happen about every 70 seconds. I messed up when I gave my other Tozo earbuds to my wife. They weren't as compact and the case wasn't as good. But they didn't has this error. Even after updating, this still happens."
"This is my second NC9 and I've used them extensively over the last couple of years, and like them so much I bought the new version.  A feature I like on the earlier version of the NC9 is it provides an audio voice announcement of the mode it's in, e.g. it says ""ANC On"" and ""ANC off"" and ""Transparent Mode"".  These new ones don't do that.  I asked TOZO if I could change this to get the mode voice announcement and apparently, the new ones are not capable of this feature.  Here's the reply from TOZO: ""Dear Customer, This is Elva from TOZO. Thank you for reaching out today and for being a valued TOZO customer. The mode of the prompt cannot be changed. Could you provide the order number? And If we have other giveaways in the future,we will contact you,is that ok? Here at TOZO, we value customer satisfaction above all else. My service will remain readily available to answer any questions. I wish you and your family good health and the best of luck in your endeavors. Warm Regards, Elva"""
"Pros:- Small and convenient case- Easy pairing and long battery life- Would do well in the gym. Won't slip out of your ears- Best for podcastsCons:- Bass is almost non-existent- Did not pass the train/subway test. Audio was barely listenableI'd get these if you want to give them to your kids or teenager. Then you know they can't tune you out. But beyond that, don't expect to tune out the world with these."
"The earphones deliver great sound, and with the app it is even better, The noise canceling function works way better than I expected. But when the battery level gets to about 50%, the left bud emits a very loud screech into your ear - at full volume - and will only stop if you deactivate the noise canceling, or recharge them. Wish there was a way to fix this, and that would make them perfect."
"I have a pair of TOZO T6 from 2022 that I love, but they have the old micro-USB charging port so I was looking for something newer with a USB-C port compatible with the rest of my devices.The sound quality is the same, but the NC9 don't fit as well as the T6 in my large ears so I'm going to look for a newer version of the T6."
"I bought these to replace a pair of earbuds from another vendor that I liked very much but lost, and so was in a hurry to get a new pair. I bought these Tozo NC9s and made a huge mistake in not sending these back in the 30 day Amazon return window.Battery life was so bad on my first pair that the seller offered to send me a new pair, and that is to Tozo's credit, but unfortunately, the replacement pair are just as bad. Worse, while there are many similar points of failure in both versions I received, there are bizarre differences in failure which suggests design, manufacturing and quality control are all broken.Minuses on both pairs:Battery life is abysmal. Earbuds hold charge for perhaps 5 hours of playtime and the charging case can barely recharge the earbuds twice, often less, so total playback time is far, far worse than what is claimed.The earbuds do not automatically shut off when disconnected or unused, so if you do not put them back in their charging case they will continue to discharge.The physical design of the earbuds somehow makes them wind amplifiers! There is a wind noise reduction setting in the Tozo app, which helps, but I've never experienced physical wind noise like this with buds.Sound quality without adjusting equalizer settings is quite tinny. There are a lot equalizer adjustments available in the app, and you will need to use them.NC is minimal (which is not surprising at this price point), but the NC setting appears mostly to amp the bass response.....so can be helpful in adjusting for the tinniness mentioned above.Minuses on only one pair:The buds do not remember the volume setting you used previously and reset themselves to minimum volume if put back in charging case, so you have to hold your finger on the right bud for quite a while to adjust bud volume (and this is independent of your phone's volume setting). (The other pair seems to have a memory and don't have this problem....).Positives on both pairs:Microphone seems to work quite well. Calls go through clearly, which is a rarity on budget buds.Customer service does respond to concerns....slowly, but still they do respond.End result...I've bought a pair of CMF Buds Wireless Earbuds (at similar price point) to use, and keep the Tozo NC9s as emergency backup in a computer bag. I've looked at other Tozo bud reviews, and overall they get good marks. These NC9s appear to be an exception, and are simply not ready for market. Look elsewhere."
I'm a bass head. I like the thump and it's just not there. The sound is too high on the treble. Even after adjusting the EQ I still can't get into the sound. These are perfect for people who like high treble and little bass. I will be returning these though.
"Somewhat puzzled by all the great reviews.  I find that even with the bass EQ moved all the way up, these are just mediocre quality earbuds for music listening.  Likewise, the comfort/fit is much the same as other earbuds I have used.  I did not want or expect overwhelming thumping sound and feel like these are worth the asking price but nothing special.  Getting registered was an annoying process too with the code timing out very quickly and needing to get several other codes before it worked."
"Bought 2 different earbuds (these ones and Soundcore Anker Life P2 Mini) to try out for wind noise while riding bike. These ones handled noise better while I was stationary, but as soon as I started moving and the wind picked up, the wind noise actually sounded louder than it should've been - sounded like it removed some of it, but whatever was leaking through was actually attenuated, it sounded more high-pitched than just regular wind noise. Still will keep it for the passive non-wind use, but not for running/riding."
"I really do like the sound of these earbuds but from time to time they cut out, click out.  Never had this issue with blue tooth before."
"In the past four years, I've been on a quest to find the perfect earbuds. Not wanting to spend hundreds of dollars on top-of-the-line buds. I have settled on the middle of the road cost of earbuds ($50 to $300) range. What I've found is most buds don't fit inside my ears or the biggest issue is extremely low sound quality. These Tozo earbuds fit PERFECTLY inside my ears but fail in the volume. Many of these manufacturers have reduced the level of the sound. I like my sound all the way up and loud. Give me the choice in lowering the sound and stop taking that choice away from the customers."
"******Note: I used to own NC9 previous  version but lost the wireless charging caseBeware - You can not change the bud case via wireless charging that nearly everything is capable of this days. It is only chargeable through USB-C. Whereas the previous version of NC 9 is capable of this simple task. I may be returning it for the aforementioned reason. Other than that, the performance is great. Just like everyone else has mentioned."
"My older version of these same headphones are better.  Even at full volume, these are too quiet."
"I have a few sets, and the reviews were favorable.  I like the brands SoundP...s, & Soundc..."
"Great for office work, not for the gym. Volume isn't very loud. Maybe a 6/10."
"I like the details and features, but functionality takes some concentration to learn. The bass is amazing, but volume is so-so. Noise-cancellation is good. I still have to master the controls. It might be better than I have figured out, but based on how I use it, I’d say it’s OK."
"anc is pretty good, not clear with sounds"
Not impressed with how clear these are for 30$ And the battery life is about 8-10 hours
"I bought these specifically for transparency mode to be able to hear the outside, but you need to have both earbuds out the case for them to work, Sometimes you just want ONE earbud in"
I was done with these 5 mins after setup.  I gotta stop believing these YouTubers..  You get what you paid for.
These might be some decent wireless earbuds if they connected half the time.  Both earbuds out of the case and on and still won't connect. This defeats the whole purpose of the ANC of this device..Definitely won't be buying this brand again
"As a owner of other TOZO ear buds, including the NC7, these were very disappointing and returned.  The two big items that were cons were the noise canceling and the battery life.When using the NC, I honesty could not tell the difference between NC and without the NC, which made me thing maybe I received a bad set of ear buds.  The NC difference between the NC9 and older NC7 models was huge.The other issue was the battery life.  I would use the ear buds for 2 hours in the morning and the battery was down to 50%.  The advertised battery life is ~10 hours, so again maybe I received a bad set of ear buds.Hopefully TOZO can fix the performance issues with these ear buds with a firmware update, but for now I will return these for a refund and keep using my old NC7s."
"So one of the review said it was better than the AirPod pro, are you kidding me right?!.  I had an AirPod Pro that I accidentally broke by dropping it and running it over with my bike.  I couldn’t afford to buy another AirPod pro so decided to get something cheaper and these had good reviews, big mistake.  Noise cancellation is okay and it had to be turned on using their app.  You can either block out noise or wind, can’t do both at the same time and again, only can be done through their app.  Sound quality is okay, but again, can only adjust EQ through app.  Battery life is okay again not great like described.  Overall, if I didn’t only paid 35 bucks for it, I would not definitely pay more.  Saving up to buy an AirPod Pro again."
"Initially worked great just like intended, however, just after a few weeks one said got quite and would buzz loudly until put back into the case. About a week after that the other side started to do the same and now it all just seems to be failing, one side the screen to the speakers started to try and fall off. I could have just gotten some dud. But, currently has failed to perform its task with any longevity. Now I can barely hear either side in the locations where there is the same amount of noise as before."
This has been a truly awful experience my headset from the moment I paired it and placed it in my ear the left bud will turn the music or whatever you're listening to down until as it is zero and then it will continue to try to turn it down so it beeps every half second. It will do this in ear or just laying on the cabinet top I have reset cleared cache uninstalled the app restarted phone charged everything fully literally everything that tozo and all the online forums suggest to do and nothing has worked this unfortunately is just a product of cheap quality which is also had cheap quality control and standards budgeted Within obviously you have to cut corners somewhere to put out a nice featured headset that will compete with the big boys at a fraction of the cost which it's obvious they cut several corners here. And if the poorly constructed earbuds weren't bad enough the customer service of the tozo team is almost literally non-existent as I have sent five different emails through four different channels trying to get a hold of somebody to no avail other than one rep not reading my concern and simply offering a 60% refund then never asking an address and name an order number or any other pertinent information you would need to credit me. I'm just glad I'm still well within my warranty. I will be returning these and going with a different brand I can't believe these have such good reviews and tozo as a whole such good reviews on all their products strange but to each their own.
"I was excited about this, since my last pair of Tozos lasted three years before the connection in the left earpiece started going. No big deal...$15 for three good years.This new pair, however, had a shorter range than the previous ones, and had more connection problems at places like the gym with other Bluetooth devices. Worst of all, its battery life is nowhere near advertised. Maybe I just got a defective pair 'cause everyone else seems to like them, but I was disappointed"
"While these earbuds offer decent sound quality, they struggle with wind noise even when the ANC is on. Calls outdoors pick up too much background noise, making it hard to hear clearly. The waterproof feature is a plus, but the noise-canceling doesn’t hold up well against wind, which is disappointing for outdoor use.Not ideal for those needing reliable noise cancelation."
I had really high hopes for these. The charge doesn’t last long at all. Volume doesn’t go that high. And they don’t stay in my ear very well. The sound quality is pretty good but I’ve had better luck with other ear buds.
"As an iPhone user never had issues when pairing to any bluetooth device, but these earbuds are just a headache when trying to connect, even when is connected it just sounds like my phone is so many feet away and they’re loosing connection, real sound is just robotic. Other than that they sound pretty good and have great noise canceling for what you paid."
"DON'T GET FOOLED BY GOOD REVIEWS. I read a lot of good things about the NC9s before going ahead buying them, and since NC9s seemed to have a good reputation I went for them after watching a couple of reviews. But these might not be what you think they are. When I started testing them something just felt off. Bass is very good but mid and high frequencies sound veery very cheap (specially mid frequencies). Also, you can't pair these to more than one device which is kind of annoying and there is no wireless charging unfortunately."
Battery life not as described. The charging case battery life decreased significantly after one week of use and now giving 50% less charge. Poor microphone quality. the product quality doesn't justify the price.
I bought these bc I had the NC10 and NC7 versions. They were excellent. The NC9 version has really bad sound quality and noise cancellation. Any recommendations for a better pair?
I bought these to sleep in and there to large and are not flush with your ear. Plus they fall out of my ears. They work fine. But not good for sleeping.
Doesn’t work well for noise cancelling. Ear plugs work better even though the ear plugs are only 30db reduction vs 45db reduction  for these ear buds. Don’t buy for noise reduction.
"This was my 3rd pair of TOZO earbuds. Each pair was a different type. The first pair were excellent. They lasted about 2 yrs before the left ear bud died and wouldn’t recharge. The 2nd pair I had for less than a month before losing. Tried this pair since they were on sale and they are the worst earbuds I’ve ever own.Cons:- fit is poor. You have to really jam the earbud in your ear and if you wear them while working out and sweating they will constantly start to fall out.- Noise cancellation is horrible. Again, you have to really jam the bud in your ear all the way or the noise cancellation is pointless.- TOZO now requires you download an app. The app isn’t easy to figure out.- battery life is bad. The charging case does work, but the earbuds themself have a short battery life. No way these could last if you had to wear them for an extended period. My best guess is they may last 4 hrs tops.Pros- nothingIf i still had the  box id return the earbuds as they are a horrible purchase. Instead I paid more for a nice set of beats ear buds."
I’m sorry but these reviews are reaching. The sound quality isn’t that well. They look nice though it’s not amazing sound and lacks bass.
Poor sound quality.  Volume is all the way up on phone and the earbud volume is stil low.
I got them for calls but people can’t hear me on my calls. You get what you pay for.
"Tried to use them with Bluetooth cd player, volume even at highest settings is barely audible. Fits ear nicely and comfortable."
"The charger case LCD screen was not working out of the box even after a full charge.  I can’t see the numbers displayed in it.  Rating is for poor product quality control out of factory.  Not worth me spending the time and energy to send it back, but sound quality and everything else is decent for the price."
Sound quality good but falls out of my ears no matter what size ear tips I used.
"Bunch of us ordered this product last week and we all noticed the max volume was 50% as high as our old ones from years back.  I can barely hear phone calls with 1 earbud in, thus making this an unusable product by the default settings.  Why so low volume?"
"If you a buying these because they are active noise cancelling, don't. Just save yourself the time and annoyance.Sound quality is ok for the price point but holly hell is trying to use ANY feature of these headphones damn near impossible.Everything is 2 taps. EVERYTHING. Change song? 2 taps. Pause? 2 taps. Activate ANC? 2 taps.You can probably see where this is going.It takes no less than 10 minutes of fighting with the headset, every single time, to get ANC to turn on. I have to constantly take the headphones off, put them back in their case to reset and try again. I waste more time trying to activeate ANC than the amount of time I need ANC for.General music listening is ok, everything else is extremely deplorable."
Only able to get 2 minimal levels of volume. Just above a whisper
"They don’t sound great, and the noise cancellation is mediocre at best.  It’s an inexpensive product, but the flashiness with the screen should have been scrapped for decent sound quality."
Don't get me wrong they are good earbuds the batter on them are good. But the in call microphone isn't not good at all. You have to be in a quite environment just for the person on the other line to hear you.
Title says it all.Spend a little more and get a good set or earbuds. These are for kids at best.
Volume was horrible- static and connectivity was sparse.  I tried based off of survey but hmmm didn’t work well at all for me.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            That’s what she said. lol any way. These suck. If you pay over 30 find another pair. If they’re 30 or under which is around what I paid, then it’s fine. Noise cancellation is terrible. I say every thing in the video"
"Right earbud started to crackle  and lose volume on the 2nd day. The sound was good, the call quality seemed fine."
"Tozo products have pretty reliably been some of the best bang-for-your-buck on the market. This update on the NC9, however, is a notable downgrade from the older versions. From the fit, build quality on the case, issues synching, to the earbuds falling out of sync with each other (so one ear is a beat or two behind the other), every is just a little bit worse than the model this replaces. I’ve fairly sure these won’t last as long as my last pair. When they finally give up, I’ll be looking elsewhere for a replacement."
IF the music stops for more than 3 seconds you'll be bombarded by tones. Tried factory reset and same results. These may be bad. I will return them.
"I have a number of the original NC9 earbuds and they are great.  Good sound, noise cancelling works decently.  Unfortunately they are starting not hold a charge so I thought hey, I'll get the new version of the NC9's.  Bad call, these things sound awful.  Scratchy and tinny highs, muted mids, and no low end what so ever.  The free 'bottom of the barrel' headphones I got from the flight attendant on my last Delta flight sound better.  Really disappointed, I know you can do better TOZO!"
"The device turns off while picking up calls, makes ear piercing sound of flapping within the earbuds for incoming teams call on phone and mostly failed call pick up for what’s app calls. The noise cancelling is ineffective and many people have complained of bad sound quality with whom I have talked using this headphone. Loved my original TOZO as that was my go to device for my long runs and easier uses."
"The bluetooth connectivity was very poor with my MotoG phone.  Ear buds would disconnect frequently while walking with my phone in my right hand.  It would stay connected great in my left back pocket, but would disconnect frequently in my right back pocket.  If I left phone sitting on workbench or table it would disconnect if moving further than 10' from the phone.  It seemed like phone motion or orientation had big impact on connectivity.  My job requires frequent movement in all directions and lots of walking.  My Aftershokz device allows me to range almost 75 feet from the phone.  Gave it a one star because the noise reduction was wonderful."
"The sound quality is horrible on these. It's extremely tiny, no matter what EQ settings you try to change. The volume for the right earbud is about 1/4th as loud as the left one is on top of that. It's so quiet that it sounds like a whisper, which ultimately creates an unbalanced listening experience.I've used multiple tozo earbuds in the past. This set, unfortunately, does not live up to the same quality that I've come to expect from this company"
"I bought these earbuds because they were on sale. However, to my disappointment, the noise canceling (or any of the other modes) didn't work. Which is the primary reason I bought them.Finally, unless I set the volume ro 75% or higher, it was very difficult to listen to anything. Especially in any environment that has any amount of ambient noise.I went through the instructions, and app setup. Nothing seemed to fix any of the ussues. After this experience, I am going to avoid this brand all together!"
"Do NOT use if you have TINNITUS.These are probably good ear buds with good noise cancelling, but they made my tinnitus so much worse it was unbearable.  Suffered partial deafness in one ear for 2 days after 1 hour of use at low volume.All of the research indicated ANC does not affect tinnitus, but for me, they're wrong.I have used several different earbuds over the years with no affect on my tinnitus at all.The ANC is the only difference, and it is really bad."
"Sigh......just one more crap product being sold on amazon... seems like more and more junk is being soldIf your like me and shopping for a new Bluetooth speaker or headset ... well keep shopping because these ain't the ones LOL they are very ""tinny"" sounding, low quality, low sound, low bass"
"I was excited to get these new ear buds. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it 3 meters before these buds reached their range. Didn't really take much time to listen to anything else because they absolutely won't work with that kind of range."
"Don’t really like how the product description says 6 mics but I only counted 3 on one earbud not 6 also after wearing for about 30 min just sitting down they start to get uncomfortable and won’t stay in place, as for the sound it is ok nothing great for the price I’d rather go with something else not really impressed."
I have some earlier versions of Tozo earbuds and they're great. These ones DO NOT WORK. The touch controls don't allow you to change the noise cancelling and they will not pair to my computer. It seems that everything MUST be done via the iPhone app. That's no good!
I am extremely diasappointed in the Tozo. My daughter managed to sync Tozo with my iPad but it won't sync with my apple phone or MacBook ? It's a pain. It shouldn't be so difficult. Until I figure out how I would not recommend this to anyone.
It is inexcusable to sell a product with such low audio volume. These are virtually unusable . I have had to revert back to my wired headset as I cannot have a decent conversation on these earbuds. Thoroughly unenjoyable and a waste of money.
Honestly love all there other buds.  These just were defective so I'm returning.  The music phased in and out and both buds emitted a high buzzing sound.  I still love the products so hopefully this was just a defective pair.
Was shopping for a new set of ear buds and these were suggested in my Amazon feed with all these great reviews. When they arrived they are dead on arrival. Don’t work…. Reordered and maybe second pair will work…. I was also threatened that another charge will occur if I don’t send the broken ones back.
"Since when do you have to install an app, share your gps location, pictures and microphone to use earbuds? This might be normal in China, but there's this thing called personal freedom that some people tend to value."
Active Noise cancellation is non existent. During transparency mode it just adds white noise to make your surroundings seem louder then it is. Absolute trash.
"Long time tozo fan, these are great but bass and audio volume are much lower than expected. Hard to use transparency and noise cancelling consistently. Id get the older versions if you like the nc9s (personal favorite of mine) and depending on the coupon they may be the same price."
"For calling purposes, hearing is good but no one can hear me over the background noise. All filters are hearing only."
You have to manually enable noise cancellation every single time you connect to it by opening the app it’s incredibly frustratingAlso the app fails to connect all the time
"Wanted to like the earbuds, they are pretty comfortable and long battery but just after hours of using, a very loud buzzing sound would happen while on anc mode."
No Bluetooth product should need an app to work.  But I installed the app anyways on my Samsung phone.  The app said that the ear buds are not supported.  I messaged support and never got a reply.  Sent back to Amazon.
No matter what I tried I could not get the earbuds to pair with my phone. I tires to use their app but the earbuds I purchased are not compatible with the app. Not impressed.
Noise canceling is good and so is the fit but that’s about it on full charge it lasted two hours and the call quality is awful.
"I had high hopes, but these have terrible sound. It appeared there would be an app with an equalizer, but this product does not work with the app. The built-in equalizer on something like amazon music did almost nothing. No bass at all, and sounds horribly tinny. Returned"
"Whenever there isn't sound being played, the damn thing starts playing annoying tones, as if I'm not trying to read something and want silence for a moment."
"If you are interested in aptx support, these do not support the codec."
"Case Did Not Charge, had to order replacement headphones. Headphones randomly disconnect, audio echoing. This new version of NC9 earbuds are unstable and have worse build quality. Case build way more flimsy compared to older version."
I found these earbuds uncomfortable and the sound was tinny.  They also didn't seem to provide any noise cancelling.
Can’t hear anything
"Maybe good for old people, bad for young people... need more volume"
"Like so many others I was lured by the enthusiastic reviews but have to agree with the more negative ones. Sound is just ok not rich, and EQ adjustments don't make much of a difference. Volume is very low and Noise Cancelling is practically non-existent. As always, you get what you pay for."
"Sound is clear ,ear buds are reasonably comfortable but not robust connections are difficult to make .controls are clunky with poor response . The micro print doesn’t help much. The pod  use and are not explained that could find  I will continue to explore maybe I can find where they hide the information gems needed to make the promised functionality's shine"
I purchased these because I wanted a cheap backup pair. Now I have to return them and get something else because these earbuds arent supported in the TOZO App. I like to set the equalizer and not being able to do that is a deal killer.
"I've only had these about 9 days as of today, and yesterday I noticed the left earbud wasn't as loud, today it's half-dead, barely any soundUpdate: the mesh thing fell out and now it's perfect, no idea what was going on bye something with the mesh cover"
"I liked these a lot at first.  Good Sound and quite decent ANC, especially for the price.  Comfortable and easy to handle.  Quick charging, and decent life.However, this product is NOT what is described in the manual.  Pairing and controls are different.  The LEDs are not red/blue, only white.  Buttons described in the manual simply are not there.  I could deal with that, but . . . .I've had a number of issues with pairing and dropping, often requiring a reset of some sort.  On top of that, the touch controls stopped working today.  I've had these only about 6 weeks."
I have some generic brand earbuds from wallmart and those are better and deep voices or bass is drowned out by a low hum and all the audio sounds like it's coming through a stuffed animal voice speaker.
"The sound is very tinny and disappointing, however, hubby needed right away, so will keep rather than return, but these are not good if you care about any kind of sound quality."
"I had $20 head phones that are better and louder then theses things! Not loud almost quiet and the sound is mediocre! They suck not worth the 30 bucks! Don't buy, buy something else!"
Earphones are good value for money and have good sound quality. Fit my ears perfectly never fall out when using. Unsure on potential durability as having some intermittent issues after only a month of use
"Excellent earbuds for the price but battery life is way less than advertised…I got 5 hours with ANC on at half volume but TOZO claim 10 hours! Call quality is also not good enough. Comfortable fit,small case,awesome sound quality and app features but I will return them for the disappointing battery life! NC7 pro are much better"
I can’t comment on the quality as these failed to pair on 3 different phones that I tried. The buds are quite big and not that comfortable. I wouldn’t bother with these
"**update** no further issues since getting the speakers to work again.So the speakers sound good enough for purposes. My tv speakers rattle and it’s nice to be able to connect two Bluetooth speakers to it easily and have nice stereo sound.HOWEVER… They did freeze and became unresponsive. This happened a week after the return window. I couldn’t get a hold of customer service and so I asked about the issue in the questions section. Someone seriously treated me like I was too stupid to find the buttons. Wtf? I specifically wrote that the buttons weren’t working.Anyhow, all buttons were unresponsive and I couldn’t reset it. One of the speakers had been close to dead when the issue occurred. It beeped, I plugged in the charger, the light showed that it was charging but everything stopped working. I unplugged the charger, the light just stayed blue but none of the buttons worked.If anyone comes across this problem, unpair/forget your paired devices and just let it die. Don’t be tempted to let it charge for 2-3 hours in hopes that it’s just too dead to respond. Let it die. It will beep annoyingly for a while then die. Try turning it on. It should still have enough juice to at least power on. Mine did. Once it did, I turned it back off,  charged it for a few hours andall was right in the world. They have been working perfectly. They are paired to my tv and linked to each other.Hope this helps.Would have given them a 4/5 for value for price if this hadn’t been such an ordeal. Will update if I have future/further problems."
"For the price, it's worth it for a nice Bluetooth speaker.  Easy to connect to my phone and it is great on my night stand for music as well.  If you let the charge completely run out, you cannot use it while it is is charging-which is a bummer. It doesn't come with, and it likely states it in the description, a wall plug in (even though it does have the ability if you purchased that separately or have an extra one at home).  I purchased extra cords from Amazon and a charging tower so I now have extra plug in abelites for my phone, this product, my earbuds, and other things.What does not work at all is the hands free phone.  I have an iPhone 13 pro.  I wanted to use this for zoom meetings, answering my phone phone, and talking with clients and friends hands-free, so I am able to easily continue to work on my PC during work hours and other times.  I tried it out with many different friends as a test run.  When I am speaking it is hardly audible to the listener but the listener comes through loud and clear.  When I adjust it, I come in loud and clear to the listener, but they are barely audible to me.  So I would rate that part at zero stars.  I was able to get in touch with customer service at the number provided.  However, he was unable to help me (he did try) and then eventually said that he was part of some 3rd party answering service who tries to help with all different products from multiple companies.  He had to find the page on his computer that was for this product.  My issue was not listed in his product information quick-fix page.  So he couldn't provide assistance and told me I should try a different number.  By this time I had spent about 4 hours of my time trying to resolve the issue.  So I chose to just stop trying to fix the problem and use it only as a speaker."
"Decent speaker for the price as far as sound quality goes. I wanted a small speaker to put on my nightstand for watching TV late at night so as not to disturb my roommates with my full size sound bar. Unfortunately, I'll be returning it for several reasons: One, the Bluetooth connection glitches and happens every 5 seconds is so aggravating and cuts out during important words and I have to rewind to clarify Yes, I have followed all instructions I could find in order to remedy the problem and no luck. This shouldn't even be an issue, especially for such a smalland simple component and considering how simple Bluetooth is in general. It sits 6 feet from my TV and Bluetooth connection. Two, the loud beeps and boops when you turn it on is ridiculously loud. Three, the lights are on when you turn it on so you have to turn them off first thing. Four, the buttons are poorly placed and lack common sense. They're hard to find with your fingers so adjusting it by memory when it's dark is a pain and I usually have to turn on the light to do it. My old one had pronounced buttons and were placed in an order that was easy to memorize. Five, when you turn it on the volume is set high so you have to stand ready to turn it down. When I am trying to be quiet this is a jolt of noise that can be heard outside of my bedroom and when it's late at night it can wake others up."
"This is the second time I have purchased this speaker! The 1st one I bought a Lil over a year ago. It was amazing! Great sound quality & battery life!! When it finally died out, we immediately wanted to get another one.  When this one arrived I had high expectations from the previous one we had.  This one although a good speaker, it doesn't compare to the 1st one! Sounds quality isn't half as good or loud. I charged that one maybe once a week. This one..... after maybe 30mins of use, started beeping, saying battery was going dead.  Just doesn't have the power or quality as the 1st one. So whatever you changed about this speaker since last year......Put it back like it was!! LolStill an okay speaker just not as great as the first one!"
"I was initially very pleased with this speaker, easy connection, good sound.  However, after a short time, started having problems getting it to turn off.  Tried holding down the power button for several seconds, pushing power button many times.  Researched the issue, seems a number of other people have experienced the same thing with no apparent resolution.  There is no reset button, no way to remove the battery.  The only thing that works is letting the speaker set for several hours and then might be able to turn it off, if not, wait until the battery dies.  Really unfortunate because otherwise this is a very good bluetooth speaker."
"The speaker’s sound is ok.  The charging time isn’t too bad.  But it does not last very long at all.  Maybe 4 hours before you need to recharge.  It’s a bit weighty and if you drop it, it’ll likely not work anymore. It’s hard plastic so be very careful with it. And don’t get me started on the colorful and annoying lights.  It can be difficult to get them to turn off.  I’ve had to press hard on the button until the lights go out.  Sometimes you need to do it a few times.  I’m sick of this annoying speaker.  It’s going back."
"I got this on sale for $24 (including shipping), and for that price, it’s pretty good—but I wouldn’t pay $60 for it. The plastic feels far from premium, and it easily picks up fingerprint smudges.Of course, the main thing is sound quality. After testing with and without SoundFX software, I’d rate it a 6.5 out of 10. The bass is weak, the treble is tinny, and the overall sound is just okay. For $24, it’s one of the better speakers under $30, but at $60? Definitely not worth it.The lights are a nice touch, but they’re more like regular RGB lighting—they react to music but not in sync. It’s not a dealbreaker, but the advertising made them sound more impressive.As a professional audio engineer, I hope this helps. If it’s on sale, it’s a solid buy; otherwise, I wouldn’t recommend it."
"Bought it in October was working great. Used it less than 10times  since I bought it, no exaggerating. Then one night after using it, when I press and hold to turn off nothing happens, so how it has to be left on indefinitely until the battery is dead or I decide to charge and use it again. Sad."
"Speaker Bluetooth worked great, sound is awesome. My only complaint is it cuts off every time you go to do something which isn't very long. By the time you pop a bag of popcorn it cuts off automatically and disconnects before you can get back to it."
"I love the sound. It's crystal clear and loud. But it loses its charge after about an hour of charging it to capacity. I believe it's due to the constant blinking lights at the sides. If not for those, this speaker would be perfect."
"This speaker is inexpensive and the sound shows.  Unlike similar JBL products, this speaker only ""fires"" from one side.  There is absolutely no bass. I have heard clock radios that sound better. On the other hand, it's cheap and gets the job done.  If you don't care about sound (talk radio, sports), this is the speaker for you. If you want Bose or JBL quality sound, look elsewhere."
"... I too have the incessant beeping problem. Most devices will alert you when the battery is nearing being dead, but usually when you plug it in to the charger the alert will stop. Not with this speaker. I guess you will need to get it up to a certain amount of charge before the beeping stops, but I can't stand it. So I've had to just turn it off and wait. Hoping I can get this resolved."
I really like this speaker especially for the price. But after two months of use it will not power off. It is like the power button just doesn't work anymore. Would not buy again.
"Was very disappointed in the battery life, can’t even get four hours before it dies, but the weird thing is the device will power back on when I hit the power button and play music for a little while longer.  Maybe I have a bad battery, otherwise the sound quality is great for a small speaker"
It’s loud with little bass. If there is a way you can incorporate an equalizer and adjust the sound that would be great. Not bad for the price as well.
I purchased 2 of these to use with my epson projector.  The two speakers connect and work well with my phone but only one will play sound from my projector.  Disappointed.
"It took 3 months of regular use (10 hr/week) to blow this speaker with no exposure to water or sever mistreatment. It was cheap so I could just buy again and likely will get better luck, but instead I am going with $75 JBLs that will last me a couple years."
mine does not have a pairing button. none of my model do. they refunded me. i actually just wanted to know how to pair it. it does it automatically with last item paired....but i had a lot of trouble with it to the point where it wasn't worth keeping. i returned. they refunded me.
"I read an article that said the sound quality of these speakers rivaled UE, I'm not sure the writer of that article had ever listened to a UE device but there is no comparision.  The sound quality is okay but remember you get what you pay for and these are worth no more than the 19.99 price they are selling for now.  If I had paid the list price I'd be asking for a refund."
Battery life is great! Easy to connect to phone but volume is very great. Does what I needed it to do while though.
I have. Smaller Bluetooth speaker that gets louder and lasts longer than this one. The USB C charging is cool and the lights are nice touch but the sound quality is well below average.
"It's not a bad speaker, but I don't like that it isn't very loud even at maximum volume."
It's ok  not really impressed with it the battery doesn't last that long and it's not that loud.
"So, it is a good deal, but you get what you pay for it is always cutting in and out no matter how close you are with Bluetooth or connected to the computer/phone that is the most irritating thing. I looked into how to fix this problem, and nothing works. The lights on the specker are cool and it doesn't get as loud as other speckers."
"I’ve had this speaker for about 5 months now, and it is not holding its charge. Dies much quicker than when I first purchased it. Other than that it’s loud and sounds good."
Not sure why but I can't get it to pair with my new Roku TV.
"It charged twice and now has a weird glitch where the power light flashes blue and red, and the lights on the side flicker at a high bpm constantly. It still sounds great, but the battery life is terrible after only two charges. Overall, works as a shower speaker, a presentation speaker, and something to commute with since my car radio is broken. I got my money out of it, so can't complain too much. But I wish the battery weren't so cheap, or whatever else has broken on it."
"Still trying to find that affordable speaker with quality sound. With todays high tech., It should not be so difficult or expensive to find a top of the line sound in a small package under $40.00."
"Start up sound is loud! Bluetooth Connect sound is loud! Turn off sound is loud! Bluetooth disconnect sound is loud!If you want to use this for a quiet environment without all the beep boops that alarm neighbors or roommates, or alert people of your activities in your apartment I would definitely search for a speaker with no such sounds. I'm currently doing such a search.Despite the alarming, exasperating, siren like noises at all power and connection events I love the form and sound quality. I am using it during the day. Not what I bought it for but..."
Look and feel of a quality product but the sound quality is more on the mediocre side. Certainly not HiFi. Maybe there are some tone controls I don't know about. The control buttons on the top could use a little white paint in the grooves indicating their function.
The speaker sounds just fine but what ruins it for me are the startup and shutdown sounds. Totally unnecessary bleeps and bloops and there's even a sound for when it hasn't been used for a while and shuts down by itself. Makes annoying sounds and shuts off automatically! Who what's a speaker that does that? I never would have bought this thing.
"Not very loud and battery doesn't last long. But it's water proof (so they say). That's good, I guess."
The battery life truly truly sucks. Stupid thing always going dead FAST!! It doesn’t loud tho. Connectivity is easy. Volume does get loud. If you don’t care about it dying easy then go ahead and spend them coins!GENUINE REVIEW
Was great until it wasn't.... Have had this for about 2 months and it started getting static and music cutting out not sure what is going on with it.  I use it for work so I'm not blaring music all day.  It was great when I first received it. Now I can't stand to use it.
Quality of the sound was amazing but the problem was the fully charged speaker only last less than 4hours! Advertised 20hours playtime?Will not recommend if you always listen to music.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Video:Listen with nice headphones if possible. (Note that the music is my own creation so I DO have the rights to play it.)Pros:Reasonably good and loud sound. Affordable enough you can get two for TWS pairing mode without breaking the bank when on sale.3.5mm in provided with weather seal to keep speakers safe outdoors.Pairs via bluetooth with Alexa and Google Home to give you nice sound.Cons:Occasional connectivity issues.Weak bass not suitable for bass-heavy musicConclusion:If you want to get some budget bluetooth speakers to bring to a small outdoor gathering, these will work. They'll add ambiance to the event. There are almost certainly better options out there however, particularly if these are not on sale."
Dislike. It’s not even loud enough for a partyVolume is low
Sound
"All I have here is a bluetooth speaker 7 1/2"" long. Works good with side lights that go on and off and turn 5 different colors,  it's so exciting."
the product looks good with the light but sound quality is sub bar. Sound quality sounded very muffled. mid and high sounds are decent but the low suck! I'll rather return this thing and spend a bit more for something else that will sound a bit better.
"It’s okay, just be wary of the size, good countertop or nightstand"
"My Echo Dot 5 is way better. I bought on Prime day at $27 now it’s  $19.99.It’s compact, will do for in the garage. No instructions, but it’s a basic blue tooth speaker pairing. I’ve bought little speakers on Temu that sound better for half the price.It is what it is!!"
This product was adequate and a probably worth the $20 price point.  Pros: It lights up.  The sound is clear.  There are several good color options available.  Cons: No bass sound.  No microphone.  No aux input option.  I tried five speakers in the $20 - $40 price range and ultimately chose the Notabrick 30W ipx7 for superior sound quality.
"The speaker itself is attractive, but it's effective range, indoors with minimal obstacles, is 32±10% feet. Much less than the 100 feet advertised. It will work on my front deck only if I leave my inner door open, and place the speaker on the glass door handle. ""As the crow flies"" that's a distance of 12 feet from mu computer! I'm guessing that the problem is with the speakers wi-fi receiver, which needs increased power. I CANNNOT recommend this particular product to anyone."
"The speaker sounds amazing. Looks great. Does exactly what I need it to do. However, the charge cord came damaged and can't be used. A little frustrating, however it does take a C charger and Ira a good thing I gave plenty laying around 😁"
"Update: after posting the review below, the seller promptly offered me a refund and a replacement. I’d already returned it and gotten a refund, so I opted for replacement. They sent it quickly and asked if the new one was better, which it was not. I definitely recommend giving it a try and seeing what you think, just not for me.Orig review: For $20 on Prime Day and such great reviews, I really wanted to like this speaker. I listen to a very wide variety of music, and I’m not kidding when I say I tested every genre out there is including spoken word. I could feel it working hard, it pumped out the bass, but I’ve never had a speaker sound so flat to me. For $20, it’ll be fine for some people. Nice size, portable, easy to connect to my iPhone, colored lights if you want them. I just want the depth I know is in the music, so it’s not for me."
"I've been spending a lot of time outside in my yard so I wanted to get an outdoor speaker. When I was looking for one, this popped up with a lightning deal for under 20 bucks so I figured I'd give it a shot. The sound quality is ok, but could certainly be better, but there's no way to adjust it (treble, bass, etc). The volume could definitely be better. I can stand next to it on full volume & have a conversation without really having to raise my voice. It's extremely noticeable which way the speaker is facing. Meaning, if I stand in front of it, then stand beside it, there's a big difference in the volume. The size is very convenient, it's light weight & it has a short lanyard (removable), so it's very portable, which I like. The setup & connecting bluetooth was extremely quick & easy. When you turn it on its in pairing mode. Overall, for what I paid for it, it's decent, so I'll keep it, but it's not what I was looking for, so my search for an outside speaker continues."
Way smaller then thought
"This speaker will do all of the functions it claims it will do. However, I can't use it on my office. No matter what I do, I can't turn the volume low enough that it's not heard in the next office, and if someone comes into my office I have to actually stop my music.If you want a speaker for outside, this is probably a great choice/value. I just can't use it indoors, thus my 3-star rating."
Good sound we really enjoyed it until it stopped working.  Only had it for a couple of months.
Was not as loud as i was expecting. I was hoping for it to be louder to hear it from further distances for working out in the yard or using at work.
"The speaker is fine and works for what I need, however if there is no sound playing for a few minutes, it automatically keeps shutting off. I'm not sure where the quick-start guide is but I was hoping to be able to read it online so I can enlarge it to read with my bad eyes. I want it to turn off when the computer is off, but not while the bluetooth is connected."
"I do like the quality of sound for the price and it does its job. The battery however is pretty poor, even functioning new it doesn’t come close to the 20h advertised. It also gives barely any auditory warning when the battery is low"
Sound wasn't what I expected...I was looking for a rich bass sound
Battery life is long and it charges very quickly and has ok quality for a small bluetooth speaker. However mine has a glitch where the power button no longer works after fully charging the speaker. I have to completely use up the battery to get it to turn off.
"I'm only giving it 3 because the build quality was surprisingly good. That is the only redeeming part. Maybe I'm a snob, which I might be. But the sound quality couldn't have been more disappointing. Zero bass and everything else sounded muddled. It was so bad I have it to my friend the day I got it cause I knew I wouldn't use it even once. Prime days got me good lol. Now, if you just want a speaker to toss around and want to hear something this might be for you but it wasn't for me."
I suites the purpose not bad little speaker
"I bought this to use as a vocal monitor in an acoustic string band. Because we rehearse away from my home I don't want to lug a mic, amp and speaker with me. I hope I could use an existing Bluetooth mic that I own. Doesn't seem possible. It does a good job of playing music from my Samsung Galaxy S22+,  but it won't pass through the mic input. It also won't pair directly with the mic, and neither of 2 weird mics will work with the Aux input.This would be good if I wanted to play music from my phone. For my purposes, however, it seems useless."
"Great sound for a lil speaker.Unfortunately during use after less than 3 months the speaker sounds blown even though we have used it for casual use. It stays on a shelf for background music.I would return it, but it's out of window time"
"It’s a really nice device, and I’ve tried with both Alexa devices and it is not compatible. It did connect to iPhone, but that is not why I bought. Must return.  Sorry"
"The speaker is lightweight, easy to connect to Bluetooth from any phone, speaker has great sound, small, and portable. My 2 star deduction is because it has no battery indicator and you get 3 chimes in the last 15 minutes of it dying. It's been charging for 3 HOURS and still isn't fully charged, based on the red light indicator. As long as you don't need to use it for more than a random moment... the battery is not reliable for extensive use. Would give 5 stars if the battery was performing as expected."
"It works fine inside my house and garage, I was hoping it would work outside.  Any back ground sounds make the device not so good.🫤"
I'm old and it's not as easy to use as I thought it would be.my grandkids tried to help.
"It has some major issues that people should know.1. It does not have a “next song” button, what if I’m away from my phone? What if I am in the shower? I should be able to skip a song…2. If you push play when your phone is not using the music app, it will call your last call automatically. Awful!3. Related to point one, it has a “lights” button that is useless and could be next button instead. Who wants disco lights all the time?!! Or at all?Volume and sounds are good though which is what people emphasize but this flaws should also be listed."
This speaker has great sound my problem with it is that my phone’s volume is louder than this speaker. Returned speaker.
"It sounds great, but the volume cannot be put down past 6. Below this it is silent."
"This speaker is amazing, loud, colorful and the base it kicks out is awesome. BUT it won’t turn off, it’s been on for a week literallyI hold the power button down and it won’t turn off. I don’t know why this is happening. I haven’t even had it a month yet. But it still works great playing music. I just want to be able to turn it off"
Very low quality product
This product play well except for one event where the device was not coming off no matter how I tried until the battery went dead. So no problem this far. I was on brink of requesting my money back but so far good no problem.
"For twenty bucks, I did not expect much and this speaker did not disappoint. I workout in my garage; I have budget-priced ear buds, but I just did not want to wear them while lifting weights. So I connected my phone to this speaker and...passable sound. OMG not in the same ballpark with my cheap ear buds. That's not a knock on the product, but the near audophile fidelity claims I have read here? Uh, no. Don't take me wrong: the product is really well made and it charged up full quickly. The directions made it easy to use and it came with a charging cable. I rather doubt that any speaker its size sounds much better. Cannot defy physics."
No user manual was included. How long does it take to charge? What do the buttons on the top do?
"This is a loud little speaker. I loved it at first. However, it kept unpairing from my phone and tablet. Instead of starting up from my Bluetooth list, I had to unpair and pair each time. I don't have this issue with other Bluetooth devices.  I tried pairing two, but they will constantly go in and out of sounds....so annoying. The battery only lasts about 4 hours before it starts beeping to charge. I'm sad I wasted money on two!"
This speaker was very disappointing. It quit working after a year and a half. The light comes on only when plugged in and will not activate plugged in or not.
Got this on sale. 59.99 down to 19.99 seemed like a deal. It's only 10w so not amazing. It came out of the box fresh with a nice crack. I just got it today and would be shocked if it la a ted 2 months. Just get the jbl and be done with it if you're going to use it enough.
I was not impressed witj this spesker and gsve it to a neighbor kid. it sounded tinny and cheap. The batteru life was terrible. a waste of money .
"Normal, but sometimes sound don't have"
The volume control wasn’t great. I could not get it to go low enough. I’ll be returning it.
"Bought this for my daughter, it’s not the best sounding system on the market but at the price point the sound is ok."
But at this price point 6 hrs of ful volume are not bad.
It could be a little louder for what I need it for but overall a good product.  easy to use and set up
Quality sounds okay but I feel like it’s not loud enough to fill a room. My Alexa is definitely louder.
"Works well enough.. Easy to use , just wished it kept ts charge longer..."
It needs more Bass! Other than that it seems like a fine speaker.
Sounds good but you will only get 4 to 6 hours of playtime instead of the 20 hours of playtime they claim it will get
can't get it to work. but asking for help
Not very loud at all.  Wanted this to play while working out and was disappointed with the volume
Not loud enough for a area with some noise in the background
"I suppose sometimes you get what you pay for. I saw some of the reviews on here mentioning that this speaker could use more bass, but I'm not an audiophile so I figured it would be fine.I was wrong. This is replacing another fairly cheap bluetooth speaker (my JBL finally gave up the ghost), and the dropoff in sound quality is much starker than expected. Not quite as tinny as laptop speakers, but this definitely does NOT provide a full sound."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I’ve had the speaker for about a month now and at first it was great but now it won’t turn off. I’m not sure what’s wrong with it. I’ve tried everything and It just will not turn off. I’m trying to let it just die but I can’t stand the beeping noise it’s makes when it’s low battery so now I have to either just keep it on the charger so I don’t have to hear the beeping noise or I’m just gonna have to let it die, which is taking forever lol so kinda a mixed review it’s a good speaker I just unfortunately got a faulty one."
Nice product only problem is that doesn’t keep a charge for very long.
"a decent speaker but the BlueTooth side is balky.  it puts my cell call on when i don't want it to.  i have 2 of them and getting them to pair is an absolute pain in the butt.  some days they connect right up and others, they refuse.  i'd probably try another brand next time."
"I’d look somewhere else for a better sound system. I was looking for an inexpensive wireless speaker for the bathroom. Inexpensive 👍, Light show 👍, Sound 🤏"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            First off, it doesn't tell you what the charge is once you're connected. All my devices to this, from Walmart headphones to Temu earbuds- they tell me what percent charge it is on.This is also frustrating because once it starts beeping to tell you it's low battery you have to rush to charge it or else it dies quickly. It doesn't give you enough of a heads up or time to plug it in.The lights are whatever, if you want them off you just have to click it 4 times. It becomes habit to know how many times to click it off and even if you miss it's no big deal, takes less than 5 seconds to fix.I liked the color and was interested in the shape but honestly I miss my simple small square speaker I had before this. It is lightweight though yet still has good weight and wind doesn't push it around.I'm not a huge fan of bass but do like my music louder than average, and noticed that indeed it doesn't handle bass of songs very well. If that's your thing.Would not recommend."
"I'm sure this product is fine for normal, everyday use. However, I purchased it specifically to play a high frequency sound in my backyard to deter animals from coming around at night and it wasn't able to play what I needed without distorting the sound. Didn't know what I was expecting given the price but I ended up having to return it."
"Thought I was getting a good deal on this...regularly 60 bucks and I got for 20 bucks.  I am a head banger when it comes to music..you know AC/DC, Marilyn Manson etc and like to crank it up.  Unfortunately,  rhis doesn't support high volumeIf your a soft rock or easy listening than this speaker is for you.  Just don't pay 60 bucks it!  UPDATE..I was contacted directly by seller and they are replacing the speaker.  Let's see what happens next.  They definitely have good customer service!!"

"I bought this purely for listening to conference calls on Webex/Teams.  Voices are somewhat tinny and sometimes a little distorted.  In general, I wouldn't call the sound clear or natural.  Tried playing music on it just to see what it sounds like.  Pretty much sounds like an old pocket radio from the '70s.  I would not use this for listening to music.  Ever.I don't use this as the mic on my meetings, but on one occasion Webex switched to this for the mic without me knowing.  After a few meetings, someone complained that they couldn't hear me very well and my voice was not clear.  Others who had been on different meetings that day said it had been like that all day.  I switched back to one of my other mics, and everyone said I was crystal clear.  Both were the same distance from my mouth.So, usable for the purpose I bought it for, but overall sound and mic quality are very poor in my opinion.  But, as so many others have pointed out, the big usability issue with this speaker is the fact that every time you turn it off and back on, it resets to max volume, and lowering the volume can take a lot of button mashing.  Brutally bad design.  I find myself just leaving it on most of the time so I don't have to deal with it, but the issue with that is if someone from work tries to get hold of me through Webex or Teams late at night or early in the morning, those tools use the speaker as the ringer, so the ringing scares the dog awake and the dog barking and howling at the ringing wakes the rest of the house... good times, good times.  You can't buy that kind of fun.  Oh wait... yes you can... just scroll up and click ""Add to Cart""."
good sound quality but the start up sound to way too loud.  Always starts very loud and takes a few seconds before it can be turned down.  For this reason and this reason only I will be replacing it.
"I realize that this is one of those, ""you get what you pay for"" items. That is, for $49, what did I expect? Power was pretty good, although I didn't test whether the 30 watts was accurate. But it was quite powerful. The sound, however, was just average. The ad says bass heavy. I would say that compared to my old JBL Flip 3, it was not as good at capturing the bass. Highs and mids were also just okay: not terrible, not great. It took quite a bit of experimenting with an equalizer to find a comfortable sound. But for the price, I should have lowered my expectations. I don't know yet about the 24 hour battery life. I assume it won't really be that long, but I haven't played it that long yet."
"The sound from this is speaker is fairly decent, great volume and sound. The bad thing is when you start playing music it blasts on at high volume. When adjusting the volume the lowest sound is too low and the next push of the button it’s too loud. This might not bother some people but I find it very annoying. The price on sale was very good and if the two things I mentioned don’t bother you then it’s a decent speaker."
They work good. Not great. They drop each other alot. Updated already.
"I liked the speaker so much, I bought a second for the sync/party mode. I originally gave these speakers a great review but after less than 2 years, one speaker has stopped working and will not turn on.  What happened to the days of products lasting?  I am 52 and still have a stereo from when I was a teen."
"Love the pairing ability with another monster speaker .However it lacks the bass of other speakers if that's what you would prefer over treble ,which is fine.When it comes to sound quality the speaker seems decent considering the size of it after all it's not a boombox."
Good sound quality!I haven't tried to get it wet so I don't know water resistant quality.I have to fight with the volume button on phone or device to lower itIt blasts really loud when it turns on even when you lower it beforehandI feel like it's possessed 😆
I bought 2 of these speakers specifically because they have straps so you can hang them. After the first use the strap ripped out. And there is no exchange or refund option. Speaker sound and pairings works well but I needed ones that hung for my use so now it’s the same as the other Bluetooth speakers I already had.
"Ordered a second unit to pair with the original upgraded S310 I purchased. As well, I was hopeful this unit would be able to read an SD card, as advertised. The original speaker couldn't read the SD card which drove me to try this unit. To my consternation, this speaker can't read a card either. I would be willing to overlook this if the speaker would pair with the original unit (again as advertised) but it doesn't do so. Possibly a bad batch but I can't get any support from Monster. If you don't care about these features, the speaker does work with Bluetooth and sounds good."
"Boomy but thin bass, overly loud and not dynamic and lower volumes. Not impressed."
"It looks well build, but sounds very tinny, no bass. Will stick to Bose."
"This speaker has good sound and battery life. I have only 2 major complaints:-sometimes will cut the music and produce static, like a tv with no signal. I have to disconnect and restart speaker-when first paired with my phone, it does not automatically adjust to my phone volume, but defaults to a set volume. So when you first pair the speaker it will be very loud, startling listeners."
"The product came damaged and we didn't notice.  As it was a Christmas gift, when it was finally opened we noticed something different.  Tried to charge it and it wouldn't work.  Amazon wouldn't refund our money and we couldn't contact the manufacturer.DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON!!!!"
Not enough bass for my taste. Battery life is very good.
Great speaker but the battery life sucks
Returned as there wasn’t enough bass.
Monster S310 Upgraded Bluetooth Speaker1) Why will Monster warranty page not accept my Amazon order number ?2) Why will my 2 speakers not pair together for TWS sound when using a SD card ?3) Why do these speakers start up at full volume ?
$40 you get what you pay for. Sound quality isn't great. Bass isn't great. You get for what you pay for.
"The max volume is very low, may be good if you plan on using it in a closet.  Was very disappointed, I have a pair of Monster earbuds that are terrific, this just sucks."
Bought a couple used as gifts.The boys were happy they loved sound quality.Would recommend.
Poor quality sound for so-called “name-brand”. Tinny and flat. I didn’t expect bass from a small unit like this and there is none.Returned after listening for 15 minutes.
"I most often use this in the cup holder on my ATV. Battery life was awesome and sound was decent. HOWEVER...after roughly 30 hours of use, it failed to play the micro SD music and refused to change mode to bluetooth. So it's essentially useless. Not impressed"
"Got the speaker for my sons birthday. We Used it for 15 minutes, it sounded great then all of a sudden it turned to high pitched static sound. Not chancing keeping something that already has issues 15 minutes in."
Selling snake oil that it’s upgraded. Great speaker but not an upgraded model. Other than the supposed water proofing
"Not a terrible speaker just not as loud or clear as expected for it being a $100 speaker ,and battery life wasn't the greatest either . There are better Bluetooth speakers for the price"
I believed in monster products until I purchased this monster speaker. The design is the only thing it has going for it. Bass lacking. Volume lacking. Value for your money lacking. I wanted to return it the moment I listened to my smaller less expensive JAM speaker…but I decided to give it to my daughter instead. Not good monster!!!
Looked like the speakers I received were used. Lettering worn off tip and original packaging had been opened before with new cellophane put around. Very tinny sound. Sent back immediately.
Not good . Tried different models all have volume adjust problems . Advise Buy something else
"The sound is good, just have to test the base sound"
"Every thing about this speaker seems to be good. But when I play music , it feels that something is missing. My ears can hear good sound quality but not wide enough. It feels like something is covering the speaker and doesn’t let the sound come out. The bass is pretty good but midrange and treble not very good. The sound is not balanced. To me it’s a tiny speaker with a strong bass. Honestly when it comes to midrange my phone sounds bigger (not better). So I believe the midrange and treble sound good but very weak also."
"I have a simple little Tribit BT speaker that sounds just as good as this one. I messed with the EQ settings, but it didn’t outperform the tribit so, you bet, I’ll be sending this guy back for a refund. Plus, I tried to link the Bose flex link with my Bose Soundlink max, using their “shortcut” button, to no avail. It’s not worth the hassle. I’m boxing this up and returning it. I could buy a way better speaker for this price."
"Not that good, not bad. Worth $80 tops. Honestly an anker speaker for half the price was pretty much the same quality, even after messing around the the apps EQ settings..."
This speaker has good bass but no mid and certainly no high frequency response so all my music sounds flat and muffled. Totally opposite than my Bose mini soundlink. for a few more dollars you can still get the mini soundlink 1. I went back to my soundcore select 4 go which cost one fourth the cost and has good bass and good mid and highs.
"Bose needs to get their stuff together for the apps. I have a 1st generation flex that have been happy with (except battery life). Wanted to get the new flex 2 to pair the two and use in stereo mode. But Bose have screwed themselves. The flex connects to Bose connect app (which doesn’t support flex 2) and flex 2 connects to yet another Bose app (Bose music) which doesn’t support Flex 1st generation so can’t pair these almost identical speakers and use in stereo mode. Why would Bose do that? I’m disappointed and in disbelief as to why would a company let the software turn users against their own products. Will be returning this one. Also don’t like the new colors.  why don’t they have old colors also? Had the white smoke and sandstone is lightest/closest but don’t like it. comparing it to my 1st original flex - the microphone quality in flex 2 is worse (comes muffled and deeper goes in and out), 1st gen flex records with a crisper truer sound (this is relevant for using it as a speakerphone).For sound playback - 2nd generation is deeper and maybe fuller like others say. It’s not any louder. Not sure which sound I like more."
"The speaker is good, easy for travel, for the cost they should include the charger and a longer USB to C cord.  The one cord provided is too short for decent use."
I had several sound link mini 2. They worked fantastic easy to connect no problems. This constantly loses connection. Can’t find the connection. It’s just a complete pain not worth it. Definitely sending it back.
"This speaker had to be returned right away, as it only worked for a few songs, then conked out. I had a prior Bose portable blue tooth speaker, for many years.! This one clearly needs to go back to the drawing board. Will not get another one to replace it, as my trust in the product is gone now."
"Very difficult to connect.  I purchased the APP for my computer (for $29.00) and it still won't connect to my computer.  I checked BlueTooth, etc. and it keeps saying ready to connect, but nothing.  WAH!  So frustrating after ready how easy it was to connect on the reviews."
"This is the worst speaker I've ever had. The sound is muddy. There's a booming  echo like it's placed in a barrel. Everything sounds false, unnatural, mechanical, jacked up. The base is overwhelming, which might please base heads but it's not good for anything else. Voices are fuzzy. The EQ adjustments are limited so you can't get rid of the built-in sound profile. My phone has better, more natural sound."
"Sound is very low, and even though battery says fully charged it only lasts 3 hours max.Waste of money, don’t buy. Probably the worst Christmas gift I got my boss."
