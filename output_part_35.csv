"It was working great for about 3 months, but then the latch to the largest component stopped working. I called the warranty office and they said they could replace it for $33, but I think it should of been replaced free of charge. Try a different blender if you want something that will last more than 3 months.Update a few months later the other lid broke too. I'm not even goign to bother with the manufacturer."
I've spent hundreds of dollars replacing parts multiple times. The large pitcher has cracked multiple times in the dishwasher and the small  lid with the blade has become damaged and replaced several times do to it constantly leaking all over and in the blender. Not to mention it is absurdly loud. It blends well but is terrible quality. Parts will barely last a year. I'm in the market for a new blender.
"Shark Ninja customer service is designed as a war of attrition, trying to get the customer to hang up before they ever have to take action. My Ninja product broke within 3 months of use and after 40 minutes on the phone forcing me to go over and over again troubleshooting articles that i had already gone over before, they said they needed a supervisor approval to send a warranty replacement but there was no supervisor available and they’d have to call back. the problem was that the call back was to be 2-4 hours later and it was already late. so they won, i gave up, but i am posting here for you to see: DO NOT BUY ANY SHARK/NINJA PRODUCT if customer service and warranty are important. because once it breaks you are ON YOUR OWN."
"I bought this blender June, 2021, today it smells like burned rubber. That is not a good thing I was expecting more from a Ninja product."
"i have used this blender about 10 times within the past 10 months. apparently ninja does not cover the warranty for any accessory parts, only the mechanical part. the button that locks the pitcher lid stopped working so i contacted customer service to replace while it was under warranty. they said because of the materials they use, they are susceptible to wear/tear AND damage and therefore do not provide replacements. this is concerning that they do not trust the materials they use, enough to cover it under warranty. my only option was to purchased a new pitcher and lid for $65, because they do not sell the lid separately. i cannot use the mechanical part (that is covered under warranty) unless i purchase a new pitcher and lid, making my gifted blender completely useless. if they dont trust their product parts enough to include it in their warranty, you shouldnt either."
This blender price was $99.98 this afternoon for Black Friday deal so I put in my cart. I was keep shopping other item then later on they took out from my cart without my doing and price raised to $181They are playing game with customers so we should stop buy this particular item.
Have had this blender for 3 months.  The interior of the blending pitcher is now completely opaque from what I think is micro plastic particles being sheared off the walls of the pitcher. I am concerned this is a health hazard of ingesting micro particles of plastic.  If the pitcher were glass it would be the perfect blender.  I have now order a glass Oster blender to replace the Ninja
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So far I have only used the main blender, but I don't think I will try anything else, as I was very disappointed. I tried to make a dosa batter which I am able to easily make with other blenders I have, and it really didn't blend well. I had to transfer it to my Zwilling Enfinigy Power Blender to finish the job, which it easily did (www.amzn.com/B08NCPHC3V). In fact, every other blender I've had can make this batter. It's not that thick, and the ingredients are soft enough from long soaking that you could pound it by hand if you had a giant mortar and pestle.I'm not sure if it's how wide the pitcher is versus how narrow the blades are, but I ran it both manually at high speed as well as several cycles with the dough/mix setting. Nothing worked to make a smooth batter, and this isn't that thick. The motor didn't seem to struggle at all, although it did make the high-pitched noise that weak motors make, and the blades are so sharp they shredded my kitchen sponge when I washed them. It must be the design. I'm disappointed because I had high hopes for this.In the video I showed myself trying to make this batter. At one point I opened the spout to see if I could add more liquid, but immediately felt the blender spitting out pieces of what I was blending. Indeed when I opened the lid and looked at the underside I could see an accumulation of debris. Afterward I tried blending something else and the same thing happened. It spits food upwards a lot, necessitating constant scraping and leaving you with unblended materials, as there's no way to scrape out the underside of the spout. Traditional blenders are much better in this regard as well.I  found the lid hard to insert and lock into place, and I found the pitcher hard to remove from the base.By the way, the whole Auto iQ thing is just their fancy way of saying there are three presets you can use: Smoothie, Frozen, and Dough/Mix.The manual setting only runs on high speed. I really prefer a traditional blender with various speeds the user can choose. I don't find presets ever work they way companies say they do. I'd prefer they spent their money on stronger motors and better design, product testing, and quality control.And the blade assembly for the small jar won't work with mason jars, not even wide-mouth ones."
"Initially loved this blender but within a few months one of the blades stopped turning properly. Tried to buy a replacement and same thing happened. Can't find this model on their website to even try to talk to customer service. Terrible warranty as well, do not recommend."
I know people who have blenders that they purchased in the 80's. This blender did not even last a year.  It broke.

I received a defective product when I order it from Amazon, it looked new out of the box. However it did not power on, also I noticed a dent on one of the blades, which suggested to me that the product may have been used. I contacted Amazon and I was told to contact ninja directly for my issue. How ever todate , I messaged ninja support twice, no response  .. beware, and be careful"
"The motor works good but after a few times, the pitcher cracked. I call customer support and found out that the pitcher wasn't covered with the warranty. Very disappointed! Will not recommend this blender."
"If you like your smoothies puréed smooth then this blender is not for you. I’ve been using the nutri bullet for my morning smoothies for six years now and it started to give up on me. I decided to try the ninja since it was on sale. However the consistency of my smoothies specially when I add nuts to it, its not smooth. I do like the oversize blender cup. I will be returning and buying the newer version of nutri bullet."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I used to love this blender but honestly it’s too strong and too loud. And eventually it even broke itself. Just yesterday I made a smoothie and the blade was sizzling and it melted plastic into my drink and the blade was smoking for 5 minutes due to heating up. It’s dangerous and it’s a hazard at this point. Disappointed.
"Holy ****!! I've never had an appliance, especially one that touches my food, disintegrate like this blender did. I bought it at the end of July 2024 and have used it for two months. I always am gentle with blending, I've never added any large chunks of frozen fruit or anything, nor do I run it longer than 45 seconds at a time.I noticed bits of black plastic flying out of the base and the ring around the base looking rough after the first few uses, and eventually that ring grew until I realized the plastic was literally MELTING off when I could look inside and see the internal components. I turned it over and found that the same had been happening with the base, and when I flipped it back around, a screw fell right out. WHY make a blender that disintegrates like this, especially so quickly, with normal use??? This is seriously the quality I'd expect off of temu. I actually might've been better off getting a blender from there... Seriously, for the safety of you and your families' health, DO NOT get this! Melting plastic fumes is already its own safety risk, but I shudder to think about the parts not being secured correctly and the motor spinning with an unbalanced load..."
"I'm not a large fan of this blender. The shape of the jar does not allow everything in the blender to get chopped up so it makes chunks in my smoothie, which I hate! I think if you're using small frozen fruit in your smoothies, then it works but if its like the size of half a frozen banana, it won't chop it up.  Also, the blender is very lightweight. It's all plastic, except for the glass jar. I'm not sure about the durability of this item. Doesn't seem worth the $45+ price tag. Seems like a $20 blender to me.  I'm going to return this."
For the most part the blender is good. My only complaint is that it doesn't seal very well. You have to tighten the blade on super tight to keep it from leaking. I've had this issue with other Black and Decker blenders before. Still good if you want to get something cheaper though. I use it every day. It brings me a lot of joy
"It gets the job done, but it's actually weaker than the Hamilton Beach option at this price range albeit it being slightly quieter. I do the same protein shake every morning consisting of protein powder, banana, 4 ice cubes, peanut butter, and a few other ingredients. After 1 minute (yes, I timed it), the Hamilton Beach would have a perfectly smooth blend 99% of the time without any chunks remaining. This blender after the same time had some sizable chunks which needed to blended for another 20-30s or so. Not a big deal if you're not going crazy, but meaningful enough to some I imagine. Personally I'm disappointed in Black & Decker on this one.Also, some of the design quirks hailed as features turn into inconveniences when it comes to cleaning. Namely the shape of the glass (opening is less wide) making it difficult for a large hand to get inside to brush, and the rubber seal on the lid making it a bit difficult to remove the lid quickly. I think it's a bit overkill. Do we really need an incredibly tight seal at the top for a blender? The Hamilton Beach flips off easily so you can remove it and wash it immediately. Very convenient for someone like me who has to be in and out of the kitchen and out of the door ASAP."
"On the one hand, it's the quietest blender I've ever owned.  Not that it's quiet, but it's quieter than my old Oster by a lot.  I make breakfast smoothies every morning so this is good since it's less likely to wake my girlfriend up.On the other hand, it kinda sucks as a blender.  I put fruit in my smoothies and no matter how long I run it for or what setting I use it leaves behind chunks of fruit.  It's not the worst thing in the world, but it's a little annoying."
"Nice sturdy glass blender, small blades not as powerful as I thought. It’s doable."
Perhaps I am not using this item correctly.  I have found that when you place the items in the jar as they suggest they do not blend well. I have to keep blending  which is add to much air to the smoothies.  Which add to much air to your stomach.  Yuck. For frozen items you need to do them in a different order then the instructions mention and hope for the best.  My old 30 year old blender works much better. Bought a new to have a glass jar.  The old plastic jar is getting cracks. Bummer.
"Our very old smoothie blender finally gave up the ghost and I was super excited finding a Black and Decker blender for under $40 to replace it. I expected the pitcher to be thin glass, but it was surprisingly thick and heavy duty. Great!!But, what isn’t so great is the blending power.We filled it halfway with smoothie ingredients for two - fresh and frozen blueberries, juice and plain yogurt. However, on the highest power, it just whirred the center and then nothing else moved. We kept adding water to it until it would actual suck in all the contents from the sides. By the time we got it to blend the drink, we ended up with a watery smooth that STILL had full blueberries in the bottom of our drinks. What kind of blender can’t disintegrate blueberries at its highest power?If this was a local purchase, we would have returned it immediately.It gets 3 stars instead of 1 because it DOES do well with thin liquids and milkshakes (with enough fluids added).  But as a smoothie blender? We are still shopping for one."
"It’s not bad, struggles in some areas. Definitely can’t function on dry foods or foods without liquid. Also leaks when thing being blended is hot.Bought this to make homemade tomato soup, leaked out the bottom. Idk if it’s bc the seal literally break if you turn bottom like even 45 degrees or if seal breaks from heat.In either case, gets the job done, nothing special. Average 3/5"
"I give it a 3.75⭐ as it is not perfect. It looks nice, just seems low quality parts and I think I'll  be lucky to have it 2 yrs. Blends quick. The bottom is kinda loose fitting....gotta elbow grease the bottom lid in to prevent leakage...which will wear n tear on the gasket, that's not really made well. Does the job, tnough, for now, until I can afford a better model."
You get what you pay for
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I’ve used B&D kitchen products for years but this blender makes me rethink that relationship. I bought this because it was reasonably priced for a sturdy glass blender, but apart from that it’s fallen flat. Can’t operated a thick shake with frozen fruit. I’m constantly having to thin it out so it’ll work. Often the blade will just spin with nothing happening like in the video. The plastic base cracked when my wife tried to hand tighten it after washing. I’ll be throwing this out and searching for a better replacement."
"Pros:Glass JarWill eventually puree and crush iceCons:Plastic housing looks/feels cheap and flimsyPlastic housing make for a very loud blenderThe lid is 100% hard thin plastic: there is just no way it is going to last""Quick Clean"" is a joke--you can put warm water and dish soap in ANT blender and get the same result"
"I was in the market for a blender and I purchased this one just because the jar is glass and I didn't want plastic. The seal on my lid pops off everytime I put the lid on so it doesn't really ""seal"" I'll make a smoothie with just bananas and milk and it sounds like the motor is struggling. Feel like this blended won't last long."
"For an appliance only used once a week, I would expect it to last for years. Won’t turn on now. It did the job for almost a year and half."
"Started fuming and making strange noises within 9 months of use. It did make a tonne of noise when I used it. I did use it at least 4 times a week for smoothies while I had it and did blend up well, but I would have liked it to last much longer"
"If you’re blending up frozen food like I do for a daily smoothy, this blender is not for you. The blades are too low to blend the frozen chunks. It’s a nice blender but not for what I need it for."
"Worked wonderfully and was super happy. Unfortunately it broke after 8 months using it for heavy items like ice and frozen fruit for smoothies, but that's my expectation of a blender. Started smelling like smoke/burnt dust and goes super high pitch/buzzes off counter and doesn't finely blend my greens anymore but leaves little bits unchopped. Prior to this could even use it to blend/process graham crackers for graham cracker pie crusts and loved it--super fine. Unfortunately isn't strong/durable enough for smoothies beyond 1 year of use, which doesn't cut it for me."
It will never blend all the frozen fruit in my smoothie. In every single smoothie literally every single one I have a few pieces of fruit not blended. I regret my purchase. Should have gotten a better one. Don’t be me.
"This AM, my 1st time to use B&D blender (it arrived yesterday).  It leaks --out the bottom.  Yes, I secured all correctly--& tightly.  Also, the lid is silly cheap & the 2 holes in top (for adding veggies, fruit) my goodness those holes are so small--why are they there? Who wants to dice items before putting them in a blender? It's noisy as all get out. To make the one smoothie, I had to stop the process several times to stir up items because the motor isn't powerful enough to do so and the blades are dorky. The glass jar is WONDERFULLY heavy! This is why I give B & D's blender 3 points. Am returning today.  I like Black & Decker. This blender is beneath them. --PS: PLASTIC, it's on the lid, base..cheap plastic at that. But, like I said what a great, heavy, glass jar!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It's what you'd expect for $25, cheap junk that broke and blew the internal bearings within 2 months of occasional use. It won't blend frozen fruit, leaves big unblended chunks. This might work for powders or shakes, but that's about it.  Wouldn't purchase again."
"You’re getting what you pay for getting a cheaper blender. Had this for about a year and it ~technically~ works fine, but the blade power kinda sucks. Even just smoothies with frozen fruit (not event ice) take forever to get well blended, and it starts to warm up and smell like plastic by the time you get the consistency you want. Will be upgrading to a different model soon"
"After using it for about a week I am trying to return for one issue. It blends well and is a good set up except for stuff getting stuck under the blades and not getting blended. For example, a protein bar broken up into pieces will not be blended completely as chunks will stay under the blades. You are left with a smoothie with chunks. Other than that it is easy to clean and pretty practical but that is a deal breaker for me as I don’t want chunks in my smoothie."
"I don’t use this for food. I use it for grinding up 3D prints and scrapes. The plastic grinds up well, but the fine pieces end up getting through gaps and flying out of the container."
"I bought this on Prime Day because it was inexpensive.  A good example of getting what you pay for.  It does a much worse job than my 30 year-old blender at simply blending things up, especially pureeing any kind of vegetables."
I feel as though the title says enough.
"I like the glass pitcher and ease of cleaning, but this is a bit of a toy. Top power and speed are limited. Four function is a bit of a joke since the ""Dice/Chop"" buttons and ""Ice Crush"" buttons are the same speed as the low and high speed buttons, repectively, but only stay on while you press them. If I bought another one, I'd go for the PowerCrush Digital with 900 watts of power."
"Blended ok and didn’t leak, but the lid windows are so hard to grab and open. They pop out of the hinge area and snap off never to hook up again. Can’t find any replacement parts but would not want the same top - hopefully improved design."
This POS always leaves a mini SCOOP of protein powder wedged in b/w the bottom. Worthless unless I'm making maragitas
"I received this today and will return it tomorrow.  I put the bottom on the way the instructions said.  Said to turn the blending jar upside down and place the blade assembly in bottom of opening, then place the jar base onto jar.  Rotate clockwise until it is tight.  I followed these directions and it leaked all over.  I tried it 3 or 4 times.  One of the times it didn't leak until I put it on the base and turned it on.  It leaked into the base and all over the counter.  I would not recommend this blender to anyone."
"I’m no gourmet. I was looking for a cheap blender to make my diet shakes. It works for what I need.  But it does have issues.Mainly, it leaks. Every time I use it, a little water comes out of the bottom of it. But it odd. Because it doesn’t continue to leak once I allow the little bit of water to drain off. It’s like it leaks the water when I first put it in the blender, but it seals when it starts blending?  I don’t know. But water comes out of the bottom every time."
It leaks
"This models lid is easy to remove but within 2 months the plastic hinged spout- there are 2 spouts - broke.  I was unable to return the blender since the return dated had closed so I called B&Ds replacement parts number. Although the blender was only 2 months old I was not offered a free replacement and had to pay $16.99 + tax and shipping. Then about a mother after I received the replacement of the new lid, the opposing spouts hinge snapped off! I called B&Ds replacement center and explained the situation and although the rep seemed to state that I’d get a free replacement, it’s been 2 months and it never arrived. So, I bought another model of B&D that had a single spout in the lid. I’ve had the new one about 2 days and this lip can’t be removed without opening the spout and using my FINGERS yanking it off. WTF? So now I contacted Amazon to return the recent blender."
"The jar is ok,but the motor is weak and sounds awfully underpowered!If you use ice .. 😂 it struggles so bad !Buy something better and save your 💰💰💰💰"
"Also, the diameter of the jar seemed like a posive thing whenloking at the picture but when used, it turns out the the machine is underplwered for its diameter so you will end up with chunks of unblended stuff no matter hw long you blend. The jar is big around, the machine is just plain slow and the blades are very small. Bad combination."
I wanted to love it but I ended up returning because it's so heavy which makes it hard to wash. I was afraid I would break it. Opted for the Hamilton Beach Stack & Snap Food Processor and Vegetable Chopper.
"first time trying my regular breakfast 'green' drink in this blender,  securely screwed in the bottom and added almond milk, fresh greens, protein powder and fresh apple, nothing frozen.  Leaked while sitting on the counter and kept leaking while whirring in the base.  Was not as strong as our old blender which just gave up the ghost, hence need a new one.  This one is getting returned immediately because it's not usable.  I thought the price was good but I guess it is ""too"" good."
"After a few months using it the only trouble I have is having to chop my veggies in pieces other wise it won’t blend and the blade will stay stuck, I’ve had to open it and move it with a spoon/fork so it can blend. Also the lid is somewhat hard to take off almost dropped the whole blender trying to remove it."
"My Oster blender broke down after 18 years and I decided to give this one a chance. I don't use it as much but since we just recently started to feed our dogs ""human food"" ( a mix of lentils, rice, vegetables and chicken), I  needed one blender that could grind well all of these foods combined. This blender didn't do the job. I was happy to see that the blades are so safe when cleaning them BUT they do not actually grind the food. I tried smaller pieces of cooked chicken breast with stock and they would only be tossed around but never were cut/grinded. I cannot return it anymore so it will go out to be donated. Don't waste your money. I'm getting another Oster and I'm hoping is as good as my last one."
"While the blender works, the glass container is far too heavy for people with arthritis or recent hand or arm surgeries.  Had to return."
I bought this for smoothies.  I love the glass carafe but I have to constantly take the cover off and mix it around with a spoon so get it moving. The blades are going but the mixture is not moving and it sounds like the blender is gonna burn out.
I went through all the trouble to get a blender with a glass vessel and then almost everything else on it is made out of cheap plastic. I would only recommend buying this if it is exceedingly inexpensive
"Got this so my son could start making shakes. Came without a lid, we have to put a small plate over the top so stuff doesn't fly out the top..."
It stopped working after using for one night only
"I just got it, but it feels and looks cheaply made (like plastic material) compared to my previous Oster brand. Hopefully it'll last (???)!!! Ho hum..."
"I wanted a blender with a glass jar and I had a previous B&D blender that was fabulous.  I purchased this one and didn't open it right away or I would have returned it.  The blades are so short that it does not mix berries, spinach or most things I put in a shake.  Save your money.I am looking to see if I can replace the blender blades with longer ones.  An extra expense but at least that should make it usable."
I was processing some chilly peppers and suddenly overheated and stopped working.
"Base is sturdy, glass jar is thick and hefty.  However, the blades are very dull. You will always have large chunks of berries in your smoothie no matter how long you blend.Also, it does not rinse clean even for quickly blending two drinks in a row.  This is thanks to a small amount of space between a lower neck of the jar and the blade component and seal. It allows the liquid to infiltrate all the way to the bottom seal.  This will then work its way back up to contaminate your next blend."
"This blender blade is so sad. Totally useless blender. How is this a Black and Decker product? Thout a reputable brand could pull of a basic, run of the mill blender. Do not buy this thing"
"Great price, good brand but very disappointed. The blades on this blender are very small. It doesn't mix well. Nice glass pitcher but otherwise cheaply made. Spend a little more and get a good one."
Love the way it works
"I just open my blender thinking it's better than the Hamilton I got, but its worse it couldnt even blend my smoothie and return window is closed so am stack with it."
"For the price,  I expected better crushing power.  Pretty heavy as well"
"l bought this blender mainly to make smoothies, but l was very disappointment in it's power to crush ice, or even to blend a milkshake. Should have sent it back!"
I was puréeing a butternut squash to make soup and had it on for about five minutes off and on as I scraped stuff down and it wouldn’t turn back on.
"I purchased this blender as a housewarming gift. I didn't think to open it, since it was a gift to someone else. The housewarming party was this past weekend and the blender pour spout was broken. I can't return or replace it since the window is closed."
This blender is alright but the engine burnt out quickly given the fact I only use it about twice a week and maintained it really well.
"I haven't used this blender much. Not even 2 months in my possession and it's already broken! The off button stopped working. I tried unplugging and plugging but it continues to run and I can't shut it off. What are my options here?? Garbage, refund, return?!"
It DOES NOT work!They sent us a defective blenderThe moment out of box:brochure is crumbledProtective sheet were missing.Total refurbished and DisappointmentWaste of time.
"We've used this blender maybe 4 times and it's dead.  In the middle of making milkshakes, whick is all I used it for.  Totally disappointed."
Does a pretty good job but has trouble crushing ice.
I was looking for a blender that wasn't just for smoothies. Used it for a few months and 2 days ago I went to crush ice. Put a small amount of cubes in and it started smelling like it was burning inside so I turned it off. Couldn't see a damage but when I turned it back on and it didn't work. tried other receptacles and nothing. Dead!! Don't buy it!!
Good value- bought it for a gift
"Motor sounds horrible, like it's going to burn out, while liquifying very soft beans. I hate to think what it would sound like crushing ice."
The blade are really bad. It is. It sharp enough to blend so well. It takes forever to blend. Had to add lots of water to blend it well Or you have to keep stopping the blender and mix a little with your spoon to strat blending again. It is a little frustrating to do it.
"Quit working after 1 1/2 months.  2 weeks past the return time. Waste of money. Blade will spin, but not blend anything."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            In general it’s a good product… BUT ..I have only used it a couple of times (literally) and today I wanted to make smoothie…but I have noticed that that glass was broken and very tiny pieces of glass could be in smoothie IF I wouldn’t notice it on time. I believe that special plastic might be better for a blender…FYI I only washed it with my hands, not in a dishwasher. Have no clue how the glass broke…"
"What a piece of junk. Stopped working on day 2. Although I was very careful not to push how long it ran (no more than 2 minutes at a time), it over heated and crapped out. When I opened the box & realized the (very nice) pitcher weighed more than the machine itself I thought I might be in trouble. I have since purchased a vintage blender off eBay and have been using it daiy for a year...going strong."
Hardly use.
"I like the blender overall, but have used it only 3 times. When I took it out of the box part 1 on the top (made of very cheap plastic) broke. I contacted amazon and they were unable to find a replacement. I decided to keep it and tonight when I was using it the center plastic piece broke off. I was not unnecessarily rough with it, so I believe it is just poor quality plastic that was used."
"- Would like a rod to push the ingredients down into the blades as stuff gets stuck floating above- There is a hot plastic smell after a few seconds of use, even with short bursts"
"As you can see from the pic, the plug could have easily tucked into the key but the cord isn't long enough. So, the blender doesn't sit flat on all 4 feet for storage.  The lid also doesn't have a big enough hole to drop things down into the jar while blending. That little slot can barely fit a jalapeno pepper, which is what I got this blender for - hot sauce making.  Not a good design. Haven't used it yet and already looking to return it."
"I received this January 3rd and didn’t use it until today Jan 15. I took it out the box, poured in some Sonic ice to make a slushy and as I poured in the orange syrup it literally came right out the bottom all over my counter. Just a big mess. Glad I decided to use it before the 30 day to return it…Also I tried to use it anyway with the little bit that was in it and noticed it didn’t power crush as it should. I had the small dots of ice like the hospital ice so it should have been easy to crush but it only crushed a little. I had to take it off and adjust the ice for it to crush and it still didn’t do much. I think ill just buy one at a store instead of online because now I have to go out to find a Amazon fresh just to return it this sucks!"
Terrible blender . Can’t even blend Ice . Gets stuck every 2 seconds . Don’t buy . It’s terrible and gets weaker after every use
"I've owned this blender for over a year now, and while I have made many smoothies with it, I can say there hasn't been a single time that I haven't absolutely hated using it. I tell my girlfriend its not a blender, its an air-pocketer. Because it doesn't blend at all, it just makes a big air pocket at the bottom of whatever you're trying to blend."
The cord is too short.  You can’t even pull it out from under the cabinet to use it.  Worst purchase ever.
I got this to make bulletproof coffee because the glass jar is safer than using plastic for hot liquids. Everything works as expected except the lid which depending on the speed will spray hot coffee through the two hinged pouring flaps all over the place depending on the speed blending and how much coffee is in the blender. I've found less coffee at lower speed sprays worse than more at higher speed which seems counterintuitive. Trying to make this work by holding a towel over the lid while blending until I can find a more solid lid.
"This blender said for smoothies all over the description. Ugh! It’s basically a joke. A good smoothie blender you can run for 30 seconds and it’s ready. Now, I don’t mind the extra time if it goes longer to get it going but I should not have to help my blender mix up my smoothie for it. I have to constantly pull the cover off and mix it around with a spoon so get it moving. Otherwise the blades are going and the mixture is not moving for like 15 seconds at a time and it sounds like the blender is gonna burn out completely. And if anything is frozen like strawberry slices, forget it…it can’t mix it. It’s a blender!!! How can it not blend frozen stuff? It has an ice setting too…so how?! Not very good unless your ingredients are all room temperature. One positive is the glass is great. Nice and thick and sturdy."
Blender leaks like a sieve from the bottom of receptacle.  Unusable.
"Loved the formidable glass container. Super easy to use and clean, but for some reason it doesn't have a rubber ring for holding fluids. So the plastic starts to break off where the blades are, pretty much immediately. And those end up in your drink. So you have a chance of swallowing plastic if you're not careful.  It often sounds like there's metal or plastic inside the blender moving around while you're blending.  Also, it's good at all for blending hot drinks. Which is what I bought it for, initially.  As well as smoothies. But I make Bulletproof coffee in the morning, and when I do, I have to physically, with a towel, hold the lid down with all my weight, because for some reason it's not pressurized. So hot coffee will spew all over the kitchen if I don't.  I have not experienced that with any other blender.  As of today, the blender is pretty much useless as most of the plastic around the blades has broken off completely. So I just ordered a Hamilton Beach blender and I'm going to try my luck there. Don't mean to be the bearer of bad news or be a guy who writes negative reviews but you should know what you are purchasing if you decide to buy this. Sorry Black & Decker."
It seemed sturdy but broke with no warning within a month.
"Best thing about this blender is the storage space for the cord. It's under it,  simple thing but if you've ever had a blender and tried wrapping cord around handle on pitcher you'll appreciate it as well.  Other than that, it's just ok. You have to help it along with blending and the lid is hard to take off."
"The blender bottle was difficult to screw on tightly and leaked easily.  That being said, it worked really well for my daily protein shakes....for a total of 4 months. Definitely not worth the money."
I replaced an older blender that started leaking after 2 years. This one leaked from the first time. Cleaning up the counter tops every time is too much hassle.
"When making a Smoothie, despite leaving blender on for a length of time, it still leaves fragments of unblended fruit."
"It is super easy to clean, but I've seen other blenders with more power and in the future I'll choose one of those. I have a difficult time blending drinks and getting all the ice to blend properly. But it gets the job done eventually. Overall I'm satisfied."
"Love my Oster. Broke the pitcher, thought I would try this. It works, but just everything about it is cheap. Not sturdy, and you have to stand there and hold the button to blend your drink. Spend the extra money! Not Worth itI returned…went back to the Oster. 😎"
"The lid has pour and access flaps that will very easily break off and costs half the price of the machine to replace. Also, the lid is held on to tight by the seal and is very difficult to remove with not much to grasp. Also, the cord is almost long enough. The rest of the machine works great if it lasts."
"Paying $50 for a blender doesn't get you much with Black & Decker.  So, if you're looking for thin-plastic, cheaply-made light weight blender that won't hold up for 5-10 yrs like the old inexpensive blenders, this $50 blender is for you. It doesn't feel or look like it could last through one season. I'll update my review if I'm proven wrong when I start making smoothies this summer.  Also note that the lid ""ingredient slot"" is only 7/8 of an inch wide so this is a poorly-designed, limited-use feature, unless you don't mind cutting up items quite small to fit through that tiny slot (which defeats the purpose of a blender) ."
"Leaking from jug, very disappointing"
"I purchased this blender in October 2020. It worked great for about 6-8 months. I noticed buttons sticking pretty early on. A few months ago, one button stuck completely and I can no longer use it. Please note, I used this blender every day for smoothies and cleaned it after each use. Overall, I think this blender is great for someone who doesn't need it so often."
The lid wad impossible to temovr
Makes a very disconcerting resonant noise when it's running. Sounds like it will eventually break prematurely. The lid really requires two hands to remove and I find it awkward. Lots of places in the lid to trap food and a big crevice at the bottom of the glass that will trap food. I'm returning mine. It's like they built this thing and never tested it.
I definitely got what I paid for and I believe that it does the job in that sense. But if you’re looking for something super powerful that will make smoothie super quick this isn’t the right blender for you.
It leaked when adding vegetables; would not mix the ingredients; small motor.
"The first time I tried to use it as a blender, I had great difficulty getting the blades free from the container. I had to soak it in hot water.  I use the blending cup for smoothies, it works well but I have trouble getting the blades in the right the place where they will blend. When I am through blending, it is often a challenge to remove the blending cup from the devise. What am I doing wrong? The other reviews were very good."
"If you’re looking at this blender to replace an existing magic bullet, please reconsider. None of your existing cups, blades or attachments will work with this unit. Not to mention there are no accessories available for this model either so you’re stuck with one cup and one flip top lid.The blade also holds water after it is washed, even if it is not submerged. They claim the blade is dishwasher safe (I have only hand washed), but considering the amount of water that is held inside after a simple hand wash, I would not recommend putting in the dishwasher.In terms of blending, it’s pretty good, but even with a larger cup, the max fill line is oddly low due to how large the blade is. It is also really loud."
"Works ok, but is not powerful enough for smoothies at all."
"The blades stop a lot, especially when you’re trying to crush ice. Will make a smoothie or food gets stuck and the blade stop. I’m really not pleased with The product sorry I purchased this."
"PROSNice compact design, saves spaceEasy to usePowerful for the size and price (sometimes stalls worth tons of ice or making almond butter / hummus) but can handle less viscous projects easilyCONSStopped working after 2 months of use. Disappointing and past the return date"
I returned this because it doesn’t crush frozen fruit or ice. Not powerful at all. I decided to spend more and get a Ninja. Very glad I did.
"It doesn't even break up ice. It doesn't chop up much at all. I put ice and tons of liquid and it still didn't chop the ice, left them in big ole Chunks. I do NOT Recommend this. it's Not Sharp enough. It Just Spins things around  it's a Sad little piece of Equipment"
"Blender worked well  on its first run on a smoothie with no ice. However, when I tried to use it another day for the second time, I started smelling burning plastic and the machine stopped working completely. Had to return it. Not sure if it was just this particular machine that had a defect. Either way, maybe I should invest in something more expensive."
"Purchased June 11, 2024 and worked ok.  Stopped working yesterday and performed all trouble shooting steps before calling manufacturers customer service.  Rep had me repeat all troubleshooting steps and change containers even though the same connector to the blender is used.  Truly dumb.  Had me on hold for another 5 minutes or so, only to tell me that I should send the product back {up to 72 hrs to receive authorization} and after inspection and I called to tell them I shipped product they would get back to me.  A total waste of my time.  Recommend a NEVER purchase."
Bought this 6 months ago and used it to only make morning smoothies. It just up and quit. HUGE waste of money. My old original lasted years and used it for all kinds of things. This one isn't even close to the quality of the original!!!!!!
"We had ours since June and it’s already dead. I recommend you go with another brand that actually last. Before this, we had an LG $20 blender they lasted for four years when they finally died we decided to upgrade to this, but instead it was a downgrade."
"they do not sell replacement cups or blades for this blender. the width of the screw on base does not fit old cups, and the only way to get new cups or a blade is to fully buy another kit with the base included. they do not sell them on amazon or even the official magic bullet website. as far as im aware they also do not sell the flat blade (for blending things like nuts or coffee beans) at all. the blender works fine but it completely kills any potential efficiency without having another cup or blade to use. im going to have to return it."
Product worked well but it was a poor design. The blade connection piece held water once washed. After the first time it was washed we shook it and there was water stuck in it. After a few times it started to smell like sour milk. We took it apart and there was mold and chunk of smoothie mix stuck in the inside of the blade attachment. We cleaned it and tried to put it back together and it would not work the right way. Ended up having to buy a different blender. Very disappointed.
"The blender just stopped yesterday after barely 4.5 month in. I will not recommend anybody to get this blender, such a waste of money!!!!"
"Worked good for 2months but doesn't turn on now, its burnt up."
I didn’t even want to use it!!
Very small blades. Very loud and feels cheap like it won't last long.
Bought this thinking it would be an upgrade from our  nutribullet. Turns out there are no accessories available as this is a new product and no word as to what and when they may be available. Beyond that the blender underperforms. It’s not powerful enough to blend pitted dates and water.
It's only the 4th time I used it and it stopped mid blend WTH 😭
I have bought several magic bullets and they seem to work for a while and then till they dont.  So I bought this thinking it would be better bigger and I could make a large smoothie.  But this has stopped working all together now.
Of all the magic bullet models i’ve owned this one has the WORST time trying to blend frozen fruit. Will be returning it and getting a nutribullet
"I returned it. The blender cup has such a rounded bottom. It barely stands up by itself. The design was very awkward as the drink cover flips up, but then does not stay in place just falls down on your nose."
It's impossible to find additional individual smoothie cups for this product. My previous magic bullet cups are too small to connect to the blade/motor base.
Takes forever to get through stuff and won’t blend frozen blueberries
"Blending was fine. But then ran it through the dishwasher as it is listed as dishwasher safe ,there is now water stuck inside the blender piece that I'm sure will be causing mold."
Pure garbage.  Won't even start with the first use.
"1) There is no reverse blade direction; paste that gets shunted to the top of the blending canister farthest away from the spinning blade doesn't get pulverized....unless additional fluid is added, which dilutes and thins the smoothie.2) If the residue on the blade is too thick to drip back into the blending canister, that portion of the smoothie must be discarded because the blades are too sharp to attempt saving the serving glued onto them.3) The screw top lids for the canisters are very susceptible to misthreading when screwing them down on the canisters. Also, while drinking, portions of the blended beverage collect and cake within the threads4) Very loud motor.5) 49 numbered warning statements for use and care of the device."
It works fairly good sometimes it doesn’t blend frozen fruit to my liking but overall it’s pretty good
"I was looking for an upgrade to the portable blender I was using for protein shakes.  I wanted something with metal blades so I could blend frozen fruit and ice. This blender works very well. It also has a small footprint which is a plus with my limited countertop space. It is noisy, but that was to be expected.And then there are the cups.  I can confidently say that I hate them!  Here are my reasons why:*They are too small in capacity, it would be much better if they were 20oz.  I have not been able to locate larger cups that would fit this blender.*And then there is the inside diameter. I do not have large hands, but I cannot get my hand in there to clean the inside properly after using.*They do not have enough measurement marks on the side so I have to use a measuring cup to get the proper amount of liquid when making my shakes.*The lids are terrible. Mine came with the flat ones, not the ones that are diagonal. They do not stay open. When I drink, they flop down and spread protein shake on my nose!*The unit is designed to be space saving but the cups don’t nestle well, which then forces me to keep them single file in the counter wasting precious space.*The cups are made for traveling, but there is no accommodation for being able to attach it to a carabiner. I instead have to use a paracord handle to then attach it to my carabiner.I’m enjoying the drinks I have been able to make with this unit, but overall I’m very disappointed in its limitations and the fact that it seems to cause more work and time wasted for me. I had another blender in my cart that was a little less powerful but what looked to be the perfect cup, but I decided on the Ninja because of its ratings. BIG MISTAKE FOR ME."
I purchased this blender awhile back and I use it also every morning for my smoothies.  It has been awesome except for the blender top.  It will start leaking out and the blender gets very loud.  I’ve had to buy a new blender top 3 times now and it is starting to happen again!!!!  This is very frustrating!!!!
"This blender works well, but I can’t find any cups or blade assemblies to fit it.  So frustrating because we have to wash the blade assembly and cups every day, and put the smoothies in other cups to drink them, so our family can all use it."
For the price it’s alright I got it at a discount but overall not good for juices it’s basically a mini blenderAnd will leak on to sides of cut. Figure out you need to fill way under fill line
"I’m not enjoying the fact that I have to hold down the cup as it’s mixing. It has issues chopping frozen fruit, but it will eventually get the job done."
"IF you do NOT want to wash the Container(s) by HAND....you will eventually encounter the INABILITY of conveniently making a Quick Smoothie!Eventhough the Seller lists it as Dishwasher (Friendly), this causes the Plastic to Expand ever so slightly and over time (each Dishwashing session), the LID (w/ Blade) will NOT correctly FIT!I spent nearly ONE HOUR trying to FIT my Container to the LID w/ Failure.  Finally, I decided to use the 2nd (original) Container and the LID slipped down over the Container w/o ANY lining up OR threading of creases in order to MIX my SMOOTHIE!"
"On the whole I like Ninja products,  I bought this because it was light weight, yet had a 700 watt motor.  But als I didn't use it because the capacity was too small.  I wanted a small individual size but this was just a dlittle too small.  I will get the next size up capacity."
"This is a good little blender for its size, however, it is frustrating that you have to hold it in place the whole time for it to blend.  This is super annoying!  Also, it doesn't hold enough, so not good if you put much in your smoothie."
"This blender seems to be sturdy and solid, it did blend ice but to buy replacement parts or accessories is impossible because it’s not a Ninja and it’s not a Shark it says Nutri blender."
Works nice and is not too loud. Only issue for me is it leaking a little bit. Other than that it crushes ice amazingly and is good for my smoothie needs. Inexpensive too!
"Unfortunately the seal isn’t great so it would leak. Also not much power, don’t expect to crush ice into your smoothie."
"The blender works okay, but it seems to blend everything closer to the blade while everything on top just sits there.  I often have to blend then take off the blade, mix everything around and then put the blade back on to blend again. This happens often when blending anything with small pieces of frozen fruit.  If you are working with larger pieces of frozen fruit I would stick with using a larger blender."
The cups that come with it are 16oz.  I wish you could buy larger cups but I guess I would have to go with a larger base unit too.  The lids that come with this leak.  It seems like there should be a rubber gasket or something but there isn't.  The blender does pretty good with ice and it mixes protein shakes fast.  I haven't tried it with anything else as I just drink protein shakes.
"Purchased September 2019.I LOVE this blender!  I use it every single morning for my breakfast smoothie.  It handles 4 ice cubes the half moon shaped kind, about 16 frozen blueberries, 1T frozen avocado, 2 large frozen strawberries plus the chia, flax meal & protein powder supplements blended with 2/3 cup liquid into a nice thick smoothie.💜. It takes about 30-45 seconds to grind it up to my texture preference.  I have made a few other smoothie and “shakes” and they’ve all turned out perfectly!  No hidden lumps like my previous magic bullet would leave. I purchased this one based off Amazon reviews, after my magic bullet motor began smoking and seized up.  I had the bullet for 5+ years so it was probably about time for it to die, anyway.  I was skeptical the Ninja would blend everything with no hidden lumps, but was pleasantly surprised that it was so perfectly smooth and so much better than the bullet ever was!  I haven’t used the Ninja for anything other than making my smoothies so I cannot say if it does all the other chopping stuff it claims.I can say there are 3 drawbacks to it. The first is that it is extremely loud! I actually need to wear ear protection to operate it! Yup, that loud!  And second, you have to stand there and hold it down the whole time it’s grinding.  I liked the magic bullet for the option to push down-turn & lock into place so I could use that time to put ingredients away or something else for that 30-45 seconds (time is precious in the mornings) but it’s not a deal breaker.  Last, if the lid isn’t on completely super tight, the contents can be vibrates out and it’s a nightmare to clean the motor!  The cups and blades are easy to clean.January 5th, 2020.Put my same smoothie together, the one listed at the beginning of this review, put cup onto the grinder and pushed down.  The gear teeth BLEW UP!  Literally blew up!  Pieces shot out everywhere! I couldn’t figure out what or how it happened!  I will be contacting customer service to see what can be done and if they will send me a replacement blade.  I will follow up on that.  But be forewarned, there’s a possibility of the gear blowing up!  This was the only reason I chose to write a review."
"I unpacked the Ninja Fit Compact Personal Blender and washed all the parts. Using a bottle brush, I washed the blades thinking I was being careful, well I cut myself anyway on my hand holding the screw-on blade.  I thought, wow this sharp and also, what a bad design.  I thought I could live with this, but then I put it all together, filled the cup with water and a little coconut oil  and fruit to test it out.  I turned it upside down and it leaked... What?  I looked closer and it was cross threaded, which makes sense why it leaked but I struggled putting it together.  I took it apart, put it together again and finally can get started.  I put the cup in place and realize the ONLY way to keep this running it to press down rather hard and hold it there.  WHAT A TERRIBLE DESIGN. Good for not burning out the motor, but a REAL PAIN and Annoying to the point I don't want to use it.  I needed to mix for a couple of minutes, which is a long time to stand there and press down hard.  The regular ninja 72 ounce blender I have bought in the past and it was great.  I would not recommend this product though.  Too many problems."
I ordered this brand because I had a previous model that had served me for many years.  I expected that the cups from the previous model would be able to be utilized in this model.  That's not the case.  It also sounds like it's screaming a little when it is being used.  It sounds cheaply made. Pretty sure it's not going to last anywhere near the amount of time as the last one.
I emptied a frozen Margarita (Pre-mix) and wanted to add a little extra. Consistency of a slushy. The Blender almost didn't start (overload). Turning the whole unit upsidedown starting and gradually turning it back solved the problem but it shouldn't be necessary.
"Its good, used once, will keep updated, seems like a great product but dnt forget to take warranty"
lack of quality control to make sure both cups seat into blender tightly.  I finally threw the second cup away as I always had to clean the blender after using it...bummer of a product
The noise from the motor is deafening. I have to shake the container manually before continuing the blending process because ingredients stick to the sides of container. Did not get expected value for my money.
"I was disappointed by this product I figured the blades would do a really good job blending ingredients. I previously had a starfrit blender that broke after a few years of use and I used it with frozen smoothie mixes mostly. When I went to use this Ninja blender on the same frozen smoothie mix, it did not blend nearly as well, there weee still bits of greens not blended in the first one I made. I attached a photo of a banana almond smoothie that I tried to blend and you can see big chunks still after a lot of time blending. Very disappointing it doesn’t even do the one thing it’s supposed to do"
Lasted a whole 4.5 months. Only made smoothies and only 1 or 2 a weekend. So great blender for up to 30 smoothies. First ninja product to fail on on me.
"I was full of hope when buying my Ninja fit. I'm an own the  NutriBbullet 900 series also. It's been great through the years. It's made terrific smoothies, and will chop, smash, and blend veggies and fruits like no one's business. The problem with the Bullet is the inability to effectively crush ice. My go-to daily morning drink these days, is a homemade coffee vanilla Frappuccino style drink, made to the consistency of the frozen Margarita.  Enter the Ninja Fit. It really does the ice crushing duties with no sweat. It is a bit louder than my Bullet, but it takes so little effort to do its job, it's not operating long enough to irritate me. However, the cups that are provided with the Ninja fit are definitely an irritation. Although they are 16oz cups, because of the height  of the ice crushing blades, the extension of them into the cups, prevent them from being able to hold 16ozs. The final prepared drink will be closer to  12-13ozs. From the 32ozs cups of the Bullet, down to the 12 to 13ozs of the Ninja, has been an adjustment. I'm not sure why Ninja didn't make the cups slightly larger, so they actually could hold 16oz of beverage. My morning Frappuccino has been the only drink I've made in the Ninja and the only reason I purchased it. It does do the job easily and reliably."
"Got it in September, went to use it (December) and it didn’t even try to work. Everybody else works on the outlet."
"If you're looking for something for the kitchen, this ain't it."
"We’ve used it regularly, but did not expect switch to fail. Now we have to unplug to get it to turn off."
Used a similar ninja bullet at a friends recently. The one I used at my friends is no longer available so I bought this one hoping it would be just as good but it is not that good at all. I do not recommend buying this.
Everything is great except one of the cups has an issue where the blending lid will not go on evenly and it causes a mess when using it. So I just threw that cup away. But the other cup works fine thankfully. As you can see in the photo the left side has a gap where the right side does not. (This was after I tried using it and made a mess everywhere in the blender)
Blends well but it’s leaked from day 1 with one of the cups. Would not recommend.
This is a just okay product. I was very disappointed with it especially seeing as how it is a Ninja product.
"The blender worked reasonably well with me although right before the end, it struggled with a full cup of frozen fruit and finally, it just stopped working.  I ordered the next size up of a Ninja personal blender with a more powerful motor to hopefully last longer."
"I'm pretty bummed about this purchase. To make one protein shake, I have to mix my liquid and powder in two separate batches. It still overflows every dang time. It gets all in the machinery, all over my counter, and all over my hands. I looked in vain for bigger replacement containers - a 24-ounce container would be ideal, but I haven't yet found one. (If anyone does, PLEASE let me know!)I got this only for smoothies, and I wish I'd spent the extra to get a bigger canister. It's got great power, but the size is so limiting that it's a massive pain in my butt every single day.If you are getting this for protein shakes, I promise you that it will not be big enough. Don't let the ""16 ounce"" size fool you."
If you do tomatoes in it . You can but no chance of making juice
"One pitcher started leaking during operation in the first week, and the other started leaking a week after. A messy and inconvenient failure. It blended great until it leaked, but it's far too expensive to have to deal with that."
"Zero stars if I could!Bought in mid February. I have used it LESS than a five times. I washed it by hand by ""blending"" soapy water and then rinsing in hot water. Never disassembled the blade piece. Went to use it last night mid April and ended up with all the blade pieces in my drink canister and a mess everywhere. The bolt that keeps the blades in place doesn't remain screwed into the base piece as it it somehow stripped maybe? I clicked on the link for help and page doesn't exist. Go to website and they don't list this! Called them and was told the parts are not covered by warranty. I asked to escalate. And after lots of discussion and advising I would be blasting them on social media since I hadn't even used it 5 times in the first 90 days...they agreed to send parts. Waiting for arrival. I asked if the juice that ended up inside was going to ruin the motor. She said to use a qtip and clean it out. I pointed out it is under the gear...I cannot use a qtip there. She said they will have record if I have more problems to call back again.Not so sure I'd buy this again based on reliability of product and hassle from customer service."
We have only had this blender for two and a half months and the motor burned out and started smoking while making a protein smoothie. We were very happy with it at first although it is a bit noisy. We used it on average 1 - 2 times per day for smoothies. Disappointing for sure. Second ninja product we have been unhappy with. Will not be buying this brand again.
This product gets the job done…eventually.Lid comes loose while blending and the blender stops so you have to tighten it and retry. Leaks and makes a mess in the process. I do not overfill it (I thought this might’ve been the issue at first.)It also can’t handle frozen fruit. So what’s the point??I don’t think this product is worth the price.
"I had a nutribullet and it stopped working after about 2 years. Got this one as a replacement and while it’s convenient and works ok for softer foods (banana, blueberry, peanut butter, avocado etc) if you want to use nuts or apples or berries I recommend the nutribullet instead. This doesn’t seem to blend things  quite as fine. Cheaper though? And with the nutribullet only lasting two years I’m still not sure what I should get."
"I'm writing this review as a warning to others after my Ninja Blender suddenly stopped working despite gentle use. I've had this blender for about 6 months, using it approximately 2 times a week for basic tasks like smoothies.Pros:- Initially, the blender performed well, handling ingredients with ease- Easy to clean and maintain- Sleek design and compact sizeCons:- Unexpectedly stopped working after minimal use (approx. 30 uses)- Poor durability and reliability for a product at this price pointI'm extremely disappointed in the Ninja Blender's performance and lifespan. Given its gentle use, I expected it to last much longer. The sudden failure has left me questioning the product's quality and value.If you're considering purchasing a Ninja Blender, I recommend exploring other options or being prepared for potential reliability issues. Perhaps I received a defective unit, but my experience has led me to doubt the brand's claims of durability and performance."
"I have been using this for about 15 months and the cup is an everyday frustration. It is just too small if you are putting anything more than some liquid, a few ice cubes, and some protein powder. Seems how I like whole foods, this just ends up a mess almost every morning. Why put up with it so long, you ask? I am cheap and it does a really good job of blending things and it fits nicely on the counter and I can rinse it out and throw it in the dishwasher. This will be finding a new home with a gym rat."
"I bought this for my 87 year old mom, and she just loves it. She’s had a couple of accidents with the lid not being secured before blending, but the machine works flawlessly.I started using it, and I have been so impressed that I bought another one for myself.Every day I make a smoothie with frozen fruit, yogurt, kefir, pomegranate juice, milk, and Splenda, and the machine has no problem blending even the biggest whole frozen strawberries in seconds.It’s a bit loud, but blenders aren’t really known for being quiet. This isn’t as loud as mom’s Vitamix, if that’s useful to anyone.I am not a bot, and I was not paid or compensated in any way for this review.Edit: I believe mine might have a bad motor. It struggles to blend fruit sometimes, and it gets hot and gives off a worrisome burning plastic odor. Also, the gasket in the lid won’t stay put. I’m probably going to try to get this replaced, because I use it multiple times daily."
"One cup constantly miss threads. There’s more liquid in the base than in the cup. Just as you tighten it, it slips open. I would have returned it if I had not just missed the window. On a positive note, it has good power and performs quickly when it is not leaking. One cup works fine."
"No matter how tightly the blade is screwed to the container or how I hold it when it is running, it leaks.There is a design flaw that allows liquid to escape the container."
"I have to use my earplugs when using this mixer. It does the job, but boy, is it loud."
"This is the second one that I’ve purchased. The return window is short. Probably because they know it’s going to fall apart. In order to keep it from leaking you have to put the top on so tightly that it’s very difficult to get off after you’re done blending. Even then sometimes it’s still leaks. Then the motor starts acting strangely. It should turn on and off based on having the cup in and pressure applied. But now when I take the cup out, the blender doesn’t stop, I have to unplug it. It’s a piece of junk And they won’t let me return it. And again this is the second one this year. Definitely won’t be buying another."
"Blender setup is easy and takes up little space in cupboard. When making a simple protein shake with ice, the blender doesn’t have much power to blend it. Sometimes has a weird “burning” smell after blending because it struggled.  It guess you get what you pay for on a cheap blender."
"I bought this item in March 2022. I have used it at work and home in this time somewhat often, but not anything excessive. Well today it overheated so much in the middle where it was spinning it was about to cook what I was mixing in it. The last few months it has had a slight unpleasant smell when I used it. I no longer feel comfortable using the item. After 1.5 years of moderate use for the price point, I guess it’s okay."
Ninja was received dirty from prior use. Cups were new and unused but the bottom (the blender) had old dried choc on it.  I thoroughly cleaned it and used it to see how it worked. It was amazing so I’m keeping it. AMAZON don’t sell used items as new without inspection. I’m Usually happy with everything I buy!
After only using the blender a few times I have been unable to remove the lid from the blender. It's so frustrating as I had thought this would be a decent blender being a Ninja. There is literally a blended protein smoothie sitting inside of the cup at this moment that I cannot drink due to the lid not being removable. I've had several people try to pry the lid off of the blender cup and it's a no-go. If I return the entire blender it's going to have the protein smoothie still inside the cup. What a tremendous waste of money. SUPER FRUSTRATED.
"I was excited to order this product on June 10, 2024.  I had radiation therapy to my nose and knew eating regularly for awhile was not going to work. Smoothies with strawberries, blueberries, and bananas, along with ice and a protein powder have become a daily pleasure. However, the more I use the blender the harder it is to screw the lids on.  My husband and I have each spent at least an hour trying to fit the lid to the container and screw it on.  It also leaks when I push down for motor action.  I won't be using it any longer and will be looking for something more substantial.  The fruits I use are soft, and I have never overfilled the container, so it should not have leaked."
"I wish I never purchased this product and got another blender.  I had never owned a Shark and heard great things so I wanted to give it a try and start a new diet routine by making power green smoothies instead of taco bell for lunch.  This worked great for 2 days and than it was such a hassle altogether I stopped using it at all.  First, it arrived and my initial impression was ""GD"" I should have ordered a bigger size blender.  I wanted the 16 oz blender size b/c I was only making smoothies for myself but sometimes when I put in the berries, fruit greens, juice, yogurt, I didn't have any room ice or additional fruits.  So I would make half of a batch (raspberries and yogurt) than make a second batch (blackberries, banana, and ice) and ultimately mix them together.  It worked but was a pain in the butt.  The second day all heck broke loose.  I had twisted on the lid and made a smoothie for lunch and than I couldnt' get the lid off.  I realized that the lid had sealed incorrectly, where half of the lid was twisted down correctly but the other half of the lid was higher up, but still the lid sealed and did not leak, but I couldnt' get it off. I tried multiple times that day, put the cup back in the fridge to go to work, and tried again later that night, and I couldn't  get it off.  I tried again the next day and still couldn't.  I went to the store and purchased a grip to remove lids, still nothing.  I kept it in my fridge to prevent rotting and had some friends try, nothing.  On the 4th day a friend took it out of the fridge and put it in the sink and ran hot water on the lid.  No one could get this off,  I contacted Ninja via email - no response.  Finally, I got pliers and got it off.  After that I was over it.  Super disappointed from the lid issues to leaking issues thereafter, I was just really disappointed.  I took a 10 year old blender from my parents house and it works just fine.  I was super disappointed from my first ninja."
"If we had to break down this personal blender after almost a year of use I would give it's ability to blend a protein shake with ice a 8/10. Holding down a full cup of ice, milk and powder for about 40 seconds gets a fairly smooth blend. It does struggle a bit getting items like chocolate chips or too much ice to a nice smoothness. Cleaning the cups? 10/10. The base? 0/10. After a leak from a cup one day, we discovered dried  shake in the base, which says not to submerge. We tried using a toothbrush, brush, etc. Nothing working. One day after pressing down on the cup to blend it decided to get stuck and needed to be unplugged to stop. 20 minutes of manual cleaning later and it was working again. It's a good little blender, just watch out for spills."
"You think you have close the led tightly, and then it starts running out once you start to blend it. I have had it almost a year, and I stop using it for a coupler months. Now, it do not work. I only use it for protein mixing. I like it some, but do not waste your money on this product. no matter I many time I checked for it not to link out, it would. This is my second time trying one of these blender from Ninja brand."
"Hello,I was unable to find your customer contact information on Amazon, so I'm leaving a message here. I purchased this item last December and have only used it a few times (less than 10 times). Every time I used it, I noticed a smell like plastic, and the last time I used it, there was smoke, so I stopped using it. Is it safe to continue using it? If not, is there a way I can get it replaced?Thank you."
"Update: I received a replacement unit. From the very first use, following a recipe from the Ninja Recipe book that came with the unit, I started getting that smell that makes you thing the unit is burning out - So I CANNOT recommend this item and my overall rating goes to one star!Got this unit April 7th, 2021 and started using it a few days later, almost daily. Used it today 5/26/2021 - same ingredients and portions as usual. Well, after pulsating three times for 2, 1, and 1 minutes respectively, the spinach and kale were still not ground up and wrapped around the blades. I was afraid to pulse again as the unit was very hot and emitting a smell that made me apprehensive. I reviewed a number of different brands before settling on this Ninja so I am very disappointed that it failed in such a short time! To make matters worse, when I contacted the company they put me through an intense inquiry including viewing the item through my phones camera, before finally agreeing the warranty provided a replacement under the circumstances. Wait, there's more. The Rep advised I would have to pay shipping of $20.95 for the replacement unit but before all of that could happen I would now have to send photos of proof of purchase (NOTE: Amazon's customer service originally connected me to the company), Model no. and a photo of the units cut cord since they do not want the unit returned due to the ovid-19 pandemic. So, even though they eventually agreed the warranty should kick in after less than 2 months, I am less than comfortable with this item and will probably look for a more reliable product to make my smoothies.I'm not saying not to purchase this Ninja but if you decide to try this product be aware of what you may have to go through if it fails!"
Hard to clean. Sticky goo gets in the nooks and crannies and it isn’t easy to clean.
"I just got mine yesterday. Works well enough but the cups are so small at 16 oz I couldn't mix a full protein shake with half a banana. I thought no problem, I'll go buy some bigger ones. Well, I'm finding out that's not possible. They don't make bigger cups for the 700 watt model. So I figured I'll just buy two more 16 oz cups. I couldn't find them anywhere online so I decided to call them. After I dealt with an annoyingly complicated phone menu and a rep that had a hard time finding a replacement cup I found out a single cup was $30, which did not even include taxes and shipping. I paid $55 for this blender and you're telling me a single cup will cost me more than half the cost of the blender? Why aren't their larger cups available? Why aren't their more affordable cup options ON THEIR WEBSITE, or even Amazon? Why can't I even find replacement cup options? Why does it have to be so difficult? Why did they drop the ball on this? I'm annoyed the description doesn't elaborate on the fact that you can't get bigger cups, and that replacement cups are pretty much not a thing either. You want bigger cups get the pricier models. Better yet, go with a different brand. I get really annoyed with poor customer service with companies that have a lot of competition. It's too easy to take my business elsewhere, and I will."
"Do not buy- It's not a bad blender but I had a bad experience with it after mild use.May have been a defective unit, but I was pretty surprised when I noticed my Ninja was smoking after only 3 months of mild daily use making protein shakes with simple things like water, powder, ice and fruits, not even filling it fully. It started making a foul noise but had the blending power to pull through. After month 3, the foul noise was accompanied by some smoke and it was time to pull the plug.I got on the phone with Ninja support and they asked me to take scissors and cut the plug. Afterwards, they asked for my credit card so that they could charge me $25 to replace my $50 blender. The moral of the story is don't cut the cord even if Ninja support tells you to. They ended up waiving the shipping price because they did not disclose that I would have to pay it before they instructed me to cut my device. Be careful."
"Giving a 3 because some aspects of it are great. It works well, as long as you do not put too many frozen items in.  If you have dry ingredients and put them in the bottom of the cup, you will not get it all blended.  The 16oz cup really only allows you to make about a 12 Oz smoothie. So if you like your smoothies without a lot of frozen things in it, and. You do not mind tiny smoothies, it is very convenient for making those quickly.  It is very easy to clean, since the container IS the blender. I LOVE the concept, but it must be made for elves or tiny people."
"I bought this in May.The blade lid too often does not screw on tightly enough, resulting in a leak down into the machine and also onto the counter. I do add some liquid to my smoothies at times, which apparently this design is not equipped to handle.I would not recommend this product."
"Not that great for ice, works OK otherwise. Bought this to make fruit smoothies with frozen fruit. It really does not work well for that. Unless you add a ton of water. Just putting an ice cubes in frozen fruit, does not work very well. All of the material and fruit and ice just end up in a pile at the bottom of the cup. You have to take it off and stir it up and put it back on the blender repeatedly to get a decent slushy. Not really good for that type of stuff which was what I bought it for. Works great for liquids, would not recommend if you are looking for something to make blended iced drinks. It just doesn’t work that well for that type of material."
I bought this in August and have used it maybe 20 times for smoothies or blend spaghetti sauce. It started smoking today and stopped working. Not even a full four months of use. Save your money.
I was using it for smoothies and it couldn’t take the ice.  I would not recommend.
"We downsized and don’t have room for a full-size blender so this was my pick.  The containers are really too small for a smoothie (ice, frozen fruit, protein powder, liquid).  It’s extremely loud, my downstairs neighbors can hear it and I blend protein drinks several times a day.It works for small portions and is powerful.I will most likely replace it and find space for a full-size blender that is quieter."
"I make a green drink several times a week so when my last blender called it quits I thought I would try a Ninja. The cup is smaller than my last blender by four ounces, not a big deal but it took a second to reconfigure my favorite drinks. I don't like how the blade screws inside the cup instead of on the outside which would give it more room and less overflow. I also don't like the blade as much. I purchased this blender in January and by April the blade is already full leaving close of spinach on the blade that has to be removed before you can finish blending. The motor is louder than I expected for the blending power."
I make protein shakes every morning before I leave the house. Ive been using the Keytone blender I got on here a year or 2 ago and it was only $20 and it works great but my new protein powder scooper is so large so I was looking for an individual blender that had a bigger opening at the top. This looked like a solid choice so I purchased. I've tried to love it. I ve had it for a few weeks and I keep going back to it to see if I could love it but It just doesn't work for me. The bottle itself the blade screw on cap screws on the outside then the 'regular' cap screws on the inside which for me makes it messy. It's loud and it's powerful but I put 1/2 cup of oatmeal in my protein and every time I use this blender it still leaves bits of oatmeal in it which causes me to not want to finish my drink. Maybe I got a dud or maybe its just not for me. Couldn't justify it being triple the price of my other blender and can't even blend oats. I went back to my keytone blender and ill probably just buy a small funnel for it.
Poor craftsmanship.
"So kind of impressed by this mixer but mostly it's like nah for me. Everything seems to be well made but just a couple gripes for me. The bottles are kind of small and unless you're a person with small hands, or a mom with a bottle brush, good luck cleaning the inside of it. Then the mouth opening is the side of a penny, no joke I compared it, so unless you like sipping your protein shake out it's a no go, I like to drink mine fast and move on with my day. And lastly like others have said I'm getting the feeling it's about to burn up. Bogs down while mixing a full bottle of....shake mix...imagine that trying to blend frozen fruit or vegetables with their blender. Not real happy atm might send it back unless I get a good pump on and chill out. It's like meh for me."
"Great blender, however you have to hold it down the whole time to blend. It doesn’t make sense to me that I have to stand there and hold it down the whole time instead of it locking into place. I’ll be returning for one that I can leave alone for a minute to blend."
"This product would be a perfect personal blender for me if it wasn't for the ring that seals the top on the cup. I've only used my blender 3 times and the top with the blades already started to smell. I thoroughly cleaned it by hand, poured hot water and cleaning vinegar in the threads to get the smell out, and no luck. Only til I physically removed the ring (which has visible remnants from the previous uses) and soaked it in hot water and vinegar did the smell dissipate. It's faint but not as bad as before.I will say that something like this is a health issue especially if bacteria can grow and sit in that ring and people ingest it. I gave the product an overall 3 because of this. Other than that it works great.Side note: People left poor reviews because they had mishaps with blending hot liquids. It clearly says on the first page of the manual that hot liquids are NOT meant for this device, it will create pressure, expand and eventually burst."
"I got this to temporarily replace a previous Ninja full sized blender. On the plus side, it has a sleek look and takes up only a little space. On the down down side, the motor is very weak. I’ve been using it for 2 weeks only for smoothies, using frozen cubes fruit, protein powder, and milk. It takes much longer to blend the entire cup, it’s doesn’t blend as smoothly, and the motor is starting to smell slightly when I use it for longer than 30 seconds. Not good!"
This is the second one we have purchased and both times the motor burns out. It produces this very chemically smelly when it happens as well. Will be contacting the manufacturer to return.
"The Good: It’s small and powerful. It can grind up frozen avocados to liquid. It’s less cleanup than breaking out the bigger blenders for making single smoothies.The Bad: The cups included are hard to clean. There noocks and crannies that are hard to get to, especially that the cups are small in circumference. You have to have small hands or use a large bottle brush to clean it out well.  Sometimes it also takes a lot to get the top ingredients mixed in. You may have to stop it, take it apart and stir to make sure everything will mix.I’ll just deal with the drawbacks rather than return it because eventually it does the job I need it to do. Just not with the ease that I expected."
"I have been using this about five times a week for the past couple of years. Recently I noticed a definite slowing down of the motor and my protein shakes were taking a very long time to blend. I contacted customer service and spent about 45 minutes going back and forth in an attempt to isolate the problem. After all was said and done, I was told tough luck. I was offered a replacement at 20% off the regular cost but the warranty would be limited to just 3 months. I am looking for another brand."
"Bought it in March, died in September. Powerful enough, very difficult to clean the base with so many deep grooves."
"I had gastric sleeve surgery 1 year ago next week and have protein shakes almost daily now and after using this just during that time on a 3-4 times per week frequency, it's dead. Doesn't work at all anymore. So, while it worked great up until then, now I'm stuck having to buy a new one. Really thought this would last longer than it did."
The issue is not with the blender itself but the cups and lids that are included. The cup is relatively small compared to others and the lid is a complete fail. It does not stay in the locked position as half of it spilled in my gym bag. Nothing like having half a smoothie all over my gym clothes. No workout for me today😤.
"Hello,I've used this device a couple times and each time it's leaking contents. I've inspected for damage, none found..... I've also made sure I cranked down to seat.... Still leaking 😞"
Yeaaaahhh.... this thing only really struggles to blend anything. It's one of the worst smoothie blenders I've ever owned.
Awkward appliance. Returned it and bought magic bullet at less than half the price which is much better.
"Purchased item 8 months ago. I have found it difficult to clean the base part where the cup attaches. Space between parts is very tight. I could not find a brush that worked well to clean. I ultimately used a toothbrush. I began noticing an odor coming from the machine. I found that one of the very small black rubber stoppers had come off. This allowed smoothie liquid to seep into motor area. Had to throw the machine away. The functionality of the machine was great, but I was spending a great deal of time each morning trying to clean it."
"Worst purchase I have ever made. Though that Ninja products were great but now I don’t think so. The lids do not seal. When applying the blade lid it gets tight but when you attempt to blend it comes unsealed and all your ingredients go flying everywhere. When finally getting ingredients a little blended and applying travel lid that doesn’t seal a spills all over my backpack and myself. It is possible that it is a manufacturing defect, since these are made by robots and personnel must check on these and this generation of workers are lazy."
"Got it in August as a gift for my mom. She didn't open the box until December when I came to visit, and the blender lasted a month. Now it won't start when you put the cup in and I'm past the return window. The hardest use it got is when I tried making a spinach protein shake with a tablespoon of pine nuts twice, and the consistency was chunky with fibrous bits so I gave up on the spinach and nuts. The rest of the time my mom barely used it, and it was to make fresh berry smoothies with water or juice only, not ice.My friend had one that made perfect creamy smoothies with spinach and nuts, that's why I got my mom this one. Turns out my friend has a slightly different model. This model doesn't smooth out spinach or nuts completely, you end up with either fibers from the spinach, and/or small chunks from the nuts, and pine nuts aren't that hard."
"It's just a pain honestly. It never blends everything at the bottom of the tin once you flip it, it'll all just sit up there so EVERY TIME I make a smoothie I have to take the top off usually twice and mix the stuff around. it's just a pain honestly.I wouldn't buy it again. I'd buy a stand up mixer before I bought this again personally."
I am working on making changes to my diet so this is my first smoothie blender. It works well but after using it for a week I have realized I need bigger cups which you can't get with this one. Sadly I threw out the box so I am stuck with it.
"update 5/20I've downgraded to three stars. This thing doesn't work anymore. The canisters have started leaking, and the motor often stays on when the canister is lifted off even though it's very hard to get it to start now.As with so many electronics today, it lasts about a year and a half, then it's garbage.original review:I have a really good Breville food processor that CAN crush ice, but when I tried to make smoothies with it, there were still crunchy bits of ice surviving. So I decided to try this little Ninja, not being terribly optimistic that it could top Breville. I'm happy to report that it was successful. It blends ice just like I had hoped. It's also a very easy-to-use machine; the only SLIGHT trick is that you have to pay careful attention to how you screw the bottom on before blending because it won't turn on otherwise. It's a good feature because it prevents liquid from leaking out, but I find I can't just absentmindedly screw it on correctly. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase."
I used the blender yesterday to make a smoothie. Worked great. I took it out this morning to make one and it no longer works.
"I initially loved this blender. However, it appears the motor is burning out after only two months. It sounds like it's grinding, slows down and a faint metallic smell emanates from the base. Very disappointing.  Wish I'd gotten insurance now."
"Not a complicated appliance - working so far, after 8-10 uses. Previous (not same brand) died after four. Quite noisy, not unusual.Very poor design of the knives - just about impossible to clean with water/soap/ bare hands - very sharp and hard not to get cut...The container quite tall and narrow - you will not reach the bottom with hand, need to use long brush."
"Product stopped working two days after I was able to return, it started smoking I had to take it outside"
I am a lover of Ninja products but this one I feel dropped the ball. Doesn’t blend all contents well. Doesn’t seems to have the right power no matter how much or how little i put in there. Cuisinart did a much better job. May have to go back to them. Sadly disappointed with this one.
"Didn’t realize I would have to hold down the cup in order for the unit to operate.  These blenders are so loud. I prefer to start the blending and leave the room.  Cannot do that with this device.  Also, cups too small for my taste, as I’m using fruit, yogurt, protein powder. Not enough room in the cups  I do like how compact the device is, but you lose those extra features when the device is so small."
"My first one didn't last more than a year! So I bought another because my wife liked it.....now it just died!My wife makes a smoothie once a day, runs it maybe 10 seconds! SO BUYER TAKE WARNING...No more.....got bit twice!!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I purchased this smoothie maker 1.5 months ago and have used it fewer than 10 times, mainly for simple mixes like yogurt and bananas—nothing heavy like ice or hard ingredients. Unfortunately, it started sparking during the last use and completely stopped working.I expected more durability for the price, especially with such light usage. Very disappointed in the quality and would not recommend this product to anyone looking for something reliable. Save your money and choose a different brand."
liked when working  i have been waiting for review  if not notified me very soon I HE NON CHOOSE BUTMNYON REPORT YOU COMPANY  STILL NOT WORKING  12/5/24 NO REVIEW NO ANSWER TO REQUEST  STAY AWAY FROM AMAZZON
"I got a blender with a bullet function I'm 2017 as a wedding gift, fast forward to 2024 it broke so I invested in this. What a shame it's nothing like the bullet/blender one, it constantly leaks, you have to hold it down to blend and it feels like it won't last even a year. I am going to return this and get the one I originally got before its worth the extra $50 this is junk."
I particularly was interested in using this product for ice cream but when I used the Frozen setting I was still left with large chunks of ice. It also smells very hot when it runs.
"Well I’m not a huge fan. It’s powerful. It’s sturdy. It has little plastic feet to keep it from sliding around and the smoothie cup that it comes with is probably the best part. The worst part for me is I should have gotten one with a tamper to tamp things down because everything gets stuck in the bottom and doesn’t blend. The stuff on the top blends into almost liquid but the bottom will still be full of chunks. I think the plastic the cup and the blender pitcher are made of, though thick, is wearing down over time. The parts are hard to clean and the blades don’t come apart so it’s hard to clean. You can’t just throw this in the dishwasher. This is a clean with a dish brush by hand thing. It’s also very loud so everyone in the house can hear it."
"Revised review / a cautionary tale of frustration, regret, and considerable financial loss: I've contacted Ninja/Shark now three times, and, with the exception of the first, they are always VERY SORRY, but have some excuse. Encounters one and two were through a text system that, at least for me, no longer is visible when I seek support. The first encounter was impressive. The agent and I went through a series of questions and responses at the end of which she typed, 'I can offer a refund or replacement. I will personally follow-up and contact you within the next 72 hours.' Wonderful. Problem all but resolved. HOWEVER! She did not contact me. Granting grace of an additional 36 hours I contacted Ninja again. I explained the content of the original contact and that agent was very sorry, but, she could find no indication I'd ever contacted them, and she was in a dither as to what to do, offering no suggestions how to proceed, not even going through the Q & A routine again. She was very sorry, but had nothing to offer. At that point I was called away by an urgent matter, and the agent left it that I could contact them again. Back in reality, unless Ninja would rush a new unit by at least overnight delivery, it would not be here in time for the Holiday meal prep I was counting on it to do. Today I contacted Ninja again, and this time there was no text option. -NOTE-  I prefer text because my hearing is substandard and when engaged in an electronically modified dialogue with others' who speak with a heavy, unfamiliar accent it is very challenging and requires many requests for repetition, and still demands considerable guess work. -The circumstances now are that I shall have the inconvenient task of shopping local suppliers brick and mortar stores, heavily crowded due to the season, in order to have a unit to assist with prep. (Rest assured, IT WILL NOT BE NINJA ANYTHING. ) To add further frustration, the chap on the phone today told me they cannot refund my money because they do not have it. Amazon does. So I guess Ninja just passes along those units to Amazon gratis to keep the Ninja name in the market place, right? They never receive any money from Amazon, right? And of course there is no way to contact Amazon regarding this matter. It is after the 30 day window, of course, so I can crawl back to the p.o.s. Ninja product and beg for a no doubt refurbished base unit to be shipped via slow boat from China, or write off $160.00 (and the price keeps dropping - I wonder why?) and do what I should have done originally. The upgraded Oster mentioned in the original review replaced a regular blender and I was hoping to use it to take some of the slack from the vintage early 1980s Cuisinart processor that fell to the floor and shattered about a year earlier. Roughly four decades of service seems appropriate. I should have added another couple of Jefferson's and purchased a Cuisinart. I would still need to purchase a blender. This Ninja experience has completely alienated me from anything Ninja or Shark. To think I'd actually considered the Shark line leaves me innervated. Oh. no, not now, not ever again. Rob me once, maybe, but every opportunity to relate this experience will be fulfilled. You'll not have another opportunity from me, nor anyone I can steer clear of another corporate rip-off.Original review: I've been a lifelong Oster fan, however the most recent one was an expensive, upgraded and revised format unit that gave out in less than a year. That sent me looking for alternatives. For a while I'd been looking to replace the 1980s Cuisinart processor, so this multi-purpose model looked like it might work. First and foremost, the slurp/smoothie cups are way too small, and by the time you allow for the blades to extend into the cup there's not a lot of room for ingredients. There are no speed controls on any of the operations on the unit. The closest is a pulse feature. This is a significant deficit with the machine. Apparently the blender blade was not properly seated when I attempted to soap out the interior of that carafe after a melange of veggies. The blade core banged against the sides of the plastic carafe cracking it in several places rendering it useless. A replacement carafe is nearly the cost of the entire combination set, so I'm wavering on a replacement. The food processor is no Cuisinart! Each vessel base must trip some activator in the motor unit that locks out the other options, so there is no flexibility with processing, blending, or smoothie-ing. If you are able to replace devices at will where cost isn't an object, give this a try. You may find it suits yours needs just fine. It was a splurge purchase for me, so I'm handicapped by it for a while. I will say that if you like your slurpees and smoothies whipped into a frenzied slurry this is for you, and that is the only saving grace to my mind."
"The price was good and the small cup blender works fine, but the rest was a disappointment. The so called food processor has no chute to add liquids, getting the hook out of a thick batter is difficult and dangerous.  Blended beans for soup, turned out mealy rather than smooth. The 72 oz pitcher takes up a lot of room and  is too big to be really useful. All in all, it is not what I hoped for. I'm just glad that it was on sale."
I love this machine! It is very powerful and I love the different parts for different uses.I am giving this 3 stars because It broke after using it for about a year and a half and the product support wasn't helpful and they didn't try to help locate the problem. They just told me to order a new part.
"Wow!  I reviewed ALL Blenders before the purchase.  I had to have a large motor to accommodate the amount of use this blender is going to get.  It is the only one I could find before stepping up to a Vitamix type (4x more in price) blender - 2-HP (1500 watt)  It came out of the box & onto the counter were it was used immediately.  Working like a charm.  Yes, It's loud, I'm crushing ice; yes you have to read how to use it, it's a LARGE blender.  The are 4 ""blades"", 2 huge containers & 2 personal size containers.  It is exactly what I needed.  There is a year warranty so if breaks in a year, I'll get a replacement.  If it breaks after a year, then I at least got my money's worth!  I love it & since I don't have the means to upgrade to the Vitamix/Blendec type, I am thrilled to find all the quality features in the Ninja Mega System.Update:  10/21/2017  Guess who's blender stopped working?  Mine.  Was making a lunch shake & it simply stopped.  My husband knew the motor was dead but he's not a professional..so who knows.  Found my receipts (as I knew that I have a 1 year limited warranty) a copy of the order & called Amazon.  Amazon explains that I needed to give the manufacturer notice & they should be able to fix it.  But also made me aware that if the manufacturer, EuroPro, didn't make it right, please contact Amazon again.  Never figured that I'd need them to assist...this is EUROPRO..Shark, Ninji you know, reputable? I called EuroPro & the 1st time they said that the safety breaker went off.  It wasn't broken.  Asked me to ""reset"" it.  So that didn't work.  Called EuroPro back & spoke to Customer Service, who also wishes to walk me through how to ""reset"" the system.  There's no resetting the system, the motor's burned!  Finally made them understand that & the customer service rep. states that this kind of repair isn't worth it for them to take their system back, would I be happy with a new base unit that EuroPro would send out today.  Yeah, that's acceptable...except for the nagging little voice in my head that's going..""hey I paid good money for this system & they are acting like I committed a felony...rather than kiss up to me because they product proved to be LESS THAN ACCEPTABLE in my estimation.  A new motor/base was what I needed to make the system work as good new again.  Now remember, EuroPro said that they didn't take the base units back because it wasn't worth it them.  Along with sending a new base unit, they was $20.00 restocking/partial return shipping fee.  Nope, not doing that.  Why should I have to pay anything when they warrantied their product for 1 year.  They were so sure that nothing would go wrong with their product, that they would replace it for free!  So I explained to the customer service rep. that the situation was not the same.  They didn't want their broken base unit back, so they weren't restocking anything & there was no partial shipping charges to be concerned about because there was no item being returned!  Wouldn't pay the fee.  Called Amazon & explained what happened.  Didn't give me a ration of bunk, no lecture, made a suggestion & stated that they would handle it & they did.  I think that EuroPro should be ashamed that 1) That the product doesn't live up to Ninji's stated expectations 2) That they gave a customer a hard time for no reason.  How does this show me that you appreciate my business?  Bought 12/29/2016, Died 10/21/2017"
"Does what it intended to do, but took up way to much counter space in my tiny kitchen. Returned it."
Easy to use but disliked the fact that one item was missing when it was delivered to me.
"The pros are that this machine performs at the levels you see in the positive reviews.  It is powerful.  My wife says she can make our infant daughter's food in less than half the time as the machine we had before, and it is prepared far more even / fine.  I like the versatility of the machine.The main issue (currently the only issue, but we only just got it) is that the containers are all plastic.  And thin plastic at that.  I expected strong, heavy-duty glass for this price.  I admit I didn't read any description beyond the highlights and reviews, and brand recognition.  Regardless, my old Oster blender cost $20 and the pitcher was strong, thick, heavy glass.  It doesn't do everything this Ninja does, but still...something to consider if you are thinking of buying.At the end of the day, I don't regret buying it.  But, in hindsight, I'd have researched other options at this price.UPDATE 09/04/2024:  Initial concerns over plastic pitcher were warranted.  9 months later and the plastic mount on the bottom snapped off.  It is completely unusable now and it cannot be repaired.  The only options are to replace the pitcher, which now costs as much as we paid for the whole unit, or buy a new machine.  When it worked, it worked very well, but I would not recommend nor buy again."
"I like that this has one base for two appliances, a blender and a food processor. It does do a nice job chopping or blending. My issue is that the food processor lid does not have a hole in it to be able to add ingredients as it’s going. It also does not have a lid/ blades that you can use to shred or dice cheese or vegetables. My other issue is that this particular model has a very limited selection of accessories you could add on. It comes with the 16 ounce single serve cup but trying to find a 24 ounce or 32 ounce cup to fit this model is almost impossible. I did find a 12 ounce that fits OK, still looking for a larger 32 ounce cup that will fit. I did order separately from the ninja store the vegetable chopper, but the housing broke with the second use. If I had to choose again, I would go with a different model that had more availability  for accessories. Or came with standard features of a blender or food processor."
"I ordered this for myself as an earlyish birthday present. I decided before my husband comes home from Afghanistan I wanted to lose weight and quick. I had always looked at buying a ninja to do a juicing diet but never got around to doing it. I finally decided I have to do this. And man am I glad I did. I received this a few days ago and have already done multiple smoothies, juices and ice creams. First smoothie and juice I made in the large pitcher and I thought it was the perfect consistency. You absolutely HAVE TO put the greens and nuts in first and blend those. Otherwise you will just have a nasty gritty mess. Today, I decided to use the single serve cups..... Not impressed. At all. If you're getting this for the single serve cups to make green smoothies and juices.... Absolutely save your money. I just made my juice and it's clumpy, gritty, and VERY thick. I don't know if I just did it wrong, but it's a horrible texture. Also, as far as clean up, it's a pain in the ass and dangerous if you have no dishwasher. As everyone else has said, the blades are crazy sharp. It's great if you have a dishwasher and can put the blade in the container so there's no chance of hurting yourself or anyone else, but handwashing can prove to be tricky. I'm honestly thrilled with it besides the single serve, and washing issue. My 21st birthday is tomorrow so I'm definitely going to be making a lot of alcoholic beverages in it as well so I will write an update with that.-----UPDATE------so, I still juice every single day and I absolutely love it. It's been about 6 months now and I can't imagine going without it. However, I have found a few things out. Number one, seeds are not a task meant for the ninja. I tried to add kiwi to my juice and it felt like I added razor blades. Don't try it. Also, the small round pitcher, doesn't do so great with ice. That ""snow"" the ninja is famous for, not so much. Keep your large pitcher for your Smoothies. And this thing is durable. I thought for sure when my husband dropped it down the concrete  stairs while moving that I was gonna have a pile of electronic rubble when we got up to the apartment. Nope. Good as when we first bought it. Seriously. This thing can take a serious beating.Here's the recipes I've tried so farGreen smoothie:Handful of baby spinachHandful of baby kale1/2 apple, cored1/2 banana1/3-1/2 cucumber2-3 stalks celeryIceOrange juiceWater to desired consistencyBlend/crush mode with large pitcher all greens (possibly a liquid to help break down)Add everything else and blend until smoothLazy left overs!Too tired in the morning to make a whole new juice?

"I had a Ninja blender for years and loved it, so I bought the professional grade 3 in 1 when I needed a new food processor, in the hopes of saving appliance space. But the plastic pieces on my bowl have broken TWICE in one year. Turns out Ninja's warranty only covers the motor, and the price of a replacement food processor bowl with shipping is $92. The price of a whole blender or food processor. I'm going to try to epoxy it back together and get a little more life out of it, but am very disappointed that a top end appliance company like Ninja does not stand behind all parts of its product.So I love this system and really wish it were a reliable food processor, but it's not. The blender and blender cup work are fantastic and work as expected though! But you're probably better off paying less for just that and having a different food processor."
"I love it but the same time I hate it because the containers are plastic, and if you use it too often they look like it's really old I use my daily,I think the strong one is the single service I in love with my smoothies and my drinks the way that they come out 8of 10"
"This is definitely not a challenge for the Breville. When I tried to make sorbet it would not move the product to the outer blades. The blades are very sharp and I cut myself loading something in the dishwasher beside it. That is one of the great things about the Breville. The blades do not cut you.  Also, I was disappointed in the selection of power settings. Very limited. But, the clincher for me was that the food processor (the main reason I purchased this set) does not have a chute for adding liquid or other food items as you blend. What food processor works without a chute?! You can't do anything but crunch stuff up unless you take off the lid every time add something and that doesn't work if you want to add or drizzle something in slowly. I am really surprized by this oversite. Did they consult any chefs while designing this? I can't say how it performs overtime as I only tested mine one day and I am returning it. Happy Blending!"
"I can only give the unit 3 stars today because it just arrived and I already had to call Ninja Warranty. The first time I used it I chose the small cup, it clicked in rather firmly but did an OK job blending my drink.  When i tried to remove the cup from the blender base it was stuck and would not turn to unlock from the base. I kept adding pressure and finally it unlocked and came off but it broke off one of the tabs on the cup in the process.  I tested the other cup and it locked in and released perfectly which lead me to believe there was a defect in the cup that wouldnt release.The next issue is that it did not come with a cleaning brush as described in the advertisement under the cleaning description.  When I mentioned this to the Ninja Customer service dept the response was that it doesnt come with a brush and that is clearly stated in the users manual.  What a fine thing to say to a customer instead of telling them it must have been a mistake in the advertising.  I do not recall reading the users manual before it arrived, only the advertisement.After 12 minutes on the phone and being told the cup wasnt actually covered under the warranty, only the motor base was covered I told them I had no problem having Amazon send me a whole new unit if they were not going to replace the defective cup I received.  Only then did they agree to send me a replacement cup free of charge.I have decided to put it through a heavy week of use to see if anything else is defective in the unit I bought.  All my friends that have a Ninja blender love them but so far I am not impressed after todays experience."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Does not work as advertiesed.  Watch my video I posted.  This is advertised as not needing to stop blending to press food down and also not needing to add liquid.  Neither of these statements are true.  In my video you can see the juice and fruit at the bottom sprayed all the way up to the top from the bottom and sticking to the sides on the top.  I make smoothies out of 1 apple, 1 banana, 2 cups frozen berries, a handful of frozen grapes 1 cup of juice and as much spinach as shown in the video i posted.  It does not blend smoothly.  I have tried adding the ingedients in all different ways; spinach on top, spinach on bottom, liquid on bottom, liquid on top, fruit in all different orders and nothing makes a difference.  I always have to add a lot more liquid AND stop blending to press ingredients back down.  I usually have to press the ingredients down 1-2 times scraping the sides down with a spatula.  I have also tried making celery juice by blending an entire package of celery and had the same problems.  I think the advertisement video works because they jam it all the way to the top and use ice and/or liquifying ingredients.  I use enough ingredients to give me a half pitcher full when done blending and when I'm done its a drink, not a pudding so I know there is plenty of liquid (I had to add a lot more liquid remember).  Even when I try adding more liquid from the begining I still have to stop and scrape the ingredients down with a spatula.  The amount of smoothie I have is way more than the single serving cup so it can't be that I'm suppose to be using the single serving cup.  It simply doesn't work as advertised which wouodnt be a big deal if I hadn't spent this much money for exactly the reason that I wanted a blender that I didnt have to stop and smash anything down during blending.  I wanted a blender that was add ingredients, push start and everythig be on autopilot.  Now the good.  It is strong.  It goes right through whatever you put in it you just have to stop and push it down.  It doesnt start heating up the ingredients from friction like my old blender and has better texture and flavor at the end.  Overall for the price I wish it was better.  That's a lot of money. I haven't tried the food processor yet but I expect the same results when i do.  It didn't make logical sense to me that what was being advertised was possible for a blender but I watched videos and it seemed to work.  It doesn't work like that though."
"This blender got scratches in the plastic after less than a week of use, which is a health risk. I don't want plastic in my food or drink!! It promises to be easy to clean and dishwasher safe, but it leaves water in the lid and is one of the more difficult blender I've had when it comes to cleaning. The price is very excessive for a blender of such poor quality and I feel the claim that this should be 'professional' is unwarranted. To add to all of it's bad qualities it gives me a painful gassy stomach as it leaves too much bubbles in my shake. It has only one speed setting for shake and one for dough."
"I wanted to like this blender/food processor, but the food processor attachments for this are no longer available separately and the blender is truly industrial -- not what I was needing or wanting for my home kitchen. It's incredibly powerful and extremely loud. I might score it higher if I was using this in a different setting for large groups, but it's just not what I was ultimately wanting."
"So after fully testing this out here’s what I think. If you’re a professional chef like myself this is not for you, if you’re a home cook or just using for smoothies or doing simple purées this will be perfect for that.The blender attachment is ok, some of the purées I try to do don’t come out silky smooth like they should. For me to make a purées from vegetable after boiling of of course took over 5 minutes to get close to the consistency that I like. When I make smoothies/drinks this works perfect.The food processor attachment worked pretty well. I threw in chicken, beef to do ground meats and I have no complaints about that. However it did not last the first and only time I put it in the dishwasher. The bottom part broke where the screws are. I’ve always hand washed all pieces, so that would be my biggest issue.Overall this is perfect for people who do simple things but for a chef I wouldn’t recommend."
"So I bought this for Christmas last year for my husband. In April my husband had used the food processor to make salsa. He put the food processor in the dishwasher which Ninja says is dishwasher safe. However, the rotary attachment that is held in by four screws broke off. Called Ninja they sent out a whole new replacement system because also the two horsepower base was making a terrible noise.Fast forward to today when my husband made a compound butter also put the system in the dishwasher which we have done several times since getting the new system. Take it out to put it away and the same problem happens the gear component falls out of the system. Called Ninja again and they said that they wouldn't replace it this time. That we would have to spend $70 on a new processing Bowl.If it's not dishwasher safe. Then say it's not dishwasher safe!"
"I loved how well the large, standard blender and the small 16oz cup attachments blended things - very powerful chopping and could get smooth consistenties. However, after owning this set for 15 months, the blender died already. While i do use it often, the lifespan of 1yr is just unacceptable to me for this expensive and genuine product.The food processor is big enough for all my needs but was only ok. I wish it had a food chute or a grater attachment and it couldn't blend things smooth enough."
"I want to give the Ninja a rating of 5 stars. It functions well, it’s fast, it's good quality, and it’s easy to clean.BUT... unfortunately it's VERY loud!Every time I use it, I need to give my wife notice so that the sound doesn’t scare her.And when guests are over, they make comments about how noisy it is.For some reason, it’s not too loud when I use the big cups (for things like soups or guacamole). But when I use the small cup (for smoothies), GOSH the machine is loud.It’s a shame, because we love the Ninja overall and use it every day.I recommend it unless the noise would bother you."
"The plug of the machine is faulty, making it unable to plug into the power outlet. I contacted Amazon customer service and after a while they said they needed to confirm my identity and told me to wait 3-5 days. And until now (about a month and I haven't seen any support from them). I had to grind the plug so I could plug it into a larger outlet - then connect it to the power source. First time buying from Amazon USA - such a bad experience!"
"I have bought two of these now over the past four years.  The inclusion of blender, chopper, and smoothie attachments made it a good all-in-one choice.  I had to replace the first one after several years, when the blender and chopper no longer turned.  There are separate gears to turn those and the smaller smoothie cup, which still worked.  I use it most often for smoothies, but needed a food processor as well.  As it was out of warranty, I replaced it with a whole new set which I found at a great sale price on Amazon in November.In March, something went wrong with the new machine on the smoothie side – a smell of smoke, but it was not coming from the motor in the base but from the smoothie blender cup, and there was actually smoke and little pieces of rubber inside the cup, and the liquid was stained with black streaks, which I presume was rubber and/or oil from the gasket around the mixing blades.  I assumed there was something defective in the smoothie mixer head and tried the one from the old machine, which worked fine for a few days, then did the same thing.  A guest suggested that the gear that turns the smoothie maker might be out of alignment, which seems plausible.  I tried making smoothies in the blender (much chunkier, at least doing one glass worth), and it worked a few times before the blender stopped turning altogether.  So now the whole second unit is useless.  Fortunately, this one is still under warranty and I am about to start the process of trying to get it replaced.So my experience is that this product does a very good job when it works, so it is worth it for me to try to get a new one through the warranty process and hope the third one fares better.  But if I were starting from scratch, I would be wary of the reliability of the mechanical parts.  If I had rated the purchase before having two of them break down (one in ways that were dangerous and alarming – I don’t know if the smoothie cup could have caught fire, but whatever had gotten into the ingredients would not have been a good thing to drink!), I would have given it 5 stars as a multi-use product that worked well.  But now that I have had two of them break down, one in a few months’ time, I may be generous in giving it 3 stars.Another important note: THE BLADES ON THE FOOD PROCESSOR ARE RAZOR-SHARP.  The first time I was cleaning it, I foolishly touched the blades, and got the equivalent of a nasty razor cut.  Make sure you grasp the little nub at the top of the spiral blade when picking it up, and if you need to leave it out to dry, make sure it is not where someone will accidentally touch or bump into it.  I do not regard this as a design flaw – the sharpness of the blade is what allows it to perform its function well – but it is something to watch out for."
"We bought this item to replace our current ninja because it’s so loud!!!! Well the new one is just as loud and when you press single cup, you have to continue to hold button down for it to work. I thought our other cup from our old Ninja would fit but they do not, so we would only have 1 cup for this blender. The quality is great, it’s just not going to work for our family."
I’d like the blender and I just purchased it a couple of months ago. Now it is making a screeching noise when I turn it off. This worries me..
"PROS: amazingly powerful blender. The blades going up the central shaft help with an even blend. We have done everything from shakes to soups to Italian dressings, all turn out great with the blender. The food processor is also quite powerful and incredibly useful for items that need a rougher chop. We have shredded beef and chicken in mere seconds, and even with just the black plastic ""blade"" - it gets the job done. The motor has lasted 2 years and shows no sign of wear or tear.CONS: within just a few months of owning the blender, the processor container broke! The plastic housing for the screws underneath the container completely snapped off, and rendered it useless. I contacted Ninja and they asked for pictures, and willingly replaced the container (so props for amazing customer service in a time of need!). After approximately 2 years of use now, the processor and blender are showing signs of cracking on the bottom. The way the cracks are forming - it almost looks like the powerful motor is stressing out the plastic too much. The blender is leaking, very mildly (like just a drop or two, when we make a shake). With how we use it, I'm guessing the blender container will be too cracked to use before another year is through. The processor, with it being replaced and somewhat newer, it's not as far along but getting there.WHY TWO STARS: I mean, I've got 2 years of usage out of it, right? So why so low? Because I want Ninja to hopefully see this, or at least other potential buyers to notice.A WORD TO NINJA: why this isn't sitting right with me, because the price on this set is hefty. Before all the 2023 inflation, I paid ~ $200 for the set. I expect with a price like that for there to be an amount of longevity with the quality of materials. Like 5 years or more. Maybe I'm setting too high expectations, but I honestly don't think so. Planned obsolescence can be overdone, and I think this wear is purposeful, and that's why I am giving only 2 stars. Make better quality containers to handle your motor, because I don't want to be sucked into buying new containers because ""oh it's just that time to replace them again""."
"There are some really great features with this Ninja and then there’s a couple not so great. The power is great, the blades are phenomenal. All the pieces that came with it, pretty cool. The fact that the lid locks down is great, the size is really big, so if you don’t cook everyday or have a family this kitchen system is probably wayyyy too big. The idea of the single cup with a blender lid is great but not that thing is soooo loud it could wake the whole house, and it doesn’t blend everything great. When you use the blender pitcher it’s huge, I love it but everytime things get stuck in the corners and don’t get blended. The bummer about the lid is everytime you take it off it’s going to spill. Because it does .There are definatley a few pros and cons but all in all I like it."
My blender is not spinning and I hardly used it. I only make smoothies with it
"Things I LOVE about this blender:• Powerful.• Blades, blades, blades everywhere!• Fairly quiet, relative to its power.• Vacuum-seal lid actually keeps liquids inside the pitcher! What a novel idea!Things I HATE about this blender• Too tall to fit below kitchen cabinets, when assembled.• Plastic pitcher started cracking and leaking after 3 months of very mild, daily use (see photos).• Pitcher is excluded from warranty coverage, and a replacement pitcher is more than half the cost of the entire set!After only 3 months of using this blender to puree steamed vegetables (it has never chopped anything harder than a limp carrot), the thin plastic pitcher began to crack at the bottom, around the rotating mechanism, allowing liquid to leak out. I was disappointed (but not surprised) when Shark Ninja customer support told me that a cracking pitcher was my problem, not theirs. However, I was absolutely livid when I learned the cost of replacing just the pitcher was over half the cost of buying the entire set brand new! What? So the motor unit, food processor bowl, two small pitchers, and extra blades are worth less than one plastic pitcher? I’d be better off buying three cheap blenders and just throwing them in a landfill every three months. Not cool, Ninja."
"I have two disappointments with this, the first is the … actually there’s many disappointments with this, I should’ve sent it back. The blender cups for smoothies are too small and they are only one size. The big blender is like the old clear and blue blender that they first came out with. The mixer is nothing to brag about and you don’t get variable speeds. Finally, the whole thing is a bear to clean. Yes I put water and soap in and spin it but the way it loads and you have to clean it out to get your food out after you’ve made it it’s all just annoying. I miss my ninja blender and my mixer. This is not a replacement for them. The only positive is the speed, 1500. If you need 1500."
"This blender has a lot of nice features.  I like that you can use 3 separate things on it that you can blend with (a cup, a wide bowl and a tall bowl).Most items say hand wash only so cleaning this thing is a pain.Ours had a crack in the bottom of the large bowl (pitcher) and when I called the manufacturer they said I could mail it to them at my expense and they would replace it.I found it easier to return the item and be done with it."
"I paid $150 for mine, awhile ago. Within a few months, the blender blade column has stripped out. It's useless. It doesn't look like it was a good part to begin with. Now, my husband noticed a crack all the way across the bottom of the processor bowl. Apparently this ninja can't handle making smoothies or grinding nuts. Why aren't the bowls glass? Why can't the plastic insert under the bowls be replaceable if they aren't going to be quality? I was excited to get this setup. It's quickly turned into a disappointment."
"First and foremost, I would like to say Amazon has the absolute best customer service ever after a mere 5 hours of dealing with this mess of a blender Amazon. Gratefully accepted my return of this blender that basically blew, white smoke and smelled like an electrical fire because well I believe it was arcing inside of the motor. I cannot verify that so take that with a grain of salt but that is just my knowledge. Plug the blender in last night to make my daughter a smoothie as I normally do. Did not overload the system. Placed a frozen banana chunked it up into five bits. Added almond milk to the fill line. Added chocolate smoothie powder and a tablespoon of peanut butter. Attached the lid. No leaking no problem. Like I always do place it into the blender, turned it on it zipped and made a smoothie, but it was extremely loud and smoke started to come from where it spins. Quickly stop the maker Took the smoothie off called for my husband too quickly. Come out to the kitchen to see what I was seeing a bunch of white smoke coming from the machine base to where you connect the blending apparatus too. Okay so I was thinking I was okay. I knew there was a 90 day return through Ninja as I was already past the 30-day return on Amazon. Purchased this January 23rd, 2023 30 days was up on February 23rd 2023. Today is March 17th 2023 so I knew I was going to have to deal with ninja. Their customer service was completely awful. I was on the phone. Even went on a live video chat to show the person whom I was speaking to that there was no leak. The base looked absolutely perfect, clean and he's still pushed me off and said it will be another 24 hours until somebody else calls you well. I don't have time to be on the phone talking to Joe schmo from Kokomo and explaining my situation all over again when I am not going to feel comfortable at all receiving another unit that caused this in my kitchen. Brand new wiring brand new remodeled kitchen but that's besides the point. So then I took it upon myself to email ninja to try to get a little bit faster because I received no email verification that somebody was going to be contacting me. I had a very bad feeling about it from the get-go. Long story short, I ended up getting another email saying oh somebody will be contacting you. Please call blah blah blah. So I get a hold of Amazon customer service. Explain to them all the hoops that I have been going through and thankfully they rock and I will be sending this back. I hope everybody else uses some caution.I will not buy another Ninja product or recommend one."
"The food processor was the part I used the least, but somehow it was the first to break. The picture was taken in the trash can, which is where it deserves to be. I haven't been impressed by this unit since I bought it. I really should have read the negative comments before buying. I have had most of the issues everyone else has had. Processor and blender fling everything to the side and must be scraped way too often. No access to add to the processor when it's running; have to take the whole lid off. Inconsistent chopping.Before buying this, I used my mother's Black & Decker food processor from the 1980s which still outperformed this Ninja.The 2 stars are for the single serving cups which I use almost every day for smoothies. I would not recommend buying this just for that."
"I bought this because I wanted an all in one set up. I’ve been brutally disappointed. The food processor broke after about 10 uses, and Ninja would not replace it for free. The small blender head for the smoothie cups was defective as well so I had to order a new one. Don’t order this set— it’s cheaply made."
"It’s a good blender, I love the single serve ones. But it’s so loud while it’s blending"
"I have had Ninja blenders since the very first smoothy models came out. My 5 yr old model was getting worse for the wear after daily use, and had been looking to update to a new one.  The sale price was great.  I have no problem with the full size blending and the food processor(which was an option I really wanted.)  They work great.  However the smoothy cup and blade, a staple of the Ninja single serving option, is not so great.  After locking the cup into the motor unit, I have to tightly hold it with force opposite to the blending direction or other wise, the motor is so powerful it vibrates it out of locked position and grinds the underside because it is no longer locked into the spinning mechanism. I suspect this will shorten the lifetime of this machine.It is extremely loud.I do like the levers underneath the motor unit that release the suction cups, since my last one was very difficult to pick up off the counter to put away when I was done.  Since the smoothy option is the thing I use most, I am a bit disappointed"
"I first bought this unit because I thought all that power would hell make my hummus smoother.  It didn't.  I don't need to crush ice so all the extra power was not really a benefit.  It worked fine although it has no slicing or shredding blade and no spout for adding anything while operating.After four years of regular use, 3 or 4 times a week most weeks, the motor died.  Maybe four years is a normal length of service, but I won't buy another Ninja."
"I wanted to really love this and was super excited about it. I especially loved that you can have just one base with a blender and food processor to save on storage space. The reviews were also great. The single serve blender made really good (grainy) smoothies. My problems really started when I tried to make hummus. No matter how long I blended in the food processor I just could not get a smooth texture. I also tried to make tahini in the food processor and the machine just would not chop the seeds. I let it run for about 10 minutes and still had seeds in tact. I would make tahini with my old mini cuisinart food processor (I was planning on replacing that with this ninja system) and the cuisinart chopped those seeds right up in 2 minutes. Another reason why I was not happy with my purchase was there is no entry hole in the top of the food processor for adding liquids. So if you like to emulsify, you can't do it with this. I did see other models of the ninja system that do have the hole in the top of the food processor, but please be aware that this one does not have that. I gave 3 starts because this product is nicely built, great price and does the job for smoothies, but if you are wanting a super smooth texture, emulsify or add through the lid as you process, you can't do it with this. I ended up returning it and am going to stick with a traditional food processor and blender."
"As well know and successful as this company is, I am surprised to find how unreliable and untrustworthy they are when it comes to their one year warranty.Short Version: Had I known what I know now I would’ve just spent $20 on a Hamilton beach blender that lasts about the same amount of time but costs significantly less. My main qualm being the company claiming that it’s $200 blender provides such an amazing product, from being professional grade quality, to raving of it’s endurance and boasting of its ability to out perform competitors, yet, can’t stay committed to an agreement that their product will be covered or even last 1 year.Facts we know:1. $200 Ninja blender. *Whether on sale or not at the time of purchase this company claims the product is worth $200*2. A 1 year warranty is provided in the off chance this thing breaks.*The company assurances are that this product function for 1 year, if this product fails to meet this very large, very successful, Ninja brand’s company’s high standards it is covered under the one year warranty.3. You pay for this one year warranty.*The one year warranty is added into the cost of this product.*4. Upon contacting the companies claims department you will be instructed to troubleshoot the item. Furthermore, if the product is deemed a dud you will be charged a fee to receive a product replacement. (Oxfords Definition of “Dud” for those unaware, a dud is a thing that fails to work properly or is otherwise unsatisfactory or worthless.) 5 months after receiving product the company deems their $200 product unsatisfactory and worthless.5. Because the company produced a $200 dud that you paid for, you must pay a $22 fee to receive a replacement product.6. My received product lasted 5 months, made one batch of dough, and approximately 2-3 single serve smoothies a week in the mornings. No ice.7. Replacement arrives in 3-4 weeks. Your replacement will be a refurbished one, that they repaired. Upon receiving your…correction, someone else’s repaired dud..  The 1 year warranty is then replaced with a (6 month limited warranty).Now my perspective:1. $22 dollars isn’t so bad, but if this product breaks every 5 months your dishing out $44 additional dollars and a $200 product turns into a $244 product that only lasts one and a half years. Long story short, I received a dud. Which was then replaced with a refurbished product, if this breaks within a year I spent $220+ on a product that lasted less than a year and a half. I will update my review once my 6 month warranty expires. Hopefully I was sent a product that will last longer than the last."
"We had this same ninja and the lid broke-had ninja many years. So we replaced it with this very (to me same exact) model but Ninja said we couldn't get a new lid since older model. We bought this one, again it looked exactly the same as one we threw out. Got this one, made a chocolate banana milkshake. Milkshake came out fine but smell of burning motor smell was bad. Used this the next morning-same thing chocolate banana milkshake-burning smell. Not normal to me. Then a week lady used to mix my sweet potato pancake mix, which always did with previous ninja. This particular ninja machine couldn't not mix pancake batter. My friend who was over mentioned about the burning smell. I kept having to take the lid off to mix the pancake batter myself-and even with that the batter was unmixed. I finally called amazing to get a replacement. Amazon, Kristy who was super nice to help, but said that was not an option, only replace it and we can buy it again. It was a hassle to do that and now we have to get a box and package everything up and drive to mail at UPS store. Feel frustrated. I know we need to buy again but I don't know if it would be wise to buy from this vendor again. sad."
"We have been using the Ninja BL770 to prepare pureed foods for a family member with swallowing difficulty. The blender does a good job, but when using the individual sized cup for blending, it is quite loud - to the point of damaging hearing.  Occasionally there is a grinding noise as well.  For that reason I gave it three stars."
"Overall disappointed with this purchase. Cheap, bulky plastic canister that are NOT dishwasher safe. The motor gets hot when using the processor for dough. Don't even get me started on using this for dough as it's advertised for, awful experience. The metal blades are very sharp and it does a good job with blending.  I almost sent it back when I saw it was all plastic, but I am really pleased with the two self serving sized canisters for smoothies. We use those every day for breakfast smoothies. They're technically not dishwasher safe either, but I have been putting them on the top shelf in the ""no heat"" cycle. They've done fine so far. For the money the canisters should be glass, not cheap plastic that we can't put in the dishwasher. We're busy. We don't have time to hand wash everything. I would not purchase again."
"Ninja used to be a reputable brand. This was the second Ninja I've bought. Looks like it's time to find a better brand. Two years after buying this, the engine has burned out. My previous Ninja lasted for at least 7 years."
"I had a ninja product for years that I really liked. When I moved, I bought this as a replacement and have been somewhat disappointed. The blender doesn’t make a ‘smooth’ smoothie - everything comes out granulated. And the machine is extraordinarily loud! So much so that my girlfriend wants me to wear earplugs when I use it because she’s concerned over the noise level.While I would give Ninja another try (really loved my previous one) I would definitely NOT purchase this model again."
"This thing is insanely loud. Hurt your ears loud. And it takes awhile for everything to blend properly. Easy to clean. I like all the different sizes. But, wouldn’t but again if I knew how loud it would be."
"I was really excited to buy this, thinking it would be great to combine a food processor and blender with one base. This blender is really loud…as in, I run it in the morning and worry about waking up my family with it!I  really dislike that the food processor doesn’t have a chute opening to drizzle liquids in while it is running. I have to stop, release the lid, and add hopefully the right amount of liquid, and resume blending. I have also noticed it doesn’t process uniformly, and I frequently have to stop to scrape down the sides.The blender itself is fine. Be cautious of the blade though! I have tried making smoothies I. The blender, and noticed my greens don’t fully blend in…there are always small bits in my drink.The individual smoothie cups work well, however, it is SO LOUD! You have to hold the button down for the single serve, and between the noise and vibration, it is sensory overload! I dread using it daily! (Yes, I realize the easy solution is to just not use it, but that defeats the purpose of having the blender)"
I had this blender for two years and if that’s long enough for you to expect an expensive blender to last than this is the one for you. I was hoping it would last longer because I did enjoy it while it lasted which is why I gave it two stars. But there’s a little plastic piece at the bottom of your blender that if it ever breaks off then that’s it for the blender because it won’t trip the sensor that allows it to turn on. So for such a high quality blender you expect it not to be fully dependent on a tiny plastic piece not breaking in order to keep working. I wish I would’ve just bought a cheaper blender if I knew that the quality of this one would only give me two years.
"I contacted Ninja after about two weeks of daily use because the handle was getting filled with material that there is no way to remove. It is a clear handle. The bottom that fits on the motor has triangular corners that catch material as well. It is very difficult to clean. The Ninja customer service was very rude to me and told me not to submerse it in matter and not to turn it upside down in the sink when washing. I told her that I had not submerged it in water, just filled it and turned it over to dump it out. She said I must be doing something wrong. If there are specific directions to clean it, I did not see them anywhere and if there are this is not the best product. They did send me a new blender piece (carafe) but said this was a one-time curtesy. Well, it has been two years and I have been dealing with this dirty piece. I looked at it this morning and the handle is full of green mold. I am throwing it out and ordering a Cuisinart. This company has poor customer service and doesn't understand that their product has too many crevices where food and liquid can get into and where you cannot get it out unless you unscrew it and some parts you can't even do that. It needs to be looked at.  Although, I really love how it blends and what the food processor can do. I only wish this was not a problem. It is unsanitary. It is also very loud."
"Love this appliance for all it can do -- so many useful options. However, the 64 oz container leaked when in use, which made a mess on the counter. So, we are returning for a replacement. Hopefully this unit is just a lemon and the new one will work properly."
"Works ok. Not a lot of options or versatility for the price. Bottom of the 64 oz processor bowl busted completely out just shy of 3 years from purchase. Called manufacturer who would send a replacement bowl for $84. That’s half the price I paid for the whole package, and they haven’t changed the design. Opting to take my $84 and put it toward purchasing a difference food processor with more options."
"I read some of the negative reviews on this, but the positives far outweighed the negatives.  I thought to myself if anything went wrong, I'd be able to get my money back or a replacement, right?  I was *WRONG*.I purchased this for my wife in January.  She seemed happy with it ... until the food processor cracked **just after** the return window.  We were concerned for our baby (she was making baby food) that shards may have been in his food, so we dumped all of it.After finding at Amazon that it was outside of the return window, I reached out to the manufacturer, thankful that they had a 1 year warranty.  Guess what?  The food processor is NOT covered by warranty.  Gee, I wonder why.  (Read the reviews.)I insisted that it is not fair for this to break a few days outside of the return window and we needed a replacement.  They flatly denied me, offering it at $65.  Okay, fine.  Want to rip me off?  I'll reach out to Amazon support.  Surely they'll help me!  Wrong.  Again, I say ... WRONG.The Amazon support lady was very nice (compared to the Ninja support) and tried everything she could, but the best she said she could do is offer a 20% discount on the new food processor part which was $65 or so.  They simply wouldn't budge!So, here I am, having made a purchase that I thought I would be protected from any type of malfunction since we went through Amazon, and was wrong.  The product broke, Neither Ninja nor Amazon will refund or replace.  Sadly, I was ripped off and have no recourse.  $130+ down the drain.If you are considering purchasing this, heed my warning.  It may work well for you, but if it does not, your money is wasted and you have NO recourse.  Whether it is a few days or a few months outside of the return window.  My recommendation would be to look elsewhere, not just for the lack of quality and support, but out of principle ... don't support a company that refuses to support its customers."
"I had a Ninja blender, model CT810, since 2019. I had no complaints about the blending, typical blades at the bottom of the jar and the food is pulled down to blend smoothly. Perfect smoothies every time in about a minute! The complaints were - the device was loud, the jar had to be replaced about once a year, the base is big & heavy, suction cups really stick to the counter (safety feature, but annoying). About a month ago, the blender was making very high pitched noises, wasn't blending well, smelled like it was burning so I concluded it was time to replace the unit.Since money is tight, I found this model on sale for $99 and bought it because I need my smoothies! I heard something negative about this style of blender a while ago, though, about the tall blending blade but couldn't remember the issue. HERE IS THE ISSUE - IT STINKS! This is the worst blender I've ever owned. Nothing is blended smoothly! All my smoothies and salad dressings are chewy. This blender just doesn't pulverize well LIKE THE OLD UNIT DID. The blade DOES NOT CLICK IN, it just sits on top of the part that spins. The unit does not have a clean function so you have to clean it all manually. When cleaning, you're just trying not to cut yourself!  It's a tower of blades!This blender is normally $200 so it should blend better! The food processor attachment is just as bad! You must blend for more than 2-3 minutes for your food to get ""some what"" smooth, ""kinda"" smooth. Blending this long can cause your food to get warm which stinks if you want it cold!If you make smoothies everyday, this is NOT the blender for you. It's definitely is NOT the blender for me. I'm going to check to see if Ninja will refurbish the old one. I need a good blender! This is NOT the one."
"This blender works but as far as the smoothie cups, if you fill to the line expect the blender to start smoking, and it smokes even if you fill below the line too. I returned this product."
"Performance is great.But....they are awful to clean.  Too many nooks and crannies.  The lid  to food processor holds water, (And yes it says not to immerse products,  but water still gets in) and that can lead to bacteria growth if it isn't completely drained.You should also include a safety glove for cleaning the bladed parts. They are extremely sharp."
"I purchased the Ninja BL770 Mega Kitchen System that clearly states on the box and online that it comes with a 72 oz. blender picture.  This is an outright lie.  It comes with a 64 oz. pitcher.  When I reached out to their customer service department by email asking why a 64 oz blender pitcher was in the box, this is the response I received ""We wish to inform you that the 72-oz. pitcher was remodeled to a 64-oz. max liquid capacity pitcher. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.""How about that.  They changed the product contents but not the packaging.  This is totally misleading.  Shame on you SharkNinja!"
"I’m on the fence with this product. We use the blender and cups in a daily basis. They work fine. The only issue I have with the blender is being able to clean the bottom. You need to use pipe cleaner/scrubbers to get the funk out of the cracks or there is nasty build up.The major disappointment I do have is with the 64 oz food processor bowl. Same situation with the cleaning but upon further inspection I realized that 3 out of 4 of the screw sites that attaches the bottom piece were completely broken through. I had only used for about 2 months.  If you are a heavy duty user for dough or making butter, look for something more durable. The only way I saw this is when trying to clean the build up.Warranty:  this product has a LIMITED warranty on time AND products included. Customer service said that the processor bowl wasn’t covered under warranty, just the blender. They said they would make an exception this time since I called during warranty period. If you do purchase and additional warranty is available through Amazon, get it.Overall, the product fulfills my needs but since it has some manufacturing and durability flaws I would purchase something different if I had to do over again."
Arrived broken pitcher.Had to return.
Leaves items chunky!
"I enjoyed using the food processor and my family loved having fresh peanut butter. Unfortunately the processor attachment cracked after only 4 uses. It's not durable. Sadly, to replace the processor it's more than half of the cost of the entire package. I expected more for this brand and price point."
The motor is awesome. However the lid seals on almost every attachments are non functional after 3 years of rarely using it (first lid went after about a year).I came back to review it after the last seal broke on the lid of the food processer attachment finally went while using it.. what a mess...
"The gears that fit into the attachments are are attached through screws screwed into plastic. The plastic and the screws themselves broke in half in less than a year of mild use (possibly used 1/month on average), making it impossible to repair the attachment. When the gears break off, the yellow grease that keeps the gears “healthy”, making the attachment impossible to wash because you can’t risk washing away too much of the grease/oil, which could further damage the product. Additionally, I’m not sure how safe the product is to use if the gears are not firmly attached. I contacted ninja and they promptly sent a replacement part. They will want pictures, so make sure you have them before throwing out the broken pieces. The replacement part did have a slightly green huge to the plastic, in case that would bother anyone. At this point I was very happy with the company and the customer service, albeit a bit worried about the quality of the product. Unfortunately, the replacement part broke in the exact same way just a few months later. When I reached out to ninja this time, my warranty had expired, and they said I’d have to purchase a new part. I expressed my concerns that there was a manufacturing defect, given that two parts had broken the same way in very little time with mild use. I asked what was being done to address the issue, hoping to get reassurance that if I did buy a new part, that wouldn’t break in a few months as well. They offered me no answers or reassurances. They did offer 50% off the new part and free shipping, but I’m uncomfortable spending additional money on a product with no guarantee that I won’t have to keep buying replacement parts. Especially now that the main attachment I use is no longer available to me and I’ll have to start using the other attachments with the same frequency and may find them breaking in a few months as well. Ninja is a well reviewed product, I thought I was investing in a quality product. I can’t recommend buying until the company addresses what must be a manufacturing defect."
This product works great EXCEPT that after the 1st use of the food processor bowl it cracked. Bowl was loaded into dishwasher and came out cracked.
"I'm not wasting Time digging up the video's the first one we sent right back, the second still makes the same squealing noise the first one made, pretty much strait out of the box. My previous ninja went 12 years before making this noise. the round blend jar is made of the cheapest possible materials, the First on cracked right away, I just sent it back with the rest of the unit & got a brand new one when they replaced the entire product. Unfortunately it also cracked almost immediately. So I'm back to making my daily smoothies in the full size much harder to clean square. overall I wouldn't purchase this product again. It's still covered under warranty , product & extended, just doesn't seem like it's worth the time or effort to have them replace it every 3 months. this is the most disappointed in ninja I have ever been. I would just use the older short jar, however they downgraded the motor hardware power transfer spindle to a junky spindle that's half the size of the original.. so there you have it.  I'll add pictures next time i log in..."
"I like this model for its performance and versatility.  But it just died after three years.  I had this model previously and it died after about the same time.  I liked it so much I bought a second one.  I'm not buying a third one.  I'm buying a Vitamix.  Expensive but I expect to have it much longer than six years, so it will pay for itself."
"Haven’t even used it yet but I’m already annoyed because of the change in the suction feet. The old model that I just replaced had a lever to manually suction the feet. This one automatically suctions to the surface it’s on. That’s great for when it’s in use. When it’s just being stored, that’s a whole other issue. I have limited space and I need the blender to be right up against the side of the cabinet. But I quickly learned that I can’t do that with this new model and new suction design. Because you have to fit your hands around the sides of the blender to release the suction. So I have to store it far enough from the side of the cabinet to be able to un-suction it when I want to get it out and use it, wasting valuable cabinet space. Very annoyed."
"We bought this combo blender, food processor unit on January 5 2022, 6 months later we are having to replace the food processor bowl already.  The screws broke off the part they screwed into without any chance of repair.I contacted Ninja for warranty replacement and they stated only the machine portion is warranted.  They did offer to send me a new bowl for this ""one time promotion"" if I paid for the shipping and handling of $17.  I elected for this option but from the period we purchased this and now, I had the opportunity of using a Vitamix and the two are very different, confirming I should have just bit the bullet.What's the difference?  This unit has 3 blades and still has difficulty making things smooth.  Sure having a food processor and blender with the same machine makes for storing this equipment easier, but when I need it to perform, it just doesn't have the same power.This one goes to my son when he buys his first house and I will get my Vitamix....July 2023 update-I can say I dislike this product, pure and simple.  I have gone through another food processor bowl and this time they won't warranty the bowl.  It's $65 plus shipping, which means I could have purchased another better performing unit.The blender option does not make ""snow"" with ice cubes as described.  I find I have to smack the sides often in order to get the top to blend into the bottom.  Don't get me wrong, the motor is extremely powerful, but the plastics used for the rest of the product aren't capable of handling this amount of power.  Too Bad...."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It’s none of my habit to write reviews, probably it’s my first time. But I was surprised with the poor quality and the POOR customer service I experienced with Ninja.So I bought this set back in November 2022 and I was happy about it in the beginning, until my wife put the smoothie in the dishwasher ( since they claimed it’s a dishwasher safe) and it completely melted out, so I said no big deal … the set comes with two.But we later noticed that the lid of the blender just started malfunctioning, read about it online and looks like its a common malfunctioning. Then we noticed that also the handle if blender was melted. Then one day I was trying to use the processor, once I tried to hook it up to the motor it just suddenly shattered from below ( the video attached ) and it’s completely useless now.The worst part is that I called the customer service after less than 8 months of use and we told them what happened and they said first that “you should have called earlier” we said it’s still within the one year warranty they said yes but this is “wear and tear” …. They claimed that the damage the dishwasher caused was “wear and tear” … then they said you probably didn’t put it on the top rack in the dishwasher, then they said why didn’t you call once the smoothie blender got melted, then they said how did you cook all that time if your food processor wasn’t working ?!!Anyway, they refused to replace any part and they were trying so hard to come up with any excuse to not replace any part. Literally the worst customer service experience EVER."
"I didn't keep this unit, and I had hopes that the design would have changed for the better. We have had an older Ninja Kitchen system for many years, and it has worked ok. But, there have been some issues with the design. The plastic cracks, especially around any part where there is metal and plastic molded together. The old one has not failed yet, but it is scary to use. It is also not easy to clean. If you place it in the dishwasher, water gets trapped in the top and IN THE HANDLE. There is gross dishwasher slime that is growing in the handle that I can't clean. There is a tiny drain hole at the bottom of the handle, but in the dishwasher dirty water gets trapped in the handle.The new unit appears to have similar features. The handle is the same without a way to clean the hollow inside and the lockable cover also gets water inside with no way to dry it out. It is an expensive appliance, so I returned it before we experience similar problems.With other products that we have owned from Ninja, their customer service is very poor. With what they already have, they could really be great if they would fix some of these problems."
"I've had a ninja food processor for over a decade with zero issues. Works like new still. When it was time to buy a blender I looked no further than ninja. Blender worked fine initially with my only complaint being it's not quite as easy to clean as the food processor. There are small spaces food can get trapped... But still worked fine.Few days ago, it stopped working mid-blend. No obvious problems. I called to get a replacement under the 1 year limited warranty. 45 minutes on the phone and I am being sent a new base unit. In that 45 minutes I had to prove via video it does not work. I was asked to pay shipping which I outright refused... They are shipping it for free.. and I was also told ""I should have gone through Amazon for the warranty"".. which actually just links you to ninjas customer service. 45 frustrating minutes, but a replacement is being sent. I like this blender a lot, but it's difficult to suggest a product that broke so quickly and was like pulling teeth to get a replacement."
I purchased two of these Ninja blenders. The first was over five years ago through Kohl’s. Loved the size and strength. The handle locking lid broke within a year and a half. Husband replaced with a much cheaper product before I could check into. I purchased this much bigger set July of 2023 on a great deal. I needed the container size to make double batches of green smoothies. I thought I liked the Ninja brand and felt it could be reliable so I purchased the fancy coffee machine a few months ago to replace my old Keurig. Well I obviously got fooled again because just over 13 months after purchasing the big blender/food processor set the base motor stand went out. In my haste to purchase it because of the great deal price I didn’t purchase an extra warranty. Now the second blender/food processor is USELESS and I’m second guessing the $150 coffee machine I purchased. I have less than a week to get everything together and request a return. WTF is up NINJA?!?!
"Just an alert I didn’t know. This has a cancer warning prop 65, I opted to not use it and get one that didn’t.  It might be a great blender but that is unsettling for me."
Material quality is bad
"I love the strength of the motor but the plastic pieces don’t last as well as my Cuisinart did. I bought this two years ago, almost to the day, and I paid $160 for the bowl, blender and two small blenders with blades and now I have to pay $100 just to replace the bowl! That’s crazy!"
Doesn't grind food fine enough or small enough. All the extra equipment is useless for that reaso
"Not a lot of settings, plastic, doesn't last long. Expensive for what it is."
The box was broken in different places and blender was damaged. So had to return. But I've used this blender before in the past and works great. I will buy again.
"This is very much a Ninja machine no doubt. Same features such as multi-blades, powerful motor, and well-built. However, when compared to my IQ system, this is a downgrade even with an IQ 1400-watt motor as compared to this one. Why, because mostly plastic parts and not just that, flip the accessories over and you see the smaller gears and less sturdy parts as compared to IQ. This is an ok system, but if you can get IQ series, go for it."
"Basic good for money. No AutoIQ , work done with ease"
"I'm addicted to Kale smoothies. Our previous Ninja was a single serving 12 oz, and we used that sucker for better than 10 years, til the motor burned up. That's why I was so surprised this Ninja wasn't at least half as good. If it mixed well enough to make Kale smoothies smooth, it'd be different. But there are chunks, and bits and pieces of Kale. I love Kale, but I want my Kale smoothie smooth. I don't wanna chew my Kale smoothie and pick out big pieces of Kale from my teeth. Too late to return, so side note to Ninja - fix this issue, please."
"I just unpacked my Ninja and noticed the food processor bowl was chipped. I’m excited to try it, so I’m hoping this isn’t a big issue, but it’s still a little disappointing."
"All the gadgetry and blades that I cut myself first time trying to deal with it and yet not in any mode did it make smoothies or cashew creams really creamy. My fault. I was trying to save money and didn’t realize what this product was. No length of time running or speed really made it smooth and creamy. Instead the liquid separated  from the fruit, nuts or veggies and did not satisfy. Bought another blender I knew I should have chosen since and wow it does the job!!"
It works really efficiently but I don't know after 2 weeks it started making strange noises after I stop it. It really makes me uncomfortable that its quite expensive but still not worth it.
"We have used the Ninja System for years and ours finally needed to be replaced.  We were super excited by the new features but shocked when we realized the 24 oz cups we use multiple times a day are NOT compatible and the “new” cups are only 16ounces.  When you add ice, fruit, protein powder 16 oz is way to small.  This, in our estimation, is an epic fail on Ninja design team!  So disappointed."
I am very dissapointed that I could not return the item freshly opened and realized it did not fit my counter I am very disatisfied.
"This blender arrived looking used or refurbished. The lid had small gaps around the edges where the plastic doesn't seem to have bonded together or molded properly. Out of the box, it had dirt on it and some sort of residue in places. The suction cups on the bottom contained dirt particles in them. I guess it's possible I received a store display or something, who knows. This is not a heavy duty blender. I don't expect to use it much, so I opted to just hand wash it and keep it as long as it works. If you're looking for a blender you intend to use every day, this is probably not a good choice. If you're like me, and you'll only use it once every 6 months it's probably fine. Cleaning this blender and all of the attachments is a pure pain in the rear. I wouldn't trust it in the dishwasher to be honest."
"I wish I would not have bought this. I wanted it mostly for smoothies, and the smoothie cups are way too small!  So I use the big blender and I have to keep scrapping down the sides. And it is a pain to clean. When you put the big blender in the dish washer upside down, food and junk get in between the plastic and is really hard to get out. This might be fine for someone who cooks a lot, but for me it is much too bulky and expensive!!!"
"I was so excited about this combination, but it falls short for me. The blender doesn’t have many speeds since it’s the same speeds as for the food processor. And the food processor does NOT have an opening in the lid so you can drizzle in something to help emulsify a mixture. I didn’t realize that when purchasing and it’s kind of a deal breaker for me. If that’s not an important feature in a food processor for you, then maybe these will work for me. The combo is a great idea and each unit is okay, but none are great which is disappointing considering the price point."
I love the power of this thing but it’s hard to clean! When food gets under the containers and in small spaces between plastic then it’s nearly impossible to get out! Had to use pipe cleaners to reach ours and I worry about molding
"I loved this product, at first...  Two weeks after receiving the blender I used the single serving unit, and the cup became stuck in locked position.  I worked with customer service, and they were helpful, but the single serve unit was not letting go.  So, I told the rep I needed to return for a new one.First, he told me to cut off the cord and take a picture to email to Shark/Ninja, and then he would order a new one for me, but stated it would cost $30 for shipping.  I said I am not paying the shipping costs for a defective unit that lasted two weeks, so he waived that.  The thing that disgusted me the most is that my replacement was a different model!  I don't like this model.  I want the one I ordered!This different model has single serve cups that are huge, it less easier to clean, and the button options are not at all desirable.  The reason they sent me a different model was to eliminate any possible benefit of using the original unit's accessories.  That may have been the least they could do to make up for the hassle of the broken unit.  But, no!  The company would rather have more waste in our landfills instead of having two of all of the attachments that could have been put to use.I will NEVER buy another Shark/Ninja product!  It's too bad, because I love my Shark vacuum cleaner."
"This should have a ""objects appear smaller"" sign because when I received the package it was huge AND so were all the attachments. I returned it due to space issues. So if your kitchen is spacially deficient, stick to nutribullet"
It’s a ninja! It just works great but the smoothie cups crack very easy and start to leak!
"The ninja is a great blender. However, the lid is not very well constructed."
"Ok first things first, if you live in an apartment building like I do I wouldn't recommend this. I mean seriously your neighbors will be complaining about noise. The thing is louder than my impact driver. If you ever walked into a coffee shop and they have multiple blenders filled with ice going at once, this one is louder than that. Not exaggerating. Besides that they gave me the wrong size blender attachment. It's not 72 oz with extra space above like all the pictures have, it's 64 oz with a little space above it. It doesn't even have 72 oz written on it. The blades came dinged up already and I didn't even use it yet so thats a red flag on the quality of it. Honestly I would be afraid to blend ice in because the plastic its made out of seems like it would break if it got hit with a chunk of ice, especially because of how powerful the motor is. It kinda feels like they put all the budget they got for making this into the motor and just skimped on the quality of the rest. I'll share more if I don't return since they sent give me a 72 oz blending pitcher... New....So mine stopped working the second time I tried to use it. Made a different crazy noise, I smelled burning then it just stopped. I told them I wanted to return it and all was fine, they told me to just keep it instead of returning it, but now I'm still being charged for thing and I'm ticked off. I told them 3 times they keep charging me for it. Not recommended"
"I purchased the Ninja AMZCHEF 2000 Watt Commercial Blender in October 2023. Lasted just only one year 🤔 and the motor quit. Just like that. No warning signs, nothing. I used this everyday for my smoothies. Just one a day. I braved calling tech support, iykyk. They wanted to offer me, offer… me… another motor for only $99.00. Oh PLUS shipping and handling.  No thanks. Looking at Vitamix.  Vitamix has a good reputation and offers many different types of blenders to fit my needs. I am definitely going to check out Vitamix.  Give Vitamix a try instead!!! Not an affiliated with Vitamix."
"While this blender combo provides excellent power and will blend just about anything, there are a few design flaws which other reviewers have mentioned.  There is also a slight learning curve.  When blending small batches, you should only use the cups, however, if the substance is thick, you will have to wait for it to drip down to the blade before you can blend it.  This is because you must fill the cup, then attach the blade at the top, and then invert the cup.  This causes you to wait for the substance to drip down to the blade in order to process.  The large pitcher is wonderful, but it is difficult to get everything out of it.  It is also difficult to clean.  I always soak it right away in hot soapy water.  It is dishwasher safe, but there will still be moisture underneath the gasket and the only way to clean that is by using a srewdriver and taking everything apart.  With all that being said, this is still a powerful blender and smoothie maker.Update: 12/6/24 - I have had my blnder for 1 month and 1 day.  Tried blending some cooled potato soup and it began smoking.  Turn it off and called customer service.  They said there is nothing wrong with the belnder, but with the pitcher and extra blades.  They are sending replacement and they recommend replacing every 6 months!  Replacements cost me $5.21 and will be delivered in 7-10 business days.  Doesn't seem very cost effective to me!  If it lasts 10 yrs and I replace every 6 months, this blender will cost me $104.20 in addition to the original purchase!"
Pro: It is powerful.It turns off if the pitcher moves off the motor.The pitcher is large.(Says it takes hot liquids but I didn’t test that)Cons: The top doesn’t stay on.The blender is powerful but the food that’s put in just flys to the side.The apparatus to help mix is too short without taking off the lid which is counter productive.It’s hard to get all of your food out once it’s mixed. Not the easiest to clean.It’s loud—but at there any blenders that are not?
I really liked the functionality of use with individual portion containers.  This is the second one we have had in less than a year and both have quit ....  this one restarted after unplugging and replugging several times.  Fingers are crossed but I will update if needed.
This was shipped in its original box with no protection. The box was ripped open and I'm not even sure that the blender is working correctly. It is super fast and gets hot. I am not happy
"This worked fine at first but after 3 months of at best moderate use (4-6 times a week) it has started to make a ""whine"" sound on all of the speeds. I'll be reaching out to Nutribullet to see if it's covered under warranty."
"-----UPDATE----Have had blender for 10 days. It smelled like it was burning up first use but read in questions it is normal. Well today it started pouring smoke out of it while blending blueberries and milk. Not a fan anymore.So this review is literally for any ninja blender folks. If you are like me you love your ninja. It was the best blender you ever had. The stacked blades are super awesome and it slices absolutely everything to a pulpy liquid. Yeah, definitely loved my ninja, then after a year the pitcher on the bottom cracked. No big deal I thought, get a new pitcher, well yeah till you see the price of just the pitcher. Might as well get the whole blender again.Read up on the new ones and why is it not a 4 star? Everyone mentioning how quickly the plastic cracked! That or the tabs on the lid not wanting to open up. Hmm, so I looked around, almost bought something other than this and the only reason I did not buy that item was I could not find another blender cup. Need to have 2 blender cups. Wife and hubby, no sharing, she can't have my goodies. First thought of going back to a normal blender (bottom blades vs stacked) was it is gonna suck. No way is it gonna do what my ninja did. I know, starting to sound like a ninja fan boy.Well let me tell you how wrong I was. I have not tried just ice yet but do my normal frozen to half frozen vegetables and this sucker kicks. It pulverized more than my ninja did. Less grit more juice. It does have a harder time getting started as all the weight is on the top of the blades unlike the ninja. However, pop it on high and it just goes. I was worried about food not getting down the sides cause it came with the ugly food pusher thing in it. I was like, I am not pushing food down the sides of this pitcher. Come to find out if you need it, you just put it in and you get more whirling action and don't have to do anything. I use the ""extract"" button, dont need the food pusher thing. All juice. nothing but juice and the motor pumps. I am honestly very surprised and even thought to myself it liquidates too much as I like a little pulp if you will. If you are in doubt over another brand, I can only say this thing is amazing. No I did not get paid or even anything free to write this. Just hope to help someone else who might be OCD or worried over such an item."
"I've had this blender for two months and it broke while I was making ice cream.  I originally purchased this blender as a replacement for my Ninja blender, which isn't really a blender, but more of a food processor in blender form.  I was excited when I received it and I could blend up kale and other ingredients into my smoothies without leaving clumps of wet veggies for me to suck up through a straw and choke on.  Everything was awesome for the first two months and I was really impressed with the blender and happy with my purchase.  Then, about a month ago, I was making some ice cream by blending up some frozen bananas and strawberries and the blades wouldn't turn.  The lights on the front panel would blink but wouldn't wouldn't turn.  The base smelled like something burning.  I knew that meant the motor burned out.  I contacted the company and, after explaining the predicament, they claimed that the problem was the blender blades which wear out after 6-8 months and need to be replaced.  I reminded them that I had only had the blender for 2 months and that if the blades had worn out, then why was it that the base smelled like something burning.  They wanted to send me a replacement pitcher and smoothie cups as long as I payed the shipping.  I told them I wasn't going to pay shipping to replace a part that wasn't broken and still have a non-functioning blender which I have only had for two months.  The rep spoke with his manager and said they would wave the shipping.  I told them that still didn't solve the problem of the motor being burned out.  I would have to wait for the parts to ship, try them out, confirm that it didn't fix the problem, and then contact them again so they can replace the base which is what's broken in the first place.  The rep just kept reaffirming that the blades were the problem. even though they weren't leaking the ""organic oil"" that he claims wear out over time.  I was not happy with the response but couldn't convince the representative of the actually problem, so I ended the call with them after giving my address to send the replacement pitcher.  Within the week, I got an email saying that the parts were back ordered and could take up to 3 weeks until they could ship them.  In the meantime, I've been without a blender for about a month now and don't know when I will finally have a working one to use again to make my daily smoothies.  I should have spent the extra money and bought a Vitamix.  I'm not happy with how this at all turned out, and I don't see myself ever doing business with this company again."
"What's good: If you follow the instructions with the order of ingredients and ratio of frozen ingredients to non-frozen, you get a great smoothie with the ""extract"" button. It makes a very smooth and creamy, TASTY smoothie. It blends things so nicely that every ingredient combo seems better than you'd expect. You can add raw carrots and they get obliterated. Great for soups.What's bad: The smoothies are not as thick as we were used to. I like the consistency more than my husband does. It is a bit thinner, but good for kids to suck through straws. It is a bit difficult to make banana nice cream or thicker tofu/veggie mixtures for savory recipes: there are always chunks. We have had this for 3 years and it is NEVER as clean as we want it: the blade doesn't come out to clean, and the rubber band around the lid gets disgusting and is impossible to clean well even if you take it off and work with a toothpick.In hindsight I would make a different purchase, but we like this enough to not replace it until we have to."
The thing worked great for the first month and a half. Than about a week or so ago it just stopped working. There wasn’t any warning or bad sounds prior to it stopping. The lights all come on but it just doesn’t run. I really wanted to love this thing because I’ve had my other Nutra Bullet for 6 years and it’s still running great. I just was ready for an upgrade.
"12/30/23 update - customer service  told meI was outside of the year warranty, to be expected. They mentioned something interesting though that I thought buyers should be aware of. Nutribullet recommends replacing the blade and pitcher assembly every 6-8 months due to dried out lubricant. When I spend this kind of money I expect it to last longer than 6-8 months. My replacement high speed blender will not be a Nutribullet. Reduced rating to 3 stars because it did work well for the first 18 months (I used it weekly so about 80 uses total).12/28/23 update - Started making a grinding sound a couple weeks ago and seems to have a hard time getting started. Now it’s shutting down after only 5-10 seconds of use. Contacting Nutribullet’s customer service… we’ll see how that goes.Been making smoothies with this for a few weeks now and it’s handled pretty much everything I’ve thrown at it; spinach, frozen fruits, nuts and seeds. Blends them all to a good consistency. The next test will be making some homemade hot sauce, but I have little doubt it will easily blend that as well. It’s a little tricky to get clean under the blades but manageable with some hot water and some effort. And it’s a high speed blender so it’s loud. For me, these are reasonable expectations for the price range though. If it lasts, it will be well worth the money."
"The reason I purchased this machine was the versatility. I make smoothies sometimes just for me and sometimes more than one so I thought it would work out nicely. I never loved it as you always had to add so much liquid to make it work. It finally stopped working with the cups in 2023-which of course is after the 1 year warranty. So I thought well I can still use the blender. I have used it much less in the last year because i had to use the big blender and then transfer to the cup and all that cleaning for one drink was a pain. So to have the whole machine break down after so little use is just insane. This is basically a disposable machine. Which is not good for my money, my landfill or the world in general. If I had used this daily and really got my money out of it maybe I would give it more than one star but even though it is 3 years and 4 months old it is just me using it and basically for smoothies-which is a couple of times a month in the beginning but even less after the ability to make single cups was taken away. I definitely do not recommend. Not powerful enough for simple smoothies and both parts of the machine are garbage today 3 years in."
"I purchased this blender set in October 19, 2023. I am writing this on June 7, 2024. I cannot turn the blender on without it smoking very heavily and smelling like a circuit fire. Not only is this faulty and hazardous, but also inexcusable for an appliance that is only 7 months old. I have never used the blender for anything more than smoothie or soup blending. I have never overloaded it, or let it run excessively.Problems happen with appliances, but my frustration has grown drastically at customers service's handling (or lack thereof). I contacted customer service Tuesday via online submission. I was messaged to contact a customer service representative who asked for details. After filling him in, he said the call needed to be escalated and someone would call me back. THAT WAS THREE DAYS AGO. I have since sent a follow up email and still received no response. So I have a 7 month old blender that I cannot turn on and I have yet to have a customer service rep even offer an apology, much less call back with a resolution to the issue.DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER. I am sick of planned obsolescence and dealing with appliances breaking after a year or two. However, this blender not only broke, but is a fire hazard after 7 months. It is supposed to have a 1 year warranty, but apparently if you have a problem within that time frame, customer service will just ignore you."
"I blend very basic smoothies and pretty often. My magic bullet died and so I wanted something with good reviews, something quiet, powerful and relatively small. Well, this isn’t really it. It takes forever to blend. I’m guessing the random flashing lights is it overheating? It’s only blending for maybe 2-3 minutes. I’ve used it maybe three times and it’s actually quite loud. I’m annoyed because it’s expensive and I needed a good blender. I don’t know what to do. Smh."
"Thought I did my research and this was suppose to be a powerful blender.  It is not.  Really doesn't do well with nut butters and nut creams at all.  Smoothies are not so smooth, always bits and pieces left.  Hard to scrap down.  Very difficult to clean!  I read every direction and watched every video, still can't get this to work well for our family needs.  I cannot recommend this blender.  I find my Philips Immersion Blender much more powerful!"
"I make 2 protein shakes a day.  Occassionally blend fruit and veggies for juice.  Loved the idea of the 'carry cups'.  BUT, instead, I've spent lots of time on hold or with Customer Service.  First:  I order from THE NUTRIBULLET website, additional blender blade twist.  They arrived and didn't fit right.  So, I called Nutribullet.  The guy said, ""Yeah, there are little numbers on the blades and you have the wrong one.""  I asked how I, as a consumer, would know this--and where on their website do I see these little numbers.  He confessed there is no way to know this and it's common, etc.  I paid to ship the wrong ones back and my refund covered the cost of shipping them back.  So, it was like giving Nutribullet free money for their little unknown thing on their website.  Not happy, but ok...so, I'm using the darn thing and putting the cups/blender twist caps in the dishwasher.  After 6 months, it starts leaking--big time.  Mess everywhere.  The unit shut itself down because it was wet. I called Nutribullet again.  The guy tells me that for regular use, needing replacements every 6 months is common.  Common?  Then, he asks how I clean them. I said 'dishwasher'.  He said that the dishwasher is not recommended (sure enough, that language is in there--guess I didn't want to see it), and I should be happy I got 6 months out of them using the dishwasher.  Sigh.  He said to let the blender unit dry for 72 hours and then try it again.  BUT, they were temporarily out of stock on the blade twists that I need.  I waited the 72 hours and it worked.  But, I still have leaking blade twists.  I waited a month (now I'm using my old reliable Oster blender--not sure why I felt it necessary to put this good workhorse in mothballs) and then order more Nutribullet Twist Blade things....I was SOOOOO careful to pick the correct model for the 'accessory'.  Sure enough, it arrives with the wrong little numbers...it's a leaker!  I called (AGAIN) Nutribullet.  Got a woman this time.  She knows nothing about little numbers on the blades (I tell her I'm looking at them and can send her a picture--that the caps look identical except for these freaking numbers).  She now thinks I'm bat-crazy.  I'm thinking I'm bat crazy to have invested this much money AND time into a freaking blender.  Really?  Are you all buying new blade assembly twist caps every 6 months?  What planet am I from?  So, be aware of the 6-month leaky blade; AND wash everything by hand (including big blender pitcher with the fixed blades at the bottom...right!), and get ready for phone calls to Customer Service.  OR, do what I am doing now:  Tossing this monstrosity.  This has been a joke."
Role after a year with only using it a couple times.
"Nutribullet ships to you directly via UPS, not through Amazon. This is how my package arrived.Miraculously, the blender works but I worry about its longevity."
"I've been using the NUTRI NINJA iQ for the last 6 years and wanted to upgrade. I've used this NUTRI BULLET product at my daughter's house and loved it.  I wanted to purchase for my home.  However, I'm giving it 3 stars because it did not come as advertised. In the picture it shows a 24ounce cup with a handle, which my daughter has.  I checked my model number, (NUTRIBULLET #ZNBF30500Z) and I did receive the correct machine, but not the correct accessories as per the picture. This is very disappointing as I was looking forward to using that."
"I bought this blender because I cook a lot and make a ton of smoothies, sauces and other foods that need to be blended on a regular basis and it seemed like my 10 year old Ninja blending system was starting to get dull. Based on all the positive reviews of this blender and seeing it everywhere on social media, I assumed this would be a powerful little blender that I could keep on the counter and I liked that it didn't come with a ton of accessories. Several months later I am very disappointed. The blades on this blender are extremely blunt from the start; you can literally rub your fingers on the blades and not get cut. It will not chop up a frozen (or fresh!) banana, sorry. It will always leave chunks behind. And if you want to add frozen spinach or kale to your smoothie, well I hope you like slurping down chunks of soggy greens, because it will not completely liquify frozen fruits or veggies, regardless of how long I blend or which setting I use. Even my 10 year old Ninja with the dull blades was better than this piece of junk. I really don't understand the hype of this thing. Beyond mixing a simple protein shake, it has never actually performed the task I wanted it to do. If you try to blend anything that doesn't have copious amounts of liquid in it, the mixture will immediately get pushed to the sides of the container and the blades will just spin round and round, not hitting anything. If you have serious blending to do, please buy something else."
"If you intend on blending things daily, do not buy this blender because it has a critical design flaw—mine lasted literally days after the one year warranty expired…and I am angry. So, double the price of one of these and buy yourself a Vitamix that will last longer than a year. Just horrible! Went died in a puff of the smell of smoke...and then died all together!Update: after I emailed the company about what I should do given the blend parts aren't available to buy on their own, and they told me ""sorry, the product is past the limited one year warranty."" So I called the number, and I spent sixty minutes on the phone. Here's the gist: if you want to EVER use the warranty, you need to send the company monthly updates on the condition of the blender. I'm not kidding. I hope they check their call logs because this is bonkers!!As you can see from the images, this is erosion due to use, which means it occurred prior to the warranty expiration, and further it means that as a matter of course the design flaw on this blender means two parts will spin against one another; NutriBullet let me know I should have reported that erosion sooner. (sounds like a regular problem the agents are trained to gaslight you about). Sooner than a month after the expiration. Sooner than I knew there was a problem.Also, 1) they can't replace the parts; but, 2) customers need to replace the blades every 6 months. I inquired if I could do this. They don't even sell those. How this company hasn't faced a class action I do not know, but it's offensive how bad the customer service was. They ended the call by pretending they could not help me...who does that? I was calm and patient and I was even nice.I turned around and bought a replacement from a different company. Be wise. Buy any brand but this one."
The blades do not come out of the large pitcher making it impossible to clean under them. If you blend peanut butter… what a nightmare. The smaller attachments are great but what huge flaw in the large pitcher.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I LOVED this blender.. for the 2 months it worked. It stopped working out of nowhere after having worked perfectly fine the day previous! I’ve only used it for smoothies but have made a smoothie at least 5x weekly since getting it so if you are planning on using it heavily, I’d suggest a different blender brand."
"I really wanted to love this product. I had it for 10 days before the motor gave up. I was excited to have a new blender that wasn’t so heavy or bulky and was simple to clean and use. It blended really well and never left any chunks. I used it every day I had it until one day it turned on but it just wouldn’t blend anymore. I tried everything from letting it sit for a day withoufht turning on, to plugging it in different outlets and came to find that if I gave it a thump it would quickly blend and stop, sensors where fine it just seemed to be the motor. I had it only 10 days, luckily I was still within the return window. I decided to look into this product in more detail only to come to find out this is an issue that everyone has eventually come across. Some experience it as quickly as I did and others a month, two months, or even a year later. It’s just a faulty product from the manufacturer. Just save yourself the money and find a product that will last if used daily. Or buy it from a retailer that has an extended return policy."
I bought this blender for general use as well as an occasional smoothie. It really didn’t do an efficient job making homemade mayo. It’s quite noisy.
"I had a small bullet that worked well for years of daily use before it gave out. I bought this because it had the big jug as well as my bullets. The bullet piece works well  and I like the blender, but the jug part is a problem. It is a somewhat flexible plastic and the first time I used it, it leaked. So I tightened the bottom and ever since it has been stuck . I can’t get it off to clean it. I have tried putting it on the base and reversing it, but that doesn’t work due to the way the base is constructed. I have tried loosening it with a screw driver, no good. I tried gentle Tapping, soaking, I sprayed w D40 to no avail. I will be calling the company next. I will update my review then. Stay tuned."
I was initially very excited about this purchase.when I received it I washed and  put it together very quickly.the first thing I noticed was how loud and aggressive it was! it was so loud and so aggressive. I was certain it had crushed all the ice I put in it for the smoothie and when I looked it had not crushed anything. it wasn't even moving the ice or fruits. needless to say it went back very quickly
"Leaves frozen banana chunks behind.  I also have a problem where the LEDs will blink repeatedly after a cycle and the blender becomes unresponsive.  I have to physically unplug and replug the unit for it to become responsive again.  I contacted support and they asked for my invoice as proof of purchase.  I emailed that back to them, but now crickets.  I will probably just return and maybe just spend the extra on a Vitamix or Blendtec.  Save your moneyUPDATE: Support responded to me, but they just keep asking for my proof of purchase, which I sent three times.  Finally on the third time, they informed me that the blinking lights usually indicates that the unit has overheated.  I get that I need to submit proof of purchase for a warranty claim, but there's no reason why they couldn't just answer a basic operating question on the unit.  Especially after I sent the invoice the first time.I've only blended protein shakes and a couple of fresh fruit smoothies with frozen strawberries.  The protein shakes did have frozen bananas.  I don't know if frozen bananas are consider very difficult for blenders, but I would get the blinking LED issue regularly even without blending bananas.Worse, the unit left a black stain on my counter.  I couldn't get it off, and I hope it will come off with time.  I ran the blender a few times on a kitchen towel to take a picture to show what I'm talking about.  It doesn't show on the counter itself very well in a picture since I have a patterned counter top, but it's very visible in person.  You can clearly see the marks the blender leaves behind on a towel.  The vents on the unit are under the unit and not on the sides. But I wouldn't expect a blender to stain the counter like this.Possibly I have a defective unit.  With support's inability to answer a very basic operational question, this blender is definitely going back.  I'd ordinarily say you get what you pay for... But with the lack of support, inability to blend properly, and stains my counter, the Nutribullet is overpriced.So if others have an issue where the LEDs blink repeatedly and the unit won't respond, then the unit is overheating or defective.  It took over a week and multiple emails just for Nutribullet to tell me what the blinking LEDs meant."
"I had a Ninja before this blender for around 6 years until it finally gave out, I bought this Blender of May 2023, it started messing up and not wanting to turn on around August, it got worse and worse. Now it doesn’t even turn on at all, for $180 I paid for this, it’s outrageous, even the $50 ones last longer than this, it’s a joke. Pay almost 4 times the price and get 20% life span."
This started off as a great blender both the pitcher and the smaller cups. But about 2 months ago I used the smaller cups with its blade and I started to smell something funny coming from the nutribullet after about 30 seconds of blending on the Extract setting. I turned it off because it smelled like metal rubbing against each other. I turned it on again to confirm it was that and then it didn’t smell anymore. I finished blending my smoothie and when I go to try my smoothie it had a weird metal oil taste to it. It’s hard to explain.The next day I try again. This time no smell comes out while on. When I try isn’t smoothie it has the same weird taste to it.I don’t use it for about a week. And at this time I only use the pitcher portion which seems to be working fine with no weird smells. Then I try again with the cup portions instead of the pitcher. The first day it was as if nothing was wrong with the blender. The smoothie tasted normal. The next day the same thing happened with the smell coming from the blender as it was on and the smoothie having a weird taste to it.I decide to try let cup blender portion to rest again for about 2 1/2 weeks this time before I try again. And the same thing keeps happening. I have been very disappointed with this product because it was so expensive to give out 6 months after buying it.I can’t take a picture because when my husband and I inspect the blades that attach to the cups they look fine and nothing looks broken or loose. The only think we notice is that it gets really hot. I don’t know why it keeps doing that. Waste of my money.
"I was expecting a bit more power from this blender, given the cost and the description. I still have difficulty with crushing and breaking up ice for smoothies in it, which is why I replaced my old blender, so that was a bit disappointing. Other than that it is an adequate blender."
"Would give five stars but quality is nothing special.  Cheap plastic parts that will probably fail sooner than later.  This isn’t an appliance you have for 5+ years.  Otherwise, it’s easy to use, cleans easy, and I love the smaller blender cups you can drink directly from.  If you are deciding between Nutribullet and Ninja, choose Nutribullet.  No comparison.  The Ninja sucks.  I hated that thing which was why I went with Nutribullet.Update (9/20)-I down graded to 3 stars because a few months after using the single serve cups the easy twist blade which attaches the cup to the base began leaking all over the place after every use.  I’m assuming a gasket was faulty.  I called Nutribullet because there is a 1 year warranty and while they agreed to send a replacement, 3 weeks later I’m just hearing it’s been shipped.  I use my blender twice a day as smoothies are my main source of meals so having to clean up a disgusting mess every time is a bit annoying.  Hoping this replacement blade doesn’t do the same thing.  Honestly, I’m kicking myself for going cheap and not getting a Vitamix which had similar features. That’s what I get for buying made in China junk I guess.  Vitamix is made in the USA and much better quality.  Lesson learned."
"The item/blender had black, greasy hand prints on the base of it: clear indications that it had been handled with greasy hands (most likely by a service person/remanufacturer); even though it was advertised/sold as ""Condition: NEW"".I wiped the stains off with a good cleaner (slightly damp with Simple Green) and will use the Nutribullet blender until it dies; but, will be very careful to ABSOLUTELY NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING ELSE FROM ""Amazon.com LLC"" (see what they did there?!?)!!!I thank God that Nutribullet makes such tough, reliable & affordable blenders."
The lids to the cups do not close.  The contents have dripped out multiple times on me.
"I purchased this to be able to make smoothies as my mom is a very healthy, picky eater. She loves her smoothies and having a blender at home saves money on Smoothie King. I decided on Nutribullet on 2/7/2020 and hoped it would last a long time. Over the last few months the blender has been losing power, not blending smoothies easily. Yesterday the blender got very hot and had a terrible smell. I tried using it one last time tonight just to make some homemade keto chocolate milk and the blender smelled horribly again, and there was black stuff floating in the chocolate milk INSIDE the 20 ounce blender cup. When I pulled it apart there was milk that had leaked out onto the blender and as i was cleaning it up i noticed that it smelled of motor oil. The black stuff in the chocolate milk was indeed motor oil as well. i had to dump it and it is now sitting on-top of my recycling bin. I had hoped this unit would last several years but apparently that won't be the case. I emailed nutribullet and their website says they have a 12 month warranty and I have filed a claim on this unit to see if they will replace it. If not, I will definitely be buying a different brand."
"Purchased to make protein drinks. Called NutriBullet customer service to warranty the blade (only 10 months old) Amazon receipt considered invalid, and NutriBullet won't warranty anything sold by Silo Market. So, even though you buy through Amazon, the vendor isn't necessarily authorized."
"I unboxed the item which description when I ordered said: ""Includes: (1) 1200 Watt Motor Base, (1) 64 oz (1.8L) Blender Pitcher with Lid and Vented Lid Cap, (1) Tamper, (1) 32 oz (900ml) Cup, (1) 24 oz (700ml) Handled Cup, (2) To-Go Lids, (1) Easy-Twist Extractor Blade, and Recipe Book""Missing: (1) 32 oz (900ml) Cup, (1) 24 oz (700ml) Handled Cup, (2) To-Go LidsContacted Nutribullet because no other number I could find to contact someone. Nutribullet indeed verified the item I ordered and item received was incorrrect."
I really enjoyed using this belnder.blender.. but folks the seller is awful.Being a prime member and paying extra for shipping it early it took them 3 Weeks to deliver the product and I was not allowed to cancel the order before it was shipped.Most annoying purchase of mine.
"Bought this to make spinach based smoothies. But this Blender kept leaving various pieces of spinach, and celery fibers in my drinks. Even after stopping the blending to push down pieces of food. I've had Nutribullet blenders before and this was not an issue. Surprising. I ended up donating this, hoping someone else can use it."
Works for blending liquids but it gets stuck a lot
"UPDATEI suggest you consider buying  Nija instead of this product. ThT is whT I ended up doing.Pros: The ability to mix and blend a large volume at once. Very Easy to clean. The cups that are with the blender are very nice, with nice flip tops.Cons: Takes quite a while to blend. Many times my frozen strawberries aren't fully cut up and blended...after an extended period of blending. Also, the mouth to pour out is too wide. When I try to pour my smoothie in the cups that came with the blender, it always spills because the pour area is too wide. Blender is also very loud. Good thing there are suction cups on the bottom.I actually like the quality of blend of the original Nutribullet blends better."
"This mixer is easy to use and quite powerful.  We use it to prepare a peanuts and bananas ""smoothy"" and all seemed well until we noticed small black flecks in the final drink.  Since the color is white, these are easy to spot, but someone mixing colored fruit would be much less likely to notice. However well we wash the lid and pitcher each time, these black flecks still show up when we mix.  We suspect it may be from the black rubber seals or even the black plastic parts.  We are now looking for an alternative mixer in the hope we may get rid of the problem that way."
"The blender itself has been great. The major issue I have with this is that both of the blending cup lids broke in the exact same spot. This particular blender has some proprietary threading that's actually on the inside of the cups. So replacing them has proven nearly impossible. All of the standard cups are threaded on the outside. I recommend looking at any other model with a standard thread set up. This will make replacing parts MUCH friendlier down the line. This was an expensive lesson. I've contacted Nutribullet and was told that they would replace them, but required a $6.00 shipping charge. For each one. While not expensive, this is beyond infuriating to me for something that is clearly a design flaw on their end AND happened within just a couple of months of owning this thing. On principal I don't want to have to pay MORE for something that I've already spent a fair chunk on. It has unfortunately also turned me off to Nutribullet. Definitely recommend looking at any other model blender, even within the Nutribullet family, based on the non-replaceable nature of these particular components. Lesson learned."
"My problem is when I followed to register my Nutribullet by following the registration card instructions I was not able to register it with Nutribullet.  When I contacted Nutribullet and after 30+ minutes trying to register the product I was finally told that I could not register it with them, I was tpold that I would have to go back to Amazon to register the product.  there is no way to do this.  I just hope that the Nutribullet outlasts the warranty."
"i blend celery and carrots every morning. i chop them in small pieces. my old blender which stopped working after several years had no problem blending chopped veggies. But this blender failed miserably. the only way i could get it to work was to add a lot of water, which defeats the purpose. returning it."
"The moto is dead, what do I do?"
The main reason I got this one was because it shows and says that it comes with the 24 oz cup with a handle. Then I open the box and neither of them have a handle. They are both really bulky to even hold. I could have save money and just bought the blender by itself.I'll edit once I use the blender.
So disappointed in this product.  I paid over $120 for this blender that stopped working in less than 3 years.  It replaced the Hamilton Beach blender that I had prior; which lasted 15 years.  I used the Bullet for primarily making protein shakes a couple times a week.  So hardly intense usage.  Then this week while making the shake it started to smell like burning rubber.  The connection where the container meets the base of the blender started to smoke and got hot.  I stopped it right away.  Nothing was blocking the blades and the shake was done.  I set it aside and tried to use it again this morning.  The motor sounded weird like it could barely run and then smelled like something was overheating.  I now feel it is too dangerous to use.  So I will need to buy a new blender.  Very disappointed that it had such a short life.  Taking the time to write this so readers can beware.
There's a slit at the top of the pitcher's handle that allows water to go into the handle upon washing. Will return.
"I've had new trouble it's before most people in my family have one, so I decided to get this because it comes with the NutriBullet small blender portion and then the actual blender portion. I feel like they're not as powerful as the original NutriBullet as well as the seal for the smaller ""smoothy"" blender part does not seel well at all and will leak. Otherwise it works pretty well depending on what you're looking for I would just go with an original NutriBullet and get a separate blender from a different brand. It could be worse but it could be better."
Open box no new no sealed missing  parts waste a time i got my refund
"I like several things about the style but it just does not work for me.  I have tried different settings, different order of adding ingredients, making sure there is very little in the container, but no:  pieces of nuts and pieces of vegetables left over.A waste of money and time, very disappointed.  I had bought a $20 hand blender which gave out after 2 years, and I will buy another.  Occasionally that blender would leave ONE piece of nut but the rest were ground up.  Not the case with this expensive blender.  It's essentially a mixer!!!!"
"I have had this blender for about 2 years, but have used it less than a couple dozen times. Will no longer turn on. Worked pretty well until now, but a product like this should last much longer."
"I've been meaning to write a review, but this is truly the worst blender I've ever owned. I had Nutribullet's smoothie maker for many years and was happy with it, then I've purchased this one so it is an upgrade?!1. This machine is the loudest blender, my ears ring after every use.2. IT DOES NOT BLEND - AT ALL.So what you get is a super loud crap machine, plus not blended food, plus above everything constant disappointment."
"The blender started making a strange sound when I used it, then I found a sharp piece of metal in my smoothie. Thank God nothing happened to me but it was really scary thinking about I had eaten some small piece of the blender."
Cups and such from a previous model do not match.One of the reasons I chose this brand .Could have bought another Brand!
"I have been using a Nutri Bullet NBR-12 for almost a decade and the same one still works.  After a lot of consideration I decided to upgrade to the larger blender model so I could make winter soups easier.  This product barely blends protein powder, nevermind any type of cooked vegetable.  I did not return this immediately thinking I was just not operating correctly, but after almost 5 months of trying to see if this has any purpose in my house, I can honestly say you are better off finding an old one used.  So disappointing."
"Purchased from the top suggested Amazon retailer. The blender stopped powering on without any warning within a year of purchase. Followed all of the steps to register the product and troubleshoot. Once Nutribullet realized the product was truly faulty they informed me that the purchase was not through an authorized retailer and Amazon purchases can be stolen goods or counterfeit. They will not honor the 1 year warranty. For a product of this price and expected quality a 1 year warranty is not comforting to start, let alone that they will do what it takes to not stand by their confirmed products.Loved the blender when it was working. Often used for smoothies and performed far better than my ninja for spinach leaves. Extremely unfortunate the quality and customer service is subpar. Purchase at your own risk…"
Don't waste your money. Blender has completely stopped working after just 6 months of light use. The blue light is flashing as soon as I plug it in - product support says it's overheating but this is clearly not true. It's also not as good for blending frozen fruit/veges as the original nutribullet was.
"This is the second one I had to order for a gift, due to a damaged box.  Unfortunately the next one came to me with another damaged box.  I refused to accept it from UPS.  Warning watch out for 3rd party distributed products, they do not use amazon boxes.  As far as the nutribullet itself I have had mine for a few years and love it."
"I make simple smoothies, nothing frozen just greens, yogurt, oats some powders. On low its quite quiet. Works well. Easy to clean and the travel mugs are mint. Bought from the warehouse and the additional blade was missing so that sucks, only downside so far."
Love my old Ninja so bought this one for my RV. The blender cup will not lock in place so you have to hold it down and even then wont work half the time. I think Ninja products are not what they used to be will never buy another Ninja product again
"I was so excited about this blender when I got it.  It worked great, the smaller cups were perfect for smoothies, but after a few months I started having trouble with the blender smoking when I used it.  I stopped using the smaller blender and started using the bigger pitcher part, but again, after a few months that part is smoking as well.  I hand wash most of the time with occasional dishwasher cycles here and there, and I use the blender pretty much every day, sometimes twice a day.  I don't know what went wrong but I have had it for a little less then a year and I think I already need a new one.  So disappointing."
"This blender is not great, it needs A LOT of help when blending frozen items and leaves a lot of black residue on our countertop after using. do not recommend"
Started smoking on its first run and didn’t blend properly.
This seller advertises as a Nutrabullet store on Amazon but they are not authorized by the manufacturer to sell their products therefor the warranty is not covered by Nutrabullet if the unit stops working like it did in my case. My unit stopped working after 6 months of use. I will be requesting a full refund due to fraudulent advertising from Amazon. Buyer beware.
"In less than a month, it no longer works! Waste of money and time!Glad I kept my Vitamix! I don’t recommend this item! Lasted from 9/25/24 to 10/20/24."
Blend ice cubes. Useful.
"I’ve had my nutribullet for a year now. First impressions, I love this thing!  I’m drinking my fruits and veggies every day and feeling healthier.But, after having it for a year, I’m realizing that the nutribullet just isn’t as well built as it should be. My blade assembly started showing brown stuff on it and releasing food grade lubricant into my smoothies, giving them an awful taste. When I emailed nutribullet, I was told that they do wear out and should be replaced every 6-8 months. So, that’s an additional $20 (plus shipping) I have to spend every 6-8 months to buy a new blade assembly. Next time, I’m just going to bite the bullet and buy vitamix."
very loud if you run to long it smells burn
I'm the only person to use this and I just noticed the blades came loose on the smaller set of blade for the large cup the damaged each other. I ordered on September 1 so I can't return it I'm very disappointed.
"This blender was awesome for the first 9 months, then started to fail. When we first purchased this blender April 2020, it was a life saver, I was starting a new diet recommended by my doctor and I was able to get in my daily nutrition by blending veggies and fruit. We continued to use this blender everyday for about 9 months then the large container stopped working. The base stopped recognizing the blender. It would start blending, two seconds later it would just shut off. It will no longer turn on with the large container. We are now using the small to go container to blend. It is slowly failing as well, it will sometimes turn off in the middle of a blend for no reason. It also doesn’t fully blend frozen fruits up. We didn’t want to spend the 400 bucks for a vitamix, but if you are replacing a hundred dollar blender every year eventually it will cost you the same amount of money. Just get the high end blender to begin with it will last way longer than a year."
"This blender is good at doing it’s job but is not easy to clean at all. I’ve looked everywhere on how to remove the bottom part which has the base and blades (all 1 piece) and am not finding instructions anywhere. All suggestions are to add warm water with dish soap and run blender. That somewhat takes care of the sides (I like to scrub anyway) but it doesn’t take care of the tight area between the base and the blender. Very frustrating trying to clean that small, tight space. Base needs to be removable!!"
"First of all I am not one to write negative reviews on any product.  I was really excited when I received the blender.  Before I even got it out of the box I started reading the manual.If I remember correctly it is suggested not to blend or chop nuts or crush ice . I thought with all that power that it definitely should. I think it was due to possibly damaging the blades .  If I remember reading it correctly.I have seen lower priced blenders with less power that claimed to do it all. So I returned it. To me this is nothing more than an over priced glorified smoothie maker.  Now I might be wrong.  Just my opinion.I did see the Nice accessory‘s.  And it seemed sturdy.  I needed something to do it all. And this sadly did not seem to suit my needs  Would I recommend it? If it fits your needs and your budget, yes. And Nutra bullet does have a solid reputation."
I bought this one year ago. It just broke on me today. I plug it in and it does not turn on. I only used it for smoothies. I would always have to put more liquid and use the stick it comes with to assist in moving things around because it couldn’t blend it on its own. I wouldn’t buy this again and I wouldn’t recommend you buying it either. Spend that little bit more and get yourself a better blender that actually does the job and will last longer than this one did. I recommend a vitamix.
Was used for smoothies. Had to return because for fried motor less than a year and half because of fried motor. Can't return second one because of the same thing because they say no return.
"PLEASE do not buy it for blending power or convenience... at least if you agree with the following:""You want to buy a blender to use for personal shakes and a regular open top blender""... because you will get mediocre quality for both of them!!!!🔹as a bullet blender, it only has 24-32 Oz tall glasses without any ofter-market options. I had an old bullet and loved the small cup I can use for small jobs and it is easy to clean.🔹as an open-top blender it just doesn't have the power. I had an Oster blender with the same wattage and it was doing a much better job in smoothies. Chunks of kale and carrots in the smoothie!I don't have an alternative for this combo that I can recommend, but there are some out there, and I would never recommend the combo nutribullet."
"As a blender, the blades are attached to the jar, so you can't remove the blades to clean them. As a nutribullet, the blades are too small and they don't work as well as the normal nutribullet, if you make a fruit shake you will have big chunks of fruit on your shake"
I was happy at first but 2 weeks later it started to expell this black zoot like powder from underneath the blender and it stopped working! Wont ever buy again i want my money back!
"Within a month the first lid broke, I used my second lid for a couple months, then it broke seems to be on the inside it won’t stay shut causing smoothly to spill all over my lap top. Then the cup blender now won’t blend , it turns on but won’t actually spin,  and the large blender always leaves huge pieces  of  non blended fruit. I’m so sad I’m going to have to get a new blender within 6 months of having this one."
Arrived in a terribly damaged box. Item warped. Wont repurchase.
"Well, it was fine while it lasted.  Recently stopped working - gets power, (lights are on), but won't turn on/spin.  Two years for a $100+ blender is disappointing..."
"It delivered about a week ago.Unfortunately, liquid can leak out. The lid is tightly closed so I think I'm using it correctly.I don’t know what to do. The machine still works fine but I have to clean the machine after using it."
"I bought this item on Nov 13, 2019. I don't use it every day, but at least 5 days a week. Making a smoothie a couple days ago, it started to produce a burning smell. Today, it started smoking and when I removed the bullet part, there were ball bearings everywhere. So now, not even a year old and it's broken! I would expect it to last a little longer, but I guess not. And I also agree with previous reviews that it's way too loud."
This blender worked good for 4 months until the extractor blades bearings decided to go out. Now when I blend a smoothie a Brown Rusty liquid seeps through the extractor blade and gets all over the top of the connector where the extractor blade connects to. I noticed that on the NutriBullet website they are out of stock of these extractor blade replacement parts. I will order one when they are back in stock. But if I have issues with the second extractor blade I will junk it and buy a Vitamix.
"Most of time I use  the NutriBullet cup and the easy-twist extractor blade. Now one ""to-go lid"" is bad, can't sealed, Both my husband and I try to fix, but the lid tongue deformed, please see the attached photo. Right now we only can use one cup, so I lost half of purpose to buy this product. Actually, I don't want to return the whole package, because just one part is fail. The problem is how to get this part (to-go lid) to be replaced."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Was so excited and immediately after I got the box it looked all beat up. But it’s ok. I knew I was not getting a brand new item. Just said that it was repackaged. Happens. After I turned it on it started making these weird rattling sounds when started and stopped. And then I tried single serve cup and the blade and the piece of metal underneath got so hot that the plastic nut in between started to melt immediately and spewing molten plastic all over the cup inside. Good thing I didn’t t try to make a smoothie because I’d never have noticed it. Returning it tomorrow. The sound was horrendous. Most likely will go with a little one that’s easy to wash. The blades are non removable so in time I see a lot of grimy old food getting stuck in hard to reach places and getting spoiled. I never owned a blender and not sure if it’s a common problem but I want something that will not make me sick and gross me out.Edit: got a new one at Walmart and it sounds just like the one I returned. Pout is they all sound like that. Molten plastic was because I didn’t have any liquids in a cup so make sure you have some liquid. Bottom line it was an ok purchase but I got a brand new one for way cheaper.
"Purchased about a year ago and have been using extensively to extract juice, make smoothies, etc. which apparently wears out the extractor blade so mine started leaking a brown oily substance on every use.Customer support replaced it under warranty and everything, and told me that ideally you should be replacing the extractor blade every 6 - 8 months as a preventive 'maintenance' measure. See that's what to me the biggest issue of all:1) How come do I have to SPEND money on it every 6 - 8 months as opposed to Nutribullet DESIGNING IT correctly ? :/2) It is unnecessarily WASTEFUL. Some companies act like resources on Earth are infinite. Like seriously.Blending power is ok and accessories are convenient but still.So I'm off the hook for 6 months or so because they replaced the blade I guess but no would not recommend (nor buy Nutribullet again).Oh well :/"
"After just over a year of moderate use, it stopped working. I can't say it's the motor, which is still strong. It may be something to do with the electronics. It now takes multiple tries to to work and the 'extract' setting, when I can get it to work, does not advance post the first stage. Yes, I did keep the switches that engage when the top is attached to the base clean - this isn't the problem."
"The box was really damaged, content was good!"
My review is ok packaging not product. Which I know is ridiculous but The box literally shows what the item is. This was a gift and my family memeber who it was for saw it. Kinda a bummer. Also some one could of took the box since they knew what was inside. I’m a little annoyed but other than that the item is great and fast delievery
"I’m not even sure how this can be used. The blades are not sharp, it’s clunky to decant from and difficult to clean. I wanted to use for smoothies, but will need to find something better."
"We purchased this in May 2020 and use is on average 3-4 times a month. In June 2021 (1 month after warranty expired) the unite began smoking if used for extended amounts of time (to fully blend a frozen smoothie, and then after smells when used.The container of the unit is great, mixes well, and the poker for the inside is really nice. Just wish the motor lasted longer than a year."
"By far the most frustrating Nutribullet product I have used. Have been using different versions of the smaller blender for the last decade and was never disappointed.  Decided to finally upgrade to this model and regret it everytime I try to use it for anything other than a smoothie. It takes 20-30 minutes to make nut butter while my old model did the job without any fuss in minutes. Even trying to do salad dressings or dry grinding  is a chore as it takes a lot of manual help to get to the solids like garlic cloves or veggies unless water is added to aid the process! That’s not how I expected this to function based on previous experience. If you want a smoothie maker, go with the personal blender models  - the larger jar is nothing but a nuisance without any value add. Why did you change your blade Nutribullet?!"
It is a good blender but has a problem fully pureeing ice.  There is always some 'un-blended' ice at the bottom (or chunks of frozen banana).
I have to say that I used the blender today to make hummus and was disappointed in the blender. The garbanzo beans took extremely long to blend. The plunger that came with the product was useless. Cleaning the blender after was time consuming and difficult. I had high hopes because Amazon recommended this blender. Wish I had not purchased! My 30 year old blender did a better job! Ugh
The blender was used a few times a week to make smoothies. It only lasted a year before it started smelling of smoke and not working. This is the second and last Nutribullet I will buy. And I won’t buy a Ninja because they are horrible too.
"Updating from Oct 2024 (purchased July 2023): This blender really isn’t good, or at least maybe I got a dud. Currently my blender only works 1/5 times and I have to finagle it around to get it to start. A weird smoky burning smell happens when it’s running as well. It also leaves odd black marks all over my (white!) countertops, and I can’t figure out if this is the rubber on the bottom or if literally something is coming out of it. It’s basically just a paper weight at this point. And all I use it for is making smoothies. It rarely even blends up all the fruit. Not a great use of my money even if it was a ‘good price.’ It’s a loss if you have to replace it every year. Ugh.Original: I don't know about this blender. I bought it during Prime Day because my old blender (a Black & Decker one I got in college and probably got on a Black Friday deal) had recently broken. There are so many blender options available that it is quite overwhelming to pick one especially with all the features they have, but since my old B&D was ""basic,"" I figured I didn't need like a Ninja-level blender for my purposes (I literally plan to only make things like smoothies or milkshakes with this). The only requirement I wanted was a blender with a glass jar. this is just what I am used to , but I also noticed that many blenders with plastic jars (including a ninja one I was considering) had reviews that stated plastic jars may crack. So, with that being part of my search criteria, I saw this Hamilton Beach one for an ok price and it had many positive reviews, so I decided to pick it up. With that said, when I received this blender I already missed my B&D one in ""look and feel."" While I think the glass jar is a nice size/shape, I don't like the quality of the lid. I thought having a pour spout would be nice, but it just feels so flimsy and cheap and when you use it it's like another messy thing to clean. I'm not sure what it adds on just pouring straight from the glass pitcher. Plus I find it cheap and plastic-y and it is difficult to pull off of the glass jar (I've literally damaged my nails trying to release it). In terms of function, I don't think this is all that powerful. I have probably used it about 5-7 times so far, and I'd say 40% of the time I've had to ""assist"" the blender to process my food because it will get stuck. I have literally only made smoothies with this (and that is all I really intend to use it for). I followed the directions, saying put in liquids first, followed by fruit. My blender literally only has milk, yogurt, and frozen fruit, and it is not able to effectively blend that consistently without me having to open it and push the fruit down with a spoon. The ""wave"" action doesn't seem to do much. It is also very loud. It think it is louder when it is probably working harder (like when it is blending and not pulling the fruit down). But it really sounds like a vacuum cleaner. So that is annoying because I didn't have to stop and assist the blender on my old B&D. Since I don't think a smoothie is all that complicated/difficult to blend, the fact that it can't do that consistently isn't very encouraging. So I am considering sending this back. If I can find a similarly priced blender to this, I will likely swap it for that."
"Compared to other blenders, the smoothie is thick and does not break up the vegetables as easily. I need to add more liquid, but I don't like it either because it is not the consistency I expected."
"I thought I had made a decent job of researching different blenders…boy oh boy was I wrong cause now I’m here not 100% content. Upon reading reviews, not a single one stated how difficult it would be to get the lid off! I even watched a YouTube video to understand the contraption and no, it does not pop off as easily as they make it seem. (Or I received a faulty one? Meh.) I’ve had to use spoons to help take the dang thing off! I now instead use a regular plastic container lid to just “sit” at the top to avoid any volcanic messes. Other than that wretched lid, the blender is good. I’ve blended frozen fruits and it does a magnificent job at not leaving big chunks.If you are Hulk, buy it. If you are not Hulk, get you a Hulk to help."
"Do not believe the hype, my friends, I implore you! I fell for the 10,000 five star reviews and purchased one of these today…Upon unboxing, I was really thrilled. It looks like a fairly high-quality product, has a nice weight to it, the food processing aspect is a nice plus, the main 40 ounce pitcher is made of a nice thick glass… the lid for that pitcher on the other hand, is a very flimsy piece of thin plastic, on par with those disposable plastic lids, you use to keep an open can of cat food fresh. Trust me, I’m not over exaggerating. When I first saw it, I thought it was a piece of, packing material to keep dust out, I went back into the box looking for the actual lid, only to come up empty-handed. The lid is a really important aspect to blending, it should be a durable, thick lid, with an opening large enough to put a  mixing stick into… This is a big fail. Not a dealbreaker, but a really unfortunate aspect to the blender.In my opinion, the true test of a blenders prowess and performance, is if you can actually make berry smoothies. Smoothies are supposed to be smooth… They’re not supposed to have chunks in them, they’re not supposed to have seeds in them… This is not a smoothie blender. It’s a regular old department store blender. It’s not a bad blender, but it is not a great blender either. I cannot stress this enough, because I’ve seen a lot of these five star reviews boast how great this thing is at making smoothies, there’s even a review that says somebody blended up Chia seeds in a smoothie… No, you didn’t, stop lying. What is it about these people who feel compelled to lie in favor of these giant corporations? Did they pay you? What’s going on here?Anyway, I had high hopes that I wasn’t going to need to shell out three or $400 for the Vitamix, and while I’m not going to give up just yet, this is unfortunately not the answer to my prayers. I will be returning this, and I also cannot really recommend this. I’m sure there are other blenders that do the same thing that this thing does with a better lid."
"The price is very good, and the machine is efficient. However, a couple of months in and now I smell burning plastic every time i use it. And the blades of the small processor ain't as sharp as u would hope"
"For me, this doesn't work well for grinding coffee or to puree. It's okay for chopping vegetables and making milkshakes, but fruit smoothies don't come out all that smooth. I went back to my old vita-mix which does a better job on both even in spite of dulling blades."
I had a ninja and its motor finally burned out but I loved it. They don't make that model anymore and I really didn't want to pay 100 bucks for a new one so knowing the brand name of this one I took a chance and wish I hadn't. It's loud yes but most are but it doesn't blend up frozen strawberries! I'm always left with little chunks of the center of them. It also has a hard time with icecubes. I cannot make my coffee frapps with this if it can't grind up icecubes. What really bothers me the most is trying to get the darn lid on and off! I have to use a towel and really fight to get it off and yes I'm opening the little clear part so it's not vapor-locked. When it does finally come off it pops of hard so I have to rally hold on to the glass part so it doesn't spill or I don't drop it. It's also hard to get on. I'm already sick of fighting with the darn thing and I haven't had it that long.  Next time I'm just spending the extra cash and getting what I really want. It's not worth saving a few bucks to get this frustrated and not be happy with it.
"Bought for smoothies using lots of fruits etc directly from the freezer. Took me forever to make one smoothie as I had to keep manually scraping and tapping down the food to try to get it to blend. I think if you are only blending softer products it could be fine, but if you use a lot of frozen stuff I'd get a Ninja instead (which I did!)."
it works but some important components are made of plastic. would be better with metal
"Not sure if I got sent a used one but when I was about to make a smoothie, the almond milk I had added before the fruit started to leak out the bottom.  And the pool kept getting bigger as I struggled to contain it.  I then discovered that where the bottom of the blender meets the base, it wasn't securely tightened -- was loose.  Was a big mess. Had to hand tighten and test it by filling the glass with water over the sink before it was tight enough to reuse without leaks.  So it made me wonder if I was sent someone elses return since you'd think it would be tight enough to use out of the box.  Once I got it going I was able to make my first smoothie with a mix of berries and almond milk, came out good.  I'll revisit and upgrade from three stars once I put it to good use.  Just a disappointing start.  On a bright note, I like the sturdy feel of the glass and yes, the lid does take some getting used to but isn't horrible with a little elbow grease.  At least that provides a leak free seal once you cover it right. 😂  Here's a tip on putting the lid on, make sure it goes over the glass lip with enough pressure, on all sides... just like in summer time when filling up water balloons at a faucet.  💦🎈🌞 You provide the pressure to secure it, otherwise you'll think it ""doesn't fit"" or ""goes flying"" like some report because they don't know how to properly secure it."
"I'm not particularly excited about this blender. The first thing I used it for was to make a milkshake with some ice cream and milk and it took forever to blend together. I actually bought it to mix whey powder for protein shakes for a bariatric diet and it takes so long to mix all the powder completely the shake is no longer really cold, despite adding some ice. It also froths a lot of air into it, which I don't particularly like.I guess I will have to start mixing the shakes in advance and putting them in the fridge for a while.One of the biggest drawbacks to this is how HEAVY the blender pitcher is. I guess it's been a while since I used a blender (or else I've turned into a weakling in my old age) because it is hard to pick up. It is also super obnoxious that the US measurements are on the ""wrong"" side of the pitcher. For me to see them I have to put the handle on the right, but I am left-handed. It would be better for everybody to have both metric and imperial measurements on both sides.I second all the other reviews complaining that the lid is hard to put on and take off. I struggled to seat the lid firmly the first time, and then I could hardly get it off again, so now I just lightly set it on top and hold it there and it works just as well.To add insult to injury, my mom told me, ""I didn't know you needed a blender. We have one we never use!"" GAH."
Very sturdy blender but does not blend effectively. This blend has only 2 blades and therefore it takes a while to get the creamy/puree consistency. I would not purchase this product again
"I thought I'd spend a little extra on a name brand blender after getting burned on other off branded kitchen appliances, but it turns out that despite this, even this Hamilton has poor design flaws and it blends mediocre at best.Functionality:As other lower star reviews have noted, the cap to this blender is supremely difficult to place and remove due to the ill fitted design. It requires a lot of force to push down to close and even more force to remove, which is really terrible experience if you need to add in more ingredients or extra ice cubes but worse when it comes to taking the blender apart for washing. I would NOT recommend this blender for anyone with hand strength issues like arthritis.There are two flaps on the cap, one is a spout ro pour out the mix and the other looks like a hole big enough to pass ice cubes. While the spout is okay, the flap for the ice cubes is thin and still difficult to close even though it's smaller and thinner. Simply poor design.The other important aspect of a blender is the power in which it can blend your ingredients. As a blender for smoothies, it sucks when using thicker ingredients like frozen bananas or harder textures like ice cubes and even diced tomatoes. It struggles to blend these things as it will end up spinning but none of the mixture is being blended unless you basically increase the liquid content to nearly 75% liquid. My old blender handled much better than this blender.I noticed this blender works well if it's mixing only liquid with powder, like a protein shake. But for everything else, it plain sucks.I do not recommend and am going to give away this blender because it isn't practical for my uses."
It has a lot of buyers but it has no power. I was expecting more. I do not recommend it.
"I pulled the trigger because I needed something fast. However I wish I would have researched more. The top doesn’t fit right, it takes way too much effort and wedging to make it secure. It never does for me truthfully, so I just leave it placed on top when operating it. It blends subpar, I still get pieces of spinach stems in my smoothie which was never the case with my other blenders. It’s ok."
The blender works fine but the lid arrived dented and does not fit the blender without a hand holding it on top.
The lid does not seem to fit…am I doing something wrong?
The only thing that i do not like are the lids...it does not close easily...i fight with the lids and make me feel frustrated😤
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I read good reviews but i didnt find it that good. It takes time. Like i have to wait for minutes to get a smoothie. Its just a good blender for smoothies if you can wait for 8-10 minutes to get all the ice and frozen fruits crushed. I like my smoothies with yoghurt or minimum milk and it doesnt work good like that. I have to add ALOT of liquid to make it work.
"Yes, the blender runs & blends, HOWEVER, the cover just does not fit!  & if you manage to get it on & seemingly secure, it comes off while pouring. Blended a protein/fruit smoothie; a significant amount of the muxture ended up on the floor, requiring a major cleanup (because of my back issue, I can’t stand straight, so have to pour while bent over the floor - counter is too high).I chose this blender, 1st because it’s Hamilton Beach, after all, but also because the cover has a spout which I’d expected would make things easier… not so much! Guess I should have returned it after its initial washing, but figured the cover wouldn’t be an issue."
The manual and description would have you believe this is an ideal Blender for Ice Crushing well… nope and 2nd the description says the Blender pulls things down to the 2 small blades via some type of air circulation funneling all you put in right into the blades well… NOT! I had to get out the trusty old rubber spatula to feed everything down into the blades. I tried the Ice and then I tried Veggies and both times I had to push down on the veggies and Ice to get the blender to do its job! Next time I’ll just stick to the Ninja Blender with 2 blades and some have 3 levels of blades. Fruit smoothie is next and see if there’s anything special about this inexpensive Blender!??
The blender did a great job blending. The lid was the problem. It doesn’t fit properly/stay on. I returned it only because of the lid.
"the glass blender is good, the cover will not go on though I looked at directions...disapointed but kept it because I used it"
I used this item three times and now it is leaking. Would like a replacement or refund. Thank you.
Does the job but very noisy!!! Don’t run it when your husband and baby are sleeping 😱😱😱😱🤦🏻‍♀️‼️
"I never really did like this blender because it was so heavy. But it was my first large blender so I learned... Anyway, it did stop working after a year of use and possibly due to what I was using it for. I was making an Indian bread batter that consists of rice. So I probably didn't add enough water and the hardness of the rice combined with that probably overloaded it. It also seemed to not blend the rice well enough. So I've moved on to a higher tech blender with blend sense and so far, using for the same recipe, it hasn't broken."
"I figured if I spent a little more money, I would get a blender that actually chops up ice. It doesn't. I have bought so many blenders over the years, and I'm just never happy with them when you add something frozen to the blender. I'm going to have to go even more expensive I guess."
"I have an OLD Hamilton Beach bleach blender -- model 600-1 (plastic jar, 330W, 5/7 speeds working) mfg waaaay back when. It had developed a noise that I was afraid signaled possible failure coming.My primary use for  blender Is a smoothie I make every morning. This new one boasted glass jar & more power. Gotta be better, right? Well, no so fast. I tried it twice, before returning to Amazon,  both times it left the end result too""gritty"" to ba called a smoothie.It appears to me it doesn't spin up to sufficient RPM, plus coupled with a cutter blade design that has different blade angle, leaves it coming up short.  I'll also mention it's also noisy.'Bought a new cutter assy and gasket for Old Faithful and movin' on."
Went through two Ninja’s in a year and they kept breaking. Went for a cheaper model with a glass pitcher. The small blade at the bottom doesn’t do as good of a job with ice as the Ninja but for smoothies it works if let it mix long enough.Would recommend if you’re on a budget.
"The Blades Seem Sturdy Enough and the Power is Fine, but the motor housing does not inspire confidence and the lid does not seat properly nor easily on the glass vessel We ordered this model because we wanted the sturdy glass vessel instead of plastic and we are glad that we did seeing the quality of the plastic parts.  We had an $18.00 blender for over 30 years of good service, I do not expect the same from this product. I would recommend that if you are looking for a product with a long service life shop for an upper tier product."
The lid is very hard to get on and off and the hole on the lid for adding items to is too small.
"For 30 bucks you are awarded the opportunity to develop a skillset to be envied by your less patient and ill-equipped friends as you advance through the levels of fruit smoothie making challenges set forth you each day...was that enough almond milk?...too much frozen berry? ...should I add the banana first, last, in the middle?! ...All in the hopes of creating that one smoothie you never had to stop the blades for from start to finish...But you’re up for it...you knew what you were getting into...you welcomed the challenge the first time you guffawed at those higher priced machines designed to lay waste anything less than a 9 on the Mohs scale. This machine WILL strip you to your core. Oh what will be revealed as you, day in and day out, feather in just the right amount of spinach while gauging the subtle changes in greenish hues whirling about, in hopes of avoiding that dry, sucking sound of the blades spinning against nothing but an air pocket at the bottom of your chilled gruel? In the less weathered, softer hands of some who might be afforded a life of protection from this harsh world, use of this machine may result in emotional pain, tears, and quite possibly a weakening of the soul...that is not you however...you will gain not only the digestive fortitude you seek and life lengthening superpower of the macronutrient overload you cram in with every tablespoon of every exotic seed known to man, but you will also gain a seemingly inhuman sort of imperviousness to all the everyday trials that once seemed to paralyze you with unbelief at how this could happen to someone like you. You will rise above and you will walk just a little higher than those around you...but only as a beacon of patience and hope to the untested. Or you can spend hundreds for the ease of a truly smooth operation every morning and continue going about each day sniveling and decrying the absurdity of your petty inconveniences....choice is always yours."
"TIPthis and most blazers like my old otter allowed me to use canning jars.that's nice option for a smaller amount smoothie both blending and storingin the frig.overall, nice enuf... heavy large which is good and bad.wish it had more than two speeds and wish it had an even faster speeddoes the job but not overly impressed"
Functions well.  However I learned the hard way that you have to be careful when removing the canister from the base after you use it.  I twisted to remove it and the bottom of the canister came lose and everything that I processed fell out of the canister.  I have since learned there is a slot in the base that aides in removing the canister.
"I would give this item 5 stars if the  top fit. I can’t afford to send it back because I need to use it everyday. So I just hold the too down with my hands. Outside of thst I love the product. “Shame on you for using such cheap material for a glass blender.” I would not recommend this item to any of my friends because of the top, but if you change the top …then you will have an excellent product!"
"Ok blender, but the lid doesnt fit soni have to stand there and hold it so the contents wont spray out whilst mixing.  If making smoothies with protein powder, dont put the powder in first or it wont mix and gets all gooped up on the blade carriage."
"This blender was very inexpensive, and it was as cheaply made as I would expect. The lid is this flimsy plastic that doesn't fit on the blender unless you jam it on, and then you have to spill the contents of the blender in order to get the thing off. I was fine keeping it at first because it was inexpensive, and I could deal with it, but then it started leaking from the bottom whenever I put liquid in it. This was after just a few months of use. Fortunately, a friend was giving away their new blender (exact same model) so we're replacing our malfunctioning one with theirs. Sure wish I could get my money back, though."
"I opted for this blender instead of a smoothie blender because of quality. However unfortunately I've had to learn that this is not the product for you if you are going to try to blend small amounts e.g. two servings of avocado with other ingredients to make a dip, small amounts of oats etc.Definitely meant to be used with more product. Adding liquid does not seem to help much, neither does shaking it while blending or using a different setting. I'm sure it's great for larger amounts but for daily use I'll always use a smaller smoothie blender instead."
"I haven’t bought a large blender in many years.  I’ve always liked Hamilton Beach products so when I saw this blender I thought it would be a good deal.  The lid has a pouring spout, but it doesn’t fit flush to the glass pitcher so pouring liquid through the spout is impossibleI tried several times to try adjusting the lid on the pitcher … to no avail.  Luckily I don’t ever start a blender and walk away so holding the lid in place while blending is something I’m used to.  If you don’t hold the lid on, the contents will erupt all over the counter.I’m not happy with this blender, but years ago I bought a blender from Amazon and was unable to replace the pitcher, when it accidentally broke, because it was no longer available since the blender was discontinued (within 2 weeks of purchase).  They sent me other pitchers, which would not fit the blender."
"The Hamilton Beach Power Elite Blender is an affordable but very basic blender.Materials and build quality - I give it an average rating because, while it does the job of blending, the build quality and materials is not good and is only adequate to doing the job.  The glass jar has a yellowish tint to it like the glass has impurities in it.  The plastics are hard and thin.  The lid is very difficult to remove and I always have to make sure I have a good hold on the jar before trying to remove the lid.  The buttons have a hard clicky feel.  The rubber feet are perhaps the most annoying aspect of the build quality.  The rubber feet on my unit leaves black marks on my quartz countertop that are difficult to wipe off without some kind of cleaning chemical (dish soap won't remove the marks).  When the motor runs, the base unit (underneath) gives off a foul dried fish smell, and no I have never put fish in the blender.  I can only guess the smell is coming from the plastics or motor heating up.  If you have any concerns about carcinogens in plastics, I would recommend to avoid this blender.  The rubber feet marks and the difficult to remove lid are the main reasons, this blender isn't getting 5 stars.The good - I purchased this blender to make smoothies, and for that it works well.  No complaints there.Yes, it does need adequate liquids to blend and move the solids.Overall this is an ok blender when on sale, but I would recommend to spend a bit more to get a better quality blender.  If price is absolute then this blender would suffice for basic functions.  This unit is definitely one of those you get what you pay for."
"Nice blender. Replaced my old one that I’ve had for over 10 years because I wanted something new and sturdy for making protein shakes. This one is good except for the lid. It doesn’t seem to fit the glass and I struggle every time. Thus, I’ve spilled shakes, etc. trying to pour them out."
"Horrible, even with Prime pricing.  I have used this several times now and I am NOT impressed! Does NOT grind up ice in a smoothie and even has a difficult time with apples! The bottom is very light weight plastic, as well as the top. The pitcher, however, is glass and is ""squatty"" so it will fit under the counter. The cog on the base is HARD plastic as well as the mechanism that screws on to hold the blades in place, like the kind of plastic that cracks easily. Other blenders I've had used a hard rubber material, so I'm not sure how this one will hold up. The cog on the bottom of the pitcher IS made of hard rubber. If you are blending just liquids it would be fine, but anything other than that- forget it.  Margaritas??? NO WAY could this blender even come close to making a blended one!  Would I purchase it again? More than likely, NO. As far as I'm concerned, this was a waste of money!"
The blades are so small that the only area that moves is dead center. If anything but liquid doesn’t work well at all
"This blender is good at mixing... but when it comes to smoothies, it's anything but good.My smoothies consist of a powder, fresh bananas, frozen strawberries, and milk. That's it, and the frozen strawberries are barely touched by the blades, even after running the smoothie button for a minute straight.There's a crevice at the base where the blades are that god forbid if you put powder in first, all your powder ends up caked in there and goes completely to waste and you have to use a butter knife to clean it out afterwards.Also, the lid is very hard to get on and get off. You could consider that a good thing but there's no flexibility to the lid at all to get it off.Reading previous reviews saying ""cut things smaller, this that""... kind of defeats the purpose of a blender. Sure, don't over stuff it. But if it can barely touch 10-12 pieces of already sliced frozen strawberries, this is definitely not a blender for you.I'm more annoyed at the crevice at the bottom. Poor design if you have to strategize how to put stuff IN the blender to get the most out of it."
"I bought this blender and it arrived June 11th. I use it around 6 times a week, every week, for strictly smoothies for after my workout. It lasted approximately 5 months and 10 days. The motor burnt up is why I threw it in the garbage today. I do not recommend this blender. Pass it up and find a better one that has more power. Hopefully the company sees this and returns my money."
The glass is well made. Thick and study. All plastic compartments are absolute garbage though.The lid is very thin and doesn't press into the top well. The hole other users talk about are so small that it renders it virtually unusable.The plastic base that holds the blades has broken. I only ever make smoothies in this thing and only a smoothie for one. Sure I use frozen fruit but it says it is for smoothies. I'm assuming most people use frozen fruit for consistency.It doesn't even chop of the fruit well. You have to keep stopping the machine and stirring it up or pushing the fruit to the blades otherwise it just kinda of sits on the top and on the sides away from the blades. All in all a huge disappointment.2 stars for the quality of the glass and the easy assembly/disassembly for cleaning
"This is not for someone making regular smoothies. The motor burned up in essentially 3-ish months. If you want to make blended items frequently or anything where you are blending anything harder than ice cream (e.g., ice) do not buy this blender.Their customer service process is also somewhat ridiculous. They don't collect enough information in their initial contact form so that then you have to engage in a time consuming back-and-forth.If you want to make regular smoothies, just pay the money to buy a decent blender such as a Ninja (definitely a stronger motor and better blades) or I was replacing a Kenmore blender we had had for years."
I like the blender itself but we are having an issue with the lid being very sticky and difficult to put on and take off.It makes using the blender not enjoyable at all. I am scared to spill the content inside the blender and burn myself when it's hot.I thought this issue was because the blender was new at first but it's been some time now and we're stil having the same issue.I contacted Hamilton for support and they just acknowledged the issue and gave us some suggestions to help take the lid off. I was hoping they could send us a better lid.
"Purchased 2 to replace the ""same"" model we've been using for a few years to make recycled paper pulp. One blender overheated and started smoking right away and never turned back on.  The other lasted probably 20 cycles.  Lots of water in the water to paper ratio, so it shouldn't be ""too much"" on the motor--no more than a bunch of ice or frozen fruit for a ""smoothie""."
strong blender but the top does not stay on tight so when you pour it falls off
"Top is very hard to put on, a kid could not do it.Unit works , ok."
"Had this blender for 5 months now- it started off kind of weak, but has gotten worse. We use it for smoothies. It takes forever to grind ice and frozen berries. It’s super loud, but most blenders are. Also, the lid is incredibly difficult to remove. That being said- it does seal well and you can confidently walk away from the blender while it’s running."
"** UPDATE ** Tried to go through Hamilton Beach customer support, and their rep ""Kenneth"" was nothing but rude. This company will not process a supposed warranty unless you pay a 50% fee, even if it arrives defective. They do not support their products and their customer service is absolutely awful. Save your money and buy a Ninja or literally anything else.Truthfully I'm trying to figure out how this blender is so well reviewed. I had a Ninja blender for almost a decade until it finally died, but decided for my usage I didn't really need another $100-200 blender anymore. So I researched and found this one with good reviews, nice and compact and inexpensive, seemingly perfect for my needs. I just need it to blend the occasional smoothie, nothing fancy.Problem is, IT DOESN'T BLEND. It won't crush ice, it won't blend fruit, it won't mix ice cream or yogurt. I threw a handful of frozen strawberries with some frozen yogurt in, and it just swirls them around endlessly. I spent 10 minutes stopping and starting it, taking the lid off, stirring, removing strawberries. Ended up with some thin pink liquid in the bottom of the blender and a bunch of still-whole strawberries.Ice does the same thing. The ice cubes just swirl around, maybe getting chipped here or there, but have to be removed before it will blend any liquid. They never actually get crushed or blended whatsoever. I've tried 4 different smoothie recipes, and this blender simply does not work.I don't want to have to spend on another high priced blender, but trying to save on this budget blender did not pan out. Now I'm stuck with it because I'm past the return date, so that was a waste of $30. Just put that towards a better one, or at least a blender that actually blends."
"Let me start off by saying that I will never buy anything from Hamilton Beach anymore!!!!  Why?  Because they offer no instructions manual in their products anymore.  I contacted them in reference to this and they told me that they only offer downloadable instructions that you could print off.  I told them that I was disabled and I don't have the means to do that.  They sent me to someone else within the company and I explained my circumstances and I said not all people have highly efficient printers who can print off 39 plus pages of instructions and I asked for a booklet.  I didn't even get a response from these folks who were supposed to be at a higher level than the people I was speaking with the first time.  I got nothing.  I do have an old printer that will print about 2 pages before it jams but no way could this printer I have print 39 pages off.  It is not that modern of a printer and I live on Social Security Disability making only 19k a year so I don't have the money to invest in modern technology of the day when I barely have enough money to buy food.  I bought a blender so I could mix up protein drinks to live off of.  Do I recommend anything from Hamilton Beach, absolutely not 🚫.  I can't lie and say that the blender doesn't work because it does.  After I spilled everything all over my kitchen because I had no instructions on how to work it, I finally figured it out.  It works okay.  I did try to crush some ice and it didn't crush all of it and again I don't know if was my error or the blender because I have no instructions.  All I can say is that it is an okay blender and I wish I had some instructions so I could follow some troubleshooting steps.  If you got the high technology in your house and can do these things, then it might be worth it to buy a Hamilton Beach product but not for me anymore, 😠"
Bought this as my first blender ever bought wanted to go cheap because I never had one it works to make milkshakes trying to do smoothies it's a little bit of a struggle it don't really have sharp blades in it which could be a plus for some people but to me it's dull and it just kind of chops at them if I get another blender it will probably be a different one not saying this is a bad blender but I'm going to make it work for a while.
"Takes about 20 minutes to blend a single smoothie if you aren't constantly stopping to stir it. Produces a wind force out of the back bottom of the machine that will blow any lightweight items in the vicinity completely off of the counter and on to the floor.  Loud enough that no one in the house can hear the television while in use and sufficiently jarring that I can't make a smoothie in the morning until I have completely woken up.  That being said, it will (eventually) get the job done."
Very hard for an older person to close the lid
"This is not a ""bad"" blender for $40, but unfortunately, I am going to send it back because of a few reasons1. The lid is really hard to put on - and if not on properly, when you pour your smoothie - bad things happen.2. It takes a long time to blend things.  I like to make fruit smoothies with milk and it will take a few minutes for all of the fruit to get blended it - almost as if we need a faster speed to get the fruit pulled down to the bottom so it can be blended.I guess you do get what you pay for :)"
"This thing is LOUD and it takes forever to mix our smoothie ingredients. All the top ingredients just sit there. We have to constantly stop it and push them down and shake the pitcher and repeat repeat repeat. And even after running it for several minutes, our smoothie just isn't as smooth as we would like.  It is easy to clean, as any blender is. You just put dish soap and water in the pitcher and blend it up for a minute. Then rinse."
"I figured I’d get a slightly higher priced blender than I normally would since I had a gift card: This works okay- I have to add water to my frozen fruit, protein powder, & oatmilk combo in order to get it to blend. My other blender did a better job (standard Black & Decker $27 blender). It finally had died. I should have probably just stuck with another one of those."
It nice wish it was more powerful
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                First it arrived 2 days late, but I chuck that up to the global internet failure last week.  So I received it today and was excited to try it out.  I read all the reviews and alot of people stated how hard it was to get the top off.  Well that won't be the case for me...my top does not fit tight at all.  As soon as you push it down, you can see it begin to rise on its own.  The little opening at the top to put in items while you are blending doesn't close all the way.  But the most worrisome issue is the blender part makes a weird noise once you stop it...like a whirling noise.  This doesn't happen when I place the food chopper on the base.  I really wanted to love this.  My old blender is on its way out...good thing I haven't tossed it yet because I need to return this one.  I'm so disappointed.  I guess my search continues.UPDATE: I contacted the manufacturer, no response."
"The blender would be okay except the lid doesn't fit ,if you take your hand off it makes a mess. I emailed the seller and no response. I suggest going with a better blender."
This blender is fine but there's nothing exceptional about it. It works. It's a little loud and not as fast as my old ninja but it gets the job done for my smoothies.
"If you’re like me, you came here because you wanted a ninja but didn’t want to spend $80-$150 on one. I’m here to tell you to spend that money!!! The sole reason I wanted a blender was to make smoothies. And guess what this blender doesn’t do well? It doesn’t blend frozen items! I literally had to let my blender defrost in the fridge and try blending the next day! The next thing I don’t like about this blender is that the top has to really be pushed into it (not going to lie I struggled for a bit there at first) and then it’s a little difficult to take it off. My parents have a ninja so one thing I like about them is that the blade is usually detachable and that makes cleaning super easy as well as more safe. So yeah not a happy camper here and I will be saving up for a Ninja."
"The blender is fine.  the lid is impossible.  it needs to be pushed on with all of your might, and then it needs to be pried off with what's left of your strength.  has a pour spout which sits back an inch from the edge, so you cannot empty the contents of the blender.  just a poor design..."
Smaller than expected especially the blades. Was very hard to make a smooth smoothy and I believe its because the blades are so tiny and low. This blender would be good to make salsa or something chunky. The lid also does not close. Maybe mine was defective. But the lid doesnt seal so you have to hold the whole time with pressure downward so it doesnt spill out everywhere. The blender was very easy to clean and take apart.
I bought it to puree foods and crush ice in drinks because my mother requires pureed food temporarily. I continually had to push the berries down into the mixture (they were cut in very small pieces) and the ice just chucked. Eventually I was able to get the berries to mash but it's more work than I had hoped for.
"For the price, I’m happy, but it’s not a great blender and the lip of the glass makes it tough to pour neatly. But it’ll make a smoothie you might just have to stir it up manually once or twice."
"most foods are not crushed, you need to cut into very small pieces and spend a lot of time constantly mixing and grinding several times"
"Messy on a good day. The lid will not stay in place, it pops out of the glass blender unless it is actively being pushed inside. Today I was making homemade egg bites, and mixed eggs, milk, and cream cheese for a smooth mixture.  As soon as I remove direct pressure on the lid, it pops out and splatters the contents down the side of the glass and on the counter.  I gave up trying to use the plastic pour spout on the lid as I couldn’t hold the lid in place and pour.  When I took the lid off and poured from the glass pitcher, it dripped leaving a streak of egg across the muffin tin and counter.  The only way to pour without making a mess was to wrap the glass with a dish towel while I poured.The first time I used it, I had securely hand tightened the bottom plastic piece to the glass pitcher, and when I removed it from the pitcher it twisted apart enough to pour out everywhere.  If you get one of these, be sure to tighten it really hard. There isn’t a gasket to help hold a seal or add some friction to reduce the hard plastic and smooth glass from slipping loose.I was really looking forward to using this blender, but I wish I had spent a little more and gotten a little better quality."
"Bought this ""used like new' and it arrived used like very used. Uh....no. The blender might be fine, but the sell was misleading."
"I had a Nutribullet for years, and while I liked it for everything except crushing ice, I really hated having to flip everything upside down to blend. After yet another leak, this time enough to get into the mechanism, I gave up on it and found this blender to replace it.It's ... fine. You have to put everything into it in the right order or everything gets stuck and it doesn't blend without repeated stirring. I like to add fresh spinach to my smoothies and frequently there are still pretty sizable pieces of it left no matter how long I blend for. Oh well! For the price, it's fine."
The blades are basically worthless. Making smoothies takes about half an hour with how poorly the blades blend frozen fruit. The same can be said of something as simple as blending Oreos - the blender can’t manage any type of food of any amount. It leaves an “electric” aftertaste. The black feet on the blender also left stains on my white countertops. I’d say this blender is most suited for blending water.
"There nothing wrong with the blender; however, the lid doesn't fit properly and won't clamp down on the blender."
"The first  (and only) time I used this was to grind up veggies for Gazpacho soup. It was a miserable experience: if you put ANYTHING in here that has any bulk (in other words, tomatoes, cucumbers, or any SOLID vegetable), the blades (which are FAR TOO SHORT) will not reach up and pull the veggies in. This wouldn't even have been an issue with a blender 30 years ago, so clearly, manufacturers are doing a worse job of designing blenders than they used to.If I CAN return this, I WILL return it. Don't read past this and ignore it: read the other 3 star (and lower) reviews and take it VERY seriously. I have no brief with ANY manufacturer if their product works as advertised, although, in the description, it clearly leans toward liquid drinks and not veggies IN THE LEAST.Caveat Emptor (aka ""Let The Buyer Beware"")."
It works great but somehow my lid does not fit right any more.  Not sure why!
"The blender that I’ve had for like 20 years (Oster) I just broke (dropped the glass on the ground, and it shattered) It was upsetting, but I figured it was old anyway and time for a new one .  I thought any new one would have to be an improvement.  Not this one.  The top is a mess! The 1 opening where you’re supposed to add liquids, doesn’t even close and when you use the spout to pour, it leaks.  Also VERY loud. I really don’t use the blender a lot- but even for the times I do, using that would annoy me every time.  Ya get what ya pay for.  I’ll return it and spend a little more for a decent one."
"I bought this as I don't like multiple 1-function equipment and thought this would be a good solve to have both a blender and food processor. Unfortunately, the food processor no longer functions properly after 2 uses, and I've tried everything to make sure it's all together properly. Regardless of using the blade or the shredder attachment, it's almost like nothing fits together anymore - the motor is on but nothing spins and all I get is this loud sound of plastic smacking against each other. So now I've purchased a stand alone food processor which I was trying to avoid in purchasing this :("
It’s loud and the blades don’t cut very well. Daly designed blades.
To takes some getting used to but it works pretty good after you get used to it.
"The old adage, that ""you get what you pay for"" is pretty well confirmed with this blender.  It works, but that's about the best I can say for it.  I also like the sturdy glass body.The low price was the primary reason I bought it.  But I'm a hard-core green-smoothie guy, and I use my blender several times per week.  So after trying this one out for a few months, I think I'm ready to buy something a little better.To begin with, it doesn't blend very well.  I'm not sure if there is a design problem, or if the blades are just sort of dull.  But I have to let it run for a couple minutes to get my spinach and kale blended to a smooth consistency.  It's also loud.  Like, louder than an ordinary blender.  And when you have to let it run extra long to get things blended, that's doubly unpleasant.The lid is awful.  It is extremely difficult to put on and take off.  I'm a 45 yr old man with hard-working strong hands, and I have trouble every time I try to remove the lid.  I have to press so hard with my thumbs that it hurts a little bit.  And they added a couple of openings in the lid that are probably intended for some useful purpose, but they just allow slight leakage.The motor is strong, and works well.  Only 2 speeds, but really, that's all I would ever need.I'd say if you're looking for an inexpensive blender for occasional use (margaritas and milkshakes), and you don't mind wrestling with a stubborn lid, then this blender is probably just fine for you.  And the price is right.  But if you plan on using your blender regularly, and ease of use is important to you, I'd suggest looking for a nicer one."
"We all can agree they do not  make blenders the way they used to, I bought this and had to get a replacement 2.5 weeks later because the motor went kaput.Would not turn on- if you want a good smoothie blender it works for sure but the motor needs some work."
"I had high hopes for this blender, but while it may work for certain uses, it will not work for mine:Mostly I make veggie-fruit smoothies for breakfast in my Oster 4093 blender, and it gets the job done perfectly well, making very smooth, 100% blended drinks. Since my husband gets up very early in the morning, he ""forgets"" or is too much in a hurry to make a smoothie for himself at that time. However, he said he would do it in the office, if he had a blender. In comes the Hamilton Beach, which, so I thought, looked great to me, as they claim that it is powerful, makes smoothies, crunches ice, etc.... and has an attractive price tag, too.I got the blender today, and tested it before giving it to my husband. What I usually put in is this: 1 peeled orange, diced; 1 peeled lemon, diced; a handful of spinach, a handful of kale, a handful of chopped arugula, a handful of chopped fresh mint. Add to that, one ts of Spirulina, 1 Tbsp of flax seeds; top it off with 6-8 small, cooked red beets. Fill in some real-fruit cranberry or other red juice, then pulse it first, and once all is turning, up it to full speed. This all works great in my Oster, but after running the Hamilton, all I got was a runny soup, with chunks of leaves floating around in it. Undrinkable!So, I want to believe that one can maybe make a blended soup with cooked, really soft veggies, or just blend banana with liquid... but it cannot handle raw spinach and kale. The thing that is nice and useful about the blender is a very solid and tight closing lid, also that the main jar is made of glass (the little chopper jar is plastic!). Another ""down"" thing is that the spout on the glass jar does a very lousy job at pouring. It just makes the liquid splatter all over the rim. I had to finish the job of transferring it into the Oster over the sink, and pour full throttle, in order to empty the glass jar out without making a mess. Slow pouring without spilling is impossible. It seems to sit sturdy while working, which is a good thing, but it is noisy like a 747 flying over your house! Well, I would not mind the noise, IF the result was worth it.I packed it up and will ship it back for a refund tomorrow morning.I already put an order in for another ""Osterizer"". After over 20 years of using them, I feel safe to say that they are the solid, efficient work horse in the world of blenders!"
"i bought it to make smoothies in the morning.  its easy to use and easy to clean in the dishwasher.  it does NOT have 12 speeds though.3 ""speeds"" and 2 for extra powerful blending.so it suits my purposes for mixing smoothies, but i dont know how they can claim it has 12 speeds.so make sure you only need it to mix blended drinks etc."
Just ok didn’t blended salsa thin enough
"The blender is cheap and works like a cheap blender. Like numerous other people reviewing here and elsewhere I have a lid that does not fit correctly and so need to hold it down physically at all times when ""blending."" Also like other people here I have found that there is no real strength to the blades and it blends pretty poorly.Pretty disappointed that a well-known company like HB has become like every other manufacturer in terms of performing absolutely no quality control on the things they sell."
The blender itself works fine for the price range. The size is a bit smaller than expected but fits about 1.5-2 glasses of a smoothie. The biggest issue is the lid. It fits TIGHT…..too tight. We can’t get it to come off every time we use it. Between the fit and suction it is almost impossible. My husband is the only one who can take it off. Wish it had a little more “give” to it. I wouldn’t repurchase this blender because of it.
"Worked great for smoothies and blended drinks but would not recommend making salsa with it, especially if you are going to use it to make a smooth salsa. Had a hard time blending soaked dry chile ancho. Even with a good amount of water, it was struggling to blend."
"The lid is ridiculous.  You have to fight to get it on, then fight to get it off.  Kind of time consuming and annoying.  But the blender works well."
"Everything on the blender is what I wanted to make smoothies, and it is, indeed, easy to clean.  However, the lid is a wrestling match to put on and take off.  I have arthritis in my hands, and I'm afraid this is just not going to work."
I was making Dole Whips for grandkids and it really had a hard time blending the frozen pineapple. I also made milkshakes and that was more feasible. It’s a basic small blender.
"I bought a Hamilton Beach because I wanted to get a good ""brand name"" blender. I use mine daily and Ive gone through a few of those bullet blenders in the past few years.  I have to say it does seem like a good blender. The motor seems to be holding up well. The blender container is very heavy glass that feels sturdy and like it wont break unless it fell extremely hard. Now about the bad part.  The actual lid was extremely tight and made from a rigid plastic. There is also a hole up top to put stuff in, but its just set up like a flap and its very small so not good for dropping stuff in unless you chopped it very tiny. The biggest problem with the lid is because its so tight its hard to get off. There is a tab made of the same rigid plastic to push/pull up to get it off but it very quickly cracked and is now holding on barely and about to rip off. I've stopped using it to take it off but I have to pry it off by the sides which are made from that rigid plastic which is thinner around the lip so it kind of digs into the skin when I remove it. They could have made the entire thing from silicone or has a seal of something similar around the rim that would have made it easier to take off. This seems like a major design flaw and if they had people actually use it they would likely found this out or at least gotten negative feedback about how tight it was. I have to give this one star as I think the rest of the lid will develop similar issues from repeatedly taking it on and off. It wont be much use to me then and having a good motor and container wont matter because the lids a piece of crap and badly engineered."
"After carefully considering options and reading reviews I picked this blender. Things to know:It’s loud! So loud I don’t use it in the kitchen. I shut it in a side room when operating because it hurts everyone’s ears.I have only used it for smoothies. But it’s a challenge. No matter the order I add ingredients it struggles to break down the fresh celery, or frozen strawberries. Making it run much longer than my last blender.The lid is very difficult to remove. I saw this in other reviews and worried; they were right be prepared to put some elbow into it.Positives:it works, just be patient and maybe add more liquid than your used to.It’s price is low.Easy to clean.In all I would not buy it again as I’m a heavy blender user and find it annoying to listen to and to operate. I’m not sure it will last due to the struggle it has daily. My last blender I had for 20 years. It was disappointed when the motor gave. I’m shopping for another blender now with the hope to find something useful."
"Every single time I use this blender, I wish I had just paid the extra $15 or so that it would have taken to buy a better blender instead of trying to shave costs.It works.  I can make a protein shake in the morning, although I have to run the blender in stages and then let it run for several minutes to try and avoid getting chunks of frozen fruit in my shake.  This method only works sometimes--I had to stop putting frozen avocado chunks in my shakes because this blender misses them no matter how much I run it, and the end product was a shake I deeply did not enjoy drinking. It's also loud enough that I feel like a jerk running it early in the morning in my thin-walled apartment (especially with how much I have to let it run to get my shake blended) so I try to plug it in against an interior kitchen wall so I won't disturb anyone--although forget running this thing if my significant other is still asleep in the other room. I do like that it's pretty easy to take it apart in order to wash it--honestly I think that's the best thing about it.I'd probably give it a solid 2.5 stars because it technically does the job it was created to do and because it's pretty easy to clean.  I couldn't bring myself to round up to 3 stars though, because most days I just really wish I had invested a little bit more money for a better blender and I don't want to contribute to anyone else feeling that way by rounding my review up, haha."
When I first plugged this in it would only start running by being plugged in. The buttons didn't work for turning it on and off. For some reason after a while I was able to get the buttons to turn it on and off but originally I had to unplug it to turn it off. Because returns through Amazon are such a huge pain I didn't bother trying to return it.  Luckily I was able to get it to work for the function I need.
"We had a Ninja for years, it finally started leaking so needed a new one. saw reviews thought ok I will save money get this... BIG mistake this thing really sucked, only tiny blade on bottom.  Nothing like Ninja or quality of.  Would barely blend anything."
"I just received this product and compared the bottom with my older ninja proffesional 1500 wattsThe older one is accurate it says on the bottom 1500 watts but this new one says on the bottom 1200, I am in awe, the box and the whole advertisement says 1800 watts but turn it around is says 1200wattsI dont know what to do , if I should return it,I tried the blender anyways and is very good , bigger cups , but so it was my 1500 watts back 4 years ago its just than it has been worn out on the baseOr am I missing something???I called customer service they told me this new one , is better she could not explain to me why it says 1200 watts.I am sharing pictures from New and old ninja blender bottomsIf someone has an answer to this I would appreciate it.🤔🤔🤔🧐I also included the pic of the part that is worn out, and the comparison with the new one.  But my ninja 1500 motor still good.And the picture of the new one."
"The Blender is Good in many ways but the blades are just incredibly dangerous and the way the blade attachment is separate from the vessel means you have to remove it to wash it. As long as you're really careful, this will be an OK blender for you. The blades don't go all the way to the edge of the vessel so you may need to shift the ingredients around with a very tall spoon in order to get everything blended. Another drawback is that this is incredibly tall on the counter and won't fit under the cabinets."
"This item came to me in rough shape, the blade wasn't secured properly so it cut up the whole inside of my blender and the whole blender was dirty one of the cups had old spoiled milk in it. It was absolutely disgusting, but it does work though."
Not very good product
Pros:-Very easy to clean-Very sharp-crushes ice easily-Very easy to set up and use-looks expensiveCons:-Very loud-the lid leaks very easily.
"Like always the motor works great and the blades are top notch. Appears the cup quality has gone downhill. The lids that I received with the cups do not fit. I have tried multiple times to get the clear lid to screw on but it won’t. The other lid is loose and the cup leaks slightly when I use it. I have multiple ninja products and am very happy with them, maybe this one is a one off on the disappointment side."
I’ve had this blender for 56 days and use it once daily for frozen fruit smoothies. I love the blend sense technology and that feature works very well. It has only been hand washed in cold water with dawn dish soap and never put in the dishwasher however I am on my second pitcher. The base of the pitcher cracks and leaks due to the plastic design from regular use as the blender is too powerful for the design of the pitcher and puts too much stress on the plastic housing.  The first pitcher started leaking after 26 days of use and the second within 14 days. Ninja does not warranty the pitcher but may send you a replacement if you pay for shipping. Hope this helps anyone who looks to use it daily. I did not have the same issue with the single serving cups.
I would definitely not recommend this blender. This is my second ninja blender ever my first one was amazing. Lasted over 10 years.!! this one can’t seem to blend anything without burning out the blade for the smoothie. I replaced blades replace cups and I still have issues.
"I only used this for a couple of short jobs.  I blended quick rolled oats into flour, and I made some dried fruit leather into powder, and it did both quickly and well.  However, when I washed the bullet cup after the second use, I found that the inside was now rough in spots on the lower inner portion and had a frosted look to it.  The friction from the blending had chipped small pieces off that were presumably now in my food.  With all of the dangers of microplastics now coming out, including heart attack and stroke, I knew that no matter how well this blended things, it had to be returned.  Sad!I tried to get a picture to share, and it didn't come out very well -- this is looking toward the ceiling light through the bullet cup.  Rather than being transparent, there is a frosted look where the plastic has chipped off after only two uses."
It stopped working for two days after receiving it
"I've used Ninja blenders for years, so when my old one died I ordered a new one. It arrived recently and the motor is very powerful but the lid has a tiny crack in it. So when I make smoothies some always leaks out. And I cannot find a way to contact the customer service to receive a new lid, so I may have to return the whole thing! Annoying."
This thing is a workhorse and almost overdoes it. The “auto sense” seems like overkill when my small smoothie is grinding and grinding and grinding at top level. It’s not blending diamonds folks…just a banana and yogurt…Miss the old version of this but we lost a piece in the move after fourteen years of love
"I liked this a lot when I first purchased it but the pitcher is terrible.  It leaks unless I hold the lid down (I am not over filling) and it cracked on the side after 6 months of use. I had to purchase a replacement pitcher for $70 which is more than it cost me to purchase a back up blender to have on hand for if there are problems with this one. I have always only hand washed this so theres no reason why it should be happening. For $200, I def did not expect to be having to buy replacement pitcher ever 6 months. If you want this, I suggest buying from somewhere with a good return policy or purchasing insurance for the product."
90 percent of you will not be able to put this under a cabinet
"I love my Ninja blender.  But right out of the box it smelled hot while blending smoothies.  I use it daily and thought the smell was because it was new, but after 6 months of daily use, the smell seemed to get worse, then it stopped working.  I contacted customer service and they had me video chat with them to show the problem.  The blender still had power, would light up, but wouldn't work.  They are sending me a free replacement. Update:  I received this blender for Christmas last year (‘23). Since then I’ve gone through 3 motors.  I only use this for smoothies, so it gets used 2-3 times daily. The first motor lasted 6 months, they sent me a free replacement, that one lasted 2 months, the third base I had to pay $15 shipping, and that one lasted just 2 months ( newest one started smoking this morning).  The last two started smoking while using.  I do not recommend this product, for being a pro blender, we bought it thinking I would have it for years, this model is not good.  I've used nothing but Ninja blenders for years and love how well they work, this is a new model, hopefully the get the bugs worked out.  That said, their customer service is great."
I would love to give this blender 5 ⭐️ but when I use it the liquid leaks from lid all down machine
"Apparently, the ninja can slice through just about anything, but the parts cannot handle normal usage. The food processor bowl will not snap into place due to a small piece popping off in less than 2 months. Now, it's useless to me unless I order another bowl."
"Generally, it’s a great blender until you go to pour it then it leaks everywhere before you even open the top it will start coming out. Also, if I’m blending a liquid if I don’t hold down on the spout, it will shoot out the sides. Something is definitely off with the seal."
Blender looks and blends great. Super loud. Mode option seems to have shipped with only one mode: chop. Pretty sure there is supposed to also be large chop and mince.
"Worst Ninja purchase ever :( I have been a big fan of Ninja products. I dropped the processor bowl less than 5 inch drop while taking it out of lower level of the dishwasher the first time I used it. I own a lot of other Ninja products and always feel they are high quality. The material the blender and  processor bowl feel brittle and not Ninja usual standards. Very disappointed. Called customer service, warranty only applies to motor, and there was  shipping of around 20.00 to even purchase a replacement. Even if you love Ninja pick something else. :("
"I LOVED this blender. It worked great while it lasted - unfortunately about 2 months in, it just turned off while it was in the middle of blending. The lights were still on, but blade wouldn’t spin and motor wouldn’t turn on.I tried different settings, unplugging it, turning it off and on, waiting a few hours and it just won’t blend anymore.Super disappointed not only to not have a blender, but to have $200+ gone down the drain"
My pitcher arrived with a big piece off of it. It looks great. Once I get a replacement I will do the review again.Sleek lines. Easy instructions. Comes with some recipes. Pour spot. Wide base to put leftovers in fridge so it won’t spill. BPA free. Measurements on the side. Handle on the side of jar PLUS on the lid.I just wish jar was glass.
It's not a bad product but not the same as my original system.  This system has far fewer pieces.
"I wanted the one that did everything, including dough and slice and grate. This is it.UPDATE: the processor was damaged due to my own fault, but it is not easy to see how to order a replacement. This is a problem."
"The blender leaked the first time it was used. The lid was on tight, and the level was below the max line. It still shot liquid out of the top. Made a mess everywhere. Also, the plastic stopper, where you can put food in while the food processor is running, fell out and chipped. It is still usable but disappointing that it fell out so easily and chipped. The smaller smoothie mixer worked fine. The only issue was I should have put the veggies in last instead of first. The frozen fruit caused the smoothie to not mix so I had to take it off, add water and mix it a little. When I put it back on the mixer it ran. So that was just operator error. Still very disappointed that the mixer leaked, and the food processor part fell out and chipped."
"This is a second one replaced by amazon and still the same problem: there are 2 lines on the bottom of main dish going from middle to the sides. They arent straight. Slightly crooked. So after a little more than a month of usage it started to leak right from those lines. We dont even use ice cubes for smoothies like most people do.  And there are squarish shaped lines as well on the bottom of the same main dish, those squared lines are ok. I guess they are made for  some support so it wont crack. Not sure.So ended up buying different Ninja model to see if those 2 lines are there. Yes they are existing. Why? To last less time? Not sure. Cause we have really older (8 years)  Ninja blender and it doesnt have those lines. And everytime you return in over 30 days there is restocking fee.(even if its returned in 31days)I thinks those lines on every Ninja blender nowadays."
Had this for little over a year and the plastic inside is starting to splinter in the raised areas. Almost drank a 1 inch piece of plastic. Frozen strawberries were the the biggest thing we’ve ever smoothied. Do not recommend ninja products.
"I can't find replacement blades.  I've tried their website and Google searches, but they don't make replacement blades for their own product.  The blades have failed on each of my prior Ninja purchases (like Magic Bullet) after only a few months.  This is my last Ninja purchase, as the blades are the most important part and they fail too quickly.  When I blend something, the liquid leaks through the blender pitcher, through the blade assembly, and drips out the bottom.  Any grease that is in there must be contaminating what is being blended if the liquid can leak through.  I've also bought 3rd party replacement for past blenders, and they seize up and smell like burnt plastic.  Also, the blades are not interchangeable between their products, which is super annoying.  Maybe instead of making a different set of faulty blades for each new product, make 1 that actually works across multiple platforms!"
"Seemed to be fine for a couple of weeks but then……the lid has space inside it so when you wash it it fills with dirty dish water you can’t get all out but then drips into the container.… the plastic is cheap, so now I can see it scratching and dulling, which means it’s putting microplastics and nanoplastics in my food.… you can’t wash it in the dishwasher."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I'm a loyal buyer of all things Shark/Ninja. So much so, it is one of the few products I buy directly from the company rather than Amazon. I initially purchased the TB401 model from Ninja. It's an amazing concept! To have all these small kitchen appliances in just one convenient system would be great, however, when it cannot even do the most basic feature it provides, which is to just blend... we have a problem! I returned the first system to Ninja via FedEx and decided to give it a second try purchasing through Amazon... the same thing happens! This confirms to me that the pitcher's sealing system is flawed and I just cannot believe Ninja's QA team just let this fly! In the video I show it overflowing with just shy of 8 cups of water, however, upon further testing it, it will overflow with as little as 4 cups of water! I'm returning this one too, and will sadly need to purchase within a different brand. What a disappointment this has been."
I bought this Ninja in July and now it stopped working. Not sure what the issue might be.
"The blender works fine but the plastic used for the jar is garbage. After only a month of using it, a crack formed at the bottom of the jar and it began to leak. I bought a replacement jar from ninja and the same thing happened. I would only use it to blend protein powders so for it to crack is insane."
I believe we received a lemon of a Ninja. It has not worked properly since we got it. Didn’t return because we are 300  miles by airplane from a post office to return the Ninja. Which is why we depend on good quality products in our wilderness business. Very disappointing with this expensive non-working ninja.
"I’ve never left a review before, but I’m so disappointed and wants to make sure people know if you are using this for smoothies get something else! After spending $200 I expected this blender to be able to chop up the kale in our smoothies. I had to chew the smoothie, even though I ran the blender three times. I should’ve spent the money on the Vitamix. it does a much better job, I bought this one for our cottage. And I didn’t want to spend more than 200$, but I would’ve been better off with a $40 blender.It’s the second smoothie I’ve tried to make it, I thought the first time was just a fluke. Now I’ve thrown out the box and cannot return it!"
"I specifically ordered this model because it says that it has a 72 oz pitcher. It turns out that it is a 64 Oz pitcher.Not planning to go through the hassle of returning it, but this is very disappointing.I haven't used it yet, so I cannot comment about anything else."
This is basically your average blender not gonna return this. I just wish it would have more power in features to it.
I bought this blender 3 months ago ..I am only used blender twice and lid of jar/pitcher doesn’t close completely. Every time I blend start leaking..its frustrating and I called Ninja twice and now they’re telling me lid is not under warranty..poor services.. I will not recommend to buy this product.
"t is meant to replace an old Ninja blender/processor - I thought it had a stronger motor, however, it is not powerful enough to provide smooth blending. It also gets hot rapidly and is not efficient. Very disappointing!"
"In a few tries of use, it consistently leaked horribly!! The return with Amazon was fine as normal but unfortunately the experience with ninja customer service was terrible"
"The base that connects with the blade for the cups stripped out and is no longer usable. Already had to replace the blade which only made it about 4 months. This is the second ninja product I’ve bought in the past couple of years that just couldn’t cut it. Probably good for people who only use it every once and awhile, not for daily use."
This may be the dumbest design for a blender. The handle is hallow and is not airtight so water and food gets into it when you wash the blender and it is never coming out. Less than a year after buying we are most likely going to throw out both the blender and food processor because there is no way to clean the handle!
The machine looks great however if you have plastic blades and gears it want last very long.The company has been saving money by using plastic blades and gear.
"I bought this blender in Oct of 2023. It is extremly loud I wear my ear plugs every time running it. Even my dog doesn't get close to the blender when it's running because of the noise. The noise is fine, what's really alarming is that the blender smells like burnt rubber/plastic when running. I thought it was a new appliance smell, it's been 6 months and the smell is still there. Always makes me wonder if some part of the motor is burnt."
We bought this blender 7 months ago and it started leaking one day. I got looking at it and it's cracked all the way around the bottom. It's a great blender overall but that shouldn't have broken that quickly.
"I can’t buy extra single serve cups or an extra hybrid edge. If you’re buying this to make smoothies frequently and might want more than one smoothie blender bottle, don’t buy it. Ninja can’t even give me a part number. Says they’re “out of stock” with no estimate as to when they’ll be back in stock."
It's very noisy and very loud
"The lid was defective.  I had to hold tight while blending, or else the juice spilled out from the tip.  I tried to get a replacement, but was told I had to pay out of pocket.  Which is why I returned the item at a drop off location."
"I received the blender in plastic bags, no box at all !!!! It seems like it has been used or refurbish."
"Looked to be a quality built product, but the volume of noise it made was literally deafening. My ears rang after the 1st use. Sent it back."
I paid over a 100 dollars plugged it in when I got itThe main blender didn’t work only the cupI also read in another review the same thing happened
"The blender cannot grind oatmeal into fine grains, despite the fact that there are 3 spiral blades. My old blender with 1 blade worked better. Very noisy and smells like burnt rubber when running."
"we received the product cup with several cracks and defective, creating a terrible experience for my wife as a wedding anniversary gift.I would like a new glass sent to the my home address."
Either a knock off or refurbished. Im pretty upset
Just like the previous model. This models large pitcher leaks when blending. Super disappointing!Definitely returning
"Melted in my dishwasher on the top rack at year one. Dealt with it since customer support said “dishwasher safe” wasn’t a warranted item.Fast forward about a year later, whole based cracked open when I went to relocate it and customer support wants me to wait 2 hours on the phone to “see if they will work with us”.This was used maybe once a week at most and moved locations twice. I’ve had nothing but issues out of their Slushi machine and the shark line as well. Multiple failures and pulling teeth to get stuff replaced.Great products for the year they make it. Then it’s just downhill from there."
"**UPDATE 2/28/24**Well, this blender isn't even five months old and the lid no longer clicks onto the pitcher. It was nice while it lasted, but I can no longer recommend this blender. Also, Ninja considers the lid a ""wearable part"", which means it is not covered under warranty. Purchase at your own risk!***I never thought I’d fall in love with a blender, but here we are.This blender has all the bells and whistles. I’ve gotten three uses out of it, and so far it has performed really well.The Blendsense works flawlessly. The blender blade spins around for a few seconds before turning on to the mode it has “sensed” for the contents.The base is sturdy, but it also has suction cups on the bottom that suction to the counter to ensure it won’t move around.The blender cup is made out of a thick plastic and the lid is another super nice feature, as it locks in place not only for for mess-free blending, but also for mess-free pouring. The flip-open spout has a metal piece running across the center so when you pour thick things like smoothies, it works as a separator, which prevents messes from happening while pouring.Overall, I am so impressed with this blender.Since I have only had it for a week so far, I will update if I have any issues as time goes on."
"I bought this blender because it has a glass jar. I plan to use it primarily for smoothies. I saw complaints about the lid before I bought it, and I agree that it is a problem. The lid appears to be made of cheap plastic and fits very tightly. It is difficult to get it on and off. Although the product claims to be dishwasher safe, I believe if you put the lid in the dishwasher, it will warp, and you may never get it back on the jar. (I don’t put plastic in the dishwasher anyway). My plan is to disassemble the blender after each use and hand wash and dry it; then, immediately replace the lid on the jar, and put it in the drainer, leaving off the bottom assembly, so it can air out. Hopefully, this will keep the lid in the right shape to continue using it. I will update if that plan doesn’t work. If it had been an expensive purchase, I would return it now. I wish the company would make a better lid, and offer it as a replacement. I do like the easy pour feature.It worked fine making a smoothie."
I just received my blender today and the first thing I wanted to check was the top because of the reviews. I wanted to put the top on and try and take it off before I used it. The top is a very cheap plastic which is why it's hard to put on and take off. The blender itself is the perfect size and I like that it is glass. Right now I am considering sending it back only because of the material the top is made of. If you have a weak grip you may not want this that is my issue. I do not know how well it works due to not using if I change my mind I will do an update.
"This is a nice heavy duty blender - but a bit too much for my simple cooking tasks.As others have commented, the cover is an issue.  It is hard to secure - and once secured, difficult to remove.Also some effort is required to clean.  For example, butter at the bottom - and also particles of food get stuck in a tiny space between the blades and the glass edge of the blender.If you have a need for a heavy duty blender and don't mind some extra effort, this blender would work for you.  But for something simple, like pureeing pasta sauce - I would go for something smaller.  So I returned this and will purchase something a bit more practical for my purposes."
I love HB. Lid went on snug first day.  put on top shelf of DW and only do the express cycle only and now will not stay on.Have sent email to CS Let's see if they respond soon.  I just want a lid that works.  The blender itself is great!
"The plastic lid does not fit into the glass cannister. It's very slightly too big to snap into the container, so I must force it down with all my strength to close the lid while operating the blender, then it seals in the food, but only if you lay on it with much strength."
The lid to the blender is very hard to get on and hold!  Blender seems good for smoothies and that's about it.
Doesn't blend ice very well
On a scale from one to 10 I give it about a five. Loud not very powerful but it’s cheap and price so I reckon you get what you pay for.
"Item is fine, for the price I guess.  Does not crush the ice as much as it describes.  It says it does slush and milk shake quality....it doesn't."
The lid does not fit!! Will not close at all!Tried the website - to see if I could get a different lid. Useless to try that!
"For forty bucks we can't expect a professional grade blender. But it would be nice if the lid would stay down. When using this blender it comes off - it doesn't even 'pop' off, because there is so little suction or holding power, it just sort of floats its way up as you're blending, and unless you hold it down with your hand, the contents will come out at the top.  I guess it does blend fairly well for a cheap blender, but super annoying this lid."
The blender itself seems to perform just fine making smoothies. That’s why I bought it. I didn’t wanna spend a ton of money so I went with this blender. The problem I had with this blender after the first use I put it in the dishwasher. The blender is supposed to be dishwasher safe. The lid was on the top rack and it warped slightly and now doesn’t fit right. I guess you get what you pay for.
This blender is inexpensive which is a good thing. Another good thing is that the pitcher is glass. I don't like that the base and top are thin plastic though. It makes me wonder how long it will last. Also I don't like the design of the top of the blender. I'd rather have a sturdy top rather than one with two openings.
"The blender and the carafe themselves are perfectly suitable as far as a blending go. The power seems a bit low, but workable. I am frustrated when I see protein powder stubbornly refusing blend into the shake no matter how high I set the speed, but it's not a deal breaker. I can live with a few lumps, but it doesn't make me happy.I'd say that, all around, the blender would squeak out four stars if the lid wasn't SO terrible. Oh, my lord. This lid design is so bad that it makes my eyelid twitch.The first issue is that it's so ridiculously tight that it takes serious work to wedge it on and ALL my muscle to get it back off. I've had more than a few nervous moments where I thought I wasn't going to be able to pull it off.And, for all that, IT DOESN'T SEAL worth crap. If I really get the ingredients flying around I can watch with bemusement as the fluid slowly slips between the edge of the lid and the glass and works its way right out. That has become a kind of ironic way to time the blend for me. Right before the fluid begins to spray all over my cabinets, it's done.Of course it's not quite done because I still have lumps, but it is what it is. Times up.There's a stupid little flap that's cut out of the lid's plastic itself. I think it's supposed to be used to drop things in while the blender is running, but it's too small to even get an ice cube through in one piece. It might latch. It might not. Depends on the mood of the gods that day.I get the impression that the lid was designed by the engineer to be made of a softer plastic and some managerial genius decided they would save money by making it out of a cheaper, harder material.The pour spout is the only part of the lid that's not terrible, but with the crappy seal, when I try to use the spout, fluid is dripping from the base of the lid and making a mess anyway. This makes the spout completely meaningless.This lid is so awful that I don't think I can make this blender work long term. I've tried to be alright with it and I've kept it too long to return, but I think I'm going to give this away to someone I hate and get a new one."
It does the job but I will keep making my smoothies in it and I will make a bet that it will not last more than 6 months cuz I can even start to hear the motor start to grind sometimes I do not put any ice in it I just put Frozen fruits that are not big like blueberries and raspberries and I put soft fruits like apples and bananas that have not been frozen in it unthawed strawberries and it will start to grind like it's not doing can't catch it it's not going to last long I will never buy another one from this company again I will have to save more money and pay for a more expensive one that I know that will last more than 6 months because of my diet I have to eat liquid food so I wasted money
"I was excited to get this blender as it replaced a previous one, finally used it to make a smoothie for breakfast but was not impressed, it took some effort to get my smoothie done.. I would return had I not used it already.. it was not hard to clean just not great at my smoothie now I’m concerned on its longevity."
"I had a really nice blender prior to this but just couldn't spend the money for a nice one, so I compromised and got this one instead.  It is very noisy but does a good job blending. The lid is absolutely horrible - the design of the lid is great, but the materials are cheap, and it doesn't fit well, so once you get it on, you can't get it off without hurting your hands or spilling the contents of the jar.  The opening at the back of the lid doesn't stay closed so stuff tends to squirt out the top and can get all over if you're not diligent about making sure it's pushed down tight."
"The glass holder is way too heavy once liquid is processed in the jor.  Hard to lift, even when washing."
"I have usually owned blenders that are specific to smoothie making (Magic Bullet, Ninja), but after my Ninja cups got distorted and I couldn't close them to blend anymore, I decided to try just a regular, classic, glass blender.  First thing, I do like the glass blending cup.  It's easy to clean, although heavy (obviously), but putting it together is quick and simple.  The blending?  Eh.  I was wondering my smoothies weren't blended as smoothly, as they were grainier, icier, and there were always chunks of something still left unblended (and this is after pulsing to get the pieces to the bottom), and then selecting ""Smoothie"" and ""Grind"" and letting it go for a good minute even.  I got disappointed in making smoothies in this, so I ended up calling Ninja and they gave me replacements to the blending cups, and I stopped using this blender for smoothies.  It'll probably be fine for things like margaritas (lots of space, so you can make a bigger batch lol), or blending non-smoothie type things.  But if you're looking for a true smoothie blender, I'd skip on this one.  It's not that loud, which is a plus, easy to clean, but has ok blending power."
"Blending various fruits together. When my fingers hit the edge of the lid some spilled out , twice . Sorry, this blender is not for me. Will try a different blender later on."
"My old blender died on me so I had to get a replacement quick. I'm not happy with this one. It's mediocre. I used crushed ice in my protein smoothie, and it can't break down those ice pieces all the way. I also had small chunks of strawberries that would get stuck in the straw. That'll be a no for me."
You get what you pay for and this is no exception. Didn't crush my ice cubes and struggled even with frozen cherries. Does fine to blend mostly liquids together.
"This blender taught me rage.  I didn't know I could hate an inanimate object with so much passion before I started using this blender.  I used to think that kind of hate was reserved for Nazis and University of Florida fans only, but no, I now can say I truly know myself better due to the experiences I've had with this blender.Let's start with the blending option.  I think if you wanted to mix food dye in with some water you might be able to after 20 or 30 minutes of blending, but ice? Ha!  Smoothies?  Think again sucker!  Whipped cream?  More like stirred froth.  See, when the masochistic designers unzipped their leather masks and peeled back their eye patches long enough to settle on giving this thing a function they discovered what might be one of the single greatest designs in all of the history of futility.  This blender can mysteriously mix the areas in contact with the blades with extreme prejudice while leaving any areas of liquid or ""substance"" above the blades completely unperturbed.  Amazingly this blender can render ice at the bottom into pure liquid water in seconds while leaving the ice above more frozen than Elsa's underwear.Some of you might be thinking ""well just push the other stuff down dummy"" and you'd be right if this weren't designed by Pol Pot clones raised in Chinese sweat shops.  Pushing things down just begins the second round of ""mushed on the bottom and solid on the top"".  Now, given 30 or 40 minutes of free time you might be able to eventually go through enough cycles of this to get everything in the blender mixed, and kudos to you buddy for having the patience and virtue to go through that process.  I lack these virtues, which is why I bought a blender that I was hoping would cut down on my smoothie making time.  It did what I did not think was possible, which was add time to an already laborious process of making smoothies by hand.The lid requires a degree in mechanical engineering to get on and off smoothly, which is great if you enjoy splashing your kitchen with blender contents, but my wife is the lead cleaning manager of our kitchen and I'm pretty sure I'd be restricted from all kitchen privileges if I continued opening the pseudo-smoothies I've been making without covering myself and the blender in a beach towel first.  I hate laundry so I'm going to pass on the extra towel duty.  Amazingly my wife hates this blender even more than I do; when I asked her if she wanted to contribute to the review she asked me how to spell a 10 minute scream.  I'm pretty sure she put an add on Craiglist for a hitman to come by and take this thing out.If I could give this thing less than 1 star I would, but then again if I could give this thing Ebola I would do that also.  I hereby sentence this blender to the death of a thousand hammer smashes, I would not dare allow someone else to attempt to use it lest I be tried for crimes against humanity (which I think the UN Council may need to consider for Hamilton Beach)."
Blender has enough power and is great for the price but the lid is super difficult to snap on - the plastic lip is not soft enough and you really have to struggle. Once it is on it is perfect for pouring with no fear of it falling off. Over all good buy - much lighter than expected.
"tried to blend/chop some dried cherries for a cookie reciupe. Useless had to take out and chop by hand. Great price, but you get what you pay for. not recomended."
It doesn’t crush ice very well
Does not blend smoothies properly.
"Bought this for my wife as a Christmas present. She likes the power of it, it has more blending options vs our old one and even seems to be quieter than the old one. The glass cup is nice and thick. The ONE bad thing she HATES is the lid. Its really hard to put on and take off. Yes it seals really really good but that makes it almost impossible to take off if you have wet hands, grease, or trying to take it off with one hand. You HAVE to use both hands in order to PRY the lid off."
"I thought I'd drop a review about this blender as I look for ""enhanced"" blender blades.  This blender as sold does a terrible job of blending smoothies.  I have to constantly hand mix, and push the contents down into the blade. Takes 5-10 minutes to fully blend.So far I haven't found a replacement blade, but was hoping HB would sell one specific to this blender with a longer reach."
All mentiomed in the headline
"Upon first use of the product, it initially seemed to be working fine. However, once the machine was done making the smoothie, the entire smoothie maker would not disconnect from the machine. Upon trying to swivel it, the bottom blade and the blade holder detached from the machine and glass portion, causing the entire smoothie inside to spill all over my cabinets, countertop, and floor! Mind you, the smoothie came pre constructed in the package and I explicitly followed set up instructions, so this definitely came as is.WORSE - a chip of glass from the cup chipped while using it (correctly), so when everything came detached and I tried to put them in the sink, a chunk of glass lodged into my middle finger, spilling blood everywhere and sending me to urgent care. AVOID - this product is not only garbage but DANGEROUS!"
Good one but the cover did not fit well. The air opening does not close so returned it.
"After a couple months of sporadic use, the blender started making odd noises. Stopped working altogether after 6 months."
THIS WAS A STRANGE PURCHASE.  ORDERED AND IT WAS DELIVERED WITHIN 2 HOURS.  RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM WHOEVER DELIVERED IT.  BLENDER WORKS OKAY BUT BUTTONS HAVE STICKERS ON THEM AND ARE NOT STRONG.  DON'T BELIEVE THIS WILL LAST LONG.  THE ONE I REPLACED WAS OVER 30 YEARS OLD AND STILL WORKED BUT TOP WAS GETTING STICKY.
"Used it twice to make salsa. Second time it was not blending properly, and i could smell burnt plastic. I made sure everything was seated right. It no longer turns on at all. Im a little out of amazons return window because i didnt use it right away. Had to submit a warranty claim through Hamilton website. They require you to pay shipping to them and i still have not got a response on how or where to send it.Update: I managed to submit my warranty claim through hamilton beach. It did take some time for them to respond, however they are making it right and replacing the unit and covering shipping. Will update if i have trouble with the replacement."
"Like a lot of other reviews, I agree that the top doesn’t stay on.  While I don’t like that, I would live with that if I had to. However, this thing doesn’t do anything. I’m very disappointed! I’ve tried blending cream of chicken soup with cream cheese for a dish I was making. I had to take the lid off and keep using a knife to break up the cream cheese. I’ve made other things too, and I constantly have to open it and use a knife to try and help stir things up. Last night I used it, and I finally admitted it’s just pointless. Why even get it out. I’ll be throwing this out and buying a new one. (It DOES work. It just won’t actually blend anything! I’ve had blenders before and this one is just terrible. I don’t recommend at all. I believe the blades are too short.)"
The lid is impossible to fit on properly! It’s a struggle every single time And at that it’s still not on properly! Very poorly made!
To blend my sea moss smoothie I thought it would be perfect. Or crush ice so I could make snow cones and icyies. It had 8 buttons as if it did 7 different things. It barely does 1 and I had to blend so long it probably ruined the nutritional value of my sea moss. The lid you have to hold it down and you better not let a child use it it has no safety features.8 buttons and they all do the same thing! One does go slower than the others. The lid doesn't seat as if its not made for the blender. The blades dont cross anymore after 1 use. I guess it is my fault for being so cheap. It word probably please someone who never owned a blender. But I had this blender only an older model and owned it for 25 years. My children laughed at my blender so I thought I would by an updated model of the same blender. They don't make them like they use to.
Sloppy non fitting lid. Made a mess because of lid fitting improperly. Return authorization granted thanks to Amazon.
". I like the pitcher it opens and cleans easily it stores easy and doesn't take up much space.  My issue is that it does not chop ice the way it says it does and I have to stand by the stupid blender open the top and shove down the ice then put lid on and try again. If I use as much liquid as it is says to (8oz) It doesn't always work it need more liquid and then my drinks are getting too watered down as the ice melts. I used it for an iced coffee beverage and it had ice chunks in it with the blended ice.  I had to spit the ice out. I also tried it with frozen fruit to make a smoothie. I have to shove the fruit around with a knife so that it would blend. eventually it blended a little but I was still left with some milk in the bottom of the glass that didn't blend. I want to send t his back as defective it doesn't do what it says it does. I saw a ""wave action"" once and it was weird. and it was only after everything was completely liquid. if you want this fro crushed ice or smoothies, it won't work. go get another bleneder. I have an off brand blender I have had for ten years, it works better than this one.not to mention the fact I got hurt twice trying to get the lid off the pitcher it's so tight it flings off when you get it off. the smoothie top doesn't work very well either."
This blender is fairly quiet and seems to have descent power.  On the downside the drive impeller is made of plastic instead of metal and the lid is difficult to secure and open.
"My old blender that I had for 20 plus years finally died on me. This new blender has plastic assembly in the bottom, and no matter how I put it together, it leaks! It doesn't seem to have the power of my old blender either."
"2nd week of using it and it lost power.  It arrived on July 6, 2024.  Motor smelled burned and stopped working on July 18, 2024.  To begin, it didn’t crush the food well.  Used it to make agua Fresca and the fruit was a bit chunky at the highest speed.  On July 18, the motor started smelling burned and it blended the fruit way chunkier.  I guess I got what I paid for since it was cheap."
"I bought this blender a little less than a year ago. It has been used mostly for smoothies with fresh greens, vegetables, and fresh or frozen fruit. I have found that it does not pull the contents down well. I have no stop it and push ingredients down to get it to blend or it just spins the bottom portions. If let to go without pushing it down it has taken about 5-7 minutes to blend and sometimes not at all. Maybe the blades are too short, I don't know. I will be purchasing something else to replace this. I'm sure it works fine for liquid, but it's not getting the job done for smoothies. It's also VERY loud."
"Not as good as my Ninja crushing ice for drinks. But works pretty well for the $’s Old Hamilton Beach lasted over 40 yrs but was made in US.Lid is terrible, dont need a spout in the lid. Old style lid was way better"
The lid doesn’t close!
"I like the size of the blender and all its options. However, the slide doesn't sit correctly, so I have to hold the lid. Blending is fine."
"The blender itself is nice. I've used it almost daily since buying it, but I have noticed some drawbacks. If you just need a blender to blend smoothies and margaritas, this will definitely work. However, the drawbacks are kind of a big deal to me so I don't think I would recommend this particular model to anyone. First, all the parts that move together like gears in order to actually blend something are plastic. At first, I didn't think it would be a problem, but after the first couple of uses, you can see that the gear teeth are visibly eroding away from friction - obviously not ideal for a long term solution. Additionally, the teeth tend to leave behind a fine plastic sand all over the base of the blender as they wear away. That is probably the most annoying thing to me about this blender. They don't get in your food or drink or anything like that, but you have to clean it after every use once the teeth start to wear down. Second, the power output isn't anything special. I've had a few times already where a recipe I was following suggested I use a blender to make a puree. This blender will not be a good fit for that type of use.If you just need a basic blender, this will suffice. However, you probably shouldn't expect much else out of it."
Cleans easy. blends ice into mix well. BUT the lid takes Serious effort to put on and off. Seriously ! ! !
"When i bought this blender 2 months ago, i was initially very pleased with the look, weight and performance. the only drawback i could see was the very cheap lid that neither conforms to the look of the rest of the blender, nor fits firmly into the glass container. in other words, you have to hold it on the entire time you're blending lest it go flying across the kitchen. anyway, this was barely a complaint because i figured the great price justified cutting a few corners and i'd rather them cut corners on a loose lid rather than a faulty jar/base/motor. [EDIT: I must have been sent a different sort of lid than some of the others who have written reviews. maybe they are testing out different types of lids.]unfortunately, the blender's performance has steadily declined to the point where it's now essentially useless. in my household, this blender gets frequent usage, mostly for making 1-2 smoothies/day from a combination of fresh and frozen fruit and almond milk. probably the frozen fruit is what dulled the blade but the photo on the article with a giant jar full of ice and fruit had me thinking the blender could handle it.incidentally, despite that photo, this blender was almost never great with ice. once or twice i got a nice slush but usually i end up with huge ice chunks, or if i keep blending, no ice at all, just a watered down smoothie. another drawback i was willing to overlook, and simply stopped adding any ice to my smoothies after the first few times.these days if i want to blend up a smoothie, i can look forward to spending 10-15 minutes stopping and starting the blender every 20 seconds and stirring things around trying to get it to break down the fruit. the amount of liquid is immaterial; the blade is simply too dull to be effective.this blender may still be recommended for people who only blend occasionally, or tend to blend softer foods like cooked vegetables for soup or something."
"I bought this full size blender because it was touted as a Wave Crusher with patented Ice Crusher blades. The first problem was that it didn’t even totally crush 2 cubes of ice for my 12 oz smoothie despite giving it a normal run time. I tried it for three days without success.  The second problem is the lid didn’t fit. The first day I just held it down at an angle so it didn’t pop off.  The next two days, out of frustration, I figured I was plenty strong enough to get the rubber/plastic lid to seal shut. Arm strength was not enough; I had to put my weight into it and the lid then popped on and sealed like glue. The flip side is how to you remove a lid that is sealed on by this amount of friction. So for the next two days I tried to use my finger nails to peel/pop it off.  Not an easy job and each time the contents went flying. I replaced it with the personal Hamilton Beach mini version of what looks like a regular blender, with blades at the bottom that remained in the smoothie cup when you drink out of it.  It crushed ice fine and the lid was no issue at all."
"I have not used it yet, but I did turn it on. It is kinda loud, but I would say not much louder than my old blender. The reason I chose this one is because the base of the blender is wide, not tapered like most and like my old one. I really was assuming and thinking mine sucked at crushing ice because it was not getting to the bottom of the blender. This one boasts a lot about its power and ability to crush ice, so it better work. the lid, as other reviews state, is hard to get on and off, but as they said I am hoping it will loosen over time. The quality from further away looks wonderful, but upon close up inspection, it seems pretty cheap. The lid most of all. nice features, but you pay cheap you get cheap. has a 3 year warranty but does not include the glass (really?) or normal wear and tear and the manual states that this item is subject to normal wear and tear just from using it so it seems like warranty isn't much. the most quality of this is the glass so maybe that's is why you don't need a warranty on it. Good feature - you can just put the blender on it and turn it on - does not need to be locked into a certain position to turn on - you know that in older products is annoying right!?!"
"I like that it has a glass container and it's still functioning after a year - so 2 stars for that.It seems to just stir --rather than chop or blend. Even on the highest setting it doesn't manage to smoothie a partially frozen banana chunk. Also, the lid does not stay on unless I forcefully press it down, which is annoying."
The blender doesn’t blend/chop or purée the fruits or vegetables as it is supposed to. It leaves the pieces whole or in big chunks/pieces. I have to add more than the necessary liquid in order for the blades to do a better job which shouldn’t be the case as it changes the flavor and texture of my shakes and salsas and it’s an inconvenience. I am very dissatisfied with the functionality of this product. Not worth the price. Don’t waste your money.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this in May of 2023 but hardly used it—maybe two times. I just tried to make a smoothie with frozen berries and frozen mango pieces I bought at Whole Foods, a fresh, soft banana, almond milk, and kale. It was blending fine, and then it burst open, and the entire smoothie for two exploded all over my kitchen—it was everywhere! The mess was a pain, but how dangerous was this!! I've had blenders for 20 years that never had the glass break! What if the glass chipped inside, and I didn't know, and my family and I drank it? Be careful. I wouldn't buy this again."
"the blender works fine , like i expected it to ,  inside packaging damaged shipping box , no damage really ?  your shipping department needs to improve , or some one needs to be terminated"
"Just bought this blender.  It was advertised as a smoothie blender. It did well with the berries and even the frozen banana but failed with nuts.One of my favorite smoothies is banana and blueberry.  I add a handful of almonds to get some protein.  The blueberries were fresh, the banana was frozen.  It mixed them okay, but there were still noticeable large chunks of almonds in the mix, even after blending for a couple minutes.  Chunks were 1/8 to 1/4 inch.My old blender was a Hamilton Beach and it lasted 25 years so I bought another by the same company.  Old blender mixed nuts just fine down to micro particles.  Noticed a design differences between the two.  Old one had a narrower base.  Blades almost touched the sides.  New one had a wider base and the mixing blades were about 1/2 inch from the sides.  This allowed the nuts to be pulled down to the blades but not actually get cut by the blades.Overall disappointed but the blender is still functional.  Good thing I like chunky smoothies"
"It has a glass jar, so I’m happy about that. Otherwise very cheaply made but it gets the job done."
The gear wheel that connects to the blender won't always connect properly and it will shave down the plastic on it...personally I think it's design flaw but otherwise the blender works fine
"Returning, because I can’t get the lid to fit properly. It was VERY hard to get on, even most of the way, so I could hurry up and mix my milkshake. I had to keep my hand on it, just in case. Then, it was difficult to remove. Now I’ve washed it and fought like crazy, to put it together to return. Guess what? The lid  is stuck again. Oh well, it’s your problem now."
"This blender is not it. It blended my frappes after some fighting with it. I had to mix it up a little with a spoon and then lift it up and shake it around a couple of time in between rounds. I had it filled almost to the top, but more than enough room to blend. The frappe was still not as smooth as I would have liked. It doesn’t seem very powerful. Which is disappointing. The noise level is normal. Overall a bad purchase."
"I just purchased this blender to replace my Hamilton Beach Scovill model 564 14-SPEED blender that I purchased in the 80's and finally the blade housing unit cracked and the bushing started deteriorating and it now leaks. I have been very happy with the blender so I purchased another Hamilton Beach blender, model 54221.Boy, what a disappointment! Even though this blender (700 WATTS) is TWICE the wattage of the Scovill model 564 (330 WATTS) it has FAR LESS power. I mainly use the blender to make green smoothies consisting of fresh spinach and kale with frozen fruit mixed in. This blender on the highest speed took 3-4 minutes to puree the greens, and even after that long, the fruit was still in chunks.And this blender is advertised as ""14 functions"" which I interpreted to mean 14-speed like my Scovill but it only has SIX speeds... how are they getting ""14 functions"" out of this? Are they trying to say that because each speed button is labeled with two different ""uses"" plus the two ""pulse"" buttons, they are claiming 14 functions? What a marketing SCAM. Yeah you can buy a volleyball and kick it around like a soccer ball, but that doesn't make it a volleyball and a soccer ball.I can now see from the blades on this blender why it doesn't work as good: my Scovill blender has two sets of perpendicular blades, and this blender has two sets of parallel blades fixed on top of each other.If I can't buy a better blade from Hamilton Beach, then I am going to return this. It's FAR inferior to my 30+ year old Scovill. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!"
I bought this blender 35 days ago so return is not possible. I only used it a few times and seemed to work ok for the money. BUT today after washing it the lid is no closing. Did the lid shrink from washing it in hottish water (I can put my hands in)???? Dangerous to run it without the lid secure. Trying to find out how to get the lid replaced and do they shrink???
"I bought this because of the large jar capacity. I use my blender strictly for pureeing sauces, smoothies, cream soups, etc. Unfortunately, the size isn't much of a benefit because filling the jar even 3/4 full means the contents at the top don't get blended well.Everyone knows glass is heavy, and this jar is as well, making it more difficult to lift, scrape, and pour from. I would have preferred a plastic jar, but those were only available in smaller sizes.My biggest gripe, though, is the lid. The first time I used it, the contents sprayed up and forced the spout open slightly, dribbling sauce (that happened to be hot) all over the lid and even up onto my face. There's another flap on the lid and that shot open as well. When I twisted the jar off the base, the bottom came unscrewed and fell out. So that was a fine mess on the countertop.To use this, I need to make sure to re-tighten the base before adding anything to the jar, only fill it halfway, then hold down both the spout and the flap on the lid while blending. Kind of a  hassle. It also doesn't puree very finely. If my food processor is worst at pureeing and my Bullet is best, this is somewhere in the middle."
"The blender part works fine but the lid does not fit. There are two ports in the lid, the one for adding ingredients won't stay closed. The lid it self does not stay in place. You have to keep pressure in it to keep it from riding up. The container jar has slanted sides and the lid has straight sides. Failure to keep pressure on the lid will cause a real mess when starting the blinder."
Lid is very hard to remove or put on
"Unfortunately, this blender is a royal pain in every way.  The first flaw is that the lid is very flexible and cheap plastic.  For some reason, it fits too tightly on the top of the blender and it is basically impossible to get off.  I broke a finger nail trying to get it off.  I found if I run the glass portion with the top under hot water then it comes off easier. But, then the glass container is slippery and water can get in to what you are mixing. It also makes it dangerous removing the lid because you don't want to put too much pressure on the glass.  I have never had an issue like this with any other blender.  The other problem I had was at one point the glass was so tightly attached to the base that I had to rotate the blender to remove it which unscrewed the base and the blade causing the contents to leak out.  Very disappointing.  Finally, the cord is really short which makes it hard to use.  This blender is not made well and is not worth the money.  I will have to continue using my old Oster blender."
"Works good, but you have to hold the cover on ... or at least I do ... can't seem to get it to fit right and the cord is way, way too short."
"I bought this to replace an old glass Oster blender since it was on sale and had so many great reviews and resembled the glass Oster.  Then when I read the low reviews, I see others had the same problems.  We make a lot of smoothies and this one says it is great for crushing ice.  This thing does not work well and the smoothie ingredients did not get sucked down into the blade and blend like a blender is supposed to do..We attempted 4 smoothies in it. I put the ice in first, as shown on the blender box picture, and would have to use a long spoon to move ingredients around to get the thing to even blend.  Then I tried putting the bananas/fruit/yogurt in first and the ice (switched to crushed ice even) in last..same problem with it not blending and yogurt was stuck to the glass sides.  I don’t know if I got a defective one or what but it is junk.  Another issue is the base is made of cheap thin hard plastic as is the lid, unlike my old blender which has a heavy duty flexible plastic lid and a hard plastic base.  The lid on this thing was impossible to pry off after making a smoothie that I broke a nail.. also the lid flew across the counter and spewed smoothie mess everywhere.  So we went back to using our 20 yr old Oster blender and just bought a new new steel blade for it as it has a metal gear that then goes into the metal blender base.. which tears ice to shreds and blends smoothies.  This thing does not have a metal gear assembly but instead has a cheap plastic gear assembly that goes into the hard cheap plastic base.. not made to last.My 13 yr old smoothie queen rolled her eyes and said why did you buy the cheap one.. She wouldn’t use it so we sent it back."
Blends well but the lid doesn’t stay on.
"I bought this for my son to make smoothies, and he told me that he stopped using it because it didn't blend the frozen fruit, just mixed them around. I just tested this out and am not impressed by it... I use things like flax, chia seeds, and celery in my smoothies, and this blender left my smoothie very gritty and a bad texture. I suppose if you were just making a milk shake, it would work, but anything with frozen fruit or things with texture such as seeds does not work.  I would love to return it but it doesn't look like I am able to return it because it has been more than 3 months."
"This smoothie maker will do the bare minimum.  I have to frequently start and stop the blender to push the fruit down again, even when I cut the fruit slices into several pieces.  The “wave action” doesn’t work until you have manually pushed the fruit down several times."
I should’ve spent more $ to get a better blender. The cover doesn’t fit well and/or stay on tight when blending.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            As shown in the video, the flap remains open no matter how you try to close! Closing and opening the lid is a bit difficult. Otherwise, the product works fine. The jar is really strong!"
"I bought the product as a gift, when my friend opened it it was lovely but I noticed it did not have the rertractable cord as advertised in the pictures. My friend loved it just the same but it is dissapointing to order something with certain features but receive a slightly different product.  I will be very careful  and probably not buy these type of products unless I can see it in person."
It blends. It's a blender. Just don't except it to chop anything up.
"One of the worst blenders I’ve used in a while, bad quality, cheap plastic material and just bad in general. Doesn’t crush ice or blend frozen fruit all that well. If you want a blender, don’t buy this. Buy another brand, even if it’s expensive. If you want a high quality blender, you’ll have to pay a high fee. It’s price was very much worth its quality, a cheap blender is expected to be bad quality. In my opinion it’s not worth dropping $40 on and you should just buy from a brand like kitchen aid or ninja."
"I got one of these as a gift and the poor design allows for the teeth of the blender to not line up when you put the canister on the blender which caused the teeth to rub down and eventually wear down to the point where it no longer blends.  You can see this in the picture with the two blender bases.  This is part my fault, but I think some of this is the cheap design.  So, I buy a replacement and it shows up with all the control buttons smashed in.  There's no damage to the product's box, so it obviously was ""tested"" and packed this way.  So I call the 800 customer service number on the instructions where it says ""our friendly associates are ready to help"".  If you consider a recording telling you to go to their website for FAQs as customer service, then sure they're friendly as can be.  Final recommendation:  but a different brand and save yourself the aggravation."
"It took 15 minutes and lots of stopping and stirring just to blend some soft, cooked sweet potatoes and milk.  And it smelled like it was burning. Just bought this a few months ago and now I need to buy another that actually works."
"I was super excited to get this in, since I scan through most of the reviews. But I was a bit disappointed to learn that it doesn’t fully get the job done. I mainly use it to make smoothies and it often has a hard time just shredding/crushing up ice or frozen fruit. And sometimes, I have to get a spoon to push the frozen fruit to the bottom, so it can mix well. It still gets the job done, but you have to be patient because it won’t do it fairly quickly."
I thought this would be a good blender but the lid doesn’t stay on and I have to hold it down when blending which is pretty awful for a blender. The top doesn’t feel like it fits correctly . I’m not sure if it’s even the correct top for the blender.
I had frozen pineapple chunks to blend with pineapple juice and they mostly stayed in chunks! . I can imagine what it won’t do with ice. The cap was washed in the dishwasher twice and it now doesn’t fit and close. The worst.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is a video that shows it’s not even blending a banana. I’ve had this blender for maybe 8 months now use it all the time for shakes and smoothies and it is MEDIOCRE. Never fully blends. Always has chunks of fruit at the bottom.
"Blender looks great but the top is too hard to get on without almost breaking the pitcher...and when your done and go to pour the top leaks from underneath the spout even with the top all the way on creating a big mess and it gets worse trying to pour without the top on as the spout has been poorly thought out form a tech standpoint... Straight up Trash..I could've just used my ninja instead of purchasing this P.O.S.I AM not intersted in hearing from you folks, contact hamilton beach!!!"
Doesn’t completely blend well and lid is extremely hard to get on and off.
It leaks around the rubber gasket after just a couple of weeks.
Cover to the blender doesn't keep firm the items are small
The blender performs as expected but my disappointment is that you have to hold the lid in place. When pouring you will have drips to clean up. I would have returned it if it wasn’t for the fact that my daughter threw all the packaging away.
I just wanted a blender for smoothies in the morning without spending a lot of money. This gets the job done. You have to add a lot of liquid otherwise the ice blending isn’t great. The bottom unscrews for easy cleaning and the whole thing is dishwasher safe which is a plus. The different functions don’t do have much variations in ability to blend- I think it is all kind of the same standard speed. It works okay
"All in all, it’s not the worst blender. It blends efficiently, and without a super a lot of noise, but whoever designed the pourspout should probably rethink their job. Made a mess on my counter every single time, no matter how slow I poured. Might be different for straight up liquid, but I use it for smoothies in the morning and the tiny little pour spout is basically a decoration. Returned it after a week"
"For smoothies. Motor had burning smell from day one ( yes, I followed all the directions meticulously) and has never performed well enough to mix, blend, chop or come close to creating smoothies magic. Missed return window as forever busy.  Bummer .  My experience, front past purchases, is a durable product so like I said, maybe I got a used or defective product here."
"As the headline says, I wanted to like this unit, but it failed on every level that mattered to me.First, as other have noted, the lid is extremely hard to remove. It's a relatively hard plastic with no flex. I miss the rubber lids that old blenders had.The hard to remove lid is something I could have lived with / gotten used to, except, even with it snapped on tight, blended liquids dribbled out between the lid and glass jar when pouring from the hinged spout. I don't even know how they pulled that off, considering there is only one way to fit the lid to the jar.The death blow was that, on first use, there was a leak from the bottom of the glass jar where the black plastic housing for the blades are. At first I thought it my imagination, but, no, it was a leak.It's a good looking unit, I like the heavy glass jar. It could go in the dishwasher for cleaning and is no more noisy than it needs to be for the job it is doing. The price point is reasonable, but it's still a total fail and it was returned within 24 hours"
Because of the design it doesn't even blend anything. The blades are small and don't even reach halfway around the inside so it will blend a tiny amount in the middle and everything else around it doesn't blend. Then you try to move stuff around to the middle and it just pushes everything away without blending it. Wtf
"I bought this blender because it had great reviews and was affordable, but I have no idea why it has so many great reviews. The lid is extremely hard to get off and the blender seems to have a hard time blending frozen fruit for smoothies. Wish I could send it back - buy something else."
I purchased this unit mainly to mix my diet food. One of the things in my diet is a soft serve so the recipe calls for ice and water. This blender does a pretty poor job of chopping up ice; at least at the quantities called for by the recipe. I should try using more ice and making larger quantities but for now it's a good blender but a middling chopper of ice.
"I sent this back before even using.  I own several older blenders that both cost under $150, and the lid design on both are FAR superior to this one. This one has a ""snap-on"" design, and directions say to push down on lid until lid flaps ""lock into place"".  The lid itself, and especially the flaps are flimsy (made out of what feels like a light weight, cheap, thin, somewhat hard and inflexible rubber that has no strength to it and feels like it will either break completely, or lose what little strength it does have in a short order.  There was no ""locking"" sound or any other indication that the lid was actually secure, and I had to instead get down at eye level and inspect the bottom of the flap from underneath to see if it was indeed under the ridge it was supposed to snap ""over""... and I STILL wasn't sure!!!  The flaps did not look or feel firmly in place, and I knew immediately I would never feel comfortable using this blender, as a tight a secure blender lid is ESSENTIAL.  Also, you have to sort of pry the flimsy flaps off the same ridge to take the lid off, and they felt like they might break right then and there!  The removable ""lid plug"", which you can remove to add more ingredients without taking the lid off,  also felt flimsy and poorly designed.  PLUS, the food container itself felt REALLY cheap compared to either of my inexpensive blenders (one has an actual glass container that has lasted over 15 years, and the other is made of a MUCH heavier and more solid plastic).The only part that felt worth the $400 price tag was the base with the motor, which was really heavy compared to my other two blenders.  I just think Vitamix went the cheap route on everything else.  The blending power may well be far superior to my other blenders, but I'm just not willing to pay $400 for a blender with ANY cheap parts, especially such important ones.  I was so excited about finally owning a Vitamix, but was so immediately dissatisfied that I packed it up10 minutes after taking it out of the box and requested a refund. Perhaps they have recently redesigned and cheapened the lid and container, as I saw only one other person with my same complaint.  For what it's worth, this is only the second negative online review I've ever written about a product."
"Wanting to upgrade my smoothie processing, got the 5200, white, on sale at a good price (for it, but really it's a bit pricey).  It happened;  now it's easier for me every day compared to my old, smaller machine which was perfectly fine but not quite as good.Out of the box my Plug would not lock in the lid.  Didn't fit together right.  Examining the parts, I ascertained that the Vitamix instructions, lock clockwise, unlock counter-clockwise (cc) made no sense.  So I wrote to Vitamix as follows:""….Your Owner's Manual instructs me (and everybody else) to secure the plug by turning it clockwise (Page 7, para 2) and, to remove it  by rotating counterclockwise from ""locked"" to ""unlocked"".  But my inspection of the two pieces informs me that the design doesn't care which direction is used to secure/ lock it, and equally doen't care which direction is used to unlock it for removal.  Unfortunately I cannot test my analysis because my pieces don't fit, and don't lock.The Plug has two studs, each a semi-cylinder.The Lid has four pairs of studs, equally spaced around the inside of the opening for the Plug.  The two studs constituting a pair are spaces approximately 9/32"" apart, thus forming a nest for the Plug's stud to rest in.  To try to avoid confusion, I'll now call the pair of studs of which the Lid has four, the ""goalposts"".The goalposts have small inclines (or, perhaps, ramps) on the side of each post that is away from the other post.  But on the side of each post that faces the other post, there is no ramp and the post has a straight wall.One can see that the semi-circular side of the semi-cylinder Plug stud will, with an easy twist, ride up the ramp of a goalpost, continue over the goalpost, and fall into the space between the posts.  It will take greater effort to twist it out, because there is no ramp to assist.  But since every pair of goalposts has two outside ramps, it doesn't matter whether one locks clockwise or counterclockwise.  The Plug stud will proceed to the next goalposts in the direction used and go up the ramp and over the post .So I wonder why your instruction book says what it says.  Ditto for the unlock.  The geometry is symmetrical...doesn't matter which direction.  One can both lock and unlock clockwise, or lock and unlock counterclockwise,  or lock clockwise and unclock cc, or lock cc and unlock clockwise.My pieces were not properly made.  I don't know which piece is dimensionally wrong, but I don't get any contact whatsoever between the Plug studs and the Lid goalposts.  The plug just spins around.  I suspect that the goalposts are too short, perhaps a molding problem.  But that's just a guess.Please send me a replacement Lid and Plug, and a shipping label so I can then send you the misfits in the box you used to send the replacements.  That way I can continue to make smoothies( being careful not to overload the container causing a spray of fruit through the plug opening after the Plug is shot across the room) whilst I await the replacement.""They sent the replacement but didn't want the original parts back.  When I asked why they didn't want to find out what was wrong, they indicated that they already knew the part was prone to warpage.  They said:""As for the lid itself, the ridges when brand new should stop the lid plug from turning. It is possible over time that they become worn down or the lid becomes warp and the lid plug is no longer stopped by them""Well, these were brand new parts, so obviously they weren't worn down, but perhaps they were warped?  When the new parts came I compared all the pieces and realized that the original lid was very slightly (1/8"") warped out of shape.  It is a soft plastic-like lid and I wasn't surprised it didn't keep it's proper shape.  Just the 1/8 inch removed the ""lock"".When I assembled the new Lid & Plug, I confirmed my previous opinion (based on the visual of the design) that it would lock and unlock both clockwise and cc.  Then I thought about Vitamix's statement that over time the ridges wear down, and that is a known cause of lock failure.  then I had a ""eureka moment"".  Not only are Vitamix's instructions (""lock clockwise, unlock cc"") unwarranted because the plug will lock and unlock in either direction, BUT THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ACTUALLY HARMFUL AND SHORTEN THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE LID.  I told this to Vitamix and explained as follows:""Well, if you always lock clockwise, and always unlock cc, the hard stud of the Plug will always ride over the same stud (or ""ridge"", as you call it) of the pair.  Back and forth over that stud (and the same thing happens on the opposite side) and no travel whatsoever over the other stud of the pair.  So all the wear and tear goes on one ridge, rather than being shared between the two ridges of the pair.  Better practice would be to make all movement clockwise (or all movement cc) as this would put both studs of the pair in play for each lock-unlock episode (  and reduce the wear on the otherwise solo stud by a significant percentage)..  The BEST PRACTICE, however, which might be a little hard to swallow or ordain in the instructions, would be to make all movement clockwise on odd days of the month, and all movement cc on even days of the month.  OK, you think I'm nuts, so let me explain.  The ""Better practice"", although it uses both studs of the pair, is always going up the ramp of one stud for the lock, but going against the vertical edge of the other stud for the unlock.  Since the ramp makes it easy to lock, it is putting less wear on the stud (or ridge) to lock than to unlock, which requires brute force (a small brute) to blast through the vertical obstacle.  Thus the unlock will put more wear and tear on the piece than the lock, and if you always twist in the same direction for both lock and unlock you will wear out the ridges unevenly.  Yes, the wear goes to both of them for sharing, but the share is not even.  The BEST PRACTICE will even it out, maximizing the useful life""The Vitamix customer service reaction to all this bordered on total disinterest.  I was told that the product was around some 20 years and if I wanted a better designed lid/plug I should return it and purchase a different model Vitamix.  I should probably do that but I probably won't, because we spent so much time in deciding to purchase the 5200 that I don't want to go through that drill again.I even found, on one occasion when my smoothie was quite large, and I was blending on high, the pressure of the fluid pressing up against the replacement lit caused it to flex (or warp) thereby unlocking the plug which then spun around and around pushed by the swirl (but did not fly out, for some reason).  I might end up by simply making it a point to put my finger on the plug in that situation.But what really galls me is that I asked for feedback from Vitamix engineering about my observations about the instructions for lock/ unlock, and I was flatly refused.  ""We don't give feedback.  Period""  or some such language.Truly, I don't know how durable (had it less than a month) or versatile (all I do is smoothies) the machine is.  Not at all.  I gave three stars only because I had to give something."
"I only really chose this blender due to this simplistic and manual design. I prefer to be a bit more hands on when using it. I'm not too huge of a fan of the new direction that they took with all of these smart features and LCD screens.By the time I make one smoothie, the motor is already overheating. I make sure I follow all of the typical best practices when using it and specifically use plenty of liquid to make sure that it shouldn't have any issues but so far expectations has been set pretty high and its really under delivering. When it does work, it blends everything really well, just as what I would expect and want, the product typically comes out with very desirable consistency.Based on other reviews, it seems like quality has deteriorated over time, I might wait until they get their quality issues figured out before purchasing this particular model."
"First time vitamix purchase, and I must say I was expecting a more “quality” feel. The tabs on the bottom that hold the cord are flimsy and the rubber grip feet aren’t really grippy.  The SN sticker on the back shows the model number VM0197 but when you google that it says explorian e310 even though the front of the unit says 5200. Also the enclosed owners manual says professional series 200🤔Performance is meh. Can definitely still feel the texture of seeds of strawberries and blueberries in smoothies."
"I was satisfied for years with my Oster12 speed blender but it was about to wear out after regular use making smoothies, and that’s about all I could use it for. I never had a Vitamix but had many friends and relatives over the years tell me it’s the one, so I bit the bullet. I read many reviews and was looking for some thing that would make a good plant milk too, which means nuts get pulverized to smooth consistency. I have an almond cow, so I was curious how well a Vitamix would do. After reading many reviews, the 5200 was what seemed to have the best user satisfaction from repeat Vitamix owners, saying with the narrower jar that particle size was smoother. My first test was a smoothie using some frozen fruit, roasted almonds (which would be too hard to make plant milk out of), Chia seed, frozen fruit and spinach. I followed the instructions for order of loading and running time, and was quite impressed that the, nuts and seeds were basically smooth as cream.  Sure beat my almond cow on those almonds!  Cleaning isn’t as thorough with just whooshing water at high speed, so I do have to wipe the walls down inside the jug to remove plastered protein powder. Can’t take it apart to get it the blades bottom. Occasionally a few chia seeds still pop up in another batch of some thing so it’s not getting it off the bottom of the blades that well, but it’s food. The noise is remarkably loud and the power  is like my worm-drive circular saw powered up on the kitchen counter (Tim Allen would be impressed).  I felt like I needed a jet pilot’s license to operate it the first week I had it!  I have had it about a month now and make a huge smoothie almost every day and follow the instructions on ramping up/down and using high speed to keep motor cooled. It still gets that hot electrical smell so finally tried making soup running it on high for less than 5.5minutes as instructed to see if that would “break it in” or just break it. -it still has that hot electrical smell but it’s not broken.  Well, sounds like Vitamix warranty is solid and there’s years left on it so hopefully it’ll go away and not a sign that it’s burning up.  It should come with hearing protection, but I’m impressed with the machine other than that.2023  update- Made in China without Quality Control- I had to send it in for repair., It was wanting to walk off the counter at about speed 4. Vitamix took it back quite agreeably - the drive shaft was wobbling and they replaced that and the container.. It doesn’t smell like it’s burning anymore but I don’t think it’s fixed that well because it still runs a little rough from 4 to 7 before you get to high. I called in again…They tell me to just get it to high right away so I do and to use the pusher so I do…. So, why have all those “useless” lower speeds then?"
I bought this unit 18 months ago. The quality of this 5200 blender is inferior to the one I purchased 20 years ago. The housing is not as sturdy. It does not seem to blend as well as I find pieces not blended. But most of all the smell that came off the blender when new was awful. The odor has diminished with time. I was glad it was summer and I could have the windows open. Attached is a picture of a paper towel that I still keep under the Vitamix to catch the fine particles that come off when it is used (the cause of the awful odor?). I am so disappointed as the first one I had was great which is why I bought another one.
"We've used Vitamix benders for more than 10 years now. The first one we had was a workhorse, getting heavy use before being replaced by a succession of models that started having more problems, with much less usage. Problems included the motor slipping as the speed was dialed up, excessive shaking (even under light loads) that had potential to throw the blender off the counter, and the occasional smell of the motor burning (again, under only a modest load). The problems seemed to coincide with Vitamix aggressively discounting the 5200 model, which leads me to suspect they reduced production costs and/or quality control to support the discounts. In any case, our last two 5200 models each lasted less than 2 years each before problems became too severe to continue using. We no longer use Vitamix and can no longer recommend it to others"
"When u make a large vegetable smoothie with  kale ,lettuce, banana flax seeds. It heats up and you have to wait for 15 minutes until it resets its self:( my wife puts it in the fridge for a faster cooling time. We also add water to the top."
The only issue I have is that every use it stops and I am unable to finish what I'm making due to how long it takes to get where it needs to be to stay working and I have to finish with an immersion blender. I'm hoping this is just a trial and error stage for me. Overall I really like it. I have high hopes that after I'm finished going through a trial and error stage it will work more effectively
All I want to do is register my phone so I get my warranty.  I tried all the ways it says to register my machine none of them worked.  I wasted 1/2 hour on the phone. wrote the company but not sure it's their fault.  Amazon this is outrageously bad service. Can you fix it for me?  Terry  Terry Vance PhD.
Smoothie is great. It has issues at high speed and can start to smell like burning plastic.
"This blender did not even blend a single thing before it died. I read such great reviews and had a friend recommend this blender, I was expecting this to be a really great product. I finally bought it, paid over $350 for this thing and it died on the counter as soon as it was turned on while following the startup instructions. Turned the dial slowly from 1 to 2 and smoke came out of the back filling up the kitchen with the smell of burning plastic and other nasty smells then shut off. Is there no product testing ? I could not believe that it died so I waited over an hour and tried turning it on again and it is dead as a door nail. I am hopeful it is a fluke and will try another, but other reviews state similar failures. We will see if another one works better, if not I will not buy from this company again."
"HMM, I owned a 5200 black model from about 7 years ago.  My ex still has it and so I bought this one from amazon.  I have only used it once so far and so I will update this post after a few more uses, but I must say something is different.  Runs fine, but I'm concerned that something has changed as I remember my other unit being more powerful than this.  In addition, the turn dial is definetly a different component as it is not nearly as smooth.  It tends to feel slightly restrictive and the workmanship is absolutely not the same as I remember.  My old unit dial rolled smoothly and just the correct amount of resistance.  I am unaware if all 5200 are the same, or possibly year made, but someone at Vitamix may know of a parts supplier or change and everyone might have the finger to the chin going oops.So again, ill update shortly after I have blended a few more things, but hopefully Vitamix is going for quality and be happy with current profits, cutting costs may have unintended consequences and open door for competitors to further expand this category.  So maybe someone from Vitamix has some answers for future purchasers, but at this price point I am a little concerned.  I posted a picture so people don't think I'm just some critic.  I'd give it a 3 or 4 star if the price was $150.00 cheaper to compensate for the cheaper components, which I assume is what the leadership team at Vitamix thought was best.  And if Vitamix differs, then they better address their Quality Control department.  Cause I'd bet it's one of the two."
"I purchased this blender to replace an older, inexpensive one, and unfortunately, it has been a disappointment. The blades often don’t spin, even though I can hear the motor running. It seems to lose its connection to the blade assembly. On top of that, there are times when the motor doesn’t start at all. Surprisingly, my old cheap blender performed better than this.I had high expectations for Vitamix, given its reputation, but this experience has been frustrating. Based on all the positive reviews, I’m assuming this might be a quality control issue, and now I’ll have to spend time contacting customer service to try to resolve it. At this point, I’m not sure if I’ll want a replacement or if I should explore other brands."
"When I first received this blender I strongly considered returning it. $400+ for a bunch of plastic and rubber is mind blowing, I don't understand how this is justifiable. I figured the company must have earned it's reputation of being the best, so I'd give it a shot. I wish I returned it day 1. The lid and cover don't fit together, you simply strong arm a piece of plastic into a hole carved into a slightly less rigid piece of rubber. The worst part; if you try to mix anything thicker than water, it simply mixes the first inch layer and never disrupts anything above it. Even on the highest setting it will occasionally grab the top 6 inches of liquid and pull it under sending a huge splash into the air and resulting in again spinning only the first inch of fluid. I blend smoothies in this, so nothing but ice, water, a little greek yogurt, some protein powder. Thats it. This absolutely does not serve that purpose. There is no way this would mix a thick soup. I am going to see if there is any way to return this, but I doubt amazon will take it back. I will be buying another blender soon, $400 waste of money, don't make the same mistake. 0/10"
"I’ve owned one of these before and gave it to my dad, but I loved it so much that I decided to get another one. I set it on the counter, added a two cooked sweet potatoes, some liquids, and butter then turned it on the low setting. Almost immediately, I noticed a melting plastic smell. Before I could turn it off, it shut itself off. I tried powering it back on, but it wouldn’t work. We even moved it to different spots in the kitchen to finish blending the sweet potatoes, but it never turned back on. Unfortunately, I’ll have to return it."
"1st, as everyone seems to agree, this blender will turn anything into a smoothie. Nuts, big chunks of apples, mixed greens, prunes, – it just doesn't matter, it quickly turns it all into a nice smoothie. This is a big plus.You need to know, though, that once you get this blender up to speed, it's going to sound like a jet is taking off in your kitchen. I've tried holding my hands over my ears, but it's still much too noisy. I just ordered noise protection earmuffs to wear while this thing is running. I believe you'll do some damage to your hearing if you don't have some protection while this thing is blending.There are so many comments about this being easy to clean, but I find the opposite. When it comes to cleaning the blades, that's true – just put some water in, and a few drops of detergent, and run it for a while. The problem is that's not going to clean the black plastic top, the clear plastic cap, or the inside or outside of the pour spout. When you pour something from this blender, you have to completely remove the black plastic top. You can't rotate or otherwise position that top to allow you to pour anything. Then after you pour your smoothie, you'll find that the spout will need to be cleaned on the inside for sure, and probably some will drip onto the outside. If you don't clean that immediately, it'll dry and you'll have a mess, and again that's not going to be cleaned at all by the normal cleaning process. Too bad none of this can go into the dishwasher."
"I had a 6300 series and loved it until I failed to use the tamping tool to push stuff towards the blades and used a spoon instead.  Yeah, that didn't go well.  So, after destroying the spoon, blender, and the container I thought I'd replace my beloved 6300 with this model since it's what was available.  I'm disappointed.  The first one arrived defective so this is #2.  It doesn't have the power of the 6300.  It seems like it's cheaply built in comparison.  It makes an awful racket when switched on.  Yes, I expected noisy but this is more like noisy I expect it to come flying apart at any minute.  It also still has a burning smell to it when you turn it on.  As someone who is intimately familiar with what burning electronics smells like, this thing smells like burning.  I get the distinct impression Vitamix was trying to cut as much cost out of the product as possible to increase margins.  I went from loving my 6300 so much that when it broke it was a no-brainer, I'm buying Vitamix.  If this one breaks I'll consider all options."
"In case my experience will help others make a decision, I thought I would share my thoughts after using the Vitamix for a few months. I had wanted one for years and had heard from many people the Vitamix“does everything.” I think I took that too literally. I finally decided to spring for the Vitamix after my food processor broke. I have a Nutri Ninja, which I like for smoothies and some other blending, but it is not a food processor, so I felt like it was time to get another tool that would serve as a food processor and blender for when the Nutri Ninja wears out. Believing what I had heard about the Vitamix “doing everything,” I ordered the one.I can tell that it is a high-quality blender, but I have decided that my expectation for food-processing capabilities were unreasonable. I find that it gets stuck fairly easily, even when I follow the instructions about order of items and use of the controls. It does well with quite a bit of liquid, but less well with thicker foods.My biggest disappointment is that food—whether black bean spread, hummus, smoothies or vegan cheesecake—collects under the blades, and I have found it impossible to scrape it out with a rubber spatula. I dislike wasting food, and there seems no way around it.While a nice product that I do use, it doesn’t do what I believed it would, and the food-waste issue was a disappointing surprise. I probably would not buy it again. I would get another Nutri Ninja (when necessary) and an actual food processor."
I purchased this product only to find out it was refurbished and not new. It was making a funny sound that was not loud and seemed to be low in power. My wife’s family has 3 new VM and this one doesn’t work the same. Best to go to vita-mix to purchase and not from this seller. Plus they charged me over $100 to mail the item back so basically I spent $150 for nothing. Save yourself the trouble and go straight to vitamix to purchase. You will be much happier. What a terrible thing to do to charge a customer over $100 for a refurbished product that is sent back to you that you are claiming is brand new!!
"I own about a 10-yr old 5200 (which I absolutely LOVE) that is running strong, but when Black Friday rolled around I decided to pick up a spare in case my old one bites the dust.  Sam's had a 5300 on sale that I tried first.  It overheated and shut off during my first smoothie.  I do make my smoothies thick, but nothing near the consistency of the nut butter that I make in my old 5200!  I could immediately tell that it did not feel as ""heavy duty"" as my old 5200.  The knob felt a bit wonky and the motor seemed weaker.  I gave it another shot the next day and after it shut off again, I returned it.  I then saw that Amazon had the 5200 model on sale for Cyber Monday, and I figured since I already have that exact model- and was well aware of how awesome it is- that I was in the clear.  Long story short, I had the same experience.  I even reached out to Vitamix and asked if there was some kind of difference in the new ones vs the models they made about 10 years ago or if they loosened up on their QA/QC.  They responded that they still have the same high standards, etc. - but I am 100% certain that there are some differences under the hood- and they are not for the better.  This one, unfortunately, will be getting returned too.  I will say that Vitamix still blows all other blender companies out of the water- and that goes for their products and customer service, but I can't justify buying a brand new blender that my 10-year old one outperforms."
"I was soooooo excited to get my Vitamix. I've saved up for ever so I could get this! It's so sleek, unboxing it was like a dream....The first thing I did was I made sauce for my tamales and it pulverized the chili pod skins so well  that there was NO need to strain it! I was like yassssssssss!!!! But unfortunately I've noticed several times while making smoothies that it struggle to bust thru the ice with out a lot of liquid, it just jams up and the motor just seizes. I made coconut butter the other day and I was sure my vitamix could handle the job but I literally had to transfer everything from the Vitamix to my damn Ninja to finish it because it couldnt power thru it hardly at all! Seriously!!!??? Ugh!I've read how ppl make nut butters, purees, smoothies, nut milks and what not in their vitamix but I'm afraid mine will overheat and destroy the motor. I'm so bummed. Like what was the point of even getting this damn thing? I feel foolish.As for a few things, its quiet up until you get it higher in speed,  then it's pretty loud. It's easy to clean but ingredients get jammed up under the blades. Its huge, it doesn't fit under my standard builder height kitchen cabinets but I knew that it wouldn't ahead of time.I'm not sure I'm on the Vitmamix train. Pretty disappointing yall."
"This thing is the worst waste of money I've spent in a LOOOONG time.  A friend of mind had a Vitamix from Costco... it works every time.  This thing... I put soft things in it and it barely does anything.  I've had cucumbers come out whole, lemons come out whole.  Today tried to make a simple smoothie and takes so much start, stop, mix the items inside and go back.  I am using plenty of water, and soft ingrediants.  Maybe I got a dud. But an expensive dud! Wish I could return.  My nutribullet was amazing - I bought this only b/c I didn't have any more nutribullet cups left b/c I kept dropping them or my family wasnt bringing them home... sigh... wish I hadn't spent the money."
"My first Vitamix is 12 or 13 years old and is still working.  I gave it to my daughter a  couple of years ago and go myself a new one.  Two years later it died!  What? Only lasted two years.  Thinking maybe it was just a fluke, I ordered a new Vitamix earlier this week.  Got it today and the very first time I used it it shut down.  I was in the middle of making a smoothie.  The blender shut off like it was overheated.  Only after using it a few minutes.  So, I let it cool down and started again.  Again it shut down after a minute.  This is so bizarre since these things are made for grinding wheat berries into flour and nuts into nut butter but it can't handle a smoothie?  I am bitterly disappointed in Vitamix.  I'm researching my options for a new blender now.  I guess they don't make things the way they used to."
"I have had a 5200 for many years, using it nearly daily to crush ice into slushes. I literally wore it out after more than a decade of heavy use. I ordered a new 5200 and it failed the first time I tried to use it. It shuts itself off after a second or two of use. If you wait a few minutes it will work again. I emailed Vitamix and never received a response. I called and was provided a UPS label to ship it to them for their engineers to look at. Meanwhile I’m out a blender AND the hundreds of dollars I paid for it. They said it could be two weeks. So disappointing, either I got a lemon or the build quality it not what it was 15-20 years ago."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                The Vitamix I received has multiple serious defects despite purchasing it brand new/for medical reasons. Reading through other reviews, there's a pattern of very similar issues that resonate with my experiences:1) Motor/blade would just stop spinning. I’d have to unplug + wait a long while before blending again only for the issue to repeat. Problem has become progressively worse to the point that it often only blends for several seconds at a time before stalling out. This adds up to about several hours to blend a (melted) smoothie…2) The entire blender would start shaking/vibrating to the point it’d spin on my countertops(can easily fall off). Pretty sure the blade is supposed to be the only thing spinning... Gradually increasing the speed(which, you shouldn’t have to do for a quality blender this expensive IMO) hasn’t helped. Now I’m left with a safety hazard that has seriously damaged(left many marks) my counters.3) Malfunctions are often accompanied by awful smells/loud noises. I now use hearing protection whenever I’m using my Vitamix.Really disappointed as my family has used Vitamix for the longest time/never encountered such issues. I've used the tamper every time with this product and am only making simple smoothie blends that are easily/well-tolerated by much cheaper/older/hand-me-down blenders. Would recommend paying close attention for early signs of similar issues if you purchase this . Also, place a protective barrier on the counter to prevent property damage that can be more costly to replace than the blender itself."
"Purchased this Vitamix 5200 to replace the same model we bought in 2008. My husband makes the same smoothie every day and when he used this new unit today it smoked, over heated and the overload protection feature kicked in and shut off. Had to wait 20 minutes for it to cool down enough to finish blending his smoothie. I tried using a few hours later for my daily green smoothie and it did the same thing. Packed it up and it's headed back. Extremely unhappy with this Vitamix model. Our last unit lasted 16 years."
"For the cost of the unit I am sorely disappointed . Many people have told me over the years how they adore their vitamix and its the number one machine to buy. I waited until a good sale came up and finally purchased one. Here are my thoughts about this machine. The biggest flaw- blending cup is NOT attached to unit. It is placed over the base and held in by the gear and the black rubber looking corners. However if you use the tamper included to help get the food blending, the slightest movements cause the cup to wobble from side to side and nearly topple off. I mean, here I am trying to blend a smoothie with frozen fruits and I'm 5'2, the machine is on my kitchen counter, which means I need to raise my arm quite high to use the tamper and shove it around. In the process if I put an ounce of weight to any direction but dead center, I nearly knock the machine off the gear turning the blades. I've had it make funny grinding noises when the cup moves off the gear while blending. Thankfully no damage done yet. So vitamix really needs a way to stabilize the cup and have it attached securely to the base while blending. Also, as per the blending power, I am pleased with the smoothness of my drinks, there is no grittiness whatsoever even when blending seedy items (hate that). But in order to achieve those results I find I do need to be quite busy with the tamper. It doesn't get moving without help. Just ironic because I replaced my magic bullet because it needed to be shaken or more liquid added in order to get the results... this machine needs the same kind of treatment its just five times the price."
"I bought the red version for around $400 in October. Why is the black version $270 now? I don't get that. Different parts? Either way, it's frustrating that I overpaid.Anyway, the blender itself works pretty well for smoothies, but I still get chunks of mostly blueberries near/on the blades. I don't go at full speed because the machine would probably blow up if I did that. If I run it at speed 6 for my smoothies it makes a very loud vibrational noise every few seconds (fruit stuck or air bubble? I don't know for sure) until it goes back to the smoothie comfortably folding over itself again. There are also still lots of seeds, which may not be preventable, but I was really expecting something more smooth than what I'm getting. I may end up trying the higher speeds, but again I am worried because of the very loud noises that it makes on only six. Also, it does make produce a faint burning smell, which the instructions said would dissipate over the first few uses - it hasn't, and I don't even run it for that long; maybe 60-90 seconds at speeds 5 or 6.Overall, I'm fairly pleased as it makes pretty good smoothies, and I haven't had to replace it yet. I was tired of buying 50-60 dollar blenders every couple of months when they burned out."
"The blender is definitely powerful on the highest setting, but the variable control introduces some literal shakiness to the base and it threatens to overheat surprisingly easy when making pesto of all things. It recently shut itself off after a smell of burning plastic and then starts up again the next day. (I was told by a rep to be sure to ramp up quickly to full speed to allow the fan to cool better; a good tip.) The way the jar connects to the base is a little ""loose"" causing the whole unit to rotate somewhat on the counter at full speed. Very bulky to store. I don't get a great vibe with this blender and honestly wish we had just kept our ancient Oster instead, but bought it for a great ""Black Friday"" price last year and there you have it."
Great while it lasted but stopped working in under a year. Spent all that money for no reason.
"I bought this in a hurry when I was traveling back into the US. I didn't pay close attention to the fact it was a refurbished product. I could immediately tell the motor is weaker than the previous 5200 I owned for over 6 years. I wouldn't do this again, I'd buy a brand new Vitamix instead and have more assurance that it would last. I've used the product for the last 6 months and I've already had an incident that the motor overheated and stopped when processing oat flour. I tried to make too much as once. Thankfully it worked again after I waited a few days to use it again. I'm being very cautious with overtaxing this refurbished blender, crossing my fingers and hoping for the best."
"I bought a used blender. My bad. Amazon said like new good condition. First problem when I opened the box was the bottom cover on the blender motor was off showing exposed wiring . I figured out how to put it back together and got it snapped in place. Second issue, used it and smelled like something burning. No problem instructions say when first using you may smell something like a burning smell. After two weeks of daily use, it still smelled like burning. Then while making a smoothie, it quit blending and sounded like it was spinning the motor without the blades turning. Made a very loud grinding noise.Not happy paying as much as I did for a blender and being of poor quality.Maybe if I bought brand new different result. Going to costco and picking up one of theirs."
"We bought our Vitamix around Xmas of last year and it just stopped working this morning. We only use it for smoothies and blending soups, neither of which are terrible strenuous. After all the Vitamix hype, we were excited to upgrade to such a powerful machine, but we've been underwhelmed from the start. The blender just never seemed as powerful as advertised, and definitely had a harder time mixing though a pitcher full of fruit than it should. Plus, it was VERY loud, and shakes so much while blending it seems like the pitcher is going to fly right out of the casing, perhaps damaging the spinning part in the process. You have to hold it with one hand so it doesn't walk itself right off the counter entirely. Even then, we were going to keep it, even though it wasn't as nice as we were expecting.....THEN, this morning, it just didn't seem to have much juice to it, even though i was just pureeing cooked potato-leek soup, which should have been easy for it. I was just on the last of the batch when it seemed to give up and then suddenly shut off and wont turn back on.  There was a slight heated smell coming off the motor, but nothing that would indicate it was about to suddenly burn out, and I wasn't running it on full speed even.I am very disappointed. We've had this blender 4 months and have barely used it. This is totally unacceptable, for the price point, and Vitamix's famous reputation. I don't know if we got a bunk machine, or if Vitamix just isn't the brand it used to be, but I want my money back and I'm getting a Blendtec next time. >:("
"I thought, ""For sure I'll be thrilled with this one! After all, it's almost $500... and Vita-Mix is a killer brand!""  Right?Hmmmm... not so much...For the money, I am simply unimpressed.  I love making veggie smoothies... spinach, kale, cucumber, crushed ice, celery, etc.  I am consistently let-down by how often the 5200 FAILS to chop-up even a simple cucumber.  I'll think I'm done blending, start to pour the drink and suddenly ""PLOP""!... a half cucumber will come dropping out of the blender and into my glass, splashing half my drink all over the counter!  So damn frustrating!!!  Why won't it just BLEND STUFF UP AS PROMISED?Even worse... after about a month of using it, I noticed an awful smell.  After some investigating, I noticed the ""plunger"" point had actually been chewed off by the blades (somehow!)... and now the plunger had veggie juice rotting inside it.  Essentially, I was composting inside the VitaMix plunger!  Well, obviously I had to throw that plunger away, and now I don't have one to use.Overall, it's a good unit.  But for the money, I simply am not impressed.  I still use it to make protein shakes with crushed ice, protein powder, and rice milk.  But I didn't want to pay $485 for a fancy ""protein shake"" mixer.  Sheesh.  Disappointed."
"Unboxing, the first thing we noticed was it was very light weight, unlike past models.  We expected a heavy powerful motor for such a price. We had one in the past and lost it in a house fire.  The motor/drive system/gears grind an chatter, seemingly  disengaging the blade abruptly, excessively loud.  Pretty disappointing. Not made like they used to be. Not worth that price!"
"I have purchased this item and used it 5 times since Oct 11th and it completely stopped working.When the item was received, it seems like it was a returned item since all the items in the box did not have any plastic cover."
"We had a 10 year old Vitamix and felt like it was time for a new one- new kitchen, new house, wanted to celebrate. I stupidly sold our old model and I wish I hadn't. This new model had no difference between variable speed 5 and up. It burns out quickly while making a smoothie, something our old version could handle. We purchased the exact same model just newer. Not happy with the quality. Smoothies aren't as smooth and it burns out almost every time I use it regardless of how thin the stuff is I'm blending. It also vibrates almost off the counter- I'm looking at the warranty info to send it back and get a new base. For the amount of money a Vitamix is, it shouldn't be such poor quality."
"Bought this 01/2021, been using on every other day basis +/-. Definitely better than other previous blenders and a bit less noisy but since the beginning it would not entirely grind pineapple and carrot chunks. Similarly not great to making pesto of most kinds as for some reason will make motor overheat and stop automatically and have to wait long time until cool off.Just OK overall."
I expect a better product for this amount of money. I bought the Asurion they said it is under the manufacturers warranty. I am in the process of contacting them but am frustrated that it seems to be so difficult to contact a human.  I had a vita mix blender before this one that lasted from 2013 to 2023 and expected this one to last just as long since the price nearly tripled. I will happily change my review if the company honors the warranty and replaces the product I just bought last Christmas (2023)
"I have now happily owned 2 Vitamix 5200’s —each worked beautifully for 6-7 years. I purchased a new one —also from the seller “Woot” as another reviewer mentioned —and it is literally unusable and clearly refurbished. Straight out of the box the motor sounded weird as if it were struggling. Then, as soon as I turned it to full power, it emitted the WORST burning plastic odor and proceeded to shut itself off within 2 seconds and refuse to turn back on until the defective motor cooled itself down after 20 minutes. This process went on for quite a few times and my basic smoothie that usually takes 5 minutes to make instead took 45 minutes. By this point the odor was so bad I worried the thing would spark or smoke! At over $400 for a machine with a 7-year warranty, I could not be more disappointed. BUYER BEWARE —save yourself a headache and money and order straight from the company.***UPDATE!I ordered another one from Amazon with Amazon also being listed as the seller and am running into the SAME problem —just like others still. I’ve troubleshooted with everything I can possibly think of. There is clearly a bad batch of blenders circulating. This is NOT Vitamix quality."
"Mine literally broke yesterday… I just got it . I was told these are the best. I couldn’t afford it, got it anyway, and it broke in a month ."
Broke after 4 weeks. It was just over 30 days I  bought the product. Amazon denied to give full refund. Deducted $ 60 restock fee.
"This model is bad! Motor quick in the middle of the first use!! It never even finished my first smoothie! Very disappointed! I had a Vitamix for many years and it finally broke so I ordered this one during the Amazon special, paid $500 and it never worked! Amazon didn’t want to replace due to others having same issues days before I called Amazon…"
"I don't know if I received a bad product but I paid $400 for this top of the line junk and it didn't perform. It took over 20 minutes (3 cycles) to make tomato soup hot. It was only supposed to take 6-7 minutes. I followed the directions to the tee. Also, It couldn't not emulsify homemade vinaigrette salad dressing.  I did better whipping the dressing with a fork in a bowl than this $400 high speed blender. What a joke! It couldn't blend a smooth smoothie with some spinach. Pieces of spinach and grapes in each bite. That's not a smoothie but a liquid salad.  😆 Multiple Fails on each test.I noticed that the bottom of the pitcher shifts often during blending which is probably why it doesn't work right.Amazon refuses to send a replacement. So they tell me that I have to return the blender and repurchase it at the current price which is higher then call back and beg for a price adjustment. You guessed it! Yep, Customer service was unhelpful. Why not send me a new and working non-defective replacement? That would be to helpful I guess.So, I'm returning this and purchasing a new blender from *W@lmart com!Highly disappointed with the blender and Amazon service!"
"Look, this thing is fricking awesome okay? But it's like a gazillion bucks. Why's it gotta be SO expensive? It somehow makes freezing cold smoothies and hot af soups. I don't get it, but it's the real deal. If you buy it, use it Every. Damn. Day. just to bring the cost per use down and into your favor. 10 Stars for amazingness 1 star for price."
"I didn't use this item right away, we were out of town when it arrived, and when I did it was already not working properly. I should have returned it right then, but I didn't and now I'm stuck with a product that isn't working and I'm being asked to pay 88 dollars for a restocking fee for them to ""make an exception"" with me sending it back. The amazon rep on the chat, DID NOT TELL ME THEY WERE GOING TO CHARGE ME for the restock, just said they would make an exception an return it, like it was a big favor. Once I looked more closely at the email I saw this. Now I'm stuck with a 400 dollar blender that doesn't work. Vitamin says contact Amazon. Lesson learned."
"Terrible blender overall. Wanted to get a vitamix as our friends had one and recommended it. We’ve had this model for a year and I can confidently rate this as a do not buy.  It creates air pockets and doesn’t blender fully, our ninja prior to this was much better. It takes a really long time to blend a simple sauce or smoothie. There may be better vitamix models out there but this one is not worth the money"
"I have loved my vitamix blender for 12 years and recommended the 5200 professional grade to everyone. My husband is on hospice and I puree all of his meals.  One day there was a burning smell coming from the blender and an oily substance leaking from it.  I was desperate so I ordered what I thought was an exact replacement.  This Vitamix does not have nearly as much power as my old one and I often have pieces of food left under the blades after I have blended on the highest setting.I plan to see if I can have my old blended refurbished.  ""THEY DON'T MAKE EM' LIKE THEY USED TO!""  orI ""GOT A LEMON!"""
The blender keeps failing on me and it smells like it’s smoking. Not a good look. It has been 40 days now since I purchased and the window of return has closed:(
"I bought a reconditioned Vitamix in 2012 and fell in love. Fast forward to January this year and it finally stopped working. I thought about sending it off to be repaired and then decided to treat myself to a new one. What a mistake! Almost from the beginning, this blender would not mix like the old one did. The motor has a burning smell and it does not move the ingredients. You have to use the tamper and push them down. I have had to start making my smoothies in stages. This morning it overheated when I added a BANANA to a totally liquified smoothie and shut off. This was a big purchase for me and I’m just sick about it."
"I've never written a review on Amazon but I want to save others from making the same mistake. I was so excited about purchasing this and so disappointed after it broke not once, but twice. I wasn't blending rocks, I was just making regular smoothies and ice cream in this (as is advertised), and it broke.I called Vitamix customer service, who gaslighted me into thinking it was my fault but after 40 minutes on the phone with them finally agreed to have me send it in. They told me the blade was broken and sent it back to me. Great. A couple months later, it breaks again. I don't have the patience to get on the phone with them again.Don't buy this, save your money. My little $70 cheap Nutribullet works better than this."
This blender is not the quality we are used to with Vitamix.  We had our last blender for 12 years and worked great until it didn't.  This new one is nothing like the old one.  Very loud motor! Constant smell of burning oil. Vibrates right off the counter. Takes a long time to blend food.  It's awful. $400 down the drain!
"I bought this vitamix for my daughter-in-law for Christmas and each time she used it it froze up and shut itself off. She was unable to restart the unit for a number of hours. Today, using it for just the fifth time since Christmas,she was pureeing mango with water and the unit burned itself out completely. It smoked up the house and will not turn back on. I am seeking a full refund or replacement with a different unit from Vitamix. Amazon only warrants the product for 30 days. I would not recommend buying this small based Vitamix as I have a larger unit and has worked perfectly for 5 years."
Doesn't seem to be as strong as our old one we had for 15 years which is the same model.
I have attempted to make 3 smoothies with this. It overheats after 45 seconds on low. It takes 20 minutes to cool down. We have followed the recipes and instructions. Very disappointed that we are unable to use it.
"Seriously having issues with customer service and quality control.First of all this thing jumps around with simple smoothie ingredients in it. I mean jumps around like would knock itself over! I literally have to lean on the top to keep it from moving and it still scoots! Doesn’t do this with just water but even after it has mixed the smoothie ingredients it’s still jumping.Second the black feet leave stain marks on my white countertop from all the jumping. I mean hard to get off marks. Like it has cheap low quality shoes on.Third, I don’t know if this is a safety mechanism or not (because vitamix won’t return emails) but the blade seems to stop spinning when in the initial blending phase. After tamping a bit it fires up again. I know they can create a pocket and spin free but it literally seems to bog down and that’s with precrushed ice. So I’m thinking surely I got a lemon here and there is no way they are all like this or vitamix wouldn’t have this good of a reputation. Especially with their horrible customer service.Note: Amazon is amazing with customer service and responded immediately and I guess I will be forced to send this jumping blender back."
"The 5200 blender was brand new and it started off really strong, it was really living up to the Vitamix hype everyone knows about. The blender was relatively quiet too. It was only the 4th time using the 5200 when it seemed to just flat out die, it was only kale greens! So maybe I got a dud."
"I got this one because of the claims that it could make hot blended soups, and then clean up easily. I ended up with a tepid soup that was terribly bland (using the cream of asparagus soup recipe from the included recipe book).  When I tried to do the ""self clean"", I found that it didn't. Although my soup didn't sit for more than a few minutes after it was made, I still ended up having to scrub the inside of the blender (being extra careful to not cut myself) to get the sides clean enough.Also, this thing is HUGE!I had an old blender that was more reasonably sized that I donated in anticipation of this new wonder-blender.  Everything but the base could be disassembled and cleaned in the dishwasher. I'm kicking myself now."
"I owned one of these back in the day when they were made with quality products.It lasted for decades. It was stolen from my home during hurricane Katrina.This new one has the same model number, so it should be built with the same products.It is not.It is weak because it keeps over heating, blends too loud, trembles like an earth quake, which agitates anyone with anxiety, then it turns off and can not be used until it colds down and does the same thing over again."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It does not makes smoothies. Keeps shutting off. Seller absolutely refuses to give more than a 50% refund. I can only hope Amazon can resolve this for me.
"I ordered this because I needed a new blender for smoothies/sorbets and I definitely wanted to buy an American made product even if it cost a little more.  I tried it out with sorbet ingredients and it worked fine but could not get all of the mix from under the blades.  The suggested method of washing is to put a drop of detergent in with water and give it a whirl but then you lose most of what you have blended.  It is incredibly noisy even on the low setting.  It didn't meet my needs so returned it.After trying a few more models...long story I found the Nutra Ninja does a good job...still needs ear plugs but I love the single serve cups.  May not last as long, but that will be determined."
"I followed their self cleaning instructions three times (fill up halfway with warm water, add a couple drops of dish soap, turn on machine to variable + 1, crank to 10 and turn it on high, run on high for 30-60 seconds). I did this THREE TIMES in a row and it did not get the almond butter out from under the blades. The blade base is factory sealed so you can't remove it, it's actually impossible to clean effectively. All of my smoothies use a nut butter of some kind so I am returning."
"Pro-powerful-high capacity containerCon-impossible to disassemble for thorough cleaning without the optional $10 wrench-too big to slide on countertop under cabinets above-quite loud, but you won’t be running it for 30 minutes-heavy clunky design...heavy rubber lid looks industrial-not easy to disassemble and clean-requires extra cost optional “wrench” to disassemble and clean thoroughly: really? Yes.It replaces a Waring blender from the 1950’s that’s still working fine at our summer place. If this V max lasts that long I’ll be pleased. The old one disassembled by hand to clean; V max requires an optional extra cost wrench. That’s a pretty strong negative. And the blades do collect gunk...the cleaning instructions in the manual (fill container warm water, few drops soap, let sit, run, etc) simply are ineffective. You gotta take it apart to clean it.But it blends fast.Have now had it two years. Wasn’t surprised that the bottom area of the blade had  considerable accumulated food after only three more recent uses.  Gotta disassemble to clean it properly, and gotta buy their extra cost wrench to disassemble it. Poor design that way compared to the Waring and Osterizer we have...from the 1950’s."
"Vitamix is very strong and reliable product, but this seller sold me refurbished as new one! It wasn’t working properly from my he beginning and now stoped all together. Purchesed in March 2024"
"OMG - why wasn't this even mentioned?!The cleaning procedure is RIDICULOUS.  It's a blender - not guddamn surgical tools!  Why is this not dishwasher safe??!  The price does not justify this.  The ridges inside the blender would make it a near nightmare to even hand clean.  I'm sure the plastic will scratch if you tried using a brush or sponge...so I won't even try.PROS:  Very powerful-first blender to actually annihilate chia seeds; Quality plastics usedCONS:  NOT DISHWASHER SAFE - making cleaning an absolute chore; Even following cleaning recommendations per company- the ridges inside blender do not come clean from thick mixtures like peanut butter, etc.  Soaking for 4 hours is NOT practical for most human beings; EXPEN$IVE."
"I loved this blender until the motor died less than 2 years after purchase. My Ninja I had for years before this worked just as well, for less and lasted longer. Don't waste your money."
"Disappointed with the 5200 Blender.Purchased the 4500 Vitamix in the late 90's and it just now stop working.  This newer model has terrible blending/juicing power.  Not sure what the problem is but I wish I would have purchased the 4500 Vitamix again.  Should have left it alone Vitamix.  It was perfect before.  Sometimes these company's need to stop trying to save a penny.  Sorry, not happy."
"Product arrived defective, I then placed an order for a replacement and the second one also arrived in the same condition. Are there no Quality checks anymore? Then the return process with Amazon takes a month to get your money back."
Motor has a bad smell when turning on. Smells like oil burning inside the motor.  Not sure how to correct.
"Our previous model lasted many years but finally died. We happily replaced it with the same model number. Looks identical but right out of the box the motor was much lighter. The new one overheats easily, causing it to shut down. Very disappointing."
I’ve tried to like this blender and have for quite a while. I’ve tried adding the products to the blender how the instruction book recommended but it has a lot of issues. It has overheated a few times or sometimes the blades just won’t spin or sometimes it just doesn’t blend everything together properly.
"It functions very well.  However if you are using it at highest level 'regularly', be sure to wear ear plugs.  It did damage my ears.  I ended up at an ear doctor."
Product broke after one month and was outside of Amazon Return policy.
"3rd time I used, set the speed to 5 and started running the blender within a few mins there was a burning smell and a few mins later the blender stopped... had to switch off for 30 mins and unplug for another 30 mins. then had to run for 2 mins and switch off for 10 mins. Customer support does answer promptly, tells you to run at a higher speed, which will boil the batter at the bottom. or add more liquid.cannot return... not happy."
"It's an ok blender, but not worth the cost imho. Really just old technology w/ a huge motor. Had a ninja b4 and honestly liked it better. This will offer a slightly smoother texture, but it's not worth the downsides. It vibrates so hard @ times it rotates on the counter, bad smells from the motor(still after 100+ uses), constant battle to get stuff to drop. The build quality is excellent though and does well with recipes similar to orange julius consistency or thinner. The ninja however is much more versatile, able to do much of what a processor could do in addition to blending."
This has been crappy since day one. We have to add soooo much liquid because it’s so weak. Terrible blend power. VERY DISAPPOINTED
"I laid out some serious cash for this pro level blender. I started a second career in culinary and all of the kitchens have Vitamix 5200 and they are NOT treated gently, far from it! I make dinner for my family on Sunday, make margaritas, and different dishes. When I used this machine I sensed the motor struggling for an instance; I’m also a DIY woodworker and use power tools almost exclusively, so I know when an electric/electronic is working well.Today, I made black refried beans, I put two cups of cooked beans and one cup of cooking liquid in my Vitamix 5200 and in a few minutes the motor stopped, the “overload” switch kicked in. I waited a few minutes and turned the machine turned On. I added another cup of beans and one cup of cooking liquid.The machine produced a “sweet” odor and died. It won’t turn at any speed.I had to finish my recipe by hand and have endure Vitamix CSR; stay tuned.Just discovered that Amazon sells the “home user” VitaMix not the commercial level machine.I am so disgusted with Amazon and their marketing scams!"
I paid that much money to get something good But less than a month it started doing very bad shake with weird sound! Now I’m posting this and I have a pain in my stomach!!
"This is my second Vitamex blender. I use it for only one thing - to make a blended dessert with cottage cheese, frozen fruit and a couple of other ingredients. Or at least I try to. I bought a mixer several years ago (I'm not sure if it was from Amazon or somewhere else.) I didn't use it for a long time but recently began using it for my frozen dessert. It shuts down every single time about halfway through the process. Oh well, I thought, maybe I just got a dud, so bought another one (this time fromAmazon) because Vitamix has such a good reputation. I'm sorry I did, because the new one does exactly the same thing. Halfway through the blending process it just shuts down. I don't have time to wait an indeterminate amount fo time for it to cool down, so here I sit eating lumpy cottage cheese and fruit. Yuck."
"I am sad to report that this has not been the most favorable experience. I had to return the first Vitamix that I ordered, as it was defective. This is my second go round and although I am a  long time  Vitamix devotee-(I purchased my first Vitamix 7 years ago) this one is sadly lacking in power and has problems blending a simple morning smoothie.  Granted they have changed the design of the handle which makes it easier to keep clean but it is very loud (louder than my first) and not nearly as powerful."
"Vitamin was highly recommended by friends and the internet so I bought one without looking closely at the description (although to be honest, the descriptions on blenders are often vague on this).  When we got it, it had a plastic container (the part that holds your food!).  This was hugely disappointing.  All that money (Vitamin blenders are not cheap) only to get a plastic main container.  There are a number of blenders available with glass, so it's not something that can't be done, it's just Vitamin chose not to and yet still charge a very premium price.  We looked for glass containers for the blender and only found a metal one, for yet another 190 dollars.  So, we returned it and will get a blender with a glass container.  So sad but we are exposed to enough plastic, want to avoid it where we can."
The blender spins. This is the second Vitamix product we've tried and they both started spinning and shaking while blending.
"Out of the box the blender stopped working while making smoothies.  Runs for a minute or two and then completely stops. Tried again the next day and same thing, runs for a minute or two and then stops. $450 super disappointing, several other reviews with same issue so this is clearly a product defect."
"I decided to invest in a Vitamix blender and have been extremely disappointed with what I suspect is a defective model.  Every time I use it it smells like burning electronics and overheats for the smallest lightest loads.  For the money I spent, I should be able to return it, but am told that the best they can do is ""troubleshoot"" since it is about a week and a half past the return window.  It was bought before the holidays, and not used until December.  My mistake, but from everything I'd heard, Vitamix was a superior blender and I didn't think it would be an issue to test it earlier.  Very, very disappointed in this product and feel like I've just thrown over $400 out the window."
"This thing is very powerful but also very loud and there appear to be some issues with the unit we purchased.The first thing we noticed besides the ear piercing whine when turned up to full speed, which by the way is what the DVD says to do for everything you make, was the awful burning rubber smell.The other day, it did not even finish a smoothie before it just quit and would not turn back on, like it over heated or something. We were left with a half made smoothie. It did come back on the next day and did not repeat the problem, but for this money I have got to think something may be wrong with this unit.Never having one before, we had no idea what to expect. Is anyone else having these same issues? (loud, burning rubber smell)Thus far, we just use it to make smoothies."
"Best, smoothest smoothies I ever made.Here is why I returned the blender:1.  When initially cleaning it, the soapy water started dripping out of around the lid - the seal of the lid is the worst I ever saw in a blender.2.  First smoothie - nothing blended until I used the tamper - than is worked great.3.  Second smoothie - same thing; however, when I was using the tamper, the blender lifted a little off of the base.  First I head a crazy loud noise, then I smelled burning (maybe just the friction of a loose container to base).  Then, I think it only blended when I pressed the container a certain way.  I found a small piece of metal piece under the container and some metal flakes.Bottom line - If the lid does not seal tight and the container does not attached tightly to the base, I don't want it, regardless of how good the smoothies were."
"I was looking to pay a premium price to get the best blender available.  Something to last me the next ten to twenty years.  Upon opening the box, my first impression wasn't great.  Cheap Styrofoam packing.  No damage to the blender, but it didn't look ""new"" either.  Almost like a refurbish.  The bits of foam get in the cracks of the blender, so you're given a nice little project to sort that out.  The plastic components feel cheap, albeit functional.  Per the dimensions, it is really big, and it does look startling large and industrial in a kitchen.  It's maiden voyage was to whip up my go-to smoothie, and it was an epic fail.  I like the controls, and the motor is reasonably quiet.  But after quite a lot of blending, I was still left with frozen strawberry bits in my smoothie.  My humble Osterizer far outperforms it in this task.  Not impressed.  Sending it back."
"Honestly, I don't understand what the craze is about Vitamix. I bought one cause I wanted a nice, high quality blender. I feel like I bought a overpriced, underdeveloped, and poorly designed machine. You're better off buying a Ninja. Atleast the you won't spend an absurd amount of money for something that doesn't perform much better than a Ninja. For the record I've never even owned one but I've used one multiple times.Maybe I'm over reacting but I feel like I'm being pretty fair. I've given it multiple chances, and it just falls short everytime. I always find myself trying to get my food out of the jar longer than I would like and letting to much go-to waste.The damn thing is incredibly loud, shakes all over the place, gets extremely hot if your using it for long intervals. By long I mean more than a couple minutes.If I could return it I would, but unfortunately I kept giving it the benefit of the doubt and am now out of my return window. Which is my own fault.So all in all. I would not recommend this blender. It's overpriced, overpraised, and quite frankly not worth owning in my opinion. I don't even want to give it away to someone honestly. Craigslist it is."
"So many outstanding reviews but the motor in this one runs for 1 second only and shuts off, even straight out of the box. Everything about this model feels cheap: shiny black plastic body attracted a layer of dust in the 20 minutes it was out of the box along with showing every fingerprint. Knob and switches have a flimsy feel, cord storage fingers are very thin plastic that look like they will break after 3 times bending them out of the way. Cord storage and cord length didn't match so couldn't tuck the plug into the storage spot. I mean really, a blender for this price, with this many drawbacks, and DOA on top of it?The black model was $100 less than the other colors, maybe it was known to be defective but was not labeled as anything but new."
"I find that the motor quits in mid-cycle constantly. I have a different blender which I can no longer locate, at our other property which is remarkable its non-stop power and mixing power that I have not been able to find anywhere else. It's too bad, because the price of the Vitamix inclines one to believe that it should work flawlessly.It DOES clean well. A drop of soap and some water, plug it in and let it go to town. But, any blender could do that, me thinks."
It's way too loud and I was not able to make a smooth paste how ever times I tired 😫.. I have used it for almost a month now trying for different food items.. it's never a smooth paste and if u try to run it on higher settings hoping to get fine paste it's way too loud I am afraid we or children can get hearing problems...
"Bought this blender to replace an 6 year old Oster blender, and I am so disappointed with it. The Oster had enough power to mix chicken soup (no bones) with a powder without overheating and shutting itself off every time. I bought this last November, and have used it no more than 10 or 12 times, of which, five times have overheated."
"We bought our vitamix on Nov 2017 and we were very happy with it until today when it overheated. Very disappointed and will be calling vitamix to find out how we can send it for repair. We use our vitamix to make smoothies on a regular basis as my family had been vegan/vegetarian for the last 7 yrs. Other than smoothies we used the blender lately to make our homemade hummus and the result is a smooth and perfectly delicious hummus, better than market bought hummus."
We finally made the splurge after our Nutribullet died a couple of months ago. This blender is fine but I do not understand all the hype I have heard about it for the past 10 years. Our Nutribullet was more powerful for smoothies and my old Cuisinart food processor is way better for everything else. I just hope it last indefinitely for the expensive price.
"When you pay nearly $500 for a blender, you expect it to be amazing.  Well, I was not amazed.  For starters, I was very surprised that it comes with a plastic, NOT glass, carafe.  Second, it is rather noisy.  Third, it cavitates way to easily.It is a great blender?  Of course it is.  I mean, it beats the heck out of my last $40 blender from Target.  But is it worth nearly $500?  I don't think so.  Sorry Vitamix, I wanted to love you, but you disappointed me."
For a “premium “ product it can’t handle the simplest of tasks.
"Annoyed. I bought this half of on prime day. The first blender did not work properly. Sent for a replacement. Got the replacement just now, and attached are pictures. A used and dirty blender. Here we go with a third replacement. The first one did not blend well. So far not impressed by this $500 blender. If the third one comes in used, and not working well again that is it for me and vitamix. And on that note whoever is accepting these returns without checking product, shame on you."
"I have a Vitamix at home that I love and had wanted another one to have at work. This one arrived and is so light and flimsy, you can’t even make a smoothie or salad dressing without it moving across the counter. The first time I tried to make a pesto in this model, I almost burned out the engine. Something as simple and soft as a few roasted peppers, garlic, walnuts and olive oil was way too much for it, abd brought it to smoking within a minute.  The 15 year old blender that it replaced had more power, was quieter, and did the job faster. I kept having to push the contents down, add more oil, remote lid and circulate contents, in order to FINALLY get a smooth puree. This vitamix is an overpriced piece of junk that I would like to return but unfortunately I threw away the box upon receipt because I had expected it to be so great, like my other vitamix experience! SO disappointing!!!!"
"I have given this blender 6 months but this vitamix blender is not the best quality. When I try to blend any batters or even a slightly thicker smoothie the motor starts to burn. We can smell a horrible burning rubber smell coming from the blender. We no longer can use the ""high"" setting because of the burning. If you happen to hit the ratio of liquid to food just right it does blend well. This model is not at all easy to clean. It is too tall."
Had to contact custom supportive and they were responsive. Had my previous nutribullet for ten years. This one came with less and isn’t as sharp. It is much more quiet than my previous version. If you’re on the fence I’d try something else. Not as good as the original
"It regularly will not blend all of the Frozen fruits and vegetables I have in there no matter how long I do it for, take it off and shake it around put it back on I end up having a smoothie with consistency I don't like because there's half frozen banana in they're still. One of the little prongs that goes into lock it so it can blend without holding it down broke off in the first couple weeks through completely normal use.Also really don't like how there's no measurements or markers on the side of the cup.  Having said that I use it every damn morning and it does what I need it to do."
Smaller than anticipated .
"Leaving 3 stars as that represents the amount of -months- this worked for us. Went and bought this nutribullet due to all the good reviews and it sounded promising with longevity. However, we find ourselves unable to start our nutribullet at all. We have restarted, plugged in different outlets, etc. and it seems to be completely dead. I was made aware that it may have been producing some subtle smoke earlier on in the week. I was curious to know if there have been any similar issues that others may have experienced with this product, or if there were any recalls. What an unfortunate experience for us."
"It worked great until stopped one year later.  My recommendation:  buy it,  but with the extended guarantee."
"I bought the Nutribullet 600watt over a week ago, because it seemed to be all the rage.  It was my first smoothie maker.  I found it to be frustrating in many respects.  After watching videos of lawsuits about exploding Nutribullets, I decided to research other smoothie makers and came across the Ninja Foodi Smoothie bowl maker.I got the Ninja last night and made a smoothie bowl (without having to dismount and shake it several times like the Bullet).  What a joy it was!!  It was very smooth...had a wonderful mouth-feel!  This morning, I made my regular smoothie, and wow!  How much more convenient it was!!  It was a smooth, easy, and painless process all the way!  Thoughtfully designed in every aspect and very ergonomic!Pros of the Ninja over the Nutribullet:1. I didn't have to keep my distance in fear of it exploding.  That was stressful, which worked against a peaceful mindset needed for a healthy lifestyle.2. I didn't have to run it several times to make it smooth.3.  I like the ease of unscrewing the top because the ring is slightly cushy and has notches, making it easier on the fingers to grip, instead of the smooth top that the Bullet has, which was always a strained effort, making my fingers hurt (I don't have arthritis)!4.  Love the built-in tamper for the smoothie bowl!5.  Love that it has different settings for more than just one function.6.  The containers are taller and narrower than the Bullet, so it fits into my hand better for turning it to dismount it from the base.7.  The threading for the blade attachment is located on the inside of the cup, rather than on the outside, so there is no need for a lip-ring (another thing to keep up with).  That feature also keeps the smoothie from oozing out into the base (like the bullet did) when I put it back on the base to add ingredients to improve flavor.8.  Love that I can just walk away and let it do its thing for smoothies, because it will turn off automatically when it senses that the ingredients have been finely blended.Yes, the Ninja is louder than the Bullet, but it is twice as powerful...1200 watts.  But, there are so many more pros to the Ninja, that I will be returning this Bullet.  The Bullet may have been the best thing when it first came out years ago, but the Ninja took their idea and improved on all the problematic areas."
I needed a new blender & wanted one that is more compact. Unfortunately this just doesn’t do the best job blending “larger” ingredients such as half of a frozen banana or a bigger ice cub. It is portable though so that will be nice.
"Works well so far, but bummed it didn’t include all the accessories it was supposed to (lid and smaller cup)"
Me gusto
I loved how this blender was working until one day the lid got stuck for two days!! So much pressure built up inside of it. (& no I didn’t over pack it!!!)
I have always loved Nutrabullets. I have had several thru the years. I have never bought one that has a burning smell like plastic burning. It mixed great though.
"I received my product March 25, 2024 started using it in May 2024 ..it crashed in October 2024, so I found a video to help get it going… The video was a success and my nutribullet started working again but last night November 2024 I was making a smoothie and i started smelling burnt rubber, it started slowing down in the middle of making my smoothie… all of a sudden it stopped.. The life of this device was only 8 months.. Now I have to find something better or buy another one because no one cares."
"I love this device - having the blades not in the container is great, makes cleanup easy and this device is easy to use and works great... except it has a major design flaw. The part with the blades is designed to be a replaceable part, such that over time the seal on it will wear out, as will the bearings, etc - this in itself is a perfectly reasonable design and they make more money over time - fine.Except that my package, out of the box - literally the first time I used it, the seal came out. I just assumed this was an annoyance (they are a pain to get back in, and you need to be careful not to get cut) and kept doing it for 20+ more uses and every time it came out (once it comes out, it is basically always going to).Finally I looked online how to do it more easily, figuring there is some trick - but no - online they explicitly  say do not try to reseat the seal, instead buy a whole new blade assembly (they are not cheap). This is fine if every 6-12 months you needed to under high use - but after the first use? Are you kidding me?It notes not to use it overloaded or for too long - short bursts of 30s or less and then let it cool. I was blending: skim milk and protein powder - nothing strenuous on the system. It took 5-10s and was done, probably less. There is no reason this should happen.So I reached out to their customer support and they hemmed and hawed and made it sound like it was my fault (HOW?!) and said begrudgingly that they would replace it this one time under warranty, but only once. I had to pay $5 for shipping and it showed up a few days later.I used the new one three times - all good - phew. And on the fourth time, happened again! Are you kidding me?! (still just making quick protein shakes - it should not stress this thing in the slightest)So I am done. I will throw this thing in the trash and never buy another product of theirs again. There is a design flaw and their customer service are jerks for implying that somehow this is my doing.It is a shame - because this product could be great. I have a friend who has the smaller one and has no issues with it - but this particular unit has a design flaw (you can see other reviews mention it too)."
"When it's blending, there is a burning smell coming from the unit. I need a replacement after 3yrs."
"So, I absolutely loved this thing.... at first. It does what it says--it blends. And it's supposedly easy to clean.The issue is the gasket. It's ""factory sealed"" in the the blade housing. This would be great, except factory sealed doesn't mean nothing gets under it. The nature of what gets blended is that it's liquid, and unless something is air tight, liquid goes where it wants. I didn't notice at first, I just trusted that washing the blade assembly was enough.I wash by hand as I don't have a dishwasher, so one day I smelled something pretty bad. Upon inspection, I realized there was black stuff coming out from under the gasket, and after struggling to remove it, I was disgusted. I wish I'd taken pictures. Obviously, it had been building up, and who knows how long it had been getting in my smoothies. And I'd only been using the machine a couple months.I washed the gasket, which still stunk anyway (I ended up replacing it), and had to use ingenuity to get all the nooks and crannies cleaned in the housing around the blade. I put it back together, and it worked fine, no leaks, for another blending session.The problem became that I got tired of wrestling with the gasket every time I used the machine so I could clean it. It's incredibly hard to remove because it's not meant to be removed. The company recommends replacing the whole blade fixture if the gasket comes out. But it gets gross, so you need to clean it.I eventually gave up and threw the whole thing out. I didn't feel right giving it to someone or donating it considering how disgusting it gets.I'm sad because other than that, I really thought it was a good machine. If the design was changed so you can take the blade assembly apart to clean it, like a regular blender, I'd buy a new one. Until then, I guess if I want a smoothie bad enough, I'll drag out the big blender. Suffice it to say, I don't have smoothies very often anymore."
"I've owned this product for about 2 weeks, and I've used it maybe a handful of times since.  It was great until the rubber gasket fell off and caused leaking.  We finally got it back over the blade, and it seems to be staying on so far.But I'm definitely disappointed as I was hoping for a reliable product after battling with the Blend Jet for ages.  Hopefully the gasket stays in place long-term because it really does make awesome shakes when it works properly!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            To say I’m disappointed is an understatement, they have really cheaped out on the newer Version of this blender.  It is my third time I have purchased, and this one is completely different, my older blades and cups, no longer work, and it is made a lot lighter and cheaper. The blades do not like going on the cup, it’s a chore!"
This one last 4 months it smell like smoke when I turn it on.  My first of purchase  of the product last close  to to five years.
"Made watermelon puree and liquid leaks all over the counter. Debating on returning it. It works, but...  Hate for it to end up in the landfill"
"I love my bullet. I had one for many years and it finally died. So I ordered another. I don’t use it often but the few times I did use it, it worked just fine. Yesterday I went to use it and it doesn’t turn on at all."
"Overall I really like this blender and make smoothies almost daily but the rubber gasket at the bottom of the blade piece comes off pretty much every time i use it. So this means i need to make sure it's all clean and dry and then struggle to replace it. So if my smoothie isnt quite right/i forgot to add something, i have to deal with the mess of cleaning /replacing it to re-blend it. Also, recently i hear liquid trapped in the bottom part of the blade piece and when i shake it dirty water comes out - gross! I really dont want any bacteria with my smoothie thank you.Yes, you can order replacements ($) etc but from everything I've read this is a VERY COMMON problem and will keep happening, it's just a major design flaw they have not fixed.Such a bummer because otherwise i really like this blender."
"Happy with the product, but this was shipped unsecured in the box. The blender had obviously signs of use, and it was missing the grab-n-go lid thing and the recipe book, and also no instruction booklet, etc. Clearly used. When I purchased this it was not listed as a used item, but they have no changed the listing to 'used', however they still display items that are not included (at least in my package!).So, buyer be advised!"
This blender didn't even last a year! The seal never stayed on and the lid would slowly unscrew while blending causing quite the mess. The blades eventually became dull and pieces of fruit would never blend. The final straw was when the nutribullet started smoking while I was blending. I just threw the blender out. Don't waste your money.
"After 5 months of use, well probably 20 times and it no longer works.  Doesn’t come on.  Very disappointed with this product based on very little use."
"This blender is powerful, it blends very well.  However, it is sometimes difficult to clean between the blade seal.  And, when washed it traps water in the seal of the blade.  Disgusting to have dish water dripping out while you're trying to make a smoothie."
"Rubber O-ring popped out of the blade attachment on the 2nd use. It seems to get suctioned out every time I blend something. I can get it back in with some effort. Otherwise, I am pretty happy with the product so far. Blends without leaving any chunks."
"The description indicates it includes an additional short cup with a lid. It does not. Even the photo on the box shows a short cup with lid. Not sure what's going on here, but buyer beware.Otherwise, it works great!"
"I’ve had a nutribullet in the past with no problems. This time around it seems like it’s made from more delicate parts. It breaks easily, as you can see from the photo 2/3 of the small anchors have broken."
"This is the third Nutribullet I have bought since December 2022. I do not over fill the cup, and I blend for a maximum of 30 seconds on rare occasions, but still the two previous units broke. I use it everyday since, and it works really well when it works. To me, the Nutribullet is cheap enough to keep replacing when it breaks."
"I purchased a new nutribullet because my old one started to smell like it was going to catch on fire. When it was new it use to smell like smoke, but this was stronger even after replacing the carbon motor brushes.The new one is not as strong as the old, meaning my frozen smoothies take about 3x longer to blend and there are still large bits of frozen fruit.The old and replacement cups would not fit with the new blade tops and cups. You can use the old blades and cups with the new blender but be careful, it likes to open a bit and drip out. I hate this part more than it taking 3x longer to use. I decided to keep this because I need my blender, but will keep trying to fix the old one.Update May 22, 2024:  it started to smell like smoke more than normal then it turned off while in use. I never had a NutriBullet turn itself off before. Past the return date so I contacted the company. I will update regarding customer service outcome."
"The blender does a good enough job blending (it sometimes gets stuck when I making bigger smoothies), but the let down of this product is that 75% of the time I use it it makes an incredibly loud noise that hurts my ears. I started wearing my noise cancelling headphones every time I use the blender just for the sake of not damaging my ears."
Rubber seal broke within the first month and will not stay back in place. Pretty messy to use now.
"I have used this companies blender for more than 10 years for the same thing, mixing protein shakes.  That's it.  Nothing that stresses the blender.  Just water or coffee and protein powder.  Out of nowhere the last one I had decided to ""lose it's seal"" somehow and launch my shake all across my kitchen.  So, I figured this one was a few years old so it was time to replace it.New blender, first use out of the box for the same protein shake, SAME result!  Shake everywhere!  I never had this issue in more than 10 years of use.Not sure what is different now, but I will NOT be buying one of these type of blenders again.  Back to the old style blender.  Sending this back immediately!"
"Yes it is a 24oz cup but you can not make a 24 oz drink. While most of the protein shakes that I’ve previously prepared require two scoops of protein powder , you are only able to use one scoop per preparation in this product.  I end up needing to make two preps to make one protein drink. I end up needing to use a separate cup so the utilization of the described drink cup is a bit misleading.Bottom line am I happy with this product-No. I wish I had purchased a blender. This item requires extra steps, extra prep and frankly I’m not impressed."
We had a nutribullet for 4 years before it stopped working prior to purchasing this.  4 years…it had a good run.  This one stopped working in less than a year.  We don’t abuse it.  We keep it clean.  Used once or twice a week.  Went through all trouble shooting…nothing.  Time to find another manufacturer/product
I’ve had one of these blenders before and it’s pretty good for a small one but this one arrived and the box looked a little wonky but thought nothing of it. Once I opened it I realized I had been sold a second hand blender that I paid full price for. All the edges and grooves have food in them. Kinda gross lol
I use the Nutribullet daily.The first one lasted roughly 1.5 years… it stopped working. I bought the second one to replace the first in March of 2024. This one lasted 6.5 months… it won’t stop running unless I unplug it.I’m reading the warranty on this product is a year.How do I get the warrant replacement for it?
"After 5 months of use the unit would not turn on.  Two of the little switches were very stuck.  I suspect something liquid being blended overflowed onto the switch tabs.  That is very easy to do.  That should have been made so that it could be cleaned.  As designed it cannot be cleaned as it is a sealed unit.  I could not return through Amazon as it is ""beyond 30 days"".  Amazon returns should coincide with the manufacturer's warranty.  So we called the manufacturer's warranty line and they could offer no help other than return it at our cost for $11.00 and they would send another base and motor assembly.  Of course there have been no design changes so it probably would happen again.  I finally freed up the switches by using Kroil on each of the three.  I'm not sure how long that will last.  I would never by this product or anything from Nutribullet again."
"It makes a great smoothie, but it leaks.  Very frustrating.  If you screw it on too tight it leaks.  If you don't screw it on tight enough it leaks.  I'm about 50:50 on getting it tight just right so it doesn't leak.  Disappointing engineering design.  There are all sorts of other products out there that have liquid proof screw on connections that have a positive stop or alignment marker to show you when it is tight.  Nurtibullet, you can do better.  Please fix this in your design and offer a retrofit deal to your existing customers."
I'm really upset about this - I had one of these for years and only replaced it back in February. I don't know what's happened but the quality has declined significantly.  Not long after I got it (but too late to return it) it began blending so weakly that there were chunks of greens and fruits left in my smoothie getting stuck in my straw (yum!). I tried not filling it so full and it helped a bit but now it's just getting worse and I'm going to have to buy a new one after only having this one for 6 months.
"I am not being dramatic when I say this is my 4th NutriBullet in less than a year!!!  I make smoothies very regularly and I love the fact that these are a personal blender, and they are not bulky and take up a lot of space…and it works great at first, but it stops working so quickly!!  The area where you place the lid of the blender to blend, wears out so quickly. It’s not been worth the money I’ve spent. I need something that will work long term for someone who makes smoothies quite regularly. I couldn’t with a good conscience recommend a personal NutriBullet blender. The colors are so beautiful and as I mentioned these blenders are compact and easy to use, but SO not worth the money!"
"I'm a little disappointed in this. I've been using a full size vitamix to make smoothies with lots of greens and fruits and what not and I struggle with the size of it. I keep using too much for a single size smoothie, so I got this to do smaller ones. It worked great for that, and it's super easy to clean. The blades are exposed tho so don't drop it in the sink where you can't see it! Probably not safe around younger kids that can reach a countertop. From a blending perspective tho it's very pulpy compared to the vitamix. I was a little surprised at that. Not a deal breaker but I guess I'm a little spoiled. Had I started with this one I'd have never known and probably thought it was great. The sipping lid that it comes with is not good, it's the worst part of it. From a ""slap it on and go"" perspective it's great. But when you flip the cap open there is no air hole to allow for easy drinking, it's like draining a can in the sink with no second hole. And it leaks! When I shook it and let it set for a minute it was leaking around the sides where it screws on. I thought maybe I had gotten some on there when I put the lid on so I removed and cleaned the threads. Gave it a shake again and it was instantly leaking. Very disappointed there. I'll use it when I do small shakes but ultimately I wish I hadn't bothered and just tried better portion control with the full size."
"I’m disappointed in this product. The lid twists off while blending, even with it being put on tight/securely. This causes the stuff inside to shoot out everywhere. The blender is “turned on” by pushing the sealed cup down, and turning it clockwise. The little points that are to be pushed down no longer pushes down. It’s basically inoperable - does not work. I don’t know if I got a defective product or not. I would return it if I still had the box that it came in. I cannot recommend purchasing this item."
"This is a very cheap blender compared to one I purchased 5 years ago.  After only 3 months use, the inside of the cup is already scratched up.  The suction cups don’t work at all.I would not recommend if purchasing this for daily use."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Edit after purchasing the ninja which has slimmer cups and2,  although it states they are 16 ounces that’s to the  “ fill line”. I ran them side-by-side, although the ninja you have to hold the entire time, , the NUTRI  says not to run over one minute  and doesn’t have a timer, so I might as well hold the much slimmer ninja cup. The ninja is lighter, but has 700 vs 600 watts.  Returning NUTRI. ORRIGINAL REVIEW  This is twice as strong as my magic bullet, I haven’t used it yet while washing, I dropped the cup, and then realized my hand doesn’t go halfway around it and there’s obviously no handle, so for me to use it I will have to put it in a different cup, and I have two things to wash not that big of a deal but the point of these are Mix & go , otherwise I’d USE MY BLENDER"
I’ve had this blender for about six months and the seal is a big issue. It’s removable so falls out constantly. It fell out during blending which caused a big mess and now it’s broken. Word of advice is to find a blender without a removable seal.
"I purchased this to replace a personal blender that I had for years.  This thing doesn't have the power for frozen fruits let alone ice.  The plastic container is small, and can only handle a pint of things at a time.  I would have sent it back but I am past the time for return,  I opened it too late.  This machine is a chore and not a joy, unfortunately.  UPDATE-I also forgot to mentions it leaks all over the place"
"Not powerful, vase too small"
Product stopped working one year exactly from day of purchase. and sadly you can not return it after that.
"I would highly recommend against buying this product - the blade attachment simply is not durable - there is a rubber ring inside that comes apart almost instantly when you try to blend anything thicker than water. I contacted the company when my first blade broke and they sent me a new one within a week. The replacement blade broke on its first use. I don’t feel like requesting another blade is useful at this point - just a learning experience to never buy a product from this company again.Gave two stars instead of one because even without the rubber ring on the blade, the product still works, it’s just harder to clean."
"My first bullet blender was the smaller Magic Bullet, and it performed well for years. Eventually the motor burned out, so I got another Magic Bullet. The second one didn't last nearly as long, but I worked it harder. I decided an upgrade might be in order, so I purchased the Personal blender in Jan 2023. I used it 2 to 3 times a week, for smoothies (mostly) and it worked great, though my ingredients are easy for a blender to handle. Basically milk, cottage cheese, soft banana and ground flax seed. I rarely use ice, and if I do, it is already crushed. A few times I ground up chicken cubes, rice, and canned veggies for a soup. I wanted this 60-dollar blender to last a long time and I would have given it five stars after a year or so. Today however,  I made my usual smoothie and got an unpleasant surprise. There were dark particles in my smoothie! The ring around the base had also come loose. (see photos) I don't know what this stuff is, but I am glad my smoothie is light colored, or I might not have noticed and drank it. I do wash out the base real good after use. Some reviews mention an oil seepage problem and I do recall the instructions mentioning that blades need to be replaced every six months. These cost around $20.00, which would make this blender a lot more expensive - not to mention the waste of contaminated food. I think for my purposes, I will save more money if I just buy a $20.00 blender from time to time."
"Idk why no one has mentioned this more - ideal concept bad flaws. For one and biggest one, google rubber ring nutribullet and see. Essentially the rubber ring that seals the lid during blending falls off every use and falls off into the blender. This morning was the final straw and I am replacing with another brand. Ring found its way off and wrapped around blade and pieces of rubber in my smoothie. Second issue is size to ratio. The filling to max line once blended results in a 1/4 of the container being filled. Blade get easily stuck. Overall great idea and size but faulty."
"I purchased this to make smoothies while out of town. It blends pretty good, but the gasket coming off is very inconvenient. It seems like a small thing until you’re cutting your fingers trying to put it back on. It’s a great little blender, but I wouldn’t buy it again."
"I really liked it at first, it blended pretty good and it was a size that was big enough for me.Then the issues started to happen. It would randomly stop mid blend and just absolutely not work. Would not turn back on thought it was broken. Tried it again a hour later and it worked. Figured it was a one time thing. But it happened again and then again.If the random stopping doesn't get you the gross amount of mold that hides under the rubber gasket will.I hadn't used this blender in a week and decided to use it when I saw small fuzz growing on the bottom of the bladed cap. I thought I just didn't wash it good enough after making a milkshake.When I was cleaning it I noticed it was like a marker where no matter how often I tried to wipe away the black crud it kept going. So I used a knife to pry out the gasket and low and behold it was absolutely covered in black. No matter how hard I scrubbed it would not completely come off the gasket.So I cannot recommend this product."
"The overall product is fine. However, the o-ring on the blender constantly comes off resulting in me wasting time putting it back on. I had an original NutriBullet for years and only had to replace it with this one. It feels like the quality control is lacking."
"I ordered this in April and didn’t start using it until recently. Within the first 3 smoothies I made the product filled my kitchen with the smell of burning plastic and soon after started smoking!! This thing is dangerous. I have had multiple bullet blenders from other brands with no issues. I followed all directions, this is not due to user error. Look up the $10million class action settlement about their hazardous blenders. I wish I had done my research. DANGER DANGER!!"
"Initially, I loved my nutribullet and was overall happy with the results (it did not blend in protein powder well.) Less than a month after purchasing this product, it stopped working. The rubber gasket kept falling off as well.I emailed and called customer support for both Amazon and Nutribullet. Amazon’s customer service was responsive and helpful. Nutribullet’s customer service made every step difficult after claiming to have a one year warranty. I sent I. Pictures and multiple inquiries."
I use mine 3-4 times a week to mix smoothies to lower my genetically predisposed high LDL 1 person usage (and probably forgot to register my purchase - Murphy’s Law says just b4 you own it for 1 yr the ingredients are coming out the bottom rubber gear - NO REASON THIS SHOULD BE HAPPENING! I need to find a better quality product! With a company that stands for CUSTOMER SATISFACTION WITH A SHELF LIFE OF MORE THAN 1 YR!
"I used this unit daily to blend protein powder with water. After about 9 months of use the motor started to produce a burning smell and promptly stopped working. I contacted nutribullet support about a warranty replacement and they said I needed to replace the blade assembly, disregarding my concerns about the motor being burnt out. They replaced the blade assembly under warranty, saying that it should be replaced every 6 months because the bearing begins to wear out. This did not solve the problem, as the motor is damaged. I will dispose of the unit and look for a better option from a different brand."
"Went to make my smoothie. Not overfilled, didn't blend over a minute and it shook itself loose or something and now the cup is stuck to the base and it's stuck in the unit itself and won't come loose. I had to unplug the blender to turn it off as it was spraying protein shake all over my kitchen. It does blend well but I have noticed it gets stuck easily. I had something close to this happen prior. Can't get it apart. If anyone has any suggestions... please let me know. The info online isn't helpful either for figuring out how to fix it."
This new model is not as powerful. Doubt it will last as long. Doesn't blend things as well.
"My husband and I drink smoothies every morning. Lots of frozen & fresh fruits, veggies, soy milk, flax, protein powder, etc. We had the older version of a ninja blender that came with a full size blender & 2 smaller blending cups. We wanted to upgrade to a new single serve blender with larger cups. So we bought a few different brands & models to try.The 2 top contenders in single serve blenders, Ninja & Nutribullet both have problems!!! For Ninja, we got the new power bowl duo blender & this one. EXTREMELY LOUD. They both sound like a jackhammer is in your kitchen. I used an app to measure the sound in decibels. It literally says these are in the “too loud” range. And imagine your poor pet’s hearing. So, that being said, these would damage your hearing over time!! The blending power is great, but is it worth losing your hearing?And Nutribullet, we got the 600 & the 900 watt models, to see if they would be any more quiet. The 600 didn’t have enough power to blend frozen fruits. And the 900 blends amazingly well, but has a strong plastic burning smell after using it for about 45 seconds. The sound level is quieter for Nutribullet, so there’s that.Why can’t the manufacturers make something better that doesn’t smell burnt & isn’t ridiculously loud?!?!"
"I purchased this blender in June of 2023, less than a year later it no longer is working properly......no fully blending."
Had this for almost 2 years - works good but the seal keeps coming off
"Update: decided to return this product because it’s too much trouble to use.I purchased this blender to replace a Ninja blender that burned out. The Nutribullet doesn’t blend the ingredients of the smoothie at the top and I have to blend, open it and stir, then blend again to get them all blended. Didn’t have to do that with my Ninja. Also it’s difficult to open the lid because there’s no grip, unlike the Ninja. I have to use a rubber opener to grab the slippery surface. This is very disappointing, but I’ll deal with it until it burns out since I’ve already used it."
"Blends great, however, the rubber O ring/gasket comes off practically every time I use it. It sounds petty, but it is extremely annoying to have to put it back on every time as it’s not easy. One got chewed up by the blades and had to order replacements. Would be five stars otherwise but it’s extremely annoying"
This one died after a few months.
"The product is great, has enough power, easy to clean ...perfect for me...However, I gave a 3-star rating because the shipping time was horrible... 6 days plus an extra day delay for a total of 7 days. Worse, the package was not in a normal Amazon shipping box, it was simply the actual product box like what you would see on a store shelf. Really bad, the product was left on the sidewalk...not even under the porch, out of the 95-degree heat, and was left wide open for everyone to see exactly what it was. Fortunately, I happened to be home for lunch and got it soon after they arrived, if I wasn't home there no dought it would have been stolen."
"It's just OK.  I had the fancy Nutribullet that made hot soup and that one died way too soon, with too little use.  I opted to purchase this smaller model with no bells and whistles because my family only needs it for smoothies for one family member, to be used once a day.  It's very easy to clean but other than that it's way more work than the fancy model that makes hot soup.  Next time I might invest in another brand altogether."
"I'm very disappointed, I purchased this nutribullet in June and its no longer working. I was only able to use it for 2 months, it's been I'm my storage since August. I just got it out of storage, tried using it and it's not working. The last nutribullet I purchased lasted me several yrs and I gave it to my son. It was defective when purchased."
"Pretty good blender but doesn’t really dice as some suggest, it makes like a purée."
"I purchased the Nutribullet approximately  3 and a half  months ago. The entire time I had it, it did such a  crappy job with blending smoothies. Nearly every smoothie I blended would still have chunks in it. This was after shaking it several times and letting it blend longer than it should have needed Shortly after purchasing it, it started to give off a burnt rubber smell. Also, the rubber seal became dislodged several times, causing smoothie to leak everywhere while it was blending. Just a couple nights ago, my entire place smelt so bad of burnt rubber, I had to open up my door to let the smell out. It was during the same time that the Nutribullet was giving off smoke. This happened after only blending a fruit smoothie for approximately one minute. After that, it quit working all together. It won’t even turn on now. I will never buy a nutribullet again. Youd be better off buying a ninja and spending a little bit more money to have a quality item That actually works."
"As the title says. I had one of these for 2 years up until a month ago when it started smoking out of nowhere. That said, it didn't really bother me because I had it for 2 years and used it daily. Seemed like time for it to crap out.This new one, however, is not the same. There are 2 glaring issues that make it suddenly terrible to use compared to the old one:1. The cup doesn't fit well on the base. With my old one, I could smoothly press it onto the base and let it blend. With this one, I have to JAM it onto the blender to get it to start smoothly. And I have to hold it in place, at that. Super frustrating.2. The o-ring pops out all the time. I mean come on! Do you have any idea how annoying it is to put that o-ring back on the blender! Not to mention it's gross when the guts of my blender are exposed to my smoothie.Anyway. I'm not sure what happened to this product. Hopefully I got a lemon. Because when it's right, this blender is amazing. This one, though, not a good blender at all."
"Both the cap and ring have hard plastic debris ridges attached to them. (See in photo the blue arrows indicating where they are.) Maybe in manufacturing they come out of their molds and get buffed off. Clearly these missed the mark. The one on the ring was found first by my pinky finger getting nicked by it. It's sharp. The one in the cap is not sharp but I can't remove it just by tugging on it. I want to believe this is a quality product once I can use it. But this experience has damaged my expectations right out of the box. Feels like factory seconds.... especially after hours of comparing products for my particular needs and expectations and feeling this was the winner. I was excitedly awaiting the arrival of what I anticipated would be one of my best buys this year. Kind of bummed. I don't know if I can buff these irritations away myself or not??? Darn, I was so looking forward to this thing... I may update this review based on performance later. Right now I'm not sure if I'll be boxing it back up instead...."
Had a Nutri Bullet for years and it finally failed. Bought this and it sounded and performed differently.Didn't seem as powerful and the motor didn't seem to be able to pulverize ingredients as finely as the old one.Returned and replaced but the replacement performed the same way. So I guess there was a change somewhere along the line that we'll have to get use to.
"I don’t know if the quality of this has come down, the first one we had for several years worked great, but this is our second one brought a couple of months ago and it’s been giving us problems from the start. It’s really hard to get this thing to work. The container has started leaking from the bottom.  All in an all a very poor experience and we are unfortunately outside the Amazon return window."
It didn't last more than two months. How disappointing! And my window to return it closed. This was a great little blender I wished the motor didn't stop working in less than two months. Waste of money 💰
"Had one of these blenders stop working suddenly in under a year. Tried getting it warranty.... What a mistake. At first the online back and forth went well. I sent in pictures of the unit, proof of purchase, etc. Went through some diagnostic steps outlined in an emailed by Nutribullet. make sure the tabs on the cup are intact, switches go down all the way. Tired multiple cups and blades. Finally found that a switch had stopped working. Cool. Customer service then has to go through a phone call for some reason. But i have a case number CA1386841 so I'm thinking that it will go quick they have all my pictures and steps taken.I was mistaken.Had to give all the information again. Guy on the phone wanted to do all the diagnostic steps over the phone and serial numbers on the blades i was testing with (had borrowed my moms blades to test with a known good one) didn't have it on hand i was told they could not proceed even though the base motor clearly is not working. Guy didn't even want to hear my case number. The process seems put in place in order to frustrate you enough to not even try. So I'll just try another brand.Oh and i opened up the unit for my own sanity. One of the activator switches was cracked. Thew it right in the garbage where it belongs."
You cannot use older canister from same model.  They slip under three white tabs.
"I wanted to love this after using my little magic bullet for 14 yrs however if you run it for more than 30 seconds you can smell the motor burning. Unit shuts off at 60 seconds! Disappointing for such a great brand! I used my old tiny bullet for hummus, dips, smoothies with no problem. This is not the quality I expected! Will be returning."
It worked fine but it would always have a burning smell after use so I returned.
Add an additional Jar for a better usage of this Blender.
"I ordered this nutribullet on July 19, 2024. From the first days, I noticed that if I didn’t put it as tight as possible, It would leak. That es a bother to clean up but I learned my lesson.Now, here I am, not even 4 months use and just doesn’t turn on. Not to mention I used it 3-4 times a week if that. I’m very disappointed in this company."
The blender will make a small blend of herbs and water steaming. You must add ice each time or you blended items will be well cooked in seconds.I have never had a blender that cooks at the same time. I may check into a puree soup of some sort. Cold smoothie needs extra ice or it will not be a smoothie.
"I want to start off by saying I liked this blender while it worked. The lid would have a tendency to unscrew while it was blending and then get lodged in the motor and would have to use a lot of force to unscrew it. But other than that it worked fine. I’ve had mine about 6 months and I’ve occasionally gotten a very slight burning smell after about 45 seconds of use but I wasn’t gonna stop using it because of that and it was very subtle. Recently I started using it and then the burnt smell returned but this time it was very strong and then smoke started billowing out of it. Will not be using it anymore. I don’t care how good of an appliance something is, if it starts smoking after only 6 months, it gets one star.For reference I only ever made smoothies with frozen fruit and I used it all the time."
I had a previous one for about 2 months that was a different model but everytime I used it the thing would run for like 15 seconds and quit so I thought maybe I would try a nicer one .  I bought this one and the very first time I used it not 30 seconds in it started smoking sent back next day…will never buy another
"I've purchased two of these in past two years.  The first one lasted a little over a year, 2nd one lasted 10 months.  Same problem with both - I put the cup in, twist, nothing happens.  Now going to try another brand.Good power for smoothies, which is what I mainly use it for.  So it's so sad when I use it one day, then the next it just won't turn on.  No sign of it going bad, it just stops working.  I use this about 5 times a week, so it does get a fair amount of use.  In all fairness it works very well, but I think it should last longer than a year."
"I did like this while it worked but a few things: rubber gasket consistently falls off; horrible design of connecting the blending cup with the blender, made with cheap plastic parts that you have to jam into place, but mostly it only laster a year and a half and topped working....dissapointing."
"I had high hopes for this blender.  After the very first use, it started to smoke and the rubber gaskets came out after each subsequent use."
"Had one for 10+ years, this one works like … poorly"
"I have gone through two of these. The first exploded contents all over myself and my kitchen twice. Showing photo of seal that comes undone. After first time I was very careful to not have it happen again. The second time I was making gravely so grease went everywhere including my clothing. Sent it back and got a new one and today for a third time it happened again. I have been very careful and still happened. I would say don't buy. Something has changed, I have one at another location and never had a problem. Maybe because of a change in manufacturing. This blender has damaged my kitchen cabinets. It's more than a mess that it has made."
"I've gotten two NutriBullets and used each one daily, each one for almost exactly a year.After a year, the first one seemed to have corroded internally. I could no longer depress the cup (which is required to lock it into place and activate the motor). I am not aware of liquid ever having gotten into the housing.I had really loved it while it worked and hoped this was just a fluke, so I got a second one, which I also used daily. At almost exactly a year into my second Nutribullet, hairline cracks appeared in both cups, and the cup and blade stopped fitting correctly. It began leaking both from the crack and from the seam (I stood by obsessively catching drips to make sure nothing got into the housing). Toward the end the cup spontaneously popped out of the blade, spraying everywhere. Approximately 2 weeks later it simply stopped turning on.Luckily I had gotten the service plan from Asurion the second one. I think I'll try a different brand for my third mini-blender. Too much drama. ꒰⁎❛⃘ ⍘⃘ ❛⃘⁎꒱"
"This blender is simple and easy to use once you understand what ""NOT"" to do. The first six months of owning my first one, I had spills at least once a week. (spills probably is not the correct word to use here, it was more like explosions or the lid loosened up while blending). Once I figured not to overfill container, things got better.  The first one lasted about 2 years and then the motor burnt out.  I purchased another 900 watt unit and it just destroyed itself a couple of weeks ago. The 3 screws that hold the motor to the unit all broke loose.  Also, the manufacture told me after the first one broke and was out of warranty, that the blade unit needs to be replaced about every 6 months. They will last longer but the bearing starts making noise. I guess this has to be a ""dry"" bearing because of contamination. So far, 2 years seems to be the working life of the ones that I have had.  It is used just about twice daily."
"Not sure if this product sold through Amazon is the same you get if you go to a store. I have another Nutri Bullet and it works fine. for some reason, this one has completely stopped working . the jar on top will not spin. I have tried unplugging, plugging back in, making sure everything is clean and unobstructed, etc. and it will not work."
I use this to make smoothies out of. But the other day the gasket from the blade came out and I couldn't get it back in. I am exchanging it today and hopefully it doesn't happen again. In hindsight I wish I would have gotten a traditional blender.
"The Nutribullet does its job well. It's powerful and mixes fruit, protein mix and water well to make a morning smoothie. However the gasket in the blade section which seals the mixing container comes out after a couple of uses. It is difficult to put back in the groove which is complicated by the sharp blades. I contacted customer service and they sent a new blade section with gasket installed. It suffered from the same problem. I can't envision the norm to be reinstalling the gasket after a few uses while risking cuts from the blade. We've had a Magic Bullet for years, and the gasket never came out. It's too late for a return."
"Opened the box to find a used product with missing to-go lid. Immediately contacted Amazon who sent me the number for the Nutribullet customer service. They were very nice and opened a warranty case. I submitted all photos but they ruled against replacing the product, only the to-go lid. So I have no choice but to return the item to Amazon. I refuse to pay $60 for a used product with rust. I sincerely hope it does not arrive to someone else's door. Model number 23BIALA11022300326 and blade number and blade number AX3323. These are the numbers they asked to register the warranty, so I will asume it has been voided for this particular product. Good luck!"
"I bought Nutribullet sets and both super defective. DO NOT BUY this as they are cheats. One of them would not even fit in the fixture and the one one had leakages. PATHETIC PRODUCT AND PRODUCT SERVICE, I DID NOT GET CUSTOMER SERVICE to even call back"
It also came with some helpful advice
I use it daily and clean it EVERY Day! It all of a sudden stops working. The motor doesn't spin. A coworker of mine said it happened to him. Sooooo upset over spending $70 for something that doesn't last a year. 🤬
"I tried blending some veggies for a salsa, it didn't blend good. There was big chunks of the tomato, onion and jalapeno."
"I eat a lot of fruits during the summer, but have never made smoothies, although, it is a great way to enjoy fruits. I am not a green smoothie kind a gal, but I want to experiment and see what else I could do with a blender.This blender has different buttons, depending on what you want to do. So, you should be able chop, whisk, stir, grind, and puree. Smoothies work really well and they turned out great. I tried to chop onions with the 'chop' button, but that didn't work at all. It might work with vegetables, I also tried to mix my cheese cake mix which is a mixture of cream cheese and greek yoghurt which should be soft enough, but it just wasn't powerful enough to mix it. Unless, what you want to mix is very soft and liquidy this machine can't handle it.Another thing I don't like about this machine are the labels on the buttons. Unless I have really good light and my glasses on I can't read it. It is tiny and it might be the coloration that makes the letters hard to see - at least for me. I don't have 20/20 vision but still do pretty well, generally speaking. I should not have a problem reading what's on the buttons.What I do like about this machine is its size. It really doesn't use a lot of space when stored away."
Returned because plastic felt thin and it may crack.Front buttons hard to read and lots of nooks and groves would make it hard to clean.
It would crush my smoothie and ice it's cute but not strong I will return it😔
Dislike motor stalls while making smoothies
The cup to the blender was all broken
"I'm quite pleased with this compact blender when it comes to functionality of the blender itself. For 30 bucks you get a fully functional blender with lots of different speeds and uses for your needs. Much more powerful than portable bottle blenders that cost as much as this one that are USB C rechargeable.The main reason why I dropped a couple stars off my rating: 1.All plastic and somewhat weak clear plastic pitcher body. 2. Lid does not properly seal and some water or whatever else you might be blending will gush out when you first start using the blender at hight speed setting. 3. Everything screws on and tightens the wrong way, normally you'll tighten things by rotating clockwise. On this blender, the lid tightens counterclockwise and the base screws on counterclockwise as well. That's terrible and confusing. I'm not sure why this was necessary. I don't like it at all. 4. The High and Low speed buttons are hard to operate. They're are not very easy to push, as the location of the actual buttons are not depicted properly. 5. The High speed is very loud and vibrates the entire unit a lot.Does this blender work... Yes, it certainly does. I'm not sure how much an all glass pitcher blender with more sturdy build would cost. This one is a fair proposition.I wish this blender wasn't as loud and rough as it turned out to be when blending my smoothies. This Fit-anywhere design is is extremely clever and saves a lot of room in my cabinet.Regardless, I would still recommend this blender because it works as intended and you can save a lot of room from your cabinets with this particular model."
"This blender is ideal for a small area counter because of its portable size. This blender is really lovely in the hue of oatmilk. The ability to store the cords beneath the blender is a feature I appreciate. My only complaint about this product is that, even with the low selection, it is really noisy when in use. Additionally, I doubt that this blender would be appropriate for daily usage. For smoothies or fruit blends, this would be excellent for occasional use, but for anything else, a strong study blender might be needed."
"I used this about a half a dozen times before it broke. The materials are so thin and so cheap that you have to blend things perfectly for it to work. The area where the blade goes is also weirdly shaped and too big for the size of the blender, so food gets caught underneath it. It also doesn't crush things well. I made pesto one day and this never truly blended things."
"Have had 3 of these. Drink a smoothie every morning now for a couple years. iI've gone through 2 of them in the last year and I don""t chop ice in them. The cross blade part wears out quickly. The bearing goes making loud noises as it starts to wear out. in a short time after the noise starts the seal starts leaking and then its done. YOU can buy replacement crossblades on  Amazon now, so you don't need to buythe whole thing."
"I purchased this to make small batches of sauces. I normally use a Vitamix. But for those small  batch sauces that don’t require absolute smoothness, this is perfect. I did try a smoothie with frozen fruit not so much it did it wasn’t able to handle blending the frozen fruit very well or the spinach however, I have not tried it with fresh fruit. For what I’m using it for, I’m happy with my purchase."
"Glad I got this during Black Friday sales. I’ve tried a few different ways of making smoothies with frozen fruit (no ice) and this thing just can’t handle it. What was supposed to be a quick and convenient way to have smoothies each day is more tedious than my 10 year old Walmart blender. The Magic Bullet can’t chop the frozen fruit until it starts to thaw, and even then, takes multiple minutes.The Magic Bullet does do a good job of pulverizing the spinach I toss in and is a lot more convenient to clean than a larger blender."
"The Magic Bullet Blender is compact and easy to use, making it convenient for quick meal prep and smoothies. Its 11-piece set includes various cups and blades, enhancing versatility for different tasks.However, the motor may struggle with tougher ingredients, impacting performance with ice or hard vegetables.Cleanup is relatively simple, though the gaskets wear down over time.For those seeking a straightforward blending solution, this blender offers good value in a small package."
It is great. The only thing is that is a bit small I should have bought a bigger one. Sometimes it will shut off and not finish blending. I guess it’s a safety feature but it’s fine.
"After about the tenth smoothie, the motor started smelling like it's burning up. Reported issue and the manufacturer did not send a new motor base.  I'll keep using it in spite of the burning smell."
"I used this to blend a bunch of cilantro leaves and stalks and it was very weak and I had a hard time stopping, mixing, and restarting the cup, otherwise, it would get stuck without mixing anything."
"We really like the magic bullet, we've been using it for several years, but I've come to learn that the motor will just stop working after 2 years, even if we don't use it daily, weekly, or monthly even. We tend to use it as-needed which isn't often (like a few times a year) and I'll go through phases where I want a smoothie everyday but that usually only lasts about 2 weeks at a time. Which still isn't a lot of use out of it. We also had one where it was leaking oil at some point and we ordered a new one because it was making us uncomfortable (not sure where it was going inside the unit). And here we are, needing a replacement because the motor stopped working right in the middle of use and it was just sitting in the cabinet for 2 months.It is a good product, fast, blends things up great, doesn't take a lot of space in the kitchen, and can handle large amounts at a time despite how small it is. But I would say this is a temporary blender since it is so low in price, you do get what you paid for. Better off buying this as an introductory blender and then switch to a better one.But we have so many of the cups and spinners now, I wish they just sold the motor base separately. As much as we like it, this may be our last go with the brand and we'll have to try and find that better brand that will last longer."
"The blender is fine. It’s not great obviously, but it’s a cheap small low voltage blender.But some of the critical parts necessary for operation keep snapping. For example, the fins on the bottom that grab on to the gear to spin the blade. Or the plastic parts that depress the safety switches to make sure it’s fully seated.Small piece of plastic snaps, and the whole thing doesn’t work. I’d recommend saving your money and going up market for something more durable"
"I bought the product, not realizing I purchased the wrong one. I meant to purchase the Bullet blender.  I returned this product."
"It blends well if you follow the instructions and don't go above the fill line. But even then, it easily overheats (pops a fuse, and you wait for it to cool to use again) and dies completely within a year or two. I hate putting things into landfills, but don't know if there's a better option out there that has some longevity. I would be happily willing to pay more for a higher-quality, long-lasting product."
"Though the blending speed is good, i find it pretty uncomfortable to use becaof the noise it makes."
"Cheap or ""affordable"" is really all this has going for it. It's small and it blends--mostly.I enjoy making smoothies with 5 ingredients -- frozen strawberries, frozen blueberries, yogurt, almond milk, honey--and it struggles even with that.1. The blades are incredibly dull--they literally get gunked up with blueberry skin every time and I have to open the cup and pull off globs of blueberry skin from the blades. Sometimes I like to add pineapple but the blades can't even cut up blueberry skin, which is pretty depressing.2. It does not pull the ingredients from the top down when running. Usually blenders like these swirl the ingredients in a way that pulls them down to the blades. This does not. I have to constantly take the cup off the base and shake it up to mix the ingredients down to the blades.3. I've been using this almost daily for about a month now, and every time I use it the entire corner of the kitchen still smells like burnt plastic. Don't understand how the smell still hasn't burned or worn off. Smells toxic.4. The cup is pretty small with large ridges that run down the sides. The ridges make it hard to wash in my opinion with fairly small hands, and definitely does not seem to help with the circulation of ingredients when blending.I bought this to replace a $30 similar blender I used for 15 years through college, grad school, and survived 5 or 6 moves across three states. I can say this MagicBullet is a huge disappointment compared to that cheap beater of a blender I hoped to replace. It's pretty frustrating to use for all the points I listed above--which my old blender had no issues with.Pretty disappointed a ""name brand"" blender could not do what a cheap no-name off brand blender from over 15 years ago could do. Yes it's cheap, but I had expected a little more performance."
"if you are blending something besides ice, it will work well but ice will not be blended no matter how long i let this run for. also, it comes with many pieces for the cups and mostly all are not something i would ever use. cups themselves are pretty small."
"too many peaces everywhere , hard to put together ."
"I LOVE smoothies and I have had several blenders of all kinds. I used to work at jamba juice too so blenders are like second nature to me. having said that, I have very high standards for blenders and their ability to blend lots of things. Maybe I ask too much of my blenders haha but this one will blend a simple smoothie, nothing too complicated about operating it. but if you are a smoothie fanatic like me - this blender won't last long. I have had mine for less than a month and it is a goner unfortunately"
"I wanted to make smoothies and milkshakes. Nothing complicated like nut butters. Most of the stuff I'm blending isn't anything more than my cheap Muller blender can. I just wanted something that did a better job. Most of the reviews I read put this at the top of the heap but after trying it out for the first time, I'm not sure how those people are using this thing but mine did a horrible job.Here is my recipe:A couple of scoops of soft vanilla ice cream.nb: I normally use more frozen but I just got back from the store and the ice cream was still really soft.About a table spoon and a half of dark coca baking powder.Milk and some heavy whipping cream.Throw together and blend.I put the powder in first and because you turn this upside down to blend, the powder sits above the blending blades. The only way for the stuff stuck to the top to get into the mix is if the blender itself creates enough blending motion and turbulence to reach the top. In this case, that never happened. Even after making sure it was full to the MAX line.  The end result was actually worse than a cheaper blender.  I decided to try again with more ice cream and then add milk in a little at a time.  So I added a little more ice cream (still soft) and the blender struggled to get through it but it was blending it, just very slowly. So I stopped the blender, added more milk to thin it out some and put it back on and got.... nothing.  I tried several times, checked the GFCI it was plugged into. Nothing.. Nothing I did would cause the motor to spin.The unit, within the first hour... was dead. :(*sigh*I only wish Amazon customer service hadn't gotten so horrible in the past couple of years.guess I'll try and return it.Most of these products are pretty good. I've had a nutri-bullet for years that's been fine. I just think this model is too under powered and under-engineered to deal with real world smoothie requirements."
My old Bullet had a much bigger blade for chopping. Glad I had some stashed away because the blade that come with this Bullet is horrible
The personal-size Magic Bullet Blender cannot break down larger cubes of ice. Replaced with the personal-size Ninja Blender. It’s small but powerful!
"Great little blender, compact and handy. Overtime with daily use got very loud and leaked black oil 🫢."
After 2 month of use; it started making thunderous noise while blending anything. Though it is still working well but seems like that it is bent upon making you deaf 🧏‍♂️. Poor motor.So buy it if are hard of hearing. If you are not then buy earplugs when ordering this product.I plug my ears before making my evening milk shake.
"Overall I was happy that I got about 4 months use out of this blender. I initially bought it to blend up frozen fruits and make smoothies with, but I noticed because of the small size, weak power of the motor, overheating and smell of the motor, I knew it was time to retire it and throw it out. It definitely was good for a cheap purchase, but I think next time I will buy the more expensive and better quality blender because it broke a lot more quickly than I expected. Definitely cannot withstand frozen fruits, and wasn't able to fully blend my smoothies, took a long time to blend them, even though it is recommended to not run the blender for over one minute."
"I have mixed feelings abut this blenderPros:- Easy to wash- The usable cup and lid make for easy transport- It does not take up a lot of space-Reduces the amount of dirty dishes because the container is a user friendly cup.-Made for smaller portionsCons-- One speed. The speed is achieved by turning the container in the locked position.- struggles to blend frozen fruit at times. not very powerful.- versus an ordinary blender, you cannot just remove the top and add water (more liquid). I’ve learned to suspect when I do not have enough liquid for my smoothies. To solve this issue you must remove from the base and unscrew the top and check occasionally.-Made for smaller portions. There is a loss of versatility."
Idk if that’s a normal feature of bullet blenders but they are dull and thick. I just use it for protein powder and banana so it worked just fine for my needs
"I have two older Magic Bullets and alternate them because they can't run more than 50 seconds before it smells like something is burning and so I take the second older Magic Bullet and alternate until the drink is like a shake. I alternate foods on a daily basis starting with 6 small ice cubes, bananas and almonds. The next day I use the same, except replace bananas with frozen peaches. When I tried the newest Magic Bullet it stopped running after 45 seconds. I let it sit for a minute and tried again but the Magic Bullet wouldn't run. I am returning it today and will continue using the two I have. It is disappointing because I I had just ordered two new blades to have on hand to alternate with this newest one."
The only thing wrong with this product is the flip up lid. I don’t know who thought up this lid but it was a bad idea.
Worked great until about the 5 month mark when it started to slow down and ultimately died shy of 6 months 😔
I bought the smaller version to replace one I had had for a long time to replace the base.My first one was easy to start. The tiny knobs on the cups don't fit smoothly and i haveto press down/twist harder than normal to get the machine to engage.  I'm almost afraidI am going to break the cup and the machine is much noisier than the last one. The knobson the cups are way too short to start the blender properly. Design flawed.
"Thought it was decent, was using it to blend my protein smoothies with fruit. Had a hard time with whole strawberries. Made a lot of noise, kids would complain, and cats would run. Was having the partially thaw the strawberries hours beforehand. Then I bought a battery operated ninja blender for a work trip. That thing eats up the frozen strawberries like nothing. Blends way faster, and quieter. I’m throwing this POS out tonight."
"I bought this to make smoothies so I don’t have to use our big (loud) Vitamix every time.  It’s relatively quiet (for a blender).  It’s also super easy to clean.  It is not, however, powerful.  I usually throw a date in my smoothies for sweetness and this leaves large chunks of date.  I’ll likely be donating this and buying a more powerful model/brand."
"Great for smoothies but…the construction of these bullet blenders seem to be getting cheaper. It can’t take running for too long and you’ll smell it if you do. Not a bad product but, I had my old bullet blender for years before it did anything like that. These last 2 I purchased dont seem to be of the same stock. Next time I’ll try a different brand."
"Cons: At 250 watts, this blender struggles with frozen bananas. I had a 300 watt personal blender before, and that extra 50 watts makes a big difference. The cups are smaller than most personal blenders,Pros: but I like that they give multiple cups, drinking attachments, and lids. If you don't need the power, and want a lot of small cups, this will do fine."
"We previously owned the original magic bullet with the larger jars, and somehow didn't expect the small version to be so much smaller.  Not practical to blend any kind of fruit/veggies for a beverage/smoothie as it does not hold much.  It might have been more worth it if the cups came in a wider range of sizes."
"Doesn't blend as smooth, especially if blending nuts and hard vegetables like carrots."
My Ninja broke so I bought this in a hurry. I remember Magic Bullet being a huge thing back when I was a kid. It’s fine but it does NOT blend seeds. I have a smoothie every day with frozen berries and the amount if seeds I got in my first sip…made me gag.
I like my bullet but the cups are too small.
Just feel confused about how to use it and it doesn’t work in an easy way. May not be a good  fit for me. I used once and gave up. I want to return but the return window has closed since I just got back from a long summer vacation
Noise at end of blend does not sound normal
"It gets the job done but takes a while and isn’t great at crushing frozen fruit or ice.  We even got a chunk of banana in a smoothie.  I got used to blending for longer than expected, but eventually just got a higher powered blender."
I am using ice from my freezer and you really have to work with it to get it chopped up. I have been melting the ice down more to make it a little easier. I should have spent a little more and got a more powerful unit.
"I purchased this as a replacement for my Ninja and it is not the same. The cups have a much smaller capacity than I wanted. it is lightweight and feels cheap. I use this for smoothies, and it can barely handle frozen ingredients. I have to stop, take the top off, and stir the ingredients manually several times when making something. This is not a high quality blender and I wish I would have returned it. Oh well. Lesson learned. I made the purchase because of the Prime Day sale and this isn't something I would recommend, at any price."
"I make the same smoothie basically every day and it includes about 3/4 cup of frozen fruit. This little blender really needs some encouragement to get through it. It becomes a solid chunk of frozen, I have to take the cup off the blender and shake it to even get the fruit to the blades. When the blades finally do attack the fruit it works, but with a notable burning plastic smell.Everything surrounding the frozen chunk of fruit is blended quiet well! But it you're a big frozen fruit blender, it may not be up to the task."
"It works but the quality is not as good as it first was.  Also, I really miss the chopping blades and the additional cups.  I won't buy another when this one gives out."
"I've purchased these sets at least 4 times. Each time a different problem caused it to malfunction, such as the motor overheated and died. This current time the clear plastic ""teeth"" on the containers snapped off and so I had to hold the container as it mixed. Wish this product was more durable."
"Pros: tiny footprint (good for my tiny kitchen); incredibly easy to use; great accessory packageCons: not very powerful, small size of containers means you can’t really use it for two peopleI love love love it for its cuteness and tiny footprint. It did ok with spinach (still specks of green but the texture was fine). They say it doesn’t work with frozen things, but I added frozen banana and mango (small chunks) and it worked fine. So for simple smoothies, it’s probably good (no celery, no mature greens, but that’s not a big deal to me, and I definitely wouldn’t use ice.). The capacity is a bit too small—you can only get one large smoothie out of it, or two 6 to 7 oz ones. It does come with multiple cups, so you could make two separate ones.However, I was hoping to dump my virtually unused, large, pain to clean blender and use this for all cold things. Nope. Virtually the only thing I use the blender for is pesto. The Magic Bullet was an epic fail at that. There was no way to get it to process the basil leaves, likely because pesto doesn’t take a lot of liquid.The 600 watt Nutribullet, which I found had some other issues, blended the pesto well (as with a blender, it ended up a bit over processed but tasty). That level of power is, a bit sadly, what I need."
It was good for the first 6 months but I guess I over used it and caused it to over heat and it stoped working.
"I decided to spend a little more on this product rather than a cheap $20 compact blender hoping it performs better. It doesn't. It broke on the first use. I think if you are only blending powders and liquids and soft foods its fine, but it can't handle anything frozen or hard. The attachments, the compact size, all looked great. The motor is the most important part of a blender, and that failed me."
This is the second time I’ve had this kind of blender and it randomly stops working after a few months. It’s usually around the 7-8 month. So disappointed.. everything still looks great and it was working great but suddenly the motor ceases to work…. I’m just glad my smoothie finished blending today so I can still enjoy it before having to wait for another. Edited: now it works on and off
"Let's be honest, I was lured in by the price tag. The Magic Bullet Blender seemed like a steal – a whole little blending system for way less than some of the other options out there. Seemed too good to be true, and well, it kind of was.This thing is tiny. Sure, it's called ""Small"" in the title, but I guess I wasn't fully picturing just how miniature it would be. And that small size translates to weakness. The motor sputtered and coughed its way through even the simplest tasks. Forget about trying to blend up frozen fruits or anything remotely tough – it just wasn't having it.Maybe if I only ever planned on using it for the tiniest, softest ingredients, it might be okay. But come on, who wants to limit themselves like that? Plus, all those extra attachments they throw in? They felt like a consolation prize for the underwhelming motor. Honestly, they just seemed like a way to bulk up the package and make it seem more impressive.In the end, I'm kicking myself for trying to save a few bucks. This Magic Bullet is going straight to the back of the cabinet, and I'm going to pony up for a decent Ninja Nutri Pro. Live and learn, right? Spend the extra money upfront and get something that actually works."
"I bought this to make smoothies. Almost bought a Ninja instead and I think I should have. I’ve had many smoothie makers such as this, but this one (adding yogurt, a liquid, fresh spinach and frozen fruit, as an example) takes forever to blend to a smooth consistency. You keep having to take it off, stir it and reblend about 3 or 4 times. It too time consuming."
"This blender was a nice little lightweight blender, but only lasted a few months with daily use."
"I loved my old MB so much I bought a 2nd for office. These new ones don't have option for as many small cups & don't seem to be blending on the large cups as well. Plus sometimes there's an odd motor burning smell. And why only black rims now? For more $$ too! What the heck, Magic Bullet! You can do better!"
This blender works easily and comes apart for cleaning well. However. It's a weak thing. It struggles to grind ice or frozen berries at all. I keep having to stop it and push the frozen bits down then blend for another eternity and it still comes out with large chunks of frozen berry/ ice. Pretty disappointing. Would have purchased a different product had I known this one would be so frustrating to use.
I would get the ninja instead. This is not very powerful.
This one was a replacement and only lasted 6 months. Ugh.
"I've had this Bullet for several years now and always want to like it more than I do. I think the brand name carries an expectation that this is going to be, well, magic, I guess. But, when it comes down to it, I did only pay $40 dollars, and this feels like a $40 blender.It seems mostly marketed for smoothies, and, for me, is barely effective for smoothies-- I'm the type of person who likes ice in my smoothies, so this is key -- if you just want to blend some fruit up, you're probably going to be fine. But as soon as you add ice (even frozen fruit), this little guy struggles a lot and I either have to water it way down, or just live with the chunks.Further, this is pretty much useless for food processing. Again, this is mostly marketed for drinks and such, but they do claim you can do some food processing... in my experience, not really. The issue stems from the size/shape of the blade. Everything spins out to the sides and gets stuck to the walls of the cup because the blade can't reach. I managed to pull off a pesto with a lot of coaxing and remixing, but it didn't make me excited to make pesto again with this.I know I'm mostly focusing on negatives. To be honest, for $40, you get something that can do what you spent $40 on. It can make specific types of smoothies, and other stuff if you figure out a bunch of work arounds, which might be the perfect fit for someone who just needs a blender to use every now and again, that takes up little room."
I was excited to get a new blender after my small personal blender stopped working. It doesn't have as much power as I thought it would. It also doesn't have a large capacity. You can't put much into the cups.  I do like the different tops and cup options.
"I bought this as a travel-sized blender. After the second time I used it in Italy with a different plug attachment, it burnt out. For anything Europe—I would highly suggest getting something that has the European plug already. It’s unfortunate that this happened during my trip when I needed it, and now it’s past the refund date because I prepared for my trip ahead of time. It worked fine in America. I bought a travel size blender before and it did not burn out. You could smell the burning. I expect that for a blow dryer that has a high wattage, not a travel- sized blender."
"4.20.2024: after using it almost daily for 2 months it is no longer working.2.24.2024: Maybe I’m expecting too much but my magic bullet mini was able to blend ice and my protein shake perfectly but wasn’t large enough to add fruit so I thought that I would just get a bigger one so that I can add fruit but it doesn’t seem to have enough power to get the whole cup full of fruit, protein shake and ice blended. It overheats, smoke actually came out of it yesterday, and then it won’t work at all so I’ve been dividing the contents in half and using my mini again. 3 days in a row now. I’m so disappointed or am I expecting it to do too much?"
"This is the third Magic Bullet blender I've owned. My second one was also a 250W blender that I got ten years ago at Costco, and it worked great for my post-workout smoothies, which typically include things like banana and peanut butter, fruit and Greek yogurt, or avocado and spinach, blended with ice. I decided to replace it after it got wet one too many times and the wiring inside got corroded. This one has the same 250W rating, but it struggled to blend the same recipes I have made every day for years, and overheated after only a few seconds, refusing to work again for hours. I tried again with a different smoothie and the same thing happened. It feels much lighter and more cheaply made than my previous blender, so they've obviously just dropped their quality bar for materials and manufacture. Very disappointing."
The motor overheats when blending chopped vegetables and doesn't even do a good job.  The veggies are still grainy and not good for a smoothie.  I'd go with a normal sized blender for the price.
"Update: July 24, 2021- The warranty replacement arrived a little sooner than expected. It was sent via FedEx. Kudos to NutriBullet for their customer service and support - and integrity for no hesitation in determining that this was covered under their warranty. I am glad they sent a blade assembly even after I said mine was fine because while waiting for the replacement, I noticed that the gear teeth under the blade assembly was also worn about halfway down. It was worn down so evenly that I didn’t notice until I compared it with my still good 10 year old blade assembly. This morning, I put it to the test with my breakfast protein shake. First thing I noticed was a burning plastic smell after at about 10 seconds. I stopped it, checked it, and started again. The mini ice cubes sounded more like they were being banged around than chopped and never got slushy. When I stopped it and removed the cup, I noticed “dust” around the blade gear and around the gear on the base unit. It looks white, but when I collected some of itnon my fingertip, it was black. (See photo.) One or both of the gears are grinding down. Same problem as before. I had been using the same MagicBullet for about 10 years before replacing it in April and again with this warranty replacement 3 months later, so I do know how to use it. I’m not confident in the quality of these newer MagicBullets. I love(d) MagicBullet and admire their customer support, but I have to leave this it one star.Update: July 17, 2021- NutriBullet (the company that makes Magic Bullet) was very good with their follow-up to my initial contact on their website and to my reply to their request for specific information. I was told to call them to arrange a warranty replacement - the base unit and blade assembly - for which I had to pay $4.99 each for shipping using my credit card. I don't like that I had to shell out even more money, but it was cheaper than buying whichever new unit I was going to get to replace it. The agent said it could take about a week to arrive from California from USPS. I'll update again when I receive the replacements.I bought this on April 3, 2021, to replace my first Magic Bullet that I had been using for about the past 10 years. This new unit didn't feel as sturdy, and it was almost unnoticeable, but the switch seemed to activate before the blender cup was pushed all the way down. Otherwise worked the same as my first Magic Bullet -- until it stopped working after just 3 months of use! As can be seen in the photo, the gear on the base is worn down and powdered, so it no longer makes contact with the gear on the bottom of the blender cup. I used it the same way I always did by pushing the blender cup down and locking it into place, but this time the blades didn't spin. I contacted Homeland Housewares to inquire about warranty support. If they do cover it, their warranty specs state that shipping is not covered. I'll update this review if I hear back from them."
After almost 10 years my magic bullet but the dust. It had been such a good product I re-ordered the same brand. The first smoothie I tried to make tripped the thermal fuse. If it’s not powerful enough for a smoothie what’s the point? Clearly the quality has gone down over the last decade.
"I’ve only had this blender for a month and at first it worked great, no issues. But now, it randomly shuts off in the middle of blending and won’t work again until after another 30 minutes. It is so frustrating. If you need a blender that you’ll use a lot, I’d suggest spending the extra money to get a nice, more reliable one.It also sometimes takes a while to blend, I have to constantly pull out the cup and shake it for it to blend the whole cup."
I had to return it. I buy smoothie kits ready to make Vidor in the grocery store and this just was not strong enough to mix the frozen fruit.
"Included: (1) 250W motor base, (1) cross-blade, (1) tall cup, (1) short cup, (1) party mug, (2) lip rings, (2) Stay-Fresh resealable lids, (1) to-go lid and 10-second recipe guide.Did Not receive the 10 second recipe guide.  Which is the only reason I bought the $39 one.  I had bought a bullet over 10 years ago and the motor finally gave out but still had all the components.  Haven't used it as yet so can't remark on anything else"
"It blends good, the cups are way too small. I’m sending it back & looking for a more reasonable price and larger cups."
"Used this item for a while. I previously only used it to blend some fully-soaked yellow beans which are soft so easy to be blended.HOWEVER, when I recently tried to make smoothies with cutted fruits. Things get reeeeally worse. It's so noisy and low efficient that you have to shake it while blending. And the machine stopped working if it's over heated (it's very easy to trigger this if you keep the blender on 1 min😅)"
Underpowered doesn’t blend frozen berries for smoothies. Spend the extra money on a NutriBullet if you are making smoothies with frozen fruit.
"I am extremely disappointed with the newer version of the Magic Bullet, especially since the older model had been my favorite and most reliable small appliance for years. I used it daily for blending frozen fruit smoothies, and it never gave me any issues. Naturally, I decided to purchase a backup when I saw it on sale—but sadly, the quality of the newer model has completely missed the mark.At first, I thought the one I received might be defective, but after requesting a replacement, I found that both units shared the same problem. Whenever I try to blend frozen fruit with juice and yogurt, the motor overheats within a minute, and there’s a burning smell. This never happened with the older model, which handled the same tasks with ease.It’s frustrating and disappointing that such a dependable product has seen such a significant drop in quality. I don’t know what changes were made to the new version, but it’s definitely not as powerful or reliable. I’ve lost trust in this product and am now searching for an alternative. It’s a shame to have to part ways with what was once my go-to blender."
It is just ok. Not sure Id recommend it. Tried to make tahini with sesame seeds and it was more difficult than it should have been. It doesn’t seem to be very powerful and it was also difficult to get everything out of the ridged cup. Not even sure I should try making a morning smoothie.  I don’t think the blades will be able to handle it. If I do Ill update.
"The blades wouldn’t cut a pat of butter in the sun.  Can’t deal with any kind of fruit skin or pulp.  Hates pineapple, grapes, blueberries and peaches.  Slows down and smells funky when blending the aforementioned items.  I wish I had bought something else."
"I ordered and was sent a Magic Bullet within 24 hours from Amazon.  I had an older Magic Bullet model that has WELL exceeded my expectations.  I was hopeful I was receiving the same.  The first time I used it, the smell of burning wires was intense and it shut down within 20 seconds and would not turn on.  I called customer service with Nutribullet and they went through several steps with me.  Eventually, it worked again.  They took my information and we agreed that I would call back if there were any problems and created a case # for the issue.  The following day the same thing happened and the smell of burning wires was even more intense.  I called customer service again.  With no additional checks or questions they decided it was a blade issue.  Based on how it smelled I was pretty certain it was NOT a blade issue but a motor issue.  The representative said that if I sent them proof from Amazon that I purchased it, they would send a blade in 10 days from now.  First, that timeframe is a bit excessive for something that I use every day.  Second, I asked if that is not the solution what happens next?  They said they would have to trouble shoot more and then it would take an additional 10 days for each additional problem they would want to check before replacing the entire unit.  At this point, I asked to speak with someone else to make certain this was the company protocol.  The ""manager"" said this was the company protocol.  I asked if his preference would be that I go through Amazon for the immediate replacement and he said ""We'd prefer you didn't"".  He did finally offer that if I paid to send the unit back to them and $9.99 for them to send it back that they would replace the model. Uhhhh..... No.  Thank goodness for Amazon's customer centric services and the ability to let people know what they will have to deal with if they unfortunately have to deal with Nutribullets customer service."
"ProsVery portable and smal so storing is easy.Again, small which is perfect for single person.ConsSeems like it is weak, I had mine for three months and it died.I chalked this up to my fault however due to over running. It wasn't blending quite right however.Power cord could be a little longer.I bought another one because I still love the product."
"I like the Magic Bullet very much.  But when received from Amazon the package lacked the lid that was supposed to be in the box.  Instead of simply sending me a replacement lid, Magic Bullet kept stringing me along, asking for additional information, etc. until my 30-day option on returning the item to Amazon for replacement expired. All over a lid that probably cost less than $1.  I am very disappointed with the manufacturer over this."
"We bought this to make smoothies for my son. And it was working great! Easy to clean and easy to store. But one day I started noticing that after cleaning the black piece with the blade on it. There was black stuff. No matter what I did to clean it, it just wouldn’t go away. So we decided to upgrade."
I used it for smoothiesIt gets to hot and shuts off
"This is my 4th or 5th Magic Bullet in the last maybe 15-20 years, it has always been a great investment and I use it at least 5 times a week to make my breakfast fruit smoothie. Unfortunately, I am not having a good experience with the one I just bought on July 23, 2023. I have been using it, but it appears to be overheating very quickly. It is not even lasting long enough to blend my fruits. After using this for so many years I know that there is something wrong, the smell alone is awful, the smell of burnt plastic and it lingers. I am a little afraid of using it anymore because I do not want it to overheat and cause a fire, that is my current concern. Unfortunately, I did not anticipate any issues after having so many before, so I do not have the box either and all the parts have been washed prior to use, since it is used on foods. I hope that I can work something out for a return and to get one that does not smell likes it is going to catch on fire.Sept 2023 update - I did exchange the first one I got and am VERY SAD to say that I am experiencing the same problem. It works for a few second then stops and smells like it is burning. I have to wait a few minutes then try again. It is time consuming and frustrating. Until this version, the magic bullet was the best product. I used to blend frozen fruits all the time, forget that. I am so disappointed and will have to find a new investment, I am unsure if I can wait until this one stops working completely. I have had good luck with Ninja products, so that I will look there."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Just got this today and looks great. My one issue is that I ordered the 11 piece set yet counting everything that came within the box (besides the instruction manual and warranty card) there is only 10 pieces. So my question is where is the 11th piece
"The “large” size is not even big enough to put a normal amount of smoothie ingredients in and then when I went to blend, it took several minutes and several shakes/removal of the container to blend everything together so I wouldn’t recommend."
"Finally got around to using this… complete junk. Barely half full of fruit  and juice and spinach and I had to stop it so many times to stir it. Took almost 15 minutes to make a smoothie… I’ll say again complete junk. Because it took so long, I can already smell the engine burning. I have a Hamilton smoothie maker and I’ll just stick to that one."
It worked great until it randomly popped out after I left it running nonstop for maybe 3 minutes max. It was really hot and now won’t work anymore. Are you kidding? It wasn’t blending anything solid or tough either. Just cheap.
"I have been using the Magic Bullet for smoothies (once a day) for the past 20 years. Initially it would last for about 5 years. Different things would go wrong eventually, like the black plastic ring over the slots would break, the rotation device that holds the blade would break, or the motor would die.  In the last 5 years, I have replaced my Magic Bullet 3 times. The most recent one I bought in April 2022. It never worked well. I could never lock in the cup because one of the tabs would get stuck. I had to unplug, turn upside down, and really force cup hard to release! Also the motor ran hot, and would overheat and shut off in about a minute - my smoothie was no longer smooth! I am in the process of, hopefully, getting a replacement! I have never had a problem getting a replacement if something went wrong within the 1 year warranty time. I hope this is still the case.  The key is to register your Bullet right away, so warranty is effective.In case you are wondering why in the world I keep buying these MB’s, it is because the cups are the right size for my daily smoothie. Other machines have cups that are too big. I like the simplicity of it, and it is seriously inexpensive. For any other blending purposes, I use a full size blender, or food processor."
"It's a cheap blender and it works as well as a cheap blender. There's probably something else for the same price that can run for more than a minute without problems. There's a discreetly placed label on this thing saying not to run it for more than a minute. It smells like burning rubber when I use it and it's already failed on me once. Like, it just stopped blending for a day. I'm not going to ask for a refund because I got what I paid for. Ignore the ads that make this thing look like a great blender, its a cheap blender with a good ad campaign, that's it."
I got this to replace my old one when it started to give out after 10+ years of frequent use. This model is nowhere near as sturdy or as powerful as my older one was. The new one cuts out a lot and does not blend as well.
I had this exact model of Magic Bullet that I purchased from a different retailer and after a couple months of light use (about once every two weeks) the motor just stopped working. Purchased another one here on Amazon and it did the same thing. Works great when it actually works but won’t ever purchase another Magic Bullet again because of the very short lifespan.
I like the number of cops that come with this blender. I also like the size of the blender. The only thing I didn't like is that it feels a little cheap and that it might break really easy. I ended up returning this item.
I used it like maybe 3 times and my electric blinked and the cord completely disconnected! It gave a huge spark and blew the cord clear off of it! I called the company and complained and explained what happened they sent me a new one !
"The first one I bought burned out in a day or two and so I got a replacement. I had a magic bullet from a year ago and that burned out too. I know they are cheap but it’s very disappointing. I will not be buying another magic bullet and unfortunately, I think I have to bite the bullet (lol) and get a Vitamix. It takes a long time to blend simple things and does not get everything, even if I keep it on for a while or take it off and shake it up and put it back on it does not get everything."
I was looking for a replacement for my last blender. Mainly used for making smoothies for my kids. It’s decent for the price but definitely doesn’t work as well as my last one. Tend to have chunks that don’t fully blend every time.
The product wasn’t the worst I’ve owned but we used frozen fruit no ice and it took forever to blend along with a lot of dropping and stirring it up.It also only made one smoothie before we had to unplug it for 20 mins as it had stopped due to what I assume was over heating.Definitely not worth it.
I've had it the motor just turn off on me a few times when I've had it says eight large ice cubes and I've had about eight excuse in there and it doesn't seem like it's as good and sturdy built like the bigger one is I'm a little disappointed I mean it definitely gets the job done but it has a hard time when you put like a large ice cubes in it but if it's just like yogurt and some fruit it's perfectly fine but when there's ice cubes or something you'll smell the motor working extra hard and sometimes it'll just shut off on you and has to like cool down I probably wouldn't buy it again though I would just go for the bigger size one
I have a10 years old magic bullet. I loved it so much that I bought another one to replace the old guy. I got the new unit all right but couldn't find the seal rings anywhere in the package.
"This blender is okay but it only has one speed option. It can blend but not pulse or puree. That's my only grip. otherwise, it works fine. I recommend but just know what you're getting."
"I had two problems with this product.First, it's small. The cups are about have the size of competitor's products. The product description does not tell you how many ounces the cups hold. I couldn't even find it in the manual. (I measured the largest cup at only 16 oz. Not enough for my smoothie.)Second, it does not do a decent job. In order to make it small, the diameter is smaller than usual, which means that the blades are shorter than the competitors. So, for the same RPM, the ends of the blades are moving slower. When I blended a drink with strawberries (at room temperature) for about 45 seconds, there were still hunks of strawberry that would not make it through the straw.Overall, it was a waste of money. I bought a competitor's product."
"Motor stop twice, smell like electric burn while making beet juice, had to unplug, turn it off for 15 minutes.Third time it happened again, had to stop, wait til the next day, very frustrating."
"Ok. I use it for margaritas. Yes chopping up ice. I think that is not recommended. At any rate, ive used the full size Bullet for years w no issues. Works great for frozen margaritas. I got the small one to use in my SUV as it uses less power. Power is at a premium when camping.  The small one doesnt chop the ice up to a smooth consistency.  Thus, im having to run it twice as long.  No net power savings. Lesson learned... Get the big one."
"It seems to be a trend lately where manufacturers of all kinds of devices assume that everyone will be plugging their device into an outlet inches away. It's annoying. I bought this to replace a 15 year old Keurig. My old Keurig barely reached the outlet. It had like 1"" of slack. This new one doesn't reach at all.I measure both cords. The old cord is 36"" and the new cord is 31"". The answers from Keurig about this on this page are relating to an older model. I also didn't see anywhere in the product specs that it listed the cord length. Another thing I saw from Keurig was that some of the cord is tucked inside the machine and to pull it out. That's not accurate either.I had to buy an extension cord. Now I don't have coffee until the extension cord gets here. Come on Keurig, spend the extra 25 cents to make the cord at least 36"" long. Not a great experience here."
"The first one I received stopped working almost immediately, it had the same problem with the one I had just threw away. It would heat up then when i started brewing the power would cut off. Either a manufacture flaw or i was sent a refurbished one that wasn't fixed. They replaced it and got another one within 5 days. I noticed that if you brew more than 3 cups in succession it cuts of like the other ones but i usually only do 2 cups so i haven't turned it back in yet. When i have company and can't make 3 cups again I will be letting the seller know and I will not be purchasing another Keurig product."
"I bought this less than six months ago.  I use good-sized coffee cups.  Not huge, but most are 16 ounces.  This coffee maker has three size options.  The ""large"" cup option delivers the same output as the medium (I measured, both 8 oz.), which means my cups only fill halfway.  Because the coffee maker creates just enough hot water for only one cup at a time, I have to wait for it to heat up before pushing the ""large"" cup option a second time.  I drink coffee throughout the day as I work, so this is an annoyance.  I am buying a replacement."
"I purchased a Keurig 475 for the house and, at Amazon, this Keurig 55 for the office. Both of these are part of the brand new 2.0 generation. When I used them, I was surprised at how bad the coffee tasted no matter what brand I used. It was flat and tasteless. I had Keurig-brewed coffee before and it had been better, although certainly not as good as coffee made with a press or filter drip system. Also, the coffee was lukewarm a minute after brewing. I thought this was odd. Then last week I was visiting a building that had an old Keurig coffee brewer and I had brought my own K-cups knowing that the ones provided were not very good. The coffee brewed by that machine was both hotter and tasted better and I realized what the problem was: the new Keurigs don’t heat the water at a high enough temperature to correctly brew coffee so its aromatic components are fully expressed. I searched the net using google about new Keurigs and brew temperature and got dozens of results that confirmed my conclusion.The proper temperature to brew coffee is 195-205 deg F. I know this since brew temperature is an important consideration to make good espresso which I have done for many years. Since I am a scientist, I conducted a simple experiment. I had three different thermometers on hand (a digital one, a laboratory-grade mercury one, and one designed to measure coffee and espresso brew temperature that uses a temperature-sensitive spring), and used them to measure (1) the temperature of water coming out of the brew head, (2) the temperature of the water collecting immediately in the cup, and (3) the temperature of the water after one minute. I then repeated these measurements with brewed coffee rather then freshly-heated water.Water and coffee will cool in the cup immediately and also after one minute. Coffee will be cooler than water because the coffee grounds that filter the water will also cool it. The temperatures were consistent with these facts. For both Keurigs, freshly-heated water out was 175 deg F, water in the cup immediately was 165 deg F, and water after one minute was 155 deg F. All three thermometers had these results within 2 degrees. Coffee out was 170 deg F, coffee immediately in the cup was 160 deg F, and coffee in the cup after one minute was 150 deg F, all 5 deg F cooler than water. The primary thing to notice here is that 175 deg F brew temperature is 20 deg LOWER than the lowest recommended brew temperature for coffee, 195 deg. After one minute, coffee in the cup is 150 deg which is not hot. This coffee will be lukewarm in another minute or two. Of course, if you add cold milk or half & half to your coffee, as I do, the coffee will be even cooler. My Keurig coffee with a very small amount of half & half in the cup after one minute was 140 deg F. (Note: the Keurig K475’s brew temperature can be adjusted; I adjusted mine to the highest possible temperature when I started it the first time. The K55’s temperature cannot be adjusted but it is permanently set to the highest brew temperature, 175 deg F. Why Keurig would want to provide an option in the K475 for any brew temperature cooler than 175 deg is a mystery to me. 175 deg should be the LOWEST adjustable brew temperature.)I read in the reviews that many Keurig purchasers returned their machines and bought something else. The selection of machines capable of brewing using K-cups is meager. One popular model is the Bunn My Cafe brewer which several reviewers and commenters claimed brewed coffee at 200 deg F. So I returned the K475 to the store I purchased it from, got a full refund, and gave the K55 to my wife—who prefers lukewarm coffee—for her office, and bought a Bunn My Cafe from Amazon. I tested it just as I did with the Keurig. Its water out/brew temperature was 195 deg F, not 200 deg as some claimed but still 20 deg hotter than the Keurigs and certainly in the range of proper coffee brewing temperature (although at the very bottom of the range). Every other temperature I tested with the three thermometers was 20 deg higher than the corresponding Keurig temperature. For example, freshly heated water in the cup was 185 deg, and brewed coffee in the cup was 170 deg after one minute, 160 deg if I added a very small amount of half & half. The brewed coffee was much better, with better flavor and more character, just like the coffee I was had obtained from old-model Keurigs that brewed at higher temperatures (these are not available anymore except in used condition and I wouldn’t recommend buying one because Keurigs wear out after a few years). The Bunn coffee was also hotter, of course, and didn’t become lukewarm for several extra minutes, usually long enough to finish an 8-ounce cup without it becoming too cool. It was clear to me that Keurig lowered the brewing temperature in their new line of machines by an outrageous 20 deg F to protect themselves from human scalding liability litigation without any consideration or mention of how well their machines brewed coffee at the proper temperature for the enjoyment of their customers.I read one comment chain in which several Keurig purchasers complained about the too-low brewing temperature and some very polite but stupid Keurig advocate kept recommending work-arounds. First he claimed that Keurigs heat the water to 192 deg for brewing, but that is untrue and nobody believed him anyway. Then he said: Heat your cup with hot water before using it for brewing. Buy an expensive stainless steel cup with double wall construction that provides superior insulation. Use a cup with a narrow rim that reduces cooling by having a smaller area for heat to escape. Put the coffee in a pre-heated travel mug that has a lid to keep the coffee hot. Heat the coffee in the microwave after you brew it. And so on. One very perceptive and angry responder pointed out that people buy Keurigs for convenience and don’t wish to indulge in time-consuming or expensive work-arounds. If they wanted good coffee with all the extra trouble, they would just brew it like they had before (filter drip, French press, espresso, etc.). Keurigs provide fast coffee for people in a rush with little extra time in the morning or during the day. Also, heating coffee in the microwave denatures the coffee by destroying the hundreds of aromatic organic compounds in the coffee with electromagnetic radiation. Microwave related coffee just tastes bad—I’m sure you’ve noticed. Why damage your coffee every time you brew it with a Keurig by heating it in the microwave? Keurig should just brew it right the first time.So I can’t recommend ANY Keurig 2.0 model. But I do recommend the Bunn My Cafe even though it is not quite as convenient as a Keurig. Also, there are other K-cup compatible coffee brewers such as Cuisinart. I haven’t tried one of those but you can and tell us the results."
"Keurig is good brand, however, the pot started spewing out everywhere.  Taking a chance on buying same one but had to pay full price compared to last one bought 4 months ago."
"This is my very first review that will list pros and cons. Those of you who are avid coffee drinkers, like me, might be interested in what I am about to say. The above model was purchased to replace Keurig's original B60 which I had for a little over 15 yrs. As you know Keurig was the first manufactuer to introduce convenience for us coffee fanatics. The B60 at the time sold for the same price ($150) no matter where purchased, it was a strong built machine, simple operation, never quiet., and still working when I decided to give it a rest for the many good yrs of service. A few yrs ago the B60 sounded as if heavy trucks started their engines, in a closed environment, at the same time, but the machine kept going, producing hot coffee in less time than the Classic, meaning didn't have to wait the few seconds for water to reheat, you could just keep filling coffee cups one after another. Other companies joined the convenience era introducing their versions which made Keurig produce more models, some with fancy features. However, in my opinion, Keurig's mass production to keep up with the competition resulted in poor quality control. I spent time reading reviews from different sites, have friends who purchased more than one of the newer models,  (some up to 3, in a short period of time)  for lack of performance or some kind of problem. I took a chance on the above Classic model because I don't need extra features and the cost was a good deal. If the machine last a yr I won't be too disappointed, I'm convinced it will never last as long as the B60, I have yet to read a review of newer Keurig models lasting that long. Wish I understood why Keurig discontinued a great model. The classic is light weight, cheaply made. The handle is some form of plastic, B60 was heavy duty thick stainless steel handle, the water cover was heavier. The classic is all plastic, including the drip plate. I made a cup of coffee and being used to loud banging sounds, I didn't know it was working so I  watched the Classic brew, it is a quiet machine and it was a pleasure not to hear sounds as if the machine was going to explode. Using the smaller size cup 3X, the button for ""add water"" comes on.  Never had that experience with the B60, nor did a light come on after each cup to heat the water. With the B60 you could make cup after cup, always hot, without waiting, until you notice the machine needs water. I also don't think this produces the coffee hot enough. Right now, the only feature I like about the Classic is that it's quiet. As I said, if it last a year or 2 fine, if not I'll buy a different model. I don't think a different model with a higher price is going to make much difference. Keurig is mass producing and they have yet to answer any of my concerns inquiring into the newer models. There are a lot of updates, modern features to all kinds of appliances we once owned. I'm all for that, I wasn't looking for a replacement, just a good, strong, simple operating machine to produce coffee whenever I want at a hot temperature.  The B60 came with a booklet that contained several pages, including outlining the descaling process. I'll admit it was inconvenient having to wait 4 hrs after running the machine through with vinegar, especially for someone born and raised in Brooklyn who's family past time was drinking coffee!. From what I  learned about all the Keurig models out there, none will ever last as long as my B60. Maybe someday Keurig will bring it back as an anniversary promotion. UPDATE TO REVIEW: It's now 2 months, I spoke to a Keurig CS agent, was told the water temp s 190 degrees, I find that difficult to believe. The Be 60 was only 185 and extremely hot. This machine is not producing hot coffee, Keurig did state something might be wrong with the machine, they are willing to replace it but I doubt another same model will operate differently. I had hoped Keurig would apply a credit to what I spent on this machine towards the purchase of a different model. If I buy another than the cost btw both machines will be well over $200. If you are a constant coffee drinker like me and like your coffee really hot, I don't recommend  the Classic. I understand we all have different tastes but I do believe when it concerns coffee, we want it hot."
Well I had a Keurig machine and a friend like it so much I gave it to her. The next few days I regretted my decision. Amazon was having a sale so I purchased a new one in Red. I find the Keurug easy to fill the cup size choices and how have a cup of coffee in minutes. I have now two of the keurig machines. Under the drip screen I placed a piece of aluminum foil to catch the drips. Plus the cup holder is removable so I can fill my tumbler cup.
"I recently bought this Keurig machine to replace my old Keurig coffee machine. The new machine has a beautiful color, and important to me ,makes hot coffee, I do not like Luke warm coffee.These 2 factors are the 2 compliments for the machine, however, this coffee machine must be a defective production, as the first time I order the machine, I had to return the same, because the lid to the water tank did not fit right and left a gap, therefore I always had tiny air  water bubbles inside the water tank, also the water tank itself did not fit correctly unto the machine there was also a good size gab between the machine and the tank. I contacted Amazon and the exchange was fast, and friendly, unfortunately the new machine has the same problem. the water tank fits a little better onto the machine, but still  has gab, most of all the lid to the tank doe not fit right either, therefore leaving water bubbles on the inside of the water tank again. This looks very unsanitary, and looks like there is something in the fresh brewing water. I wished Amazon would have told me in the beginning, that these machines are 2 quality, and I wold have not bought this machine, or at least sold these machine at a good size discounted price. I will not exchange again, it is just too much trouble to do this a second time.I do not recommend buying this coffee maker. There are also coupons for Keurig coffee inside the box with an expiration date of 12/31/2021.Amazon I love you, but this is not right!"
"The keurig is nice, but I did not get the filter with it. Waiting on a response from the company."
takes longer to heat up  coffee not as hot as original 9 yr old unit
"Does the job but this is not anywhere near as well built as our old one. Plastic is thinner, water capacity is lower, water condenses on inside of top which causes leaks. Loved our old one which was well made. Why ruin a good thing by making this cheap design. If costs went up, fine - charge me more - but don’t compromise on the quality."
"The water tank is awkward to fit back into place after filling. At first I thought I’d get used to it, and have to some extant. This morning I thought I had it lined up, but nope! You can imagine the rest.ive had this unit for 9 months, and still struggle with the water tank. Hence the 3 stars."
"Last Sunday my older model broke so ordered the same model, first thing I noticed it wasn't as wide and much lighter. The lever that opens to load pod feels flimsy, the entire machine feels cheaply made"
"I had a Keurig 1 which worked great however started making grinding noises after 10 years.  This replacement works fine but a few irritating things.One, the filter holder that goes in the water compartment is now something you have to buy separately - my old one came with the filter holder and a filter or two.  Not terrible - it was around $12 but that's how they nickel and dime you.Second, so much of it is now plastic instead of stainless steel.It's very quiet and so far problem-free, but obviously Keurig is another company that's cutting quality even though the cost of the product is fairly high.The original Keurig held a lot of water in the tank.  This one holds much less.We'll see  if it stands the test of time."
"As stated above this is my second purchase of this model of coffee maker. Our first one was purchased from a brick store, lasted about 3 years and then started to have issues - specifically it will not brew unless I open and close the lid about 3 or 4 times then it decides to brew (sometimes over brewing and overfilling the cup which is I assume from pressing the button 3 times but with power cycled off then back on and reopening the lid). We have had this one less then a full month and it is exhibiting the same exact behavior.I have cleaned the needle on top with a paperclip through the little hole. I have cleaned the bottom basket. We have tried different brand of pods ranging from authentic Keurig pods to most recently the Amazon brand of pods - same issue with them all. I am pretty sure I have been thorough with my trouble shooting (I have not listed everything here and I am amazed if your still reading this lol).I am going to contact Amazon support today and do some more searching, maybe on Youtube and see if there is some secret technique I missed. Maybe if I sacrifice a chicken to the coffee gods I might get a cup in the evening before work otherwise I see this machine being returned and possibly just going with a cheaper model of Keurig. The water reservoir is nice but filling a mug then pouring it in before isn't that much of a inconvenience imo. I feel like I payed an extra 40 dollars for the convenience and wish I realized this earlier lol.I will return to update this regardless if I eventually get my coffee or not. You will be able to tell if I got my coffee or not by how snarky my return is. Fingers crossed.Update: I don't know what I/we did to make the machine work again. I read online that they say to brew 6 full mugs of straight water through it to make sure it is completely clean after cleaning the needle hole and basket. No chickens were harmed but I may threaten the machine with feeding a puppy to a snake if it decides to stop working again. Actually it'll just go back to Amazon and I'll get a smaller model. (My paranoia thinks they added something to the water and that is the reason it isn't working but that is nonsense as is most of this review.)TL:DR Replaced a non working model with a new one. Having same issues as old one. No animals were harmed in this review."
This was just like my other one of about 5 years old.  The material is thinner than my previous one so I am hoping it lasts as long. Time will tell. Units' features are exactly like older one I replaced with this.
Nice looking coffee maker new timer function to allow you to set it and come back and it’s ready.
"I bought this as my other keurig stopped working, and I needed coffee asap.  I don't use the timer, so I got this one. It does not brew as well as the one with a strong option, so I returned it and am getting the other one delivered today.  It is worth the extra money to have coffee brewed better. The one I'm getting is the same as my old one that malfunctioned, just a newer model."
"Purchased Dec 2022. I only use it on weekends to maybe make 2 cups of coffee. It worked fine until June 2024 when it would turn itself off once I put a kcup in and tap the size cup I wanted. Cleaned the machine several times. Today 8/18/24 it did the same, turned off and now won't even power on. Will not spend this much money on a Keurig again."
"I am returning this kurige. Not made properly, wobbled, lid doesn't fit. Anderson I ordered a different Keurig."
"Purchased too quickly assuming it would have the same features as the one that I had for many years.  My bad.  It doesn't have a filter; of course, no notification for changing the filter or time to descale."
