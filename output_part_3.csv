"The phone was a hit,however I thought unlocked meant I could use with any provider and I couldn't do so, so it had to be returned"
"I soooooooo regret purchasing this phone, poooooorrrrr picture quality andi I am unable to touch the speaker when on a call to put the phone on speaker. Terrible phone"
"I've always bought inexpensive phones and never had issues like this one. I've had this phone for TWO months and freezes all the time now, constantly have to restart to get it to work"
It does not have Wi-Fi calling and where I live it is essential to have it so I am highly dissatisfied with it
My phone was broken when I received it had to use as it was battery did not last 2 days
Absolutely terrible for even the basics. Slower than what it's advertised as. Any Bluetooth connected devices constantly cut out or just don't feed sound in.
Phone seems nice but it would've been nice to get some paperwork to get info on the phone and the features. Guess I'll figure it out.
"I love Motorola phones, but this model is not compatible with most networks. I don't know why. Sadly, I had to return it."
"I had to return the phone because the screen was not functioning properly. It was making a static electricity sound when you touched the screen. Also, it was not registering touches correctly. The phone has a couple of small nicks in the screen protector. I tried to return the phone, but for some reason, they would not pick it up. So I had to drive to an Amazon return center to send it back. They returned the phone on the 5th of November. It's said it would refund on 27 of November. That was 22 days. Then, on the 27 it changed and said not till December 19th! There is no reason it should have taken 22 days in the first place. But now it's going to take longer than 43 days! That's nuts! A month and a half to get a refund!  Especially since they changed the refund date on the day I was originally supposed to get it! But what can you do? I wonder if I will ever get it now! I would not purchase from them again. Anybody who takes a month and a half to refund your money. Is not a company you should do business with. Update: They have now changed all the dates again. They are now saying they did not receive it until the 19th of November, and the refund will not be given until December 20th! Absolutely Nutz! I never seen a worse return policy in my life. Most places will refund you within 7 days of receiving the item! For some reason, it takes these guys 2 months!  Plus, they keep changing their dates. That is Shady!"
"Motorola Edge 2022Phone itself is good but the 5000 mAh battery life is terrible. Even with all battery saver features on, you can still literally watch it run down. It's also a penalty of having the exact percentage show on screen, however the phone is much slower and laggier with battery saver on so you're kinda getting penalized both directions. (battery life and performance)Camera so far struggles to focus at times and has some processing judder trying to keep the image in frame but it's a quality camera if you know what you're doing.The screen is nice being an OLED but so dark compared to traditional lcd I'm unsure it's worth the tradeoff but much better to look at than my 1080p LCD. The colors and contrast are punchier and more vibrant. It does make browsing easier on the eyes but eats battery life I'm sure of it.Im a hurricane survivor that lost most of what I own in the storm and after not having a phone for awhile I can't help but tell you I feel like multitasking MONSTER with this phone.There's a few hitches and lagspikes with the Mediatek Helio in case some of you are concerned. Some of my previous apps didn't install either. But all in all in holds up ok but you'll notice the difference in camera processing, multitasking, or if you're a speed demon on your phone.For the price I paid of $140 on sale it's a smoking hot deal, especially if youre in a financial bind like I am. You won't find a better deal on a phone or this quality I can 100% guarantee it, but the battery life is major letdown for me, because I'm the type to appreciate longer battery life over quicking charge times.I would say if your financially unstable I'd definitely recommend a phone like this but if you have financial stability a newer phone should undoubtably offer a better battery life, better security features/software, and I think a brighter screen as 2020-2022 rough for Motorola brightness as even my moto ace had terrible brightness and it was an lcd.To those that care I charged it correctly to 100% before using, never inopportunistically charged it, and gave it a couple full charges/discharged before reviewing it."
"I decided to give Motorola a try and bought this phone, something way different then my normal galaxy S23. These galaxy's are expensive,  $800 for my last one, and by the time I pay it off, 3 years, it's shot. I take care of my stuff, the galaxy being no different. Once paid off, it seems they start over heating, not holding a charge for more then a day if your lucky, eat. ( you get the picture, I'm tired of wasting my money ) I received the Moto Edge 23 new, and unpacked and charged it. Once that was taken care of, I attached both phones together and did the smart switch, which went great ! Next up was navigating the apps, and settings, getting it ready for my personal taste and style. Easy enough. From there on out, things went wonky. My calls were echoing on the receivers side, my side , I couldn't figure out how to increase the volume when on speaker phone. Taking pictures really had me going, I'm not a big picture taker, so all those settings, different camera lenses,  had me so frustrated, just trying to snap a quick picture of my fur baby. The pictures weren't coming out, and when I tried to send the picture to an sd card, lol, there isn't a place for 1, so I had to order space for the ""cloud"" which is another $5 a month. I went to use googles app , where you take a picture, and google finds the item for you, I was looking for the name of a plant, and I couldn't figure out which camera lense to use, the app wouldn't take a picture of the plant, to find the name. 2 hours later, still hadn't figured it out, so gave up. The bottom line was everytime I tried to do something with this phone, it ended up being hours of research and trying to figure out how to do every day normal, simple stuff on it ! I even had my lap top out with u-tube videos showing me how to use this phone and it still was rough going. After 4 days of being totally frustrated and getting no where, I sent it back.I'm not completely illiterate when it comes to this stuff, but darn, this phone had me ready to smash it, but at $600 I couldn't do that obviously! Lol !I don't know if I had a bad phone, it was listed as new, not reconditioned,  but the upgrades etc that were different then the galaxys, had me going right back to the galaxy S24, and I'm praying after it's paid off I can still get some more years of use from it. But history with the galaxy has me doubting it.I'm giving the Moto Edge 3 stars for the beauty of it, the screen colors are vivid, if I could have been able to take and print a picture,  it would have looked awesome. Other then those few things, I can't think of any more pros, and as for cons, here again, to me it was a very confusing phone to use once you have it set up ! Good luck on this pick, if you choose it !"
"This phone may be more of a 2.5 rating. It has some good features but it definitely lags. There are times that if I'm using an app or doing a Google  search while watching YouTube, YouTube will freeze, blur or disappear from the screen. When I try to re-enter I can't. The screen will go black except for one top corner. The dual camera view is nice, but you can't flip the camera during recording with the single camera view. It's nice that if you double tap text, you can highlight a word to look it up, but this makes using apps with double tap to color highlight a nightmare. It's like a game of whack a mole to tap the right spot at the right time so you can highlight rather than look something up. Sometimes I can't properly start, or exit an app. I've noticed this happen often with Google Maps/Directions.  The device is not overloaded with apps, so lagging and app crashes shouldn't be an issue. It has to be something in the way the phone is manufactured.Battery life is good. There are some easy to equip shortcuts.This phone is serving the purpose of a temporary fix to my very old Samsung phone that had a screen issue. I was going to make the Motorola my device until I can afford a new Samsung, but I am seriously considering switching back to the old phone now that it's repaired due to some of the lagging from this Motorola device."
"Phone was inexpensive and works well if you only need basic functions.  Camera is very glitchy and would sometimes take a picture, but when you'd go back into your photos later, the picture would be whatever was showing in the lense two seconds after you took the picture.  It didn't do this all the time, just some of the time.  I don't keep a lot of apps on my phone and no social media apps, but the phone always seemed to run slowly and need a lot of load time.  If you need a phone to make phone calls and browse the Internet, this one is a great value, but if you need anything more than basic functionality I would opt for something else.  I kept this phone for 5 months and then upgraded."
"If you can get this phone for a decent price, its ok. The battery life is poor I get around 3.5 hours of screen time. Which is disappointing I came from a Oneplus 9 pro which had a smaller battery and a less efficient processer. But the battery life of that phone when new was probably close to 6 hours. I think the phone has bad firmware that causes the battery drain. For one thing if you are viewing a mostly dark screen and not doing anything you can see the screen brightness flicker (yes auto brightness is off). I assume due to the phone changing power states. Its very distracting.The software is mostly good, the gestures and karate chop to turn on the flashlight are nice. I can not get the phone to stay connected to a poor signal WIFI. Usually there is a toggle switch to turn off constantly looking for a better signal. The only solution I've found is to pull the sim card entirely, which is a shameThe fingerprint reader is nice, but if you leave your phone on the desk and approve 2fa all day its not actually as convenient as a screen finger print reader. So this might be a personal preferenceI only tried the ""ready for"" on WIFI, and it wasn't actually very useful more than just plain old screen sharing. But maybe you could have a use for it, like showing notifications on your desktop. I'm sure wired is way better but didn't try it outMacro camera on this is great, honestly I don't use the other cameras muchI love a flat screen, I really wish more high end phones came with a flat screen. its a beautiful phone, too bad putting a case on it ruins the look, and ruins the feel in hand/great haptics of this phone. I also wish this phone was 16/512GB. That is the ideal spec in my mind. Any phone that does that without being $1000 will get my vote"
"Motorola makes great devices but I think they're trying to keep up with the major other players Samsung,Google,Apple and kind of charge around the same price range for these devices and these devices cannot compete with pixels,galaxyFE even the S line ups, They can compete with the Nord series from one plus, for the price range of $599.99 thats steep you can get the Motorola Thinkphone for 399.99 The edge 2023 can't even sniff even close to the think phone in performance. There are positives about this phone I have no issues with performance the cameras take real good decent pictures if you're not a photographer you will be pleased with point and shoot I don't take pictures in the dark because who looks at dark pictures anyway I know I don't. The materials the vegan leather back is nice but that front glass I got to say it's trash. In 2 days I got really bad scratches on the front and I've not put this device in harm's Way to get scratches that deep so get a screen protector immediately because the glass is fragile. If you like lightweight phones this is ideal for you I need something a little sturdier but I have no complaints but overall they are better options in the $600 price range then this device 350 it's a steal I'm not telling somebody don't buy it but consider your options and what you can get around the same range that could be a better performer before you go and spend $600."
I'm old so I'm no expert with smart phonesBut if you touch the screen wrong when receiving a call it is almost impossible to answerPeople don't hear me as good on speaker as my Apple phonePrice was good as I bought a never used 2022 modelDoes have a lot of good features some badWould rate it 3and 1/2 stars but not quite 4
"I learned from trying my husband's smart phone that this one was over my head.  I learned that he has a Motorola Edge phone like this one, and it was not for me.  I'm not a technical person like he is.  And while it was affordable, that's also the problem.  How can I rate a phone I never even took out of the original packaging.  One star isn't fair, but no stars apply for something I didn't use.  I could rate it based on my husband's phone.  In any case, I need to save my $ for the phone I do need, one that I'm excited to tackle learning with my husband's help.  I need one that dictates, and I know those are very pricey but something I'm willing to wait for.  So based on my use of his phone, I can only say I can't understand it.  So I'll give it maybe 3 stars even though it doesn't seem right.  It's the best I can do."
"I see others have had the same complaint.  The touch screen is awful.  It doesn't recognize my finger touch.  I have to keep pressing hard for it to register my selection.  I hate this phone because it makes everything take longer to do. Sometimes it gets stuck.  Worst phone I ever purchased.  I almost never give anything a low rating but felt obligated to let the next person know not to buy this phone.  I should have returned it but thought I just needed to get used to a different touch.  No, it wann't me, something is wrong with how they made this one!"
Every day I need to recharge halfway thru the day. One 45 minute conversation on top of regular use empties the battery.
"Got tired of paying $600 to $750 at Verizon AMD saw this one for half that and have it a try. Was very easy to set up and transfer data from my old phone. I've had it for almost four months now with no real issues.But the thing I have a major issue with is this phone will randomly bring up a prompt to download tiktok from the play store. It doesn't matter what I am doing, I can be in the middle of watching something and it will pop up. I tried to call my wife and when pressed call the phone brought up that prompt and only once I closed it did the call go through.This is highly annoying and really not acceptable. I can't find a way to turn off those prompts, Even when I force close the play store it will come back.Other than that the phone has worked pretty good for me but having that pop up makes me suspicious."
"Battery life is definitely WAY too short, it went from 33% to like 15% after about 10 minutes out of the box which is ridiculous, however after I charged it all the way the battery didn't die that quick but man the false advertising is beyond shameful, ""2 day battery""...yeah sure. It might last you a day at most.You CAN switch the 144hz screen to 60hz in the display settings to reduce battery drainage, but the first impression I got from this phone was extremely disappointing, I will be returning this phone, which sucks because the screen is beautiful, but the processor/battery just don't seem to be able to handle a 144hz display, also this phone has no headphone jack."
other than the camera being super slow I like the phone . I
I purchased this phone from Amazon and when I received the phone and went to set it up the first thing that comes up on the screen is spectrum not Motorola. This phone was made for spectrum cell service by Motorola and not advertised correctly on the website therefore I returned the phone Because it was not Motorola and it had apps on it that said spectrum
"This phone is fast and runs smoothly. The Motorola gestures are not found in any other phone brand, which is something I cannot live without. I've had Motorola phones for the past 10 years, but ever since  Lenovo took over, the quality has went downhill.The back of this phone is glass, it is completely shattered, even with a protective case on at all times. The glass is also sharp and will cut you. Why on earth make the back of a phone glass? There is significant screen burn, most significantly at the top. There are also thin light and thick dark stripes running vertically across the whole screen. It is not nearly as bright as when first purchased. This shouldn't happen with light use after a short period of time. This was the most expensive phone I've ever purchased. I typically hold on to them until the point of non functionality, which is typically about 3 years. It is wasteful to keep replacing an expensive electronic device every year, and shouldn't happen. The phone still functions smoothly, but the shattered rear glass and significant screen burn will only get worse over time."
"This phone is crap, It lost ALL my contact names, left some numbers but no name and it saved some numbers I added, and then sometimes it won't save them. I had over 300 Contacts in my phone, now I have less than 20. Had to call numbers to find out who they were and you know most of THOSE were SPAM. When this smart phone started acting like a Smart Ass phone, the closing date to return the phone had passed. So NO MO MOTO FO ME. I would love an upgrade but I'm not paying full price for another phone. BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
if it wasn't for the power button issue it would be a great phone.  plenty of battery life.  unfortunately about a week into owning it pressing the power button results in nothing showing on the display.  power button is set to start camera on double press and that works but still black screen.  you can hear the camera sound when you press the screen where the button should show.  it's very random and very frustrating.
"SHENANIGANS! This phone has No micro SD card slot as advertised it does! The phone takes forever to charge, not a very good battery! Do not update to Android 13! Dolby Atmos is a gimmick (Dolby Atmos is a  is a surround sound technology  which uses 3D object based channel orientation utilizing overhead speakers, 24.1.10 overall). The display is the best part of this phone and would have gotten a one star without it"
"The Motorola Edge Plus seems like a good phone with the top of the line Processor, a good amount of storage and memory, however once you start using the Motorola Edge Plus, you'll soon realize that it is overpriced.Again with Android 12, phones are so bland and the Motorola Edge Plus is no exception. All Google apps for the services (Phone, Keyboard, contacts, gallery, files, Messages) with very little personality for the phone itself.The file system is fairly responsive even with a ton of pictures, the screen resolution is good, however the cameras are about right for a $300 phone. No external storage nor a headphone jack.The worst part is the touch screen inaccuracies, so many times the phone thinks I am scrolling horizontal when I was scrolling vertical. That is the most annoying part. Again, very little customization due to Android 12 and phone manufacturers giving up on adding any personality to the phone that makes it stand out from any other phone.I really don't understand the joint effect with Phone manufacturers and Android on making all phones exactly the same as any other phone on the market. Bland and boring OS layouts matching any other phone with few features and customization. It's sad.In short, if you need a phone for voice conversations, checking Facebook and uploading video to TicToc, this phone will work for you."
"During a recent road trip, the charging port on my phone suddenly malfunctioned, causing the USB-C charging cable to melt inside. This happened despite the fact that I've used the same official charging cable numerous times before without any issue. What's baffling is that my phone gave me no warning whatsoever about a potentially wet or dirty USB port. It simply occurred while the phone was charging as I was engrossed in an audiobook.When I contacted the warranty department, they inspected the port and pointed out oxidized metals and plastics, claiming it was liquid damage. However, they provided no explanation as to how they arrived at this conclusion. It's worth noting that my phone is equipped with wet or debris detection functionality, which failed to alert me to any potential issues. Had it done so, I wouldn't have risked connecting my phone to a charging port in the first place. Nor would I have endured the inconvenience of being without my phone for weeks, during which time I couldn't access essential services like emails and bank accounts that require two-factor authentication.In discussions with customer service representatives, they acknowledge the validity of my points. Yet, they seem unwilling to accept that there was no water involved in the incident. Their actions and attitude imply a lack of trust in my credibility and integrity, without providing any evidence or explanation as to how they determined it was water damage. This is not only frustrating but also unjust. Even a criminal deserves a fair trial, yet Motorola's warranty department seems to be quick to assign blame without due process.Adding to my frustration, I received an email notification about the returned phone via FedEx an hour before it actually arrived. It's evident that Motorola has no intention of honoring their warranty or engaging in a meaningful discussion about their decision. Instead, they're determined to impose their judgment without any opportunity for recourse or explanation.In summary, the lack of transparency and accountability from Motorola's warranty department is deeply disappointing and leaves me questioning their commitment to customer satisfaction."
The phone is unlocked and will work with any carrier but it is a AT&T variant meaning it gets its updates from AT&T and not Motorola. This is a big problem because it should have Android 13 or 14 but is on Android 12 and says it's up to date which means AT&T isn't updating their variant or isn't updating it in a timely manner. It would have been nice to have known that this was a carrier unlocked device and not an OEM unlocked device. Since my son is using it it's not as big a deal but I would not have purchased it had I known it was an AT&T carrier unlocked device as I would rather have had the OEM unlocked device.
"Well, had it up and running for 4 days and having to send it back for warranty. I do not have the ""edge"" lights turned on but the left ""edge"" light only decided to come on and stay on... Other than that, the phone functions as it should.Things I did not think about that I don't like:1) The widget on the primary screen after the phone is unlocked (dark circle with date, battery %, time and weather) allows you to display analog or digital time. However, the digital time format is a large font hh on top of mm. You cannot change the format to hh:mm in this widget. This is the widget that came with the phone but may have to look for another widget or I will stay with an analog clock.2) The volume buttons only control the ""media"" volume, not the ""ring"" volume while the phone is idle. To change the ""ring"" volume, you must go to the settings to lower the volume or set to vibrate. When you decide to turn the ""ring"" volume back up, the ring tone plays at the volume you set it to. Annoying!!! My previous phone changed the ""ring"" volume with the volume buttons when idle and did not play the ring tone when you turned  the volume back up..."
It's a mid android phone that constantly disconnects from android auto and requires a work around to function. I recommend getting a wireless dongle if you want to listen to music or use the GPS in your car.
I purchased this phone about two or three days ago. Love the screen and works great unlocked. But the voice to text not working on messaging when you hit the  microphone button. I called  Motorola and we even did a factory reset and it still seems to be not working correctly. They have instructed me to return to amazon and order another one. Which i have done. I will update this review after i get my new phone again and returning the one not working.. I will update when I get the new one. i wanted to put this in case anyone else had same isue with voice to text  mic not working or holding the button for google assistant.  its very sad i had to do a return  waiit 30 days for refund and pay for 2nd phone while i am waitng.. really don't like that.
"I originally purchased a refurbished model ""used like new with all accessories"" but the phone arrived missing the SIM card cover and turbo charger. I returned it and purchased another from a different seller, condition ""used, like new"". This one was also missing its cables and any other accessories (for example, they did not even include the pin to open the sim card cover). Because I like the phone model, I've decided to keep this second purchase despite the disappointing buying experience.Other notes: this phone does force you to install a lot of unnecessary apps such as Booking.com,  TikTok etc that you'll need to manually uninstall. The haptic touch sensor is not very sensitive.the audio and display are very clear."
"I have a Motorola Edge 2022, and I see this Motorola Edge 2023 as a upgrade.So, I put them side by side to compare the WIFI in the house.Everywhere I go in the house (and even outside to the drive way), Motorola Edge 2022 has excellent WIFI.However,  the Motorola Edge 2023's WIFI shows none or 1/2 of the bars for most places through out the house.When WIFI is not usable, it is basically useless for me.  Probably 80% of the time, I will be using the phone in the house with WIFI.  That's the main reason I want to return it.Another thing that I find bad when compared to the Motorola Edge 2022 is,  the finger print reader.For Motorola Edge 2022, it works flawless -- it can read finger prints even with the extra glass protection over it.  I was able to add 5 different finger prints to it, super easy.For Motorola Edge 2023,  I tried so many times, and it cannot even pick up one finger print.  It times out every time after many tries.For those people not looking to use the fingerprint to unlock, and you don't use WIFI, then this may be good for you.For me, this is getting worse than the previous generation (Motrola Edge 2022) phones."
"Why no charging block?  This thing uses TurboPower, which requires a special charging block.  Also its packed with garbage apps.  I spend a long time trying to removing all this garbage.  I am still not sure I got rid of it all.  I think this is a no retail pack.  Next time maybe I will got o Best Buy where they sell the whole package for the same price.Else, Its a nice looking phone."
"This phone.... Half of the photos I take never appear in memory.  The preview looks great but when I go back to the photo it's a picture of my foot because the actual photo is taken four seconds after the click.Slow, slow, buggy, slow.  I am almost certain my Moto Stylus was faster with less memoryMotorola isn't what it once was"
"Does not have the latest processor, but it feels snappy.  Under-screen fingerprint sensor is excellent.  Updated to Android 13 and feels faster.  Calls are clear and easy to understand.  Not too big and not too small.  Comes with oled screen.Edit 3/26/24:  I had taken one star off this product.  This phone comes with T**tok installed and F*book installed, both known to spy on users.  I can no longer trust this phone, it is a China product and from a low trust society.  Don’t do anything serious on this phone."
"Bought this phone Edge+ for my wife. It was sold as new, but appears to be used, as there is information on the phone which appears to be from a previous user"
"Battery lasts about half a day with moderate usage.  Cannot get on phone network without outside support.  Required MetroPCS support, taking several hours, in order to get working on their network so plan on that.  Decent product for the money once connectivity is established, but did not meet expectations.  Soft buttons poorly arranged, easy to put call on hold and mute by mistake.  Poor design ---Holding normally tends to cover microphone."
I'm using it right now the glass broke almost instantly after getting the phone and it's supposed to be Google Glass; I mean gorilla glass.That's a problem for Motorola they should be making stuff better than Apple at this point this is a phone should be waterproof and crackproof I mean I just saw a beta production of a watch that was so thin you could wrap it around your wrist and bend it as much as you wanted and it looked almost as crystal clear as my Acer Chromebook that I love so muchThat's a spin 311
"I purchased this for my wife at a great price during Prime days. I know it was a bit of a risk as she uses the camera on her phone constantly.The phone arrived quickly and in perfect condition.I asked her to just test drive it and take many photos before I ported her data over.The photo quality is poor, not even as good as her 6 year-old LG phone. We have returned the phone.If photos and the camera are not important to you then this is a fantastic value. The screen is beautiful and the build quality is good. Motorola features are nice too.Not the right fit for her."
"The phone itself is fine I guess but I thought we all agreed when iPhones removed their headphones jack that it's stupid and shouldn't be done. I wasn't even looking for that info in the description because I assumed it had one but it doesn't. It doesn't have a sd card slot either, so if you want more storage you'll have to buy a new phone or pay for  cloud storage which really sucks. I would NOT have bought it if I'd known it doesn't have a headphone jack or sd slot"
"I hate this phone. Motorola's ""Always On Display"" cannot be disabled on this phone. It barely works when it is supposed to and the phone will not even respond to the power button to wake it at times. It will wake when it wants to or if it decides to have the finger print reader actually work. It will not show messages on the sleep screen no matter what setting you pick. These issues render this phone almost useless to me. The touch screen needs your finger to be exactly perpendicular to the screen and even then it will ignore touches. Two day battery is barely a one day battery. Many more apps seem to have an issue working properly on this phone compared to my old phone. Fast charging is the only feature that worked as advertised, thus one star. Cross Motorola off you list of potential next phones. I did."
"Just unboxed and transferred data from old phone.  Wanted to add SD card as the ""About this item"" section indicates that: Storage: Comes with 128GB built-in storage and support for microSD cards up to 512 GB for extra capacity.I went to Motorola site and chatted with support and they indicated that 2022 Motorola Edge does not support SD cards!If I had known this, I would not have purchased the phone so a little disappointed."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Why I only got the cable and the phone and not the head to plug the phone to charge
"I wish I'd bought a replacement 2021 edge uw.Better camera and battery, everything else is pretty much the same. I do like the finish of the phone, how sleek it is. Motorola is awesome.Seller deserves 5 stars but this is a product review"
When on a call the phone momentarily cuts out.  I don't know if this is a specific problem with the phone I have or generally with all Edge plus. Only had the phone for 2 months and can't return it now. It is not my service as other phones do not cut out.
"I really like it, I came from a High-end device.  The only bad thing which is very frustrating is how slow and laggy the camera is."
"Probably would not have bought the phone had I known it didnt have a gallery app for your pictures.Only has Google Photos which saves to cloud. Maybe you like that, but Im not interested.Had to download an app to manage photos, but none of them are particularly great.ALSO, copying from old phone to this one works great, but all of your apps get locked away somewhere??? None of them load to your desktop or whatever.. only way I knew I had them was the apps section in the settings where I can see them all and open... but there was no way to get them out on to your home screen, etc.I ended up having to delete them all and reinstall from the play store to get them back.FINALLY... this isnt a new phone. Anyone else get tired of all the ""renewed"" phones? Yeah, well this one is too, despite the listing not saying so ANYWHERE."
Use for work. The worst is that the screen scratches easily. Something without sense considering that is comes with ip68 protección but doesnt hace a glass of corresponding Quality. That takes a lot away. Motorola don't have it own photo gallery or editor and depend of Google one.
"Has a very limited battery life. If you need to use it for anything you're going to have to plug it in. When you do that it gives off as much heat as the Sun.Not an issue on wireless quadlock in wind and works with the universal adapter. Just make sure you have a convenient way to keep the phone charging if you plan on long continuous screen time.It has an audio bug. Wants to be LOUD or really quiet. Sometimes hard to get the audio ""just right"" when in a restaurant or other public place."
Bought it as a gift and first thing you know the phone does not charge.  It's been two days plugged in and no success.  The gift was sent to South America.
The phone is not compatible with cgms like dex com.It is Google based .It is hard to navigate does not have good signal. Causing delays in receipt of text messages . The reason I am returning the product is it's not cgm compatible.
"Horrible battery life even when not in use.  I'm now going to try running it in battery saver mode all the time just to see if that helps.  I had gone from a full charge to zero in less than 8 hours without the battery saver on and I was not running anything.  Also, I had to adjust the screen sensitivity because I have to constantly tap on something in order for it to work. That still didn't accomplish anything. I still have to tap screen multiple times. The sensitivity issue isn't constant.  Sometimes I'll tap on something and that app will work on the first tap while other times I'll tap and it doesn't work. You almost think you're going insane as you tap harder and harder trying to resist the urge to throw your phone against the wall."
The phone is great. But buttery can't take long time usually one day just small use.Ready to not work with a HDMI connect to a USB-C hub.
"Pros: decent camera, large storageCons: no headphone jack, stylus ""ink"" skips around (I've tried many brands and types of stylus.)"
"New garbage that beeps and flashes to get my attention for things that aren’t very important. Actual texts, and calls tend to get lost in the modern mess of pre installed apps, and features that come with this thing that is trying to be a lot of whatever stuff it seems, and kind of fails as a useful phone for me, but hey, I needed 5G technology apparently in order to do my laundry here in a tech city where the landlords are too lazy to physically collect my money from their machines, and the network who sold me my last stupid smartphone just a couple years said I needed an upgrade to be able to transmit data via their network.  I am sure my next fancy new phone will remind me even more about how the world is going to hell."
"Good day. I wanted to make a comment regarding the purchase. Although I am very satisfied with the two phones purchased, I expected to receive the same ones with their chargers. The product description says ""Ultra-fast 68W TurboPower charging. Get all-day power in less than 10 minutes of charging."" To me it makes it clear that the charger is included. I wanted to express that criticism regarding the product. Thank you so much."
"I loved my previous moto, changed it bcs I needed more space and RAM. The fingerprint reader is the best thing of the phone. I am not impressed by the camera, I don't feel it is better than my old moto. The microphone is bad bad bad bad. If my husband and I are in a videocall with somebody else, the other person cannot hear my husband unless I put the phone close to him. Also, the mic does not get the noise of a whistle. I tried removing the case and nothing changed. Summary: It is not worth the money."
This phone model can't insert microSD cards.  Because don't have a tray slot for micro SD cards on a sim tray.
"I bought this to to replace Moto G that I broke the screen on, but was otherwise happy with.  Bad Idea!  Locked already on several occasions, especially if watching something on Youtube and trying to do something else.  Battery won't make it through the day.  Camera is unimpressive.  My last Motorola."
"I've had Motorola for decades many of the features built into the UI such as tomahawk chop flashlight is downright essential in my line of work.. overall, functionally, the device is as advertised.. seamless and for smartphone applications just terrific. But, there is one horrible, deal breaking problem with the speaker phone.. it's useless ..no matter to whom I'm speaking. It inevitably results in folks are complaining my voice is muffled and difficult to understand. How can the manufacturer design phones for decades and miss the target for the most essential application within the device?"
"Poor call quality. If you don't believe it. Try one out before you buy it and see if i'm right.Battery drains faster than anyone would think.The processor was having trouble opening up gmail.comMy phone, dropped dead after one hour of usage brand new out of the box.I say, stay away and look for a better one. Or if you buy it, get an extended warranty - you are going to need it.Stay away from motto play 2024, you can't upgrade the storage and only get 64. You're better with motto play 23, if you like those. But the resolution is not the greatest on these phones, but the price is."
The Phone Handles 68w supposedly but is option comes with a 30w Charger other countries get the 68w charger the phone doesn't ever reach a 68w charge max 53 watts
I've never used a Motorola phone before. This phone seems to have a delayed response situation. I ordered a Google pixel 7pro. Felt like the better way to go.
I got a deal but felt taken when it came in. It just leaves much to be desired. Finding cases and other accessories is very very limited. I was so disappointed. My Prime Day bust. Battery look and feel is good. That alone just will not cut it.
"Phone works good but would have been nice to get the 68 watt power adapter with the phone. Said in the amazon description that in the box includes power adapter, charging cable and SIM card tool kit. Mine has no power adapter and on Amazon or from Motorola the power adapter is 59.00"
I bought it 3 times and every time there was a defect I had to return it
"Do not buy this phone! I had a 2020 Edge and had cracked the screen a week or two after purchasing (should have invested in a better case). I waited months to save up and buy a replacement phone, and was sure the 2022 Edge would be an upgrade. I purchased new on Amazon and it's been a terrible experience. The interface feels the same, but the operating system is slow and clunky. The battery life is not as good. The camera system is supposed to be an upgrade, but I feel like the photos have been worse quality....I keep trying to change the settings and make adjustments to improve things. After using this phone for two weeks, the applications are not as responsive. When I wake up my phone from hibernation and try to enter my passcode, the phone is not responsive and it takes several tries to get into my phone. Today it just started restarting itself....when I checked for updates, the phone was not responsive (as if the screen was locked). When I tried to make a test phone call, nothing happened.This is not related to service- this is certainly a device issue.It's in an Otterbox since Day #1, and has not been dropped or exposed to the elements.Do not buy this phone."
The e sim works okay but the battery is not sufficient for all day use . I could start the day fully charged and by noon I have to put it on the charger again. I've taken to carrying extra battery bank so I can use the phon all day.
Product did not included charguer
"If I'd known this I would've sought out a different unlocked cell. Motorola, for the cost, you should know better. After turning it on to test it upon receiving, there was next to no battery life & quickly turned. But that's kind of a given. We don't know how long devices have been sitting in a box until we get it.Anyway, the following was NOT included with this Motorola Edge 2023:1. NO Plugin charger jack, for wall/outlet strip, to insert the 24"" inch cell cord (that they DID send) into.2. NO SIM Card.I was already set to order a specific Wireless charger specifically for this phone figuring I could function with a full charger set I presumed would be enclosed in the box to tide me over until I got the Wireless charger. But now that won't be doable in my planned out budget until 1st week of May. The date of this review is the same day I received the cell; Monday April 22, 2024.Ugh, an unseen hassle. My other cell died over 2 wks ago. Now have to go longer w/o a working mobile. It's always something."
"Unfortunately no eSIM, otherwise your typical Motorola phone."
"Slight downgrade of a processor as in the same model last year, and the fact there was no 68 watt fast charger in the box was a deal breaker!"
"Charging port works intermittently after only 4 months of use, wireless charging has the same issue.  Battery drains quickly.  Bought this as a replacement for another Motorola with charging issues.  Horrible warranty practices and services.  Would not recommend anyone purchase these phones due to their limited duration functionality."
"The software and components are so glitchy! They Freeze, take a while to load. Sometimes I have to restart my phone just to get a text message to go through. It's also affecting some of my apps and won't allow me to have picture in window which allows Netflix and Hulu to go to a small picture when I scroll to something else. Only had the phone for 2 months."
"As soon as it was out of the box I noticed it seemed to charge slowly, even on the provided 30w charger and cable. After checking the charging with an app that I've been using and have paid for on my last 4 phones I see that it's charging at about 1w off and on every few seconds. It took over 7 hours to get it fully charged the first time. That was also the last full charge that it had. Over the course of the next four days it became more and more finicky when charging until when I came home the other night it was at 7%, so on the charger it goes. When I was done in the shower I looked at it and it seemed to be turned off. It hasn't turned back on since. I've tried several chargers and cables and two different wireless chargers that all work flawlessly on my Galaxy S20+ that this was going to replace. I guess not . I'm going to have to send it back and hope j get my almost $300 back for this brand new brick they sold me."
"great device, awesome visuals, kick ass performance, great speakers, just slippery as all hell, and the screen is make with 2018 gorilla glass, the back glass is stronger then the front, as I've discovered.Arrived on the 5th, first drop on the 13th, yesterday, and dispite having a ""tempered glass 9 hardness"" screen protector installed, the display shattered on the first drop when a corner impacted the floor inside, and the gap on the crappy screen protector did not cover the glass.The case? Yes, I bought a case with the phone, delivered by Amazon, delayed until who knows when, it's missed it's delivery twice.Becareful, the display is hella delicate."
"I sucked it up and bought this phone despite its price based on satisfaction with a previous Motorola model.Imagine my dismay after receiving it that it did not include a compatible stylus!Worse, Moto only sells their 'Smart Stylus' as part of an $80 package with a protective sleeve.This is deeply hidden in the menus of their store.  You can only find out that the phone needs a stylus by accessing an 'accessories' menu.  It is not mentioned on the sales pages for the phone itself.I am deeply disappointed."
"Bought this phone last year. After a few months of use, I started getting messages that the phone didn't have a sim card. Taking the SIM card out and putting it back in didn't fix the issue so I thought it was a bad sim card. Got my phone provider to send a new card. Same issue with the new card. So ok, I got a bad phone. I ordered a replacement of the same phone and after 4 months, the new phone is doing the same thing. No sim card message. This is the last Motorola phone I purchased."
"Very unhappy with this phone.  Hrant you.  Beautiful front.  Lighting fast. .  Downloading. .  All of sudden. Slowwwww.  Cleaned phone.  Slowwww.  Done.  Bought case to .phone dont fit in case.  Im done.  Just send it back.  Does not help. 5G phones.  ,5 G not everywhere.  Sognal strenght not thst great ither.  10 cell towers  withen 15 miles of .each other.  .  .  Technology is not allways the answer.  Keep 4 G.  Your fine"
"I stopped using this phone and switched back to my old Stylus 5G (2021) because the battery on this phone lasted only a day. It also started showing a warning that the USB socket was wet, even though it was perfectly dry. I had to restart or turn off the phone to charge the battery. I regret buying this phone."
The battery on this phone sucks
Good phone. Te box does not include the power adapter.
Missing a charger and it's expensive!
"To much control and  advertise , charges for any apps , don't like it ."
"This model is defective and will eventually stop registering the Sim card and will only work on wifi. If you don't believe me, go to reddit and look at the countless others who've had the same problem.  When it works, it's fine, but I had to buy a new phone just four months after buying this one. I've always loved motorola phones but will never buy another.  It's ridiculous they're still selling this."
Buyer beware - pre-installed applications that will bloat you with notifications and rot your brain. If I wanted Tik Tok I'd  install it myself. Anyone too dumb to find tik tok on the app store should be protected from its effects.
"This phone WAS great, but I found out way too quickly that the screen is actually an inferior glass. It was already having response issue right off the gate (I would swipe and swipe but it wouldn't bring up the passcode screen) but I didn't make too much of it. However, the first time I dropped the phone, it SHATTERED! Had a ton of different Androids, and dropped my phones many many times but this one was so surprising. Looked it up only to find out that the screen is a weaker Gorilla Glass and apparently others have felt the same way about it. Disappointing as hell, lasted 1 month and now I have to go back to my old phone. AVOID"
"The ads boast of *68W TurboPower Charging*, but there is no charger in the box...and you WILL NOT get 68W TurboPower charging using your own charger! Why would Motorola intentionally lie to its customers? Even the Amazon AI generated answer lied when I asked the question...it said ""fast charging is only possible using *the included* 68W TurboPower charger""... but it IS NOT included!?!"
I would review this phone if it was usable.  The only positive is that it is slick looking.  There is no way to plug it in to charge it.  It only has a cable with an identical mini plug on both ends and no wall adapter.  There is nothing in my home that receives that plug.  I have power strips that you can plug devices into and a pretty new computer with multiple ports.  Nothing I have will allow me to charge this phone.  I also don't think it came with a sim card because it came with instructions on how to add one.  I guess I'll be sending it back.
"It does not have a fingerprint sensor; you have to manual type in code on a small screen each time.  Very slow. Do not recommend. I thought I was upgrading, just the opposite for more $$$."
"Motorola has given up on their tradition of no bloatware and standard UI. The hardware is good and affordable, but the software is unexpectedly bad.Good phone for the price, mediocre experience compared to previous Motorola purchases."
"No complaints about the build quality or the software, but my phone had a faulty screen so I had to return it. I was having problem with ghost touches on the screen. I noticed when pinching to zoom pictures on Instagram that the pic would get smaller by itself without me removing my two fingers from the screen. So I downloaded a couple of screen tester apps and discovered that there were numerous ghost touches happening when using two fingers to do any task. Bad digitizer. So I'm returning the phone. I bought another one and hopefully the replacement works better."
"Screenlight kept turning down by itself. Lock screen picture was not clear. Requested phone that worked on GSM and LTE network, it didn't. Thin easy to hold nice looking phone. Nice color."
"Bought it to stream my phone with HDMI cable to TV due to no Internet or WiFi, but so far it does not work."
"Love the software on this phone but the battery life is a joke. (Update) Do not buy it.  It went from average to nil, the charging cable is an expensive nightmare that I've replaced twice.  After saying no to Apple forever I'm done with Android.  What's the point of an affordable option if you have to keep replacing it."
"Purchased the phone with it stating that the product is unlocked for all carriers,  but when I went yo get the phone activated, T-Mobile could not activate the phone. They stated that  the phone was not eligible for activation. They also mentioned that it could have international programs on the phone."
"I decided to trade up my Moto E 2020 for the Motorola Edge 2023.  I am very sorry that I did.  This phone is EXTREMELY slow.  It's very ""touchy"".  If ANYTHING is touching the edge of anywhere on the phone it will not function (took me a minute to figure that out).  The sound quality is AWFUL (not as described) and it's not adjustable like my Moto E, which has an equalizer etc...even when paired to Bluetooth it sounds terrible.  I wish I could return it!  Don't waste your money on this model!!!  I still prefer Motorola products, but this one was not worth it."
I have owned Motorola phones for my last two phones. This would have been my third in a row had I kept it. I like the moto gestures and the minimal bloatware. Battery life is atrocious. Kinda feels like my old phone which was a mid range phone from 2 plus years ago. That's not a good thing. Id rather use my two year old Motorola with a cracked screen versus the edge 2022. I like Motorola phones just get a different Motorola phone.
The phone can make  and receive calls but cannot detect or connect to wifi. no fuction well
"I received the gimbal quickly but soon realised there were issues with it. The main one was that the remote control kept turning off and losing connection to the gimbal, even when docked. This made the gimbal practically unusable as the remote houses the controls for the different modes and controls.I contacted Hohem support, and to their credit, they were very responsive and scheduled a Zoom call. They could not resolve the issue and advised me to return the gimbal to Amazon as it was still within the 30-day returns period.The gimbal is very good; it has all the necessary functionality. I was impressed with the AI module, which is excellent at tracking.However, I probably will not buy this brand again, as receiving a new item that is faulty is usually a sign of poor quality."
I was looking for a way to make my boxing session with my clients look better by using this gimbal and using the tracking mode. I was compelled to buy it cause it had great reviews but it was a no more me! The gimbal folded and got out of control at random times and took awhile to set back up. Did not have fun using this. Not worth buying.
This gimbal works amazing with iPhones. I have an Android and an iPhone for work. The app for the gimbal doesn't work well with Android. I believe google pulled the updates from the play store. Unfortunate but at least I have an iPhone as well. Would rate 5 stars if it worked with Android. 5 stars if I was an iPhone only guy.
We purchased the gimbal so film my sons during sporting events and to use for posting videos.  Overall the gimbal works well for steady video and it connects easily to our Iphones.  The one issue we have is the auto tracking functions.  The face ID only works for the face and you the person can't turn away from you.  The object tracking does not appear to work at all.  We tried to track a football which is a clear object form the background and it will not track the ball. We set the ball by itself on the turf and attempted to calibrate the object tracking.  This is something that should be able to be fixed within the gimbal app and then it should work on an update. We are still pleased with the gimbal for the price.
"Just returned this gimbal stabilizer, thanks to Amazon's staff.The ads eluded it was able to follow me around as I recorded, but in reality, it was the next higher priced unit on the same ad.If you are just looking for another thing to hold in your hand to keep the phone still while you video, it'll do the trick. But, if you want hands-free, follow you around the kitchen recording buy the next model."
"When functioning properly, this works well for keeping video stable.  However I am starting to have issues of it going all floppy in the middle of a session, and the battery indicator is still at 2 dots, so it's not dead.  I've read the manual (which has NO trouble-shooting section), and tried support online, but this issue is not addressed."
"One thing I learned is many of the features will not work (like zoom or switch front/back camera) unless you use their app. Using their app means you’re stuck with their photo quality and photos will be in their app.As long as you only need a phone holder that will move it up and down, etc, no need to use their app. And you are good.  With that said, it works for my basic needs."
is lightweight and convenient to handle. If you are not a professional it’s fine. But to have all the features you have to download the app
"I wanted to use this item for my photography business, and I wanted to utilize the AI tracker option. But I must have mistakenly bought the wrong one, because this one doesn't have AI tracking. Which is one of the main reasons for the purchase. Unless I've missed it, I  don't see it. Other than that, it's a good product."
took me the entire night to charge then it died maybe two hours later.
"This has potential but the problem is the software the drives it has weird reactions. It will be on and sitting still, not being used and then it flips out and doesn’t stabilize. It’s okay, but not good. I realize that at $50 it’s what it is, but figured the one thing it needs to do, it would work."
Kinda heavy very sturdy but the battery does last two hours. Have to reconnect to Bluetooth when it time out and when you turn it off and back on. It's not what I expected for the price.
I really wanted this to work it holds my phone securely.  Unfortunately zoom does not work face tracking does not work . I belive this is more an apple device has more features for apple that supposedly work. Doing return hopefully will get my money back to purchase something else. On return it says takes over 30 days and they may keep part of the money for this thing that does not do as advertised.  I would not recommend .
This gimbal is great on small phones but the iPhone 14 ProMax is not comparable in the sideways position
You have to leave it on to be stable
It does the trick but I don’t think the software is really good but hard ware is good
"Purchased this for an iPhone 13 Pro Max and it was more of a automatic pointer than it was a stabilizing device which is more of what I was looking for, perhaps I was wrong but as I walked and took video it showed each step. When moving the the device left or right it did not track any certain object or point. Ultimately returned it because It just was too clunky to use."
"This purchase was an epic fail! !  I bought this to help with capturing footage of my children's sporting events.  Not only were the instructions not clear, but I could also not get it to follow images as indicated in the description.  Set-up and usage was not as easy as the description made it sound."
It was working when i was testing it out but when i attached my phone it didn’t work. It couldn’t handle the weight of my iPhone 14 Pro Max. Had to return it.
"The Gimbal stabilizer for Smartphone, specifically the JCROBOT iSleeky L7C Pro, left me somewhat disappointed. While it does offer a 3-axis stabilization feature, I found the performance to be inconsistent, especially when using it with my Android device. The face/object tracking was hit or miss, often losing track of the subject and resulting in shaky footage. The build quality is decent, but the overall design feels a bit clunky and not as user-friendly as I had hoped. The learning curve to operate the gimbal effectively was steeper than anticipated, and the provided instructions were not as clear as they could have been. Overall, I had higher expectations for this gimbal given its price point and features, and unfortunately, it fell short of delivering a smooth and hassle-free experience"
"This might be a terrific product, but I still have not been able to figure out how to use it. The minimal instructions that come with it are in adequate, and the few videos online still have me wondering about the functionality of various buttons."
Hard to control joystick moves way to fast needs setting for joystick fast medium or slow
"The app lower the picture and video quality, the si tracking move isn’t good, for the price is not than bad, I must admit I was expecting something better"
Wanted this to work so bad but the motorized gimbal is terrible it was so shaky and showed up in my videos. I went with the DJI osmo 6 after returning and never looking back.
"If you have a foldable phone such as Galaxy Z fold, this tool might not be a good solution as clip is too short to hold the device securely."
"It's difficult to use. It shuts off for no reason and it has so many buttons, it would take a ton of studying to even figure it out."
"When shooting in landscape, product regularly pmalfunctions after a few minutes of filming. It is as if my pixel 6 pro is too heavy. Will not buy again."
Not as responsive as they show in the videos.
I decided to send this gimbal back. Just spend some good money and buy a gimbal that’s worth it. This one has limited rotating axis’s and it seems to shut off or make a beeping sound in horizontal mode when I’m recording the AI tracking is like Childs play. Anyways just get a decent gimbal if you’re serious about content making. And the battery life is not that impressive
Could’ve use if
This is not exactly what I needed for filming from my cell phone camera. I sent it back.
"in the middle of use, it turns off. even if I only use this for 5 min it turns off automatically and does not work for 5-10 min. frustrated with this product does not recommend."
You can’t zoom out to 0.5X with the gimbal app. You would have to use the iPhone camera app to get the 0.5x zoom—and even then you would have to use the two fingers on the screen which is not optimal for smooth video recording.
I used it for two days and I had lots of trouble making it work as expected.
"I've owned several gimbals, this thing is useless trash. The seller did everything they were supposed to but it's really the manufacturer. Save your money and save your time"
"Have used dji gimble in the past and it was much more user friendly. While this may be a reasonable substitute if you have budgetary constraints, I will warn: having to use the app to fully utilize controls on the unit adds complications to the process and strains battery on your mobile device."
I use this to record my son’s basketball games and it started working fine but the app that goes with it often crashes and then changes the layout of my recordings from horizontal to vertical which cuts off most of the picture! The battery drains very fast! It also will just stop working mid recording and the lights on the stabilizer setting just flash. It gets too hot and just dies even though it is fully charged. I do not recommend.
"Not a good product, the face tracking doesn't work correctly and bounces to the point of un-usablility. The controls are diffecult to use, and hard to see. On a full charge it, times out and powers down after 5 mins."
"You have to use their app to have any type of tracking. The QR code to download app goes to an unsecured website all in Chinese. When you download the app you can select language, but it still gives warnings in Chinese. I am returning after only using it for an hour. ."
Many times while using it undergoes sudden motions/jerks and impacts the overall quality of the video in the critical moments. The smoothness in its operation is lacking at least in my device.
I tried this out and unfortunately it would not object or face track as described.  I really was looking forward to using this as I am taking up photography.  I don’t know if I just got a defective one or if that is standard.  I will try a different brand in the future.
"I liked the price and construction. But when I turned on the gimbal, it vibrated heavily with the tripod on. I picked it up and it still vibrated in my hand heavily for a while, so I turned it off. After turning it on again, it vibrated intermittently. The gimbal also vibrated after I changed modes. It vibrated off and on while in video mode. I wouldn’t recommend this gimbal."
"Taking photo use the product photo software and the final result is poor, you also can't take a selfie shut"
The instructions are not good enough. It has a mind of its own and is too complicated to use. I don’t like this one at all.
didn’t make it work for my event . Face tracking works for a moment and start to track anyone crash to the handle sometimes .
It doesn't hold a charge and it always cuts my pictures off I would save money and buy something else not worth it
The tripod at the bottom of the product was constantly coming out of its place and was lost. How can you help?
all these gimbals are pointless because u have to take off the covers off the phone and then use it especially the pro max's like what i have and it falls off and not worth it at allJUST PLAIN GARBAGE
It moves on you while taking videos and videos aren’t as smooth as other gimbals I have used
"My experience has been terrible with this product. Not touching any buttons and it beeps and changes settings on its own. If you are going to buy a gimble, don’t buy this model. Nothing but pesky issues."
"I took this on a trip.  Not even a minute after mounting my phone and started walking, and this thing started going haywire.  Very disappointed by this purchase.  TGIF effectively ruined my plan to travel vlog.  I would return this piece of junk if I could.  Avoid at all cost!!"
"I took this on a trip to a garden and managed to set the alarm off within the first 5 minutes of use.  It didn't feel ""solid"" or comfortable when in use so I did return it. Looking for a replacement if anyone has a suggestion."
"The instructions are horrible. I even resorted to YouTube and  cannot get this thing to work no matter what I try. Maybe mine is defective but if it is, that's even worse. I cannot recommend this product.."
"My son does athletics and I got this to be able to record his workouts and training session so that we can review and improve… however after setting up download the app connected to Bluetooth…It take pictures, move manually but no auto tracking"
This worked for 2 days and did not thereafter Even being fully charged!
This is not a reliable gimbal I would spend the extra money on a better product
getting this is pointless.. It is a good gimbal but it hasn’t charged since i got it. I’ve been using the charger that came with it and it dies everytime i use it. Just save your money
"It didn't work as I expected.  I read the positive comments about it, and I bought and give a try, but as I said, it doesn't stabilize all the ways if you move around and make different angles"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Great in the beginning, then it stopped responding when pressing buttons.  Also, the directions are not clear on troubleshooting."
This item is 3 months old and no longer charges/holds a charge. Waste of money
…more like an unstablizer. It shakes uncontrollably and turns my phone around during filming.
"Worked great for 3 months. Then started to wobble, not level out, etc. disappointing quality"
Have only used once and now it turns off after one second of being on. I’ve been charging for hours. Returning.
Has trouble in any light
Could never get it to work/connect w my phone
Very hard to balance the phone. No clear instructions.
"The gimbal equipment is pretty much useless without the app. The app has terrible reviews on google play and apple store. The app keeps shutting down and exits when I start a video to record. The customer service does not exists. I have emailed them about the issue, left a poor rating on the Gimbal Pro2 app and yet no response to help solve the issue. I don't know what else to do."
"This is the first time I've used a gimbal so in my mind there were things I could do with it that probably aren't realistic with something like this. For the price, though, it's a decent entry level device, especially with the small discount that it currently has.Taking the gimbal out for the first time I was really confused. I didn't know that it was flipped closed (for easy transport) and nothing in the instructions mentions it. So what you want to do is just manually flip up the part that holds the phone. Next I tried to put my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra in the clamp with my case + PopSocket base (I removed the top) installed. It didn't really work. So I had to take it out of the case to fit properly. The part of the clamp that touches the phone is indented so it won't hit the power and volume buttons. You want to make sure the phone is centered as much as possible because if not it could hit the gimbal while rotating and the motor also doesn't seem powerful enough to support the weight of my phone when it's clamped off-center.It connected to my S21 Ultra via Bluetooth easily. I couldn't get the hotkey to turn on my camera app to work, but it did work on a Vivo V25. The zoom only worked in their own app, but I don't think it used my phone's different cameras for optical zoom.The one thing that I didn't expect was how the gimbal would rotate the phone to keep the camera from filming the arm if I was trying to rotate the gimbal so that the handle was at the bottom to the top. I didn't understand why it was doing it at first until I was moving faster and noticed that it didn't rotate quick enough to not have the camera blocked by the arm.If I'm just holding the gimbal handle in 1 direction, instead of constantly trying to rotate it around, then it works well. I did find situations where the camera would start pointing lower than normal, but a quick nudge of the joystick or double tap to center would fix it.A deal breaker for some people might be the loud motor. Sometimes it would make pretty loud clicks that get picked up by the phone mic. If you don't make the gimbal do a lot of movement it won't be noticeable."
"It feels good in hand; not too heavy.  The motors move very quietly and smoothly, so good points there.The spring loading of the phone is a 4: I used my iPhone 12 Pro but it just didn't ""feel good"" - there is room for the buttons, but just barely.  In order to get a good balance on the phone so it doesn't tilt when tracking, you need it in the middle which means the volume down button is tucked under the foam pincher. And sometimes it pushes the button.Face/object tracking is decent.  As long as the phone is balanced, it'll work good.I liked the action and button control but the labeling on the buttons is very small and a bit cryptic.  I had to crack open the instructions to understand what they meant.Now if you want to use all the features, you have to download the app, that according to the App Store, doesn't track any information, but the app will ask to access your camera, mic, bluetooth, and camera roll.  It is probably ok, but one of the messages that popped up was in Chinese, so I don't know what I was accepting or declining (I went with decline).Inside the app function, it's pretty decent, again the icons are a bit cryptic.For the price, it's a bargain as long as you can live with the less than great app."
The battery doesn’t last very long. When i try to change the modes it doesn’t work. I have to turn it off and then turn it on and it stops working again. I would recommend you buy a more expensive gimbal since this one is not worth the money.
"Not intuitive at all. It never does the same thing twice. I thought I had it figured out only for it to start doing... nothing. It's just a swivel-ie phone holder. My wife bought it for me. I'm technology inclined, seldom need to read instructions on things.  I'm having her send it back and get something better. Cheap is often so for a good reason.It does not track like they show it doingIt's not very stableIt doesn't do much other than correct itself when you reset.It doesn't hold the phone in place nor does it keep it from swinging aroundSometimes it doesn't even swivel"
I have had this gimbal for many months.  This gimbal is not working.Tracking: It has a tough time tracking any objects.Stabilization: Not working.Manual:  The manual does not explain how to set it upSorry...I just could not get this to work.  Not sure it is a bad design or I have a defective unit.
"It works well, but then it randomly started calibrating with no warning.  I had to turn it off and on again to get it to reposition.  So while it works just fine, not being able to depend on it conducting a full 360 during a Zoom call or video shoot, is a pretty big draw back.  I see so many other great reviews, so I'm guessing mine might just be defective.  Will keep as a backup but definitely not a primary,  It does come with a detachable, lightweight but sturdy mini-tripod, and I actually used that quite a few times with a different boot."
There’s a learning curve to this gimbal and it isn’t very easy to use. I’ll keep trying but so far I’m not loving it.
"I bought and it doesn't charge, the Bluetoot doesn't connect at in general it doesn't work at all. Unfortunately the devolution cost from my country is similar to the cost of the equipement."
"This stabilizer has its pros and cons. It does help capture smoother videos and comes with face and object tracking, which is neat. It's also lightweight and easy to carry around. However, there are lots of issues with it. I found the tracking feature to be sometimes a bit finicky and struggling to keep up, causing me to miss some great shots during my son's basketball game. The build quality is okay, but it doesn't feel very durable. Setting it up is also tricky, especially for those who are not tech person like me.It is an okay option for smartphone video recording, but I'm not convinced it's worth the price. I'd rather continue exploring higher quality stabilizers that offer better value for what I paid."
"ummm…..I’m not even sure where to begin lol. This phone stabilizer for recording and picture taking while in the move was a little bit hard to use. The controls are hard to figure out and the instruction manual is little help. The material that this is made out of is good, but not the best. Unlike what the manual says, the twisty part doesn’t really lock into place. The whole product itself is also quite heavy.  If you were told hold it up, you would get quite tired pretty quickly. I think I’ll stick to my old fashioned hand holding for videos and pictures."
This definitely needs some work both products and app. It couldn’t support my iPhone 16 pro max it was just give plus the hand area got really warm not sure what was going on but didn’t feel safe to use
"This selfie stick was...interesting to say the least. To start with the good: the quality of the material was good, it seemed durable and able to withstand some wear and tear. However, this is where the good ends. To begin: THIS WAS SO HARD TO USE. The manual wasnt very helpful: it was hard to read and follow which was disappointing. The stick isnt very versatile, it only fits a phone of a certain size. The stick also spins around a lot, not really locking into place. The multitude of little buttons that control it are confusing and, in general, hard to use. Overall, kind of disappointing."
"AOCHUAN Handheld Gimbal is compatible with iPhone and Android.  Its an interesting device but more complicated than old fashioned selfie stick :-) to take pictures and videos.My idea was to try vlogs and make good quality non-shaky videos as gimbal tech balances out (sort of has a gyroscope).Honestly so far I havent found it very intuitive .  My reco when you download their app just patiently listen through tutorial to understand how to use , what modes exist and how they function that helps.Also make sure you charge before you start using (2600 mAH battery charging took long 12+ hrs and was still charging) otherwise it keeps turning on and does nothing or move in weird way banging on the gimbal.  Little confusing at first and my tech knowledge is average if not more.May be this is my first gimbal so feeling some learning curve.Adjustment clip also feels tight and sharp for setting iphone (atleast with 14 pro max) even with a super slim case surely will be harder if you have a fat case.Device itself feels heavy and high quality not sure if its really pro level but surely not cheap by any means.  Comes with additional extension handle cum tripod and an extra light to create fun videos.Honestly I am still exploring and making myself familiar with features and not sure if I have started doing things right or gimbal has a problem.For hobby its great  at this price and fun to play around ! Hoping to get a hang of it soon and create some cool videos. Overall , If you are looking for a cool gimbal without breaking a bank this is good."
It swithched off instantly as I pressed start recording button. Unlucky me.
"It didn’t work, when I open the box looked like it was used before and also the tripod and manual were missing"
"First things first - I've never owned or used a Gimbal Stabilizer for a smart phone before, but I've been fascinated by the possibilities one could offer me. When I saw this AOCHUAN brand unit at a reasonable price, I though, ""Why not?""First impressions:It appears to be well made, and looks impressive. The typical tiny ""instruction"" foldout takes you through the very basic first steps, but the most important thing to do first is install the ""AOCHUAN"" app, hit the ""HOME"" icon on the app, and watch all the tutorial videos to learn how to use it. This model is the ""Smart X"". (here aren't any videos for the Smart X, but there are videos for the ""Smart X Pro"", and it looks like the only major difference is the PRO model gas a Focus knob on the gimbal that the Smart X lacks.)Basically, the first thing you do is swing open the gimbal to mount the phone, and at that point I thought I was going to break the thing. It's a leap of faith that it's not going to snap into two large pieces as soon as you try to swing it open, but I finally got up the courage and went for it. No problem - opening it was a complete non-event.I'm using an iPhone 12 in a Otterbox Defender case, and it mounts easily without any interference during operation. Leveling it the first time took a bit of time (since I had no idea what I was doing) but after a few tries it literally takes just a few seconds to do it now.The unit has a USB-C connector to charge the battery (a standard 2600 mAh 18650 battery), and as expected, it took a few hours for the initial charge.Since I've never used a gimbal, to me the learning curve is definitely there. The controls consist of a 4 position joystick, a Zoom In-Out control, and two push buttons, All controls but the Zoom have multiple functions (As many as Four!), and at this point I can't for the life of me keep them straight. Some buttons can use Long Press, Single Click, Double Clicks or Three Clicks to accomplish different tasks, and the tasks aren't necessarily related. It can be a handful for a beginner like me.The unit comes with a folding tripod that screws on the bottom of the gimbal with a 1/4-20 stud, and it appears that it could be left folded to use as a gimbal extension, but personally I'd be afraid it would snap right off. As a tripod it works fine though.Also included is a magnetically mounted RGB fill light that's rechargeable using USB-C,and is surprisingly bright. It has two push buttons, and when turned on with one of the buttons it defaults to White. The other button cycles through three brightness levels. Press the first button again and the light cycles through Red, Green, Blue and a couple of other colors. Again, the other button cycles the brightness. Pretty clever!The gimbal has four operating modes:""Fan follow"" (I suspect they mean ""Pan Follow""), ""Full Follow"", ""Lock"" and ""POV"" mode. I can't comment much on the modes, because I'm still trying to wrap my head around the differences between them, other than to say it's entirely too easy to inadvertently switch from one mode to the other. Remember that button that has four functions assigned to it? It's the joystick, and a single click cycles between the operation modes. If you're trying to select one of the other functions that the button does (or moving up/down/left/right, which the joystick ALSO does) it's a recipe for cinematic disaster. Half the time I have no idea what mode the gimbal is in, or why it's doing something I didn't expect it to.I've said it before, and it bears repeating here: I came here with NO gimbal experience. Maybe this is par for the course with gimbals. Maybe my expectations are unrealistic. Maybe after more time with this gimbal I'll feel more comfortable with it and have a totally different opinion in the future. If so, Ill come back and revise my review as appropriate. For now, we're both (the gimbal and me) a work in progress."
I needed a little help from the manual to understand how to use the stabilizer. I like that it's compact and lightweight but it was difficult to figure out. It's just not super intuitive.
"I have tried using this to film several different performances, and I have yet to have a positive experience with it. I find that it does unexpected things, and refuses to reset when it starts acting weird. I really wanted to use this and make it a regularly part of my recording of live performances, but it just is not reliable enough for me at this point."
"I thought I wouldn't need an app to know how to use this, but I do. Each function is not clear in my opinion, so I had to watch some videos and read the guide included in the box. It is also difficult to find the right balance on my phone, since it would his the arms sometimes when it moves. Besides that, the stabilizer is decent with the face tracker and balancer."
"I have never owned a Gimbal before so in doing some research with this one and putting it together, I found that it does not stay focused very well and will start to move all over if I move too fast. I have to stop everything and get it resituated when this happens, which makes it a bit of a time waster. The app to make this work seemed to work out ok but instructions could be a little more clear on how to work this for a newbie."
"This thing is pretty useless. First, it took multiple attempts to get the thing to even charge and turn on. Once I got it to turn on, I put my iphone in it, and immediately realized two things. First, the motors in the thing are incredibly weak and can barely more the phone around. And second, the is no clearance between the phone and the arm. So if you want to hold the thing down low, or up high, or just at any odd angle, the gimbal is not capable of tilting the phone to keep it level, and instead you end up with the phone pointing up toward the sky or down at the ground.The one and only worthwhile feature of this gimbal, is the fact that there is a battery door you can open and just pop out the 18650 and put a new one in. But aside from that, just go ahead and buy a gimbal from one of the known brands. They don't even cost very much more, for a far superior product."
This stabilizer seems nice but I could not use it because it did not fit my phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra with a case and it did not fit. I own a different brand of stabilizer and it works. If you are interested make sure you keep the box and packaging and try it first to see if it will fit your phone.
It works for a while than it has a mind of its own. Do not rely on this if you are doing professional work.
"I ordered the AOCHUAN handheld gimbal stabilizer, and at first, I was pretty impressed with the hardware. It runs on a single 18650 battery, which is convenient and easy to replace, and the build quality feels solid. But unfortunately, the issues started once I installed the app on my Pixel 7A. The app constantly crashed whenever I tried using any tracking features, especially face tracking. Each time it failed, the camera would freeze, and I’d get an error saying, “AOCHUAN has an abnormality; the camera will be restarted and parameters reset.” It even had small but noticeable issues like a misspelling of delete as delect in the gallery section for saved videos and photos.When the face tracking did work briefly, it was impressive, almost like having someone follow you around with the camera. However, this only lasted about 30 seconds before the app crashed again. It’s possible to use the gimbal without the app and rely on the phone’s regular camera features, but you miss out on all the advanced functions, which defeats the purpose of buying a smart gimbal.On top of that, my phone won’t fit in the gimbal clamp with the protective case on, and since my case is difficult to remove, this was inconvenient. Additionally, when using the gimbal without the app, the directional joystick isn’t analog, making control jerky and imprecise. I also tried it with my older Samsung A50, and while the app worked a little better, recording was vary stuttery, likely due to the phone’s limited processing power and sometimes the app would crash with the same error message is my pixel 7A.The hardware itself is decent, but the software needs a lot of refinement. If AOCHUAN can improve the app, this gimbal would be much more appealing, but as it stands, I can’t fully recommend it due to these app issues and hardware limitations."
"I’m the one that never leave without a selfie stick 😅  I got this Gimbal To have better stability when making videos and better angle at pictures, selfies or not!But despite downloading the AOCHUAN App and reading the instruction manual, I can’t say it’s easy to use at first 🫤Turning it ON, the clipping part which is supposed to stabilize the phone is not holding on its own…. Trying with the App to direct it, but without success; it says “Device Disconnected”Finally, in the App, I pressed the Bluetooth sign, and it finally paired up.But, it sometimes randomly disconnects, despite being fully charged 😕Instructions are not very clear either.I will try to get used to this gimbal, which is fun when functioning as it is supposed to, but I had other easier devices to use that I prefer.Selling at $110 minus 20% coupon ($20 off)."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I was excited to try out this self tracking gimbal, unfortunately it didn't live up to the expectations. It tracks faces decently as long as they are slow moving and don't become blocked (even for a a few seconds) or else it starts whipping around like a toddler throwing a temper tantrum and never refocuses on my face.  Object and body part tracking do not work at all (as seen in the video) I set my target object (Loki) and gave it the parameters, the second I hit the record button it went wild flinging my phone around. I tried this several times with no luck (How hard could it be to track him? he's sitting there half asleep) before moving onto trying to track my hands. I have little interest tracking my face but tracking hands is perfect for tutorials, etc.  It was the only time the gimbal stayed stationary or avoided my hands so it was another bust. I've tried playing with the settings but I get the same result and the flinging my phone around makes me nervous, the gimble is sturdily built otherwise my phone would have been on the floor.It does require an app to run, It won't run without it.  I'm not a super paranoid person but the app is accessing my camera and audio so I do feel it's important to be cautious. Playstore says the developers 'declare' that there's no data collected by the app and yet when looking at their privacy/usage policy for the app they provide a link for the 'app privacy policy' (their words) but it takes you to their website privacy policy which talks about installing cookies and beacons on your device as well as tracking a good chunk of information about your device, and your browsing, etc. It's highly suspicious to me the way the policies aren't laid out properly (loop hole?) The other thing is that the gimbal tries to slip in Call and Contact access when connecting initially."
"I recently purchased a Lenovo tablet, and I wanted to share my experience with it. First and foremost, I want to clarify that my review is not directed at the seller; they did their job in delivering the product promptly. It's important to note that sellers have no control over the product itself.I decided on a Lenovo tablet because I was in need of a device for both personal and work use, and Lenovo has a reputation for producing quality PCs and laptops. I carefully examined the product specs on the Lenovo website, which indicated that the tablet had 32GB of storage, expandable to 128GB with a micro SD card.However, when the tablet arrived and I went through the standard setup process, including adding my Google account and performing necessary updates, I was shocked to discover that I only had 17GB of storage space remaining. This was before even installing the apps I had planned to use.I inserted a micro SD card and attempted to set it as expandable storage on top of the internal storage, but to my disappointment, the option was nowhere to be found in the settings. After some research on the Lenovo website, I learned that the storage expansion feature had been removed in the latest system update, rendering the micro SD card usable only for photo storage.This left me frustrated as it's nearly impossible to work with only 17GB of available storage on a tablet. The operating system and updates had already consumed nearly half of the 32GB the tablet originally came with. Consequently, I promptly requested a refund and opted to purchase a Samsung Galaxy Tab with 128GB of storage.In conclusion, if you're in the market for a tablet, I would strongly advise against considering this Lenovo tablet. The unexpected removal of the storage expansion feature was a major disappointment, and the limited storage capacity severely hindered its usability for my needs."
"The Lenovo tablet is a good unit, especially for the price. This was my second Lenovo tablet purchase. Only problem was with delayed delivery. Was supposed to be delivered in three days; was actually about eight days due to some glitch between supplier and shipper. But the unit itself is very acceptable and performs well."
I spent 3 hours trying to remove all the bloatware and finally gave up!
"EDIT: After 2mo of use. Here's the update. The battery now diminishes rapidly. and it appears to be laggy and glitchy when switching apps and screens. Overall. They could have done way better but this is after 2mo of use and charging. etc... So yeah. Battery life has gone down dramaticallyI'm going to start off by saying I love Lenovo products. For the most part, they make amazing stuff. This tablet however.... Not sure where to start...It's laggy right out of the box. Takes forever to ""start up"". Loaded with mass bloatware you can no longer delete so that's eating up almost half your already tiny space.. Many of the apps can be disabled and have their background data restricted but they're still taking up valuable space.. Some of them even re-enable themselves and run in the background and chew up half the ram they give you...3gb ram isn't anything in 2024.. The android system alone uses half that, and if you do use something like Youtube. It's going to chew up the rest making everything laggy, glitch, and flicker..It's also loaded with numerous phone apps and services when this thing has no phone capabilities. Not even an imei number, yet the provision app is in it and still updates... Almost like Lenovo made the cheapest tablet out of 5yr old parts and figured they'd take shortcuts and give the same android as their phones.Very disappointed in this.. I know some are going to think. It's a cheap tablet.. I know I know. But I've seen many cheap tablets with way better performance, specs, and custom android for more tablet use and not just some bottom of the barrel recycled phone OS...."
"Locked boot loader,"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So this is a nice little tablet, I will say the folio case it comes with is okay but I would not trust it to actually protect this thing, the screen protector it came with is straight garbage and came with no tools to ensure a good application I honestly would rather it not have come with a screen protector at all.As for performance, I got this mostly as a streaming tablet but also for a little emulation and I am happy to report if you want this for emulation it is a great value get it. It can play light ps2 and gamecube games easily like Luigi's Mansion, Mario Kart, and Monster Hunter All play fine, and every system before gamecube like dreamcast, psp, n64 will all work perfectly.For video streaming I was actually dissapointef which is why I will probably end up returning this. I always watch YouTube videos at 2x and this thing it depends on the video but I would say about 50% of videos if you turn on 2x speed it runs at literally like 15fps and looks horrible, yourube was my primary reason for buying this so it just does not make sense to keep it. Netflix, hulu, disney, all seem to work fine and it does not make much sense why youtube has this issue, but it does. Also whenever an ad plays on YouTube it exits full-screen for some reason which is super annoying. I added a video showing 2x video on YouTube. In this instance it looked just fine until an ad played, then after the ad the franerate dropped to this like 10 or 15fps and looks terrible"
"There is a lot to like about this tablet. It's nearly the perfect size to use as a reader and for general entertainment. It feels solid and is suitably fast for general infotainment functions. Some reviewers have even reported being able to use it for light gaming. I would not expect it to perform as well for multitasking/productivity type functionality. This was going to be my go-to recommendation for anyone looking for an inexpensive but functional tablet for the next year or two. I was also ready to get one for a family member who is not especially tech savvy when, out of the blue, the tablet offered an Android 13 upgrade. Wow! So soon after procuring this tablet. Nice! Well, as it turns out, Lenovo's implementation of Android 13 on this device includes a completely pointless taskbar. This taskbar is great at getting in the way and provides little additional value when you are using this tablet as... a tablet. It might have some use if you were using this tablet for a productivity device - but this is not a tablet that is especially fit for productivity apps. This taskbar severely impedes using navigation buttons and cannot be hidden when using them. So, if you want the taskbar out of the way, you must use the default launcher and set navigation for gestures. Only once this is done, may you use a third party launcher. You can then swipe down to make the taskbar disappear. It will reappear after restarting the tablet or after unlocking. Then this workaround must be done again. Other manufacturers allow users to disable the taskbar in the interface. Lenovo's Android 13 implementation for this tablet does not allow this. I am hoping this option becomes available in a future update. But, until then, I can't recommend this tablet for anyone who might easily be confused by this new ""feature"" - and it's a regular annoyance for me, too. It's too bad. Because otherwise, this is a very nice tablet for the price point. I'll circle back and note if this issue gets resolved with a future update."
"I have not had an android tablet in quite yet some time. I tried this one out and it was everything I was hoping for… everything but one major flaw.On the good side it was fast, smooth, great picture quality. It connected fine to all my other devices and it is, in my opinion, the perfect size for a tablet.Unfortunately I did not know that android tablets have started to go the apple route and do not allow you to increase your device storage space. You can mount an SD for extra storage, but not to increase the devices internal storage. This means that you cannot put apps on the SD and with the newer android OS being close to 15gig on it’s own and the files it creates upon starting your storage space is already half gone. That is not sustainable and I’ll be sending it back. It’s very frustrating because aside from that it’s a perfect little tablet for me. Sad day…"
"You're limited to 32gb, it will not use my 256gb micro sd card that I installed. Which makes this tablet extremely limited to web browsing / streaming.  There's no space to install any programs, not sure why they include the micro sd slot when you can't use it."
It's ok just for reading but soooo SLOW when trying to do even light web surfing. Spend a little more and get a better tablet.
"The tablet works well. The tablet has 32g of storage... Supposedly. However the system automatically takes up 13 g. That's a significant amount of storage. It slows up frequently. I have to go through every other day and delete images, videos, random files just to keep enough space to keep it operating smoothly. I literally have to go through every app and delete the cache or it will become glitchy. I am not a heavy user so this is pretty annoying. I either scroll FB or play ONE game. I don't use it for videos or anything. Overall it's decent for the price but I would highly recommend going with a minimum of 64gigs."
"This tablet came with Android 12, which, when it updated to Android 13, the pull down menu which usually appears on the top of the page on Android devices disappeared.  After checking everything, it appeared that the update to Android 13 removed it.  (The menu was there when it was running Android 12.)  I have a Samsung phone with Android 13 which still shows the pull down menu, so it appears to be this tablet and not Android 13.  Also, the tablet comes with 16 GB of system files, so if you bought the 32 GB tablet it might not leave you with enough memory for your needs.  Other devices that I own which have 32 GB of memory, use noticeably less space for system files.  Although you can add a memory card, if you need the space for apps, this tablet might not work for you.  I returned it."
This item came and was slower than molasses not worth the price and definitely not worth the time to even set it up it took forever to watch the wheel go around just to access even Google browser! Very poor quality....looking for better quality
"I'm replacing another (older) Lenovo tablet with this one after breaking the screen on the other. I was very happy with that tablet, so I thought this would be a safe choice. Definitely a mistake.The tablet has an infuriating problem with breaking browser windows by reloading them if I switch away to another app and come back. This causes lots of problems if you have entered information previously or are using a progressive web app. There's not enough memory on the device to handle keeping inactive apps in memory. Normally that's an uncommon thing, but with this tablet it happens every time I'm browsing. Makes doing any kind of forms submission just about impossible unless you never leave the window. That dropped my rating from 4 stars to 2. (The other lost star was battery life}.The form factor is nice, the 9 inch screen is definitely a good size for reading books. The battery life isn't great, I end up charging it daily to be sure I have enough power for the next day. And there is an annoying Lenovo ""Duraspeed app restrict"" application which appears to be a watchdog to slow or lock background apps down if they use too much processor. Again, this feels like a kludge because the tablet is underpowered.Bottom line: at this price you can do better. It's not worth the headache."
"I bought a Lenovo Tablet from Amazon on September 20, 2024. Today is November 14, 2024 and it will not turn on. It's fully charged and I have tried every online suggestion. I regret not purchasing a warranty. Very disappointed."
"I had bought one of these in mid October 2024. It was super buggy, you would have thought this device was at least 4 years old the way it ran...so I exchanged it for a new one in late October and that one had the same issue. Apps take multiple taps to open. Usually a computer will take a couple of seconds to respond to a command, but the staggering that happens with this device suggests that the issue is within. I have updated the software, I have plenty of data left over, I have tried using this device on multiple sources of public and private wi-fi and my device barely month old. There is no reason it should be working as bad as it is. It's meant to be affordable, not ragged. I expected better Levono."
"The expandable storage can only be used for pictures, music, and documents.I was going to install some games but there's hardly any room and they say to add more space.I primarily use it for PS Remote Play and it works fine for that.A decent tablet otherwise."
Screen is  little dim. Price is right
"Basic browsing computer for reading, news, utube, and simple games like angry birds. Don't get me wrong this is a good tablet for basic needs. I kinda like this tablet buts its weak and isn't a gaming tablet. U can't play roblox on this it's just not powerful enough it just lags and knocks me off. It's okay for the money but kinda wish I would of saved up for a better tablet."
"Bought this to use on vacation sparing my phone. Loaded all the usual apps, streaming service, shopping.  The good.  Good porce point, well constructed,  high quality tablet with minimal bloatware which is the reason I avoid samsung.  But I kept getting warnings that I was running low on space and the tablet lagged often even with the addition of a sd card.If you are looking for a kindle replacement or minimal processing power for a kid, this works but android only consumes more power and space with each upgrade.  Consider an m10 which is my next option."
Works but tablet is surprisingly slow/laggy
"Had to return it, the case was cool that came with it, but a little slow - maybe to be expectedWithin a week I had a bug that would not go away, no matter what I could not bring  back the digital keyboard, and I was stuck using Google Voice to type with no alternatives, this was incredibly frustrating and scary since I disabled Google Assistant and google's microphone listening abilities the day I got it.As a final act of spite from the tablet, when I went to factory reset I was forced to use Google Voice to enter the security pin code - but there was no enter button and no way to enter the code to reset; so I was forced to hard reset with the physical buttons.What is it with Google on some of these Androids? all of the Google pre-installed apps which you cannot delete seemed to also take up half the available space"
"Good quality tablet, like screen (made with glass), sound is awesome, but only don’t like the small storage as system consume 14gb, usable only 18gb. Min apps alrd installed and consumed 4gb alrd.Would get a more storage version instead."
Good price. But slow in speed.
great for streaming...storage options are very bad. you need wifi
Tablet works OK for a teenager but the port no longer functions or damaged that it's unable to be charged.
"I'm writing this about the M9-2023.  The build quality of this is excellent - it feels premium with the brushed metal edges.  So far it seems to run very quickly.  The included cover has a nice feel to it.There's one BIG problem with this though -- I couldn't install all of the same apps that I have on my phone because there simply isn't enough room -- my phone has 4x the amount of space.  You've only got 20GB for all of your apps -- system files take up 12GB of the total 32GB right out of the box.**Another part of the problem** (to add insult to injury) is that Lenovo has now limited the use of micro SD cards, even if you buy one separately.  It's only possible to use them as ""portable"" storage; what that means is you can't install apps on them (and this means that the manufacturer's responses in the Q&A are **outdated and inaccurate**)."
"I was looking for 8 to 9 inch tablet because I like the size and this tablet had decent reviews. Within 10 minutes of using it I realize there's some major shortcomings. 1. 32 GB of memory doesn't go far into today's world. The ability to offload applications to the SD card is not available. After loading all of my applications I only had 1.5 GB of space left2. Yes it's a $100 tablet, I was shooting for the stars hoping that it would be faster than what it actually is. I was wrong. Apps take an unusually long time to load"
"Love the tablet overall, but the sound rises and falls."
"This is a basic tablet with solid construction, but with subpar performance to do movie streaming or gaming. But it matches the price I paid for and I use it mostly for reading ebooks and short video watching. Battery life seems good and with my basic usage it goes for a week without needing to recharge. This is good for my needs."
I bought this thinking I could add a SD card to it as it only has 32GB of storage. But you cannot. So it works well for reading and watching videos.
"The tablet was working but then reverted to black and white. I have followed suggestions to restore color - removing apps, removing wallpaper, following directions to restore color, but nothing has worked. The tablet is also slower than my Amazon fire. I would like to return it."
"Returning.  If it looks like the deal is too good to be true... yah, it was one of those.1 - The audio is worse than any cell or tablet I have used.  If you plan to use earbuds, it might work for you.2 - the MicroSD card can only be used for file transfer between devices.  It does not support the card for storing application data like every other tablet I have owned."
Works fine storage sucks. Adding an sd card does absolutely nothing because the only thing that can be put on the sd card is files and photos. Miss the old days when you could save space my moving the apps to the sd card
"I am literally not using this tablet (purchased from Amazon August 2023) because of the annoying menu bar that sits at the bottom of the screen, even in browsers, and appears, from various forums, to be not be removable.I am continuing to use an old similar-sized kindle fire (with google play installed), with a cracked screen and aging battery, rather than see that annoying waste of screen real estate at the bottom of browser screens.Very disappointed."
I see why ipad is top dog in the tablet world...nothing has compared yet and no i will not purchase again!
"One of the primary reasons I bought this tablet is that it came with expandable storage for an SD card. However, I have discovered that this tablet does not allow you to use an SD card as internal storage.  What this means is that you cannot move large apps such as Netflix from the regular internal storage to the SD card.  With this tablet having only 32GB internal storage and nearly half of it taken up by the Android OS and Lenovo files, there is very little space left if you want to use several apps or even download more than a couple movies from a streaming service.  Had I known of this restriction, I would never have purchased this tablet."
"I learned the hard way that the SD card expansion can only be used as portable storage. This means that you cannot install apps or games on the SD card. You can't download Netflix shows to the SD card for offline viewing. This leaves you with very limited storage space. Considering Android takes up 12gb of internal storage from the get go, this only leaves you with 20gb of usable storage for all your apps, games, etc. I read through the product description both on Amazon and Lenovo's page and nowhere is this mentioned. It's only advertised as having expandable storage, which to anyone familiar with Android, would assume that would mean you can use SD cards for apps. It was only after finding a post on the Lenovo support forum that I learned this. If you only use this for social media browsing or always have an internet connection available it's not a bad device. But if you plan on using this for multiple games or plan on taking it on the go for watching movies while on long road trips or anything, you'd be better off looking for a different device"
"Decent product, horrible cheap dishonest shipping company they use. Also Horrible Customer service"
Tablet came with a Spanish  email already  on it  leads me to believe  it was a used one
Tablet lasted me approximately 2 months before giving me issues.  Now touch screen won't work even after a hard reboot/reset.
"First off, the tablet itself is very nice. Great picture and sound, and it's incredibly light. It has a fatal flaw though, the lack of memory! I'm stunned that there aren't more reviews mentioning this. If you want to download games or anything else that is a large file size, this is not the tablet for you. If all you want is a tablet for streaming media and reading books, this will be great."
Works ok. It drops WiFi connection often which requires me to reconnect which isn’t great. Expected more from Lenovo.
The battery runs out very quickly.No more than 4 or 5 hours. It is very disappointing considering that I use it only for reading.
It’s so better than Fire tablets good display and design don’t waste your money on other brand
"Apps continuously crash. For what it's worth device is totally not worth it. The tablet is slow, almost impossible to run anything on it. I connected to several different wifi it still sucked."
"The M9 is a nice tablet. However, it failed to run after 8 months.  Although it is still under warranty, I cannot send it back due to the sensitive data that is on it.  Very disappointed."
The tablet came cracked all over. Bad packaging. I've always had great success with levono! Never on Amazon though
This tablet was used only to stream music from YouTube.It won't do that any longer.It had been less than three months.The WiFi seemsc to be an issue. Videos no longer load.
"As soon as setup was complete, it went from 32GB down to 14.66GB! We only added 1 app. Don't waste your $$"
As I was setting up this tablet ads kept popping up in front of me. It's exasperating to think that even a brand new product would have a bunch of junk ads on it. I ended up sending it back and trading in for a Galaxy even though it was more money.
"This is slower than the tablet I purchased to replace one from 2016. The only good thing is the battery life because I'll read on it for 25 minutes and then a page will bug out and need to restart the whole app and sometimes the device, and most of the time I'll just get annoyed and stop reading entirely because of it happen often. The WiFi receiver is useless to. I basically have to sit right next to my wifi to get good signal. Just get a 9th Gen iPad instead."
"Disliked that there is no back arrow to tap to exit out of a screen, video recording playback is not the greatest, not a long lasting battery charge.Tablet appearance is to thin and the size is awkward.Not worth the money."
"I got this tablet for my daughter to play Cookie Run Kingdom. I even bought a 128 gb SD card. I could not transfer to the SD card and the game would open, load, and close. Continually! Could not even use it!"
"As others have mentioned, SD card can only be used to ""transfer files"" between devices.... Jeez who does that anymore.  You are limited to 32gig of memory and honestly 17 is taken up by Lenovo Bloatware that cannot be uninstalled.Dont waste your money"
"I thought that the internal memory could be extended so I bought it.  It turns out you can’t.  Don’t waste money on it.  Get something with at least 64Gb.  With 32, I only install 5 extra apps and the memory was already increased to more than 20GB.In addition the screen is a little blurry with lower pixels."
"I generally like Lenovo products & have had their laptops for many years, but this tablet has changed my mind. What a wase of time and money. The only time it recognizes my password or pin (tried both) is after a reboot.  If the tablet goes idle, it says my password or pin is incorrect.  I tried factory reset a few times and still get same results.  Waste of money  - I bought this to use with a square device at a craft fair. I can't power reset the device to get it to work! VERY disappointing.  I will try to return, and will never ever  purchase a Lenovo tablet again."
I've seen glaciers melt faster than this thing.
"This Lenovo tablet looks good. Works fine. But is ""almost"" worthless. It says 32 gig. In fact it's actually about 15gig. The operating system takes up about half the storage. Once you put on a few apps...it's worthless.. I would not recommend"
Well I got my tablet LenovoTab M9 and started to set it up. Asked me to connect dots as a pin. Tablet shut off and I haven’t been able to unlock it. It will not accept the pin I created. I tried many times to get help from Lenovo with no luck. I tried a chat and got nowhere. I even tried to email and nothing. Cannot unlock the tablet and when I try I get options I Chinese. I’d like to return it but I’m afraid that I have downloaded apps.
"I have a 5g ace and this tablet. I use my phone and the tablet stays in my suitcase. The amount of storage that comes pre installed takes up most of the memory and much of it is not removable. My phone has active storage but the tablet can only store photos and documents on the mini drive, or so it says. I have not been able to use it for my work as a sales person, face to face with customers, so this is useless for me. Maybe I'll regift it."
Product has a lot of latency.
"Even though it has a SD card slot for external memory,  Lenovo does not support internal to external (SD card) support. 32 gigs is all you will ever get. Do not buy"
"This was to be for personal use but was not happy with it at all. I didn't get what I thought I had ordered. So, the next thing is I haven't received my refund yet. I have not seen my refund credited to my bank account. Why not?"
This unit looks nice. But it does not work well for what I need.  It was to replace an ipad that is almost 10 years old.  We use it for IoT items in our office. We cannot get it to connect with any of the ring or Mr Cool products in our office.  I would not buy again.
And really slow too so I guess I got what I paid for
"This tablet comes loaded with Android 12 and can't be updated to 13. If anyone is curious, it won't work with PS remote play using PS5/controller. Returned."
"Very difficult to navigate! No visible Settings icon. Has a swipe function that scrolls the page but doesn't work well, especially on drop down menus. Has a voice assistant to help with set up, But was not able Returned her off!!! Some sort of invisible menu pops up from time to time for making adjustments, but could not figure out how to find it when needed. Also, must double click on every function! Waaaay too much work!! Returned"
Processor is incredibly slow so do not recommend
Bought this tablet with the sole purpose to play Wingspan. The app crashes every single time. Cant get through a game without 4+ crashed. Should have bought a better tablet
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Just keeps flashing 2 hours after setting it up
Slow and extremely difficult to setup and to use. No buttons at all. Slow as a sloth.  Don't buy....
"M9 model TB310FU - cannot use SD as internal storage.  The only option is to use it as external storage.  Android will not let you install apps on the SD card and most apps won't let you download to the SD card.  For example, you cannot download Netflix shows/movies to the SD card.  It leaves the storage very limited."
It only has 32GB of internal storage and adding a Micro SD card only increases storage for media. Pointless if you want to use it for regular app usage. System files take up 14 GB of the 32 GB storage so you only have 18 GB to use from the start.
First of it's slow as hell and the tablet was pretty darn heavy not worth it. Don't buy...
Do not buy. Crashes alot during light gaming.
Processors too slow
I'm used to a Samsung android tablet. This Lenovo is definitely not what I was expecting.  Maybe give it to the little ones to play games on.
Was broken in the first week! NEVER AGAIN will I buy an off brand.
The tablet appears to continually kick out spectrum and continually goes on safe mode. We must reboot it all the time. I'm not happy with it.
The tablet had me set up a passcode so I did a pattern. It does not recognize the pattern except upon restart but won’t recognize when trying to change it.
"Can not unlock device after entering a password correctly, latest OS updated and still. Can not download apps successfully and use."
Had this product less than a monthIt's now locked up and doesn't workDon't waste your money
Doesn't work with wifi
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Stop responding after 4 months. Warranty is worthless and no refund or exchange
The screen could no relay information smoothly.
For the first time you can't use an SD card for storing apps. Totally useless.
"Amazon.com can not do business properly with getting my payment from my visa 2445 for a Lenovo m9.I did everything possible, your employees tried to help, saying it should work and still nothing is working!!! Les miller, PLEASE HELP!"
"First off I ordered this directly from Lenovo.Unfortunately after set up and configuring the PIN, the tablet forgets the PIN once the screen locks.  So the PIN that was just set is suddenly the wrong PIN.  A reboot allows you to enter the PIN you just set - but if the screen lock kicks on due to inactivity, your PIN doesn't work to unlock it, you'll need to reboot.I then factory reset the tablet.  Re set up, and tried protecting it with a password.  Same shenanigans ensued - it only recognized the password on the first unlock after reboot, the lock screen fails to recognize the password until reset, and the settings for screen lock must be accessed nearly immediately after reboot otherwise attempts to alter the screen lock won't recognize the password either.Something about the OS is out of sync.  So while the hardware seems fine, the bugs with the lock screen render the tablet useless."
"This is a junk product. The stupid little power plug is WAY too soft and delicate. Thats the one part of any electronic device which should never be made from soft plastic. I accidentally  pulled the USB cord while standing up and it completely mangled the plug with very little force. The Lenovo M9 tablet wont charge and of course without charging it dies quickly and is useless. Lenovo won't offer support and neither did Best Buy. So now I have a very expensive paper weight. And its not even a good paper weight.Before this I had an ASUS nexus 7 that lasted for MANY years and was not so easily damaged, it was also lighter and had easier to hold rounded edges. I had to ditch it because after so many updates from Google the thing just plain refused to do anything, but at least it runs and I can look at the home screen. This tablet died in less than a month and is a pretty good indicator of how the industry is headed. Cheap garbage products you have to keep re-purchasing regularly because some spoiled lazy brat just doesn't own enough yachts. I will not be purchasing another Lenovo device. Its very interesting to me NOBODY else noticed or reported on the issue. Makes me wonder...."
"Not Fun Fact! This tablet is unable to transfer apps and games to an external storage. The system takes up 12-14gb of the internal storage. So even though it can take an SD card; it is basically useless. You'll want either the 64 gig version or better yet, something that lets you use an external card as the main storage."
"The navigation keys are counterintuitive, complex, and onerous. Couldn't deal with it and had to return."
"Awful in every respect, excepting battery life which I've never had the patience to test. SO SLOW. I have a ten year old galaxy tab that outperforms this paperweight. I must have a lemon because I have no idea how anyone could rate this above a three. Slow to boot, slow lo load webpages, slow to open apps, the screen is slow to respond. The box was thrown away or I would've returned this pos immediately. The keyboard has closed itself twice while typing this review. I've had Lenovo laptops that are great, but this tablet is the worst. Sorely disappointed, can you tell?"
"From the first time I turned this tablet on, I started getting notifications every time I opened it saying ""Duraspeed has disabled background applications"".  These notifications cannot be disabled.  The app itself cannot be uninstalled or disabled.  Every time you pick up the tablet, you'll get a notification from the app.I googled around and found out that the notifications aren't the worst part.  It's actually killing applications you want to be running constantly.  Even telling it not to kill those apps doesn't work.  If you have mail and message apps that you want to see notifications from, this app will kill them and you won't get your notifications.I use my tablet to play music while I sleep.  Nope.  Duraspeed kills the app after an hour or two, even though I tell the app not to do that.Google ""Duraspeed"".  Read the nightmares.  Don't subject yourself to it.Also, be suspicious of this listing.  This tablet model only released in 2023, but there are reviews going back to 2021."
"I have 2 other Lenovo tablets, which are fine. This one does have some nice features, screen, battery life. BUT with android 12/13 there is very little storage space with 32 GB of storage without app access to installation on the SD card, and the large operating systems involved. My old Lenovo Tab 8 has as nearly as much with 16GB of native storage, and actually has more with some apps being able to be installed to the SD card. I cannot recommend this version of the Tab 9, unless you are inclined to have very few apps. I have a 512gb SD card installed for music and photos..but that is all. Android 13 does not even let most of my apps access my 1TB network drive (this may change as developers program work-a rounds  ) , which caused me to purchase the large SD card. I really can't give a thumbs up to the later versions of the android operating systems, nor to this very limited tablet, despite it having some nice features. Just be aware. If you have very few apps, it will be fine, but with a few more than a few, will be very limited."
"I really wanted to like this tablet, but with no SD app support these models are doomed!!! I will be returning this first thing in the morning.Lenovo needs to par up as even the most budget tablet has App to SD support."
I bought this due to its great reviews however I found the system unresponsive and the final straw was when the onscreen keyboard lost alignment with the screen pressing.Now bought an  iPad 10th gen and the Lenovo sits in the corner unloved
"When I started to set up my new galaxy Tab A9 + plus tablet the quick start set up guide that was enclosed stated under GET STARTED instructions - Insert a microSD card. Since I had a Samsung 512 GB card I installed it. The unit did not recognize the card, so I pulled out the tray to reinsert it. When I pulled out the tray the card remained stuck in the tablet. I did not try to remove the jammed card as many suggested when I did an online search. Instead  I called the Samsung customer service number. They instructed me to send the tablet in to their repair center. Under their warrantee they offered a post paid label and a quick turnaround. While inconvenient, I was satisfied with the customer service response. I rated the unit only 3 stars because of the misleading directions in the Get Started guide concerning inserting a microSD card. Once I get the unit back, I will update my review."
"Samsung talks about video frame speed, but Bluetooth audio performance is severely lacking! While the overall Bluetooth performance has better sound than the best of their phones, performance is frustrating! The audio gaps occasionally on devices using Qualcomm APT-X Bluetooth and fails completely when LDAP is demanded from the driver. I now understand why a wired headphone jack is provided...there aren't enough resources to do Bluetooth satisfactorily. My A9+ has Android 14 but it appears this tablet barely has enough resources to run it. Also, compared to my previous Galaxy Tab S6, maximum SD card size is limited to 1GB instead of 2GB. I put all my data on the SD card and only use the internal for apps and the operating system. This assures my data cannot be monitored by Google & Samsung. Also, it's alot bigger than the 128GB internal storage which I use for the operating system and apps. These are the main bones of contention with the Galaxy Tab A9+While there is no fingerprint login on this tablet, the face tracking works remarkably well! Even in relatively low light, the tablet opens right up. If you are backlit however, the face tracking doesn't work...that's pretty much to be expected. For a screen that is not OLED, the image quality is quite good. Both cameras work nicely for videoconferencing and it takes reasonably good photos and video, something my Galaxy Tab S6 did not do well at all! Plays even 4K video I've shot with my Note 20 Ultra and Canon M50 nicely. Photos are reproduced very accurately.In conclusion I can say the following: Some of us don't play video games, in fact I could care less for that. A tablet should have strong suits not only in video performance but audio as well. This A9+ seems to fall flat on it's face in this area and I am somewhat disappointed by this! While it may be better than previous A series tablets, it's not even close for even older S series tablets. Perhaps back to the drawing board?"
"When we got it in the mail, it turned on no issues. We got it set up and turned it off because it’s a Christmas present for our son. Well today we went to look at it to see if we still wanted to keep it and IT WONT TURN ON! It was sitting up in a closet on the top and no way anything could have happened to it. Thankfully Amazon has sent a replacement so our son won’t be without his major Christmas gift. I’m just upset that had we not checked it, he may not have had his Christmas gift."
"I have bought several models of the Tab A over the years.  I have to say I am less impressed with this device than other versions I have owned.  For one thing, during the initial setup it  became apparent that I have less control over this device that ever before.  Another thing, on the first spin, it crashed on the first app I ran.  After a reboot, it might be working better.  Time will tell."
"It's a little bigger than the old, which I like. And it has more than 2x the the RAM and way more storage, especially with a 1TB card added. Now the part I don't like - the touch screen is very iffy - sometimes it's right on but often I takes a major pressure push to get it to respond. That can be very inconvenient.  All in all, I'm not sure I'd buy it again."
"This device is held back by the Snapdragon 695. Can't play 4k videos and video playback battery life is about 7 hours. So you'll constantly need to charge it. The 4 speakers and Atmos on this is awesome but that's about it. The screen is ok, not great. Just get a fire tablet for half the price if you just need a cheap tablet. The battery life on those is great. I ended up with Lenovo Tab Plus for $190 and it's 2x better."
"Good news and bad news abut this tablet.  The good news is the large screen makes it easier to read.  The bad news is that the larger size makes slipping it into a purse and taking it with me impossible.  Also, nowhere did it say you needed to purchase an SD card.  Since I don't have any lying around the house, I had to make a special trip to buy one.  Also, charging the thing is ridiculous.  One end of the data cable fits nicely into the tablet, but the other end doesn't fit into anything.  I had to buy a special charger, and even with that, it seems that my hair grew longer while waiting for the thing to charge.  I would not recommend this to anyone who does not have a gazillion accessories in their home already."
The tablet seems to work but it had all the personal info in it from a previous owner so it must be a refurbished unit sold as new. The packaging looked factory. If you live in the Atlanta area and sent one back - it's in Texas. I have a IT person that is going to clear it out.
"This product comes with a daily board that is too easy to accidentally invoke. It also comes with a smartswitch that takes over your screen and doesn't allow you to go back to the home screen. All I wanted was Android and in addition, I got a tremendous amount of unwanted garbare."
"I have had this for about a week, maybe a week and a half. I have several projects I was working on, this notepad shuts off in the middle of a project. This last time, it shut off and would not turn back on."
"After 3 months, tablet stopped charging/working. Had to pack it up and send back to Samsung, $13. I shouldn’t have had to pay anything to send for repair. Think I’m going to get an iPad now. I’m thru with Samsung!!"
"Just got the tablet. Loved everything about it. Installed my SD in the holder and inserted it. Tablet says there was no SD card installed. So I ejected the holder, but the card had dislodged and got wedged all the way in the slot!The card was inserted properly and worked fine in my old Samsung Galaxy A7 Tablet. Never an issue inserting or ejecting the card. So now I've lost the data on the card and I have a brand new tablet with an SD Card slot that's useless.But, I have 128GB storage, which is more than enough for me, and I love everything else about it from the display and audio, to the performance, which is way faster than my old Samsung A7 Lite that finally stopped working. I was surprise how quickly everything from the A7 transferred over to this one.PROS: Sleek, lightweight, excellent display and audio. And FAST.CONS: Terrible MicroSD card tray. Out of all the Samsung tablets I've ever owned, this is the first time I've had an issue with it not handling the card. Proceed with caution.Win some, lose some..."
"Overall, this tablet was perfectly functional and usable. If you're looking for a tablet for games/movies/general entertainment purposes, it'll probably be just fine for you!My main complaint is that I bought this tablet for note-taking since I'm starting school soon, and what they don't make clear is that this tablet is NOT ideal for that. There is no feature that allows for palm rejection, meaning you can't rest your hand on the tablet while writing, and this was something I only learned after purchasing, unpacking and setting up the tablet. I did some research to see if there was a way to make it work, but from what I could tell there is simply no option to do so. I wanted the tablet to replace pen-and-paper notes but there's just no way to write comfortably/nautrally without being able to rest your hand on the screen, so I had to return the product. Now I'm using the Samsung S6 Lite and it's already miles better (I'd recommend if you're looking for a note-taking tablet).One thing I'll say is that this tablet was totally compatible with non-Samsung styluses, so if you prefer to use styluses and want to use this tablet for anything besides note-taking it will still probably work for you, with no need to invest in the super expensive styluses out there."
"Outer shipping box was not damaged so this happened at the fulfilment center. Very thin box with no padding on interior. Device seems to be working okay, but I have barely been on it."
"We had an old Samsung tablet at our office and needed to upgrade our gear, so we decided to get this one instead. Right when I turned it on, the device had some minor lags when swiping on the screen. I also don’t like the placement of the buttons on the sides. This device is primarily designed for horizontal (landscape) display. While you can use it in vertical (portrait) mode, the overall design is clearly intended for landscape use. iPad would've been a better investment in the long run. Oh well."
No charger included. Special size charger had to be ordered as well as Microsoft card. Can't charge it or use it until that special order arrives
I got 3 for my 3 children and my daughter’s both seem to work fine but my son’s dies in like a hour and then takes forever to recharge.
"It has weird moments where it lags--a lot. Even unlocking the screen, or swiping down to get the notification and shortcut bar, taps and swipes won't register. The device is preloaded with some bloat that you can't remove. Some of it reinstalls itself. Samsung abuses notifcations to harass you to make an account with them, requiring your phone number. You can't disable this notification. The battery lasts a while, but that's not really a good enough reason to buy this. I feel wronged."
"I bought this to use as an inexpensive tablet I could use while backpacking. I was looking for something really basic that I could read at camp, check maps, and listen to music offline while hiking. Being a Samsung, it meant I would be able to find a decent case for it to provide at least some basic protection. If it got damaged during the hike, well... it was a cheap tablet so it should be good enough.It had 55% battery when it arrived, so I plugged it into a USB-C cable I had plugged into the USB port on my wall outlet. I figured this would be alright since it would need to be charged from a portable power source in the field anyway. After 48 minutes, it managed to charge only to 64%! I wanted to err on it being my cable, so I plugged it into a USB-C power brick instead and put that in my outlet. My wall outlets are 20w, and this requires 15w to charge, so it should totally work.It managed to hit 100% 4.5 hours later. Taking four and a half hours to charge anything 36% is insane. When I finally was able to power the tablet on, the screen was so dim, I could barely see anything. After rushing through the typical Android setup, I managed to increase the display brightness to around 50%. After installing 3 apps, I noticed that the battery was at 93% for less than a half hour of use.I definitely do not recommend this tablet. The cons far outweigh the pros in this device, especially since finding a budget tablet is not really that hard to find these days."
"I ordered the 64 mb tablet thinking it would be ok since I only use it to read books and do puzzles.  It is pretty sluggish, I will pull a puzzle piece and it will now move until after I release the piece.  Pretty frusterating.  My older Samsung table is actually better.  I would not recommend this one, chose the 128 mg even though it is more expensive."
I downloaded some games for traveling and noticed the tablet runs very slow when opening up apps.
I could not move information from one tablet to the other. I have found when I go to the help resources I’m usually more confused and out of sorts. I wanted to expand on the tablet with more memory but if it is time consuming and overly complicated I would rather just use my phone.
Battery only lasts a few hours after being charged to 100%.
"This tablet is very slow, and displayed image is very basic"
"Battery life is less than optimal, reading only gets about 12hr"
when you hold the ipad to operate the case doesn't hold the fit
Does not come with charger plug only the cord
keeps on hanging and very slow or freezing
"love the tablet, and the size. I am not happy with the charging connection. I have purchased 2 of these tablets and so far both have had to have the charging connections replaced.  so  in addition to the purchase price paid another 75$ on each to replace the connections within 6 months of having them."
"Having had the Samsung 7A tablet which was an awesome A+ device (until it would not hold a charge), I then read through reviews and decided on the Samsung A9 plus. Big mistake! This tablet lacks the screen sensitivity of the 7A. The tablet's overall system I have found to be a disappointment. Overall, I would not recommend."
"It lags pretty often with minimal effort, but for my purposes of reading/streaming, it's not bad! I got it on a prime day deal which made it worth the price, but I wouldn't go higher than $150 for overall performance plus branding"
Nice size but hard to get paired with my phone and really slow.  Would have been better off the a Microsoft surface at this point.
"Not easy to use, very confusing, button don’t work well need to be pushed constantly or held to get it started. Will not purchase again."
This product did not come with an sd card or an adapter to charge it.Do t know how it works cause it don't work
I really was disappointed with the performance of this tablet.  Found it slow and baggy compared to an iPad.  Avoid.
"The price was right, but I have found that with Samsung, you get what you pay for. This tablet works pretty good but has a slowish refresh rate and an unexpectedly slow CPU and a slow GPU. It has kindof a ""cheap"" feel to it. The microsd card tray is very difficult to insert a card into. This tablet might be great for kids 8-15 years old. Also not water resistant. Internal battery does not last nearly as long as claimed during use."
"I love everything about this except that even with the screen at full sensitivity it does not work. It shows it is being clicked on but even after a minute or two of waiting (incase it is just slow) it doesn't respond. I use this for work for taking pictures, editing and displaying pictures of my work.  Basically it is my portfolio.  But The screen is horrible! I wanted to throw the darn thing last night because it wouldn't respond of course I didn't but I really wanted to and that is a lot for me. I am the most optimistic person in the world probably with patience of a Saint I have been told. But this thing is driving me mad. I can't win. I transfer to this from an Ipad the only reason I left the IPad was because their editing apps are not free. I spent $150  on apps where on Samsung I can do it all for free do I ditched the IPad for the Samsung. I love my Samsung phone so I thought this would be a bigger version and in some ways it is but this screen is driving me nuts. I spent 12 hours setting the Samsung up with everything I needed so I guess I am stuck with it because I am not doing it again on another one. Stupid Screen!"
"I ordered this as an extra device to use with TikTok to stream video lives. The video camera was very poor. The resolution is lower and the pictures are washed out. It does not even have auto focus. I guess that I have been spoiled with the S series for phones and tablets. This is nowhere close to the quality of picture as my Tab S8+ or my S23 ultra. I am returning it to order the Tab S9+. If the picture and camera quality are not of importance to you, the Tab A9+ will probably be fine for you. I did like that it had 4 speakers which assists if you want to use the tablet in vertical rather than horizontal. Other that resolution and camera, it seems to be a quality device. Fortunately Amazon has an convenient return policy. Sadly, the replacement will take seven days, even though I have PRIME. Why has shipping taken from 5-7 days for my last few orders?"
ordered this near the middle of the year 2024 I've had it a few months now. I've been using it a lot for shopping reading listening to music movies and audio books. I did stress test it on the 3d mark on wild life. overall score is 1 203 average FPS 7.21 its score range was only better then 15% of other devices that have been tested. I will say the temp on this device does maintain a nice 27C with how much I use it the battery can hold for on average 4 days unless I use it for something big like watching a movie or playing a game will run it out in less then 5 hours. I have noticed when I opened it on day one system ran smooth but it was fallowed by updates needed after updates where finished the bootup on the device became slow and sluggish even unlocking it would cause a small loading screen after launch.
Good tablet but cant give it higher stars since it only comes with a usb connector with no wall charger.
"I have had a number of Samsung TabA tablets over the years. This is probably the 4th or 5th one I've owned. I will say that all the rest were very reliable and worked well for me. Though only 5 months old, the charging port on this one is broken and it won't charge. I didn't treat this tablet any different than any of the of the others. There is no reason it should be broken. I'm not a kid who mistreats their electronics, I only use it at home. Samsung customer service said I could sent it in and they wouldn't charge me ""if you didn't do anything to break it"". That means being without my tablet for 1 to 2 weeks. I took it to a local shop because I would rather pay for the repair than be without my tablet. They can't get the part. I haven't decided what I will do. At this point it's a toss up between sending it in to Samsung and getting a new one. The tablet cost less than $200. Sending it in means being without for a week or so, the cost of shipment and they will probably charge me $100 to fix it, despite the fact that I'm sure it is a defect and not my fault. I am seriously considering buying a different brand for my next tablet."
"I think I would like this tablet so much better than my past run of Kindles if it would just work properly.  The charge cord that came with it does not work, the tablet doesn't see it at all.  Unfortunately, the wifi isn't working well either. It loses connection approximately every 10 mins, sometimes more, rarely less than that. This would be the only device dropping the wifi in the household. It happens no matter what wifi I connect to in any household of my friends and family. Last and most importantly, I have never been able to talk to any human at the customer service contact info. So Samsung doesn't seem to care if their devices don't work, just as long as they have been sold. Never buying another device by them."
Very disappointed. Expected a better quality.
So I had my tablet for about 5 months and now I tried charging it and it's just a black screen it won't turn on I don't know what is wrong with it I suggest just buy them more expensive ones cheap don't last that long
"I have to say that I have been telling myself that this tablet is good enough for what I need it for, but I keep running into asinine problems. First off, if I ever try to use the keyboard, in any context (browser, notes, email), the words and letters are consistently in a different order than I typed. I type a word, say, “dysfunctional.” The letters won’t appear on the screen immediately. There is a pause, and what comes out is “functdysional” or some other nonsense, the letters transposed. I don’t have to be typing quickly for this to happen, either.For some reason, I’ve been living with this without complaint. Then, yesterday, I needed to use the tablet flashlight, and couldn’t find it. I contact Samsung support via the chat function. I tell them what the device is, and the rep asks for the serial number. Is the flashlight in a different location based on whether the serial number is odd or even? Why would that ever be a question? I specify the model number instead, and get the response that there is no flashlight. I say, incredulously, “are you kidding me?” expecting  confirmation. For some reason there is a long delay. I ask if he is busy talking to someone else, and he says he is sorry because he was looking into it. Either he was lying, or he nonsensically had to double check elsewhere to see if he was kidding or not. If this review sounds like it was written in frustration, and I’m being harsh, you are correct. You could say I should have known there was no flashlight before buying it, but it is such a basic functionality that I never would have guessed it wasn’t there. And after my admittedly testy exchange with customer service, I didn’t think I’d get a good or timely answer about the transposed text, since the rep was obviously in over their head. I would not recommend this product if you are looking for basic functionality, like the screen showing what you typed. The flashlight thing sent me over the edge, you could say. It is just a telltale sign of mediocrity."
"Works fine and is reasonably responsive when web browsing.However, the battery life is not very good, despite what other reviewers say.  I have power saver on with screen brightness at 5% yet I constantly have to charge this thing."
I would not purchase this item again. It charges when it wants. You have to have it setting in a  certain way or Position to be able to touch the screen to get the screen to work.
"I love this tablet! It uses google, YouTube, and Netflix just fine. Anything else that requires a lot more will slow it down! The touch response time is not the greatest and you'll definitely notice it, but if you’re buying this item you aren’t looking to buy a top notch tablet. Lastly, the only thing that bothers me is that it just RANDOMLY turns off. In the middle of using google, in the middle of YouTube, whatever it is, just randomly turns off. I’m sure it’s just something that’s happening to my tablet, but just be on the lookout!Also included a pic for size comparison to my RTIC tumbler."
"Setup difficulties, which could be illuminated if they would include written instructions.  Even a tech had a hard time doing it.  But Samsung did save 2c per unit."
missing part ..... tried to get it without having to return not so user friendly tablet that only took me three days to be able to use facebook
"WARNING!! ALERT!! DO NOT spend money on this dangerous (to your existing software and computer equipment!) piece of junk!!!  Having been an active computer builder and user since about 1970, my experience with this little monster was a disaster!! This ""computer"" and the Samsung firm WILL not allow you to freely use the computer!! I had to have a friend use his ""GOOGLE"" account and password (I use Google only for search functions -- nothing else!) to get to a point where I could even get a ""home screen"" to access the machine (his material was later deleted)!!  You will be forced to use Google apps and their functions, IOW, just to get to a ""home screen""!!  To make matters MUCH worse, as suggested by Samsung, I then then tried to use their ""Smart Switch"" bit of corruption, to transfer files from my old Samsung machine, and unbelievably, the software not only did NOT transfer all files, as promised, but ALSO actually, literally, deleted a number of ordinary highly useful apps that had been on my old machine!!!!! Icons that had been on the screen for those apps had also disappeared!!! Games and utilities I've used for many years!!! As mentioned earlier .. there is NO way to access this computer unless you accept a ton of invasive junk and create an ""account"" with Google !!!!!! First!! Including pages upon pages of legal jabberwocky that bind you and the computr for life, to Google ... OR ... you are not allowed to access and use the machine, YOUR machie, that you've just spent hard-earned money on!!!I have never seen such a heinous intrusion of rights and intense lock-down on a home level, non-professional small computer.Since I had foolishly used the ""SmartSwitch"" hackware in attempting to transfer files, and since Smart Switch transferred some but not all files, i have no idea what was moved and what was not, so I will literally destroy this bit of spyware/hardware and just lose the money I spent on it rather than return the wreck to an insecure destination. Once physically destroyed, it will go to the recycling center.  No more Samsung--- anything ... in my life!!! Shame I couldnt submit the review with NO stars .... but you have to have at least one to submit. This junk doesn't even rate that!!!"
So Samsung seems to be famous for having battery issues with their devices most especially tablets this I know because this is now my third one... I purchased them because they are affordable.... And my A7 needed an upgrade because it will not hold charge so I bought this one and then returned it... Because they do not provide a charging block... Which is annoying enough but when it went on sale again and I could get it with a payment plan and now that I knew that there would be no charging block I went ahead and ordered it again and I am seriously regretting that decision because I'm locked into payments and this cord that they send with it is not charging the tablet.... I had to buy a specific charging station that it would even fit because even though I have a Samsung tablet the charging block did not work and you can't use those generic ones from Walmart you have to use a Samsung cord and charging block as I'm finding out again I had this issue with the A7 and now again with the this one and the other thing I hate about Samsung is all those apps they insist you have but no customer service is available trying to get to them is like trying to get to the president... Anyway I'm stuck with the stupid thing it will not charge I don't know what to do.... I've got a Brand New charging station it charges my phone fine so it's not that the Samsung devices have battery problems and are notorious for that issue so please spare yourself although I will say if you're going to buy a Samsung go the cheaper route and buy this one because I would never trust just because you spend more money you're going to get a better device I'm here to tell you it's not true it is a little bit of a bigger screen but it's exactly the same as my old one with the same issues and I am very unhappy especially since I have three more months of payments... Samsung has gone to the dogs so spend a little more money and get a better device I don't have money to do that... But I could have spared myself and just stayed with the A7 until it gave up the ghost because the issues are the same upgrading did me no good and cost me financially which I really couldn't afford to do and I'm really kicking myself since I returned the first one and then turned around and bought it again they sucked me in with the low sale price... Full of regret and no possible solution I'm just stuck
"Guess with all the hype I was expecting more, Guess iPads spoiled me, this is slow to start and not terribly impressive."
Wish I had known that a Type-C charging cord was required for this device. I do not own one.
It’s okay for the price because it’s for my daughter but the camera quality isn’t great
"Seems like a nice tablet. I got it a few days ago. Relatively easy to set up since I have an android phone as well. However I go to charge it for the first time to find that they haven't given me a charging cord, just a C to C cord. I can't even plug that into a USB charger. Its just annoying how everything is extra now."
"My main issue with this device is that it won't fast charge while you're using it.  The battery level gets lower while plugged in.  Of course Samsung people claim that the charger or cable is bad, but I also have a Samsung S8+, and an S21 phone that the same charger and cable work fine for.  So it's gotta be either a software or hardware issue.  I'm guessing software because it charges fine when the tablet is off.  Also, the smoothness and quickness of scrolling and selecting apps is sub-par.  I'd expect this of a generic brand, but no Samsung product I've purchased has ever had these kinds of issues.  I realize it's not a flagship product like my others, but this product is just plain disappointing.  Don't know if I just got a lemon, or if I should go through the trouble of returning it if I'm just gonna get the same garbage as a replacement"
Bought September 2024 and now November 2024 and it went dead and been on a charger long enough to turn on and will no longer turn on. Tried many ways of turning it on to no avail. Wish I got the extended warranty but who remembers they bought it yet alone how to use it. 30 days to return is not enough on many things such as this. Wish I could return it and or get a replacement. I got this as an alternative to the iPad for testing as I have plenty of iPads and no Android tablets. Well this is putting a bad taste in my mouth.Will update if things change.
It's just soo heavy. The screen is big.
The cable don t match with the tab
"I expected to find a wall plug.More importantly, I expected a full or near full charge on the tablet.I was told that it was Tablet Only, but the power cord, 3’ , was sent, so the wall plug would be expected.  A full charge is expected as a minimum.Very disappointing."
"The Galaxy Tab A9+ Plus is a good value-for-money tablet, ideal for users who need a reliable device for everyday activities. It receives 4 stars mainly due to its combination of performance, quality display, and efficient battery, with minor limitations in the cameras and audio."
"The case is nice but the built in screen protector sucks, it makes it so you touch screen will not always work. Air bubbles will get behind it and no mater how many time you reinstall it the problem will not go away."
Nice tablet
I picked the red case. It came with a yellow case.I was really hoping it came with a charger. It only came with the wire and both ends are the same. So it doesn't fit in my USB chargers
Bought this item for my grandson birthday. He was highly disappointed when he opened it. It had a charging cable but no charging dock. A good dock cost about $40 bucks on top of the price of the tablet.
"Bought this because it has an earphone jack but could not charge it!  I have two older Samsung tablets and they all use a standard usb cord to charge. This came with a weird usb C to usb C cord that has a the same C connector on BOTH ends so you cant even use a regular charger plug or another laptop to charge it. No charger or adapter to charge it are provided so it is functionally DOA. Only good part is it still has an ordenary earphone jack.Will be returning it, big disappointment.Really cheap ommission given the higher price compared to other tablets."
Bought this for my step daughters birthday for her to use as a drawing tablet and it does run a little slower than we would like but it is a nice big screen.
"I'm rating 3 stars as neutral.I purchased this tablet for my mother as a gift. She's 73 years old and loves to play games.Love the tablet, but not not sure who's dumb idea it was to sell a device with no charger. Dumbest idea ever!Spoke with a rep and was told that Samsung doesn't include chargers anymore because most customers have one from previously purchased items. Well, what about new customers that have never had a Samsung device? Now, they have to spend more money to purchase something that should have been included. Very disappointed!"
"I don't see a screenshot option like my last Samsung tablet had.  I hope it lasts longer than that one.  It got a software glitch after a year.  Very disappointing.  I'd give this one a better review if it didn't beep it's little tune while I'm trying to watch a video. It's very distracting.  Also, the caps lock is extremely annoying.  It doesn't even come with memory chip and charging plug head so you won't be able to use it without a trip to the store. Glad I didn' get it or give it on Christmas. Dissapointing."
"I purchased this tablet mainly for browsing and online shopping. It works ok for browsing. It may be slow and get stuck on some websites. The Duolingo app doesn't work well on this tablet. It freezes and you have to close the app to make it work again. The Home Depot app is not compatible with this device. I contacted Samsung's customer service but they can't do anything about it. Samsung's customer service (chat) is extremely slow. They took forever to answer my questions. They told me to contact the sofware developer. I have never encountered an app that's not compatible with my iphone. The Home Depot app is just a regular shopping app, not some complicated gaming app. I'm very surprised that this Samsung Galaxy A9+ doesn't support the Home Depot app. Next time I will stick with apple products. They are more reliable."
"I waited to give the tablet a good test drive before writing a review and I would have given it 5 stars if it had been better receiving the WIFI signal. Compared to my 6 other devices (phones, laptops, Fire Tablets) which have no problems receiving a WIFI in different rooms, the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9+ Plus 11” will lose the WIFI and I have to get closer to the router to keep the connection. So if you just want to watch downloaded movies and offline games, or be closer than normal to the WIFI router it's fine."
"Battery life isn’t good, the percentage decreases every 30 min, even fast when using video calls or video applications.Works perfect, like a tablet besides that."
"2nd UPDATE: ONCE AGAIN IT WILL NOT CHARGE AT ALL OR TURN ON.WORST TABLET I'VE EVER PURCHASED. PIECE OF JUNK. SAME WITH MY SAMSUNG FRIDGE. I'M DONE WITH SAMSUNG. THEY MAKE GARBAGE NOW. UPDATE: I bought this tablet exactly 60 days ago today.  First the tablet only had a very short battery life (5-6 hrs even not using it, just not charging it).  Now, the charging port won't even charge it no matter how many different new chargers I buy.  This is why I bought this one is because the other one did this after 18 months.  At 2 months old, I am having the same issue.  So disgusted with this product.  I don't know if I got a lemon or what.  I stopped using Samsung phones because they had this same issue but I wanted to give the tablets a try.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I was so disappointed by this tablet.  It is my 3rd Samsung tablet and in the 6 weeks I have had it, it already has no battery life.  I am not someone who is on it all day but even using it off an on during the day, it has a battery life of about 4 hours.  Even if it stays in sleep mode the entire day, it doesn't last even 8 hrs.  I haven't had this issue with Samsung tablets before so I don't know if this was a return or defective because I have noticed in the last year, the quality of the items I have received from Amazon have declined greatly.  I have received items in damaged product boxes or ones that look like they have already been used even though it's sold as new and you pay full price.  I don't know if this is a Samsung problem or Amazon/seller issue but I will probably return it and buy it directly from a store."
The tablet has a bunch of great features to it and because of the features it is my favorite Samsung tablet by far that I’ve owned. But what kills the tablet for me is the fact that the touch screen won’t respond most of the time. I have a screen protector on it and it says to switch on touch sensitivity but even with that the screen barely touches. It’s unusable at this point. I have to hit it just for the screen to touch again just for 10 seconds of touch. What a shame this has been.
"Purchased a TAB 9+.  Three months later the touch screen stopped responding to touch.  After two calls where I was made to go through self checks I was told to bring the unit into a local repair shop.  After driving 30 mins to get there I was told they only repair phones and that the CS the agent gave me bad info. Another call to CS and having to go through the same self checks the agent finally agreed I needed to send the unit in for repair.  I packaged it, and drove to a drop off site.  3 weeks later I got the unit back, it now works but was clearly damaged during the repair. The back cover is bent, the unit is bowed and there are 4  green spots on the screen where there is permanent damage.  Called back to CS where they insinuated that I sent in a damaged unit and they asked me for photos to prove otherwise.  After much argument where I asked why a consumer would expect to need to take photos to defend themselves. they offered to put in an UPS damage claim.  The unit was well wrapped and the packaging was not damaged so I refused to have them pass the buck to UPS.  I insisted on having the issue escalated.  Several days passed b4 I got a call back.  Again it was insinuated that I sent in a damaged unit.  After more argument the best they have offered me is to send the unit back to the same repair shop so they can try to re-repair it.  So for a $200 item under warrantee, I have spent over an hour driving, at least 2 hours on the phone, been hinted at that I'm lying, and still no resolution.  Where is Samsung's common sense, logic and respect for the customer? Buyer be ware."
I attempted to use the provided pin/paperclip/tool to eject the MicroSD card holder/cover.  It was very difficult to eject.  I placed my SD card in the holder and attempted to slide it back in.  It needed considerable force.  after registering the product and looking for the SD card it was not discovered.  I ejected the SD card holder/cover with the Samsung tool and SD card was left jammed in the tablet.  No way to get it out.  The SD card holder came completely out without the SD card!  Upon inspection with a flashlight the end of the SD card is visible but no way to retrieve it.  Be careful inserting your SD card.  This slot is poorly manufactured.  I would not buy this again.
"I didn't realize that this item doesn't include a sd card/storage, and I have to purchase additional memory for $99.99. However, I can utilize the device, but it's not what I expected when I purchased it. I am also an Apple user, and I was looking for a much cheaper way to use technology. I am unable to syncc my information between apps such as, BSF which is a Bible study tool. Also, the device isn't what I expected as far as reading aloud. Apple dictates and is more user friendly in my opinion. I guess now I will just need to purchase additional storage, it'll be much cheaper than increasing my cell phone bill by adding additional devices. Essentially, smart devices depending on preference, performance and learning style is paramount."
"Robloxs is my kids main thing and this runs it great. The only thing that bugs me and why it got a 3 out of 5 is the charger is not a normal UBS changer, its for a mini USB and i dont have anyway to plug that in making me have to buy a charger. But looking past that the tablet looks and runs great for my 10 year old who plays robloxs and watches youtube."
"I ordered the tablet early February 2024. Used it very little until late May. Since then, listening to audiobooks and streaming has been its primary function. A couple of nights ago, I moved it from my kitchen table, where I was watching Netflix, to my bedroom where I intended to finish watching the program. In those 3or4 minutes, it died. Now, it won’t open, charge…..nothing.  Black screen. Very dissatisfied customer here. I need a tablet, but it may not be from Amazon the next time."
"Really disappointed with this tablet. I was trying to replace my Surface Pro with something cheaper. Big mistake. I've really come to hate this android interface. It works fine on my phone, but on this Samsung tablet, it seems clunky and unintuitive. The battery life is ridiculously short. I barely use this tablet for 30 minutes in the morning and it needs to be charged almost every other day. Maybe it comes down to personal preference, but most Microsoft tablets seem to be a lot better than this Droid."
"If you're an android user who has never had a Samsung device, you will not like this. Common settings are gone. The way you do almost anything if pointlessly different than android and usually much worse. If this were a phone I'd return it but for a tablet I'll suffer through. The touch screen is not very responsive, I usually have to touch things more than once to get a response and closer to the edges and corners it takes several attempts to get a response. The hardware is fine and battery life average. If you're used to the Samsung OS you'll be ok with this even though it is so much worse than most Android based OS. It's my last Samsung for sure."
When I received my tablet I was surprised to find there was No power cord included in the packaging. If this item is not included it should be stated in the description so we can purchase it at the same time.Not only is it an inconvenience to wait for this item to be shipped again but I now have to pay an extra shipping cost when receiving it because I live outside of the US.I’m unable to review the quality of this product at this time due to not being able to charge it and open it up. I will submit another review at a later date.
"Samsung's One UI has a very buggy notification badge. I've been seeing bugged notification badges basically daily. The symptom is that there's a number on the icon that never goes away and can't be dismissed. I think I may have found a way to disable this altogether, but come on. This is amateur hour nonsense. The hardware is as promised but don't make it my job to fix your terrible customizations."
"Overall I like this tablet. It's easy to use. The only problem I've had, is the holder for the micro SD card. I've tried 3 different cards and none of them fit the holder.  It gets stuck if I try and gently push it in. I don't want to go through the hassle of replacing the whole unit, so I guess I'll keep it as is."
Sometimes the touch screen doesn't work when the tablet is laying down flat
"I bought this tablet mainly for its 90hz refresh rate, the only problem is one of the One UI updates broke it and now when you set the Refresh Rate to ""Adaptive""(90hz) it's really laggy and this is both on the 4GB and 8GB of RAM models. If you set it to ""Standard""(60hz) this problem disappears. But still disappointing, hopefully Samsung fixes this..... Other then this problem it's a great tablet!"
"I watch a lot of anime and the platform I watch them is Crunchyroll. Sadly iPod does not show english subtitle when the english dub is on. I've heard that Samsung does show sub even with dub in Crunchyroll. So, I decided to give this a try. However this was very disappointing and here is why:Pros:1. The price was reasonable for a Samsung device, making it an accessible option.2. The battery life is decent. It can last through a day of light use without needing a charge.Cons:1. The picture quality is a huge let down. Colors seems washed out and details that aren't as sharp as they should be. Watching video or looking at photos aren't enjoyable at all.2. Low sound volume. Even at maximum volume, the audio is quiet and clarity isn't great. This really limits its usefulness.3. The performance is average at best. While it handles basic tasks fine, it starts to lag when running multiple apps."
"like screen, speakers.dislike buttons close together, off and speaker."
"Decent tablet for the price, but infinitely slower than any Samsung phone I've had over the past 8 years. I wrote it off at first as it was installing updates, but after a week of using it, having very few apps on it and restarting it several times, it's still incredibly slow. Very disappointing."
"I bought this because SmartView had Second Screen functionality being built out for it. It would allow you to use the tablet as an extended desktop monitor. Samsung killed that functionality in an update. Now I just have a slow, hardly responsive tablet....that has ads baked into the OS. :/"
PROS:* Screen is bright with sharp colors* Good touch response* Price* Good for Samsung device ownersCONS:* Pre-loaded with Samsung related appsI have used a variety of tech devices and operating systems. This tablet just didn’t appeal to me.Still looking for a good Android tablet. The last good one I used was the Nexus tablet.
"I finally got everything set up. Tablet didn't include S pen. I am so disappointed that I  can't seem to find any help with trying to resolve this issue. I thought maybe I could use my S pen from my old tablet. However, the new tablet has no information on how to connect it. I don't think it supports an S pen. I'm thinking about returning the tablet."
"I keep going back to my old S3 tablet.  It's a better tablet. The screen is washed out.  There is no bixby.  The shape is totally wrong unless you like an 11 inch phone.  The front camera and light sensor are on the long side which I keep covering with my hand, which dims the screen. The audio is decent but there are no audio settings like on the S tablets.  Also  the S pens dont work on it.  If you buy this hoping to use your s pen, you will be disappointed.That's all."
"....maybe it's just the battery in MY tablet, but it does not keep a charge at all and takes forever and a day to charge.  I bought several USB C chargers and the only one that seems to charge a bit quicker, but still over 7 hours to fully charge and can not be used during that time, is the 240V usb C charger.  This tablet can not be off the charger very long and even when it is on the charger and being used, it still loses power even though it shows the charging symbol.  Aside from the battery issues, I like this tablet for its storage space, but still, I am disappointed in this unit and have to see if i can get the battery replaced for a better one....then i will love it.  No stars on battery life."
"I love the tablet but within 4 months it has charging problems.  I am using the charger that came with it and it only charges to 79% and stops. And when it does charge, it is VERY SLOW.  I have had several Samsung tablets and loved them all.  Love this one....but what good is it with the charging problem."
It was supposed to be new but when I received it had a bump on it and whatever the bump is is causing the bump light thing on the front screen. It does still work fine.
"Seems to need continuous charging.  I do heavily use it though.  Maybe i should have got an S tablet, one was on sale recently fornot much more money"
"Key points to note:- No official charger included- No audio jackSamsung's claim that not including an official charger is an effort to be more ""green"" feels flawed. It likely increases resource use and handling since people are forced to buy a charger separately.I'd love to give this tablet more stars because it feels like a solid product for what it is. However, adopting some of Apple's worse practices is something I can't support by buying their products in the future.Additionally, it comes with a fair bit of bloatware. Do everyone a favor and remove the unnecessary apps that nobody wants."
"My first venture into android devices, only to discover when opening the box it says to install SD card, then  (in ridiculous 8 pt font) “SD card not included” .Looks like I have to order an SD card.I don’t recall seeing that as a critical piece of equipment required when ordering the tablet.The charging cable comes with it, but the type C charging Adaptor does not.One more thing to order before I turn this on.ipad looks REALLY good right now."
"I was so excited to try this tablet for my art, as Android has a ton of things that make for an efficient workflow including air gestures (with the S-Pen Pro, not included), air actions, DEX mode, syncing with my Windows computer, and so much more. The mint color is gorgeous, and I loved everything about the tablet... except that it couldn't do the ONE thing I bought it to do.It worked fine at first, but then I noticed there was an extreme delay in gestures when switching from pen to gesture, and sometimes just wouldn't work at all. This happened in my Clip Studio app as well as others. I spent hours with support for the tablet and with CSP before being forced to factory reset, which somehow solved it... Until I installed the updates.Turns out, the issue is with OneUI, and hasn't been resolved for years according to the complaints on Reddit dating back to 2022. This delay completely interrupts my workflow, as I can not seamlessly switch from drawing with the pen, to zooming or rotating with my hand.I had returned the first tablet I got, under the direction of the support desk, only to get a second one, spend hours re-installing my brushes on CSP, only to find the same problem. It's definitely an issue with OneUI.For everyone else who doesn't care, or who doesn't intend to use it for art, it's 100% fantastic. Bright screen, powerful budget tablet that can do so much more than you think it can.For artists? I am so sad to claim defeat to the iPad which can do the one thing this one can not: Work.The straw that broke the camel's back for me is more of an issue with Clip Studio Paint's Android version which does not allow you to access your files in ANY other way except through the cloud, making it absolutely impossible to batch move your files from your tablet's CSP to your desktop, external HD, or other devices. You literally have to manually open each file from the cloud, onto desktop, then save it where you want. Or you have to access the files ONE at a time through the cloud, click an arrow, open the file location, cut the file and paste it where you want. And of course the file location doesn't have ALL your images in one place. it places it within 3 tiers of foldiers for each. individual. file.So after going through 2 tablets, hours of support, blood sweat and tears, I finally have to call it quits on the Samsung Tablet yet again and switch to the 2x more expensive iPad. I'm so devastated."
"The S9 Fe works fine, its the long shape and size that bothers me.I like the functionality of Samsung and the way they work, so I've been waiting for them to hopefully make a smaller and more proportioned one, like the ipads, but they haven't.  I like the Ipads' shape and size options much better, but I dont like their restricted system, so I wont even consider getting an Ipad.I got this Samsung S9 Fe thinking it didnt look as big and rectangular as the others but when I unpacked it, I was disappointed as it is indeed too long on it's side and over an inch bigger than my S2, which is a nice 9.7"".On the S9 FE, which is 10.9 inches, I have to push it far back from me to watch videos, as the screen is too big for watching videos in front of me.  And the rectangular shape makes it more awkward for watching videos.  Not to mention there's no headphone jack on the S9 FE.My Samsung S2 Tablet it has worked very well throughout the years I've had it.  It has a nicer, more proportioned (squarer) shape and is smaller - good for  watching videos in front of me.My older Samsung S2 Tablet has a Super AMOLED screen, whereas the S9 Fe has an IPS LCD screen.  I paid about $160 for the S2 and this S9 fe was $400 + tax- just overpriced!I will say, the video quality isnt bad on the S9 FE, but it looks kind of odd on a bigger rectangular screen.The display on the S9 fe only gives you Vivid and Natural color display options, whereas my much older S2 gives more options, like Amoled, Adaptive, Reading and Basic.  This doesn't bother me, as i use the Eye Comfort Shield anyway to remove the strong blue light from the screen, but the colors do still come through.* Pic comparisons of my S2 vs S9 Fe.I've had my Samsung S2 Tablet for at least 7 years and it still works well, with some minor slowdown at times.  The only reason I need a newer one is because some of the apps i need to use no longer work on my older S2, like Word & Excel."
"I upgraded to this from a first gen iPad pro because I wanted the pen.  And I'm not convinced it was a good move.  It seems like every time I pick this tablet up, the battery is either dead or it wants to install a new software upgrade.  Software upgrades are good and all, but I haven't spent all this money to be continually denied use of my tablet for updates that constantly need to be installed. This is after 6 months of use.  Update all that when it's activated, I don't use a tablet to be continuously updating Samsung software. Otherwise, the microsd port is da bomb; all your media is available to you anytime, anyplace.  Display and speakers are phenomenal.  100% an upgrade from an iPad Pro unless you're heavily invested in Apple, which means really, no Apple fans are reading this."
"Nice in just about every way, except for the fact that after transferring files and contacts from an iPad and smart phone, I discovered that it would not detect brand new Samsung microSD cards (neither 512GB or 256GB) which necessitated calling Samsung Support on two different days, spending over an hour each time while they remotely took over the tablet and tried everything under the sun at least three times each, only to have them reluctantly conclude that I got a faulty tablet- that was factory sealed brand new. *sigh*The second support agent then said I’d have to send it to their repair facility and wait who-knows-how-long for them to fix it or replacement, which was not the kind of support I had expected from Samsung!Update: After returning the S9FE I ordered a newA9+ and guess what!? That’s right it doesn’t recognize SD cards either- even though the provided instructions for both models instruct you to insert a microSD card before doing anything else!But this time, rather than wasting more time getting nowhere with Samsung support, I tried a few things on my own and figured out what the problem is.Too bad Samsung seemingly can’t be bothered doing the same!"
"I actually have two of these same models, the second one purchased after I dropped the first and the above mentioned screen spiderwebbed.  Device still functions, and it's very nice to have for reading browsin and streaming.  My second device has faired better as I purchased a nice case that has kept it fairly secure through all my travels.  Though today I noticed it still has developed a crack on in it's screen.  Annoying screen issues aside, the functionality of the device is excellent.  Great for note taking, browsing, reading or streaming on the go."
"Doesn't have sim card slot, no charger included and will not work with HDMI adapter. I like the S pen and the screen resolution."
Takes a long time to open several apps installed from the Google Play Store.  Smaller apps open quickly.
"I got this to serve as a mobile screen for my main laptop, as well as a smaller laptop I could use when my main laptop was busy or my work required less horsepower than my main computer.  I also wanted to be able to connect it to secondary screens (i.e.:  a Trio secondary monitor) or to projectors, and use my cell phone provider (T-Mobile's) mobile network, as necessary.The version I got does not have the ability to connect to other displays via USB-C to HDMI cables, nor does it connect to secondary screens or projectors like my laptop does, nor can I use it with a SIM card.  I can connect to my laptop wirelessly,  but it does not do everything I expected it to do.  Further, I wasn't aware that the one I got wouldn't work with SIM cards or HDMI cables before I bought it, and I had to dig through websites and documentation to find out that this model just doesn't do that.I would not have bought this if I had known it would have these problems, especially since it seems that there are other Samsung models that do everything I mentioned without problems.  If you also want it to work with mobile networks or connect to secondary screens or displays via HDMI, I recommend buying something else.  If it were possible to get my money back for this purchase and get something else, I would do that.  As is, I am making do but I am not happy with this purchase."
Samsung help line help me out was about to return this and get a different brand.
"Why do all tablets suffer from obsolescence a few weeks after you buy them?  CPU in this new Samsung is marginal at best.  Already suffering slowdowns when surfing the web and just trying to set it up.About all I can say good about it is it is better than my older tablets with lesser processors.  My old el-cheapo Moto phone is faster. With WiFi off it takes seconds to load simple apps, then lags to change screens.But it is better than my older tablets.  Reviewers say you play video games on this tablet?  If a simple vacuum cleaner app is slow, what's a game going to do."
"The display is much worse than the one on my 5 year old Note 10+; there are no blacks, only dark grays.  Buy the full S9 if you are going to view any videos or photographs. Many of my touches are ignored, but there are equally many accidental touches. The fingerprint sensor is on the side, so you will lock yourself out of your tablet just by picking it up. But when you try to log into an app with your fingerprint, you cannot find the sensor. This was no longer a problem after I put it in a case. Battery life is not good, and the tablet is slow to charge. Many of the apps are different from the same apps on my phone, and usually worse, especially the Samsung apps. Syncing with my phone is poor, and connecting to the same Bluetooth devices is cumbersome. It's a bit slow - not a problem for me, but if you want snappy performance, this is not your tablet. If none of this bothers you, it's a solid tablet. But if you can afford it, get the regular S9. It's worth the price difference."
it's insane to me that a samsung tablet cannot communicate through a USB-C/HDMI cable. other tablets of theirs can. they have a whole app to change the tablet to work like a docked computer. it's called DeX. and guess what? DeX comes on this tablet! but you can't use it to show on another screen. dumbest thing I've ever seen. I thought this tablet would use DeX like the others. NOPE. I do not recommend this model if you want to connect via cable. very disappointing. I wish I could return it.
"Don't understand the hate. BUT so far it has held up. Few times I used it as a 3rd screen which has been all right, a little delay though. As a tablet, it's a little slow-loading on websites. And Goodnotes comes preinstalled, it's fine but not suitable with the tablet, few times the app has crashed. Easy startup, IF you have a Samsung account.IT DOES NOT COME WITH A CHARGING BRICK AND FOR THE PRICE, IT SHOULD COME WITH IT. ALSO WITH THE SPACE STILL AVAILABLE IN THE BOX."
"The only thing I don’t like is that after a stroke, it’s really hard to use and turn off. I had to find the off button."
"Very unhappy with this purchase. I've had it less than 24 hours. The item will not charge. I have tried 5 different chargers, plug it in, charge picture pops up, immediately disappears. Not only that but the video quality doesn't seem great. I'm really very disappointed. Not sure I could suggest any new Samsung tablets."
"This info WAS on the website but honestly didn’t see it as it was not prominently featured. I’m astonished that any electronic item that cost this much does not come with everything it needs FOR IT TO WORK. I mean, come on Samsung - it’s a $7 part that should definitely be included in the box. I’m also disappointed in the keyboard/case that was featured with it. I bought it thinking it was an actual case that protected the tablet. It is not. It’s a cool stand- but not a protective case."
"I hate how this became a thing what now I'm wasting more packaging getting a charger brick. Outside of that haven't used it, but have been pretty happy with Samsung tablets in the past. So hopefully will be the same with this one. Will possibly update in the future."
I was ordering cases a couple weeks ago and notice the case was bowed on the top only to find out it’s not the case at all it’s my tablet that’s bowed
"I been using this tablet, I'm not a tech type of person by no means.  I just found out May 4th 2024 that this tablet may not have a SIM CARD port!  Grrrrrr so my issue is it may not work properly with my needs for my business. I was basically forced to purchase this item on that paticular day because no one else had one.  So I highly recommend everyone do more research before you buy.  I'm currently trying to find out if I can get the EXACT same tablet, with a sim card OPTION not just WI-FI.  This paticular one is WI-FI ONLY!!!!!!  So far this is the only thing I find extremely bad or important to know.  I made a poor choice and now I have to live with it,  because I doubt I can get my money back. I will try diligently, but I assume they wont refund my money. Thank you if you read my issue. Please be sure what you read and need. Sincerly Rick, N."
Great product but almost impossible to shut it off!
Supposed to be able to fast charge.  Includes a cable but no charger.  Instructions state charger is available separately.  Did not see that stated in product description.
"Everything seems nice and sleek but so far I've been unable to get it to consistently read any sim card, the sim and sd holder looks damaged but not sure if that's normal. Given my issues I'm thinking it's damaged.I have the T-Mobile version and have tried my T-Mobile SIM. Google fi sims(T-Mobile Network) at one point it read the Google fi card and wiped the whole tablet and now boots showing T-Mobile(hadn't shown any carrier info before )on startup but still no cellular connection. Can't get esim or apn settings to work.Waiting on a new SIM card before I return it.Update. New TMobile SIM arrived and when it does read it it says network locked and is unable to unlock. Tested again with sims from att, Google, Verizon and all say the same. Stopped by T-Mobile store since this was the T-Mobile version with T-Mobile SIM and they couldn't figure it out and recommend returning it. Also stopped by Verizon next door on the off chance they could help and they had the same recommendation.Returning and debating on trying this one again or waiting to see what comes out later this year."
"I previously had an S2 previously, which finally died due to battery failure.  The new one was more aggravating to set up and I don't like the screen keyboard.  For the price, it is utterly ridiculous that you have to pay separately for the AC adapter!  So far it is stable, which the old one was not at the end.  Hopefully it will grow on me."
I really have been enjoying my new tablet. I wanted something with a pen so I can do more digital notes for various things like school and genealogy. So far it has been good. Be careful with the pin number! I didn't realize samsung erases everything if the pin code is forgotten. So now I'll probably have to factory reset and lose all my notes!
Opening the packaging taking  computer out of the boxing was badly arranged and extremely difficult.
"Beautifully designed, lightweight. However my tablet battery has issues. It cannot hold the charge long enough. The other day I only used it for 28 minutes and its battery charge dropped 16%. Not happy with this tablet. Planning to return it."
"the tablet only holds a charge for 2-3 days, then goes to 0 battery. i have to charge it at least every other day to keep up the battery. this is without using it"
Seemed very cumbersome to set up and was finicky to use. Returned and purchased ipad
"Your passwords from your Samsung phone won't sync with this tablet.Why? Your phone has Samsung Wallet. This tablet has Samsung Pass. And this tablet cannot get the Samsung Wallet.So, make sure you save your passwords elsewhere. Cause they will not sync.Otherwise, an OK tablet. Not a great one. Kind of slow charging. It is light.  Battery life is ok.No way was it worth the intro price.I got a notice the other day on my tablet that I cannot sync the Samsung browser with any other Samsung devices. So don't think you will sync that jazz either with your phone. Would return it if possible."
"Without a type C adaptor, I can't plug it in to recharge it; you're instructed to insert an SD card, but doesn't tell you that it must be a micro SD, which you don't really need. It was challenging to sync the tablet with my Samsung phone. I'm still working to set it up after 2 days. It may prove to be a fabulous unit, but I'll get back to you on that."
"Purchased this during Prime Day.  Sold to me as a new device--maybe that wasn't accurate.The device completely bricked after a little over two weeks.  Wouldn't turn on, wouldn't charge--just dead.  Took it to a Samsung Store tech guy who told me it had been previously opened, and showed me a photo of the camera lens to prove it.  I couldn't see anything in the photo, but basically he told me that Samsung won't warranty the device based on his say so.  They were pretty busy, and maybe he just wanted to get rid of me.  He recommended I return it to Amazon.So I am in the process of doing that.  Unfortunately, Amazon can't issue a replacement for some reason.  They tell me it will take two weeks to issue a refund, and after that I can purchase it again on their site (which can be done now) and they will reimburse me the difference.  I will have to wait and see how this return goes.  I may be returning the cover I purchased as well."
This tablet can play music out loud but not with headphones unless they're Bluetooth which I had didn't try out so I'm not for sure the tablet heats up pretty quickly and the writing pen isn't great and they do not like to do a refund I've been trying to get refund for 2 weeks and when I finally got it refund they scam 71 off of it Amazon's working to fix it though so that's good but the seller did not want to give a refund
"Now waiting for an SD card and a Type-C adapter. I'd also like to use some of my older earbuds, but alas, those too are not standard.  I want to love you, Samsung, but you make it so damn hard."
"The builtin GPS does not work. The GPS receiver sub-system seems to be OK, but there is a firmware bug preventing the apps from getting the position.So, if you want to use this for real-time navigation out of the box, wait until the GPS-fix is ready and tested.Other than that, It's a good tablet like most of Samsung tablets are, once you disable some of the bloatware and silence the Bixber."
"No headphone jack. The 11 inch screen is actually too big and awkward to use personally.Can't charge it and use headphones at the same time unless you use blue tooth headphones, limiting usage with your existing hardware.Placement of the screen buttons is so awkward and finicky, and difficult to configure into a way it doesn't always need to be set.Overall, the device is hard to use on places engineering was skipped out on."
"It works, but it's not brand new, no original package, no pen, only tablet and a charger.Mine is AT&T version, but you can not use a cellphone sim card in it, you have to buy a new data only card."
"Overall I really like this tablet. It is big, bright, full featured (for a mid priced tablet) and lightweight.I was sold a 256G tablet, and only given a 128G tablet. Pretty disappointing in that regard.sWith that said; The price I was sold was typical market price for a 128G Tablet. I thoght I was getting a deal, turns out I did not.I will most likely not send the tablet back.After the effort to set it up, then to discover more or less by accident it was not the memory I was sold was a bit of a let down, but I really like the tablet overall.I would not mind at all if Amazon made it right by sending me a SD card to slip into the machine to make it into what I was sold. This seems like a reasonable compromise."
"The tablet is all good but mine came with no cover, I had to purchase one separately."
"The product description specify that came with a smart book cover, and the item wasn't included in the box or delivered"
So the tablet itself is great but the s pen that came with it had the tip pushed way in when I got it. I was able to write with it for the most part but any drawing and coloring with it didn't work right. It didn't sense any of the pressure changes and would randomly bounce around writing in random spots on the screen. (At first I thought maybe the pen was dead but nothing changed after making sure it was fully charged) I luckily have one from my old samsung tablet that works way better than the new one. I tried finding a way to contact the seller for a replacement but I want able to find a contact option. It would be nice to have a new pen to go with the new tablet but we will see if anyone reaches out.
"I have tried everything from changing Dark to Light, Vivid to Natural, I took it out of Power Saving Mode, and I even got an update on a brand new tablet, but side by side with the 9+ FE, my laptop, and my Samsung phone, the tablet colors are dull.  I read a lot of posts online with people complaining about this happening after having their tablets a long time, but this one is NEW.I think I will have to return it.  The display is not where it needs to be."
"The tablet works fine. Just beware that the price you pay can be drastically reduced and they will not match the price, I paid 380. A week later it eas $319. Amazon will not match the price."
"This review is not for the tablet but the shipping package, I haven't used the tablet yet so I can't speak as to its performance. However for being such an expensive and delicate product it was haphazardly thrown into the shipping box with no protection no bubble wrap nothing, I also bought a case that was also in the box. Such an expensive device could have easily been damaged due to carelessness, that's why I gave it a low rating. I have not used the tablet yet so I can't say whether or not it was damaged. I will say as something good that it did arrive very quickly."
The pen is falling and the bloated software is too much
"This tablet when you're typing skips all over the place. You'll type a certain letter but you don't have any confidence of it showing up. I press T I get O, it jumps off the page and It closes constantly. It's even worse when you're speaking into it, It doesn't seem to understand plain english and constantly is putting in periods if you take even a split second in between words. You have to go to what you've typed and clean it up before you send it or god knows what it will read. This is the worst tablet I've ever owned. I just got rid of my Pixel tablet and went back to the Samsung. I'm getting rid of this immediately and I'll never buy another Samsung product. They are overhyped and overpriced for the crap they put out."
Well designed case every detail figured out
"I am extremely disappointed with my purchase. The product arrived in a plastic bag, inside was the original box. The box itself had two security seals, one of which had been tampered with and merely retaped with a clear sticker. The tablet was missing a protective screen and wasn’t placed in the white protective bag as expected. Additionally, the box was used and damaged. I didn’t even bother starting the tablet and will be returning it immediately. Please ensure that you inspect your items upon arrival to avoid receiving a returned or previously used product."
"Hopefully it was justa defective tablet. I can't imagine anyone would pay money for a tablet that takes 30+ seconds to open every website- even basic sites require you to pay attention as the screen will shutoff before webpages open with default timeout.  I'm not used to seeing a spinning wheel when opening settings....If you use this for things less intense than casual web browsing, this might be nice.  Otherwise ignore at all costs!  It does look nice"
"This is my second Galaxy tablet. I loved the first one until I stepped on it... This one was great until a week ago when it went dark. It's new, not refurbished. After shaking it, the display came back on. After a few minutes, it went off again. I had enough time to confirm the battery was fully charged, so it wasn't that. It would come on normally for a bit, but as soon as I moved it, the display went off again. Unfortunately I missed the window for returns by 3 days, so I guess I'm stuck. Teaches me not to buy the warranty. I won't buy tech from Amazon again as this isn't the first problem I've had. One month return window is inadequate. Goodbye $350."
The tablet size is great and the display is amazing the only thing I do not like it’s the battery life. I have an iPad and even when I don’t use it for 2+ days it still has battery this tablet dies on a daily basis even when it’s not in use.
"So far, hate the person who brought it here. I like that it is pretty big.It will be opened on Xmas day and tryed."
"I love Samsung and have a galaxy tab S7 ultra tablet that was great until my daughter dropped it in water and it doesn't work right anymore, anyways, I got this one and it stopped working right within a week and so I sent it back, I didn't buy another either because it broke that early, I don't trust their manufacturing anymore.  The Galaxy 7 ultra tablet that cost me over a grand was supposed to be water resistant but my daughter dropped it in the tub for 1 seconds and it never worked right again, I still have it in hopes of trying to fix it or something. But with that tablet breaking so quick and this new one not working after a week, maybe I should move on from Samsung products for good then even if I don't wanna"
Defective tablet. Worked for 2hrs then entered a constant reboot mode. Returning and looking at other options.
How can I write a review when it will not turn on or charge.
I don't like the recent forced update that changed the way the navigation bar originally worked. I'm really glad it happened while the return window is still open. I hate these devices changing the way they work after you already paid for it.
It is not even a year and the battery has to be replaced.  This is ridiculous as it is very expensive.
After 7 months of use the battery died and can't find another one to put in it.  Making it useless.
"In order to use this tablet you have to create or login into an existing account.I can't seem to log into my Samsung account using the google SSO which is how I setup the account.  I don't get an option to sign in with the google SSO and I can't use the email address and password for my google account as it's trying to log me into an account created with Samsung and the password is invalid.  Great job Samsung.  You just sold me a brick as I can't get past this without creating an alternative account.  if I had known this was a requirement beforehand, I would have bought another brand!"
Tablet stops charging after 1 second you have to turn it off to charge it and now its not doing that anymore this store is crap and since I put all my banking info in it i cant return it. Went against my better judgment ordering from you after i saw another review about same thing but thought maybe that was a fluke but no you sell broken tablets to people Amazon should get rid of you and your garbage electronics!!
"It does not have HDMI outIt can not use a sim cardThe worst part is that other samsung tablets do, but there is no warning about this. I ordered a sim card but found out it simply doesn't work. Its kind of a rip-off."
"I bought this because it is not listed as being locked.I need a T-Mobile compatible device for my Google fi plan which runs off T-Mobiles network. After being jerked around for an afternoon by everyone involved, the blame appears to have fallen at Samsung's feet. They stopped helping so I decided to return the device for something that actually works with my 5g network."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                The tablet is alright, i had it for like 26 days good thing i didnt pass the 30 days so i can do the return. It was working good but i noticed yesterday i left it to charge ober night, i woke up in the morning to see the battery still low. I tried different charging wires and adaptors nothing working. I felt disappointed i dont know if ill use samsung tablet again (eventhough i have the s21 and s23 ultra). Specially because i had set it up for my trading apps and now i have to go on another tablet."
"Description doesn't say anything about used items. Was sent a used, opened box with no discount, nothing saying on the product that it is use/open box. Complete waste of time and money."
"Not worth $500Cheap CPU, cheap usb interface, cheap display and a cheap pen. That's not mid-level, that's cheap!"
"After many hours on the phone, Verizon could still not get the SIM card to connect properly.  Also, while Samsung claims you can link the tablet to your Samsung phone and then use the tablet as a phone, it doesn't work and Verizon says it cannot be done.  You have to add a new phone line at Verizon for the tablet at $20/month plus a $35. ""activation"" fee so you  can connect it to a cell tower and use it without WiFi, but you'll still need to carry your cell phone.  Buy a WiFi only version, not one higher priced and set up for Verizon.  Verizon was a nightmare to work with and then with no success."
"Slow and inundated with Samsung software, which is a bloat upon every Samsung device I've had. Simply writing this review using voice dictation is a hassle. Several password managers are all but useless. It's slow. Repetitive actions frequently lead to different results."
Very slow/horrible for note taking/drawingThe S pen feels like it was made from a cheap materialThe tablet lags super bad/having delays!
Color size weight amazing picture quality....Love it
The price of the same device on Costco with 128GB is $50 less than the price here.  I chosen this one because it claims to have 256GB.  The device I received has a storage of 128GB.
"The tablet is as advertised, that being said the only problerm is that  the IMEI version IS NOT COMPATABILE WITH THE VERIZON NETWORK, as per Verizon tech. Spent hours researching this Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Wi-Fi/5G (US CELLER) tablet thinking that (US CELLER) ment that it would work with with all major carriers. I was WRONG. (SHAME ON ME FOR BELIEVING WHAT WAS PRINTED ON AMAZON) . Sending it back.samsung"
"I purchased this tablet, and it clearly state that it comes with 256g... But when look at the internal hard drive it states 128... Why?!"
as stated unit would not charge. tech support advised to return and I did return it.
Don't buy this. The device stopped working after a few weeks. Still haven't gotten around the return process as it's already outside the return window so Amazon refuses to help.
"This product never worked. I bought it for my wife but when we tried to set it up it sent 2-step code to a machine we do not own and a phone we do not own. It is  useless,  and Amazon won't let me return it."
"HUGE WASTE OF MONEY! NEVER AGAIN!!! I can not believe I spent $1,000 purchasing two of these terrible tablets. Now outside of the 30 day return window. The unit does not turn on, stay on. I had to google how to force it on (power and volume down button for 15-30 seconds) and sometimes that doesn't even work. You would not believe how many search options Google has regarding unresponsive Samsung tablets. SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR MONEY and buy something else. Did I mention how TERRIBLE THIS MACHINE IS????"
I ordered this tablet a couple of weeks ago it was supposed to been on sale and come with 12 0% interest free payments. I checked my account today I was billed for the entire thing and not only that they got the tablet at an additional $50 off right now. Don't get me wrong I love the tablet I just don't like the marketing strategies.
"After one week, the pen stopped working. No troubleshooting worked. Hours of customer service time wasted. It just stopped working. I feel cheated."
"When ""tablet only"" is selected, it is noted in two areas that a cover is included, even ""what's in the box"". I was informed after an hour on the phone that it's not included with tablet only. Very Sketchy....."
"I was under the impression this would work with Google Fi's data only SIMs (their help center lists Galaxy tablets beyond the S2 as supported), and Google Fi is T-Mobile under the hood. But the T-Mobile version of this tablet rejects anything that isn't a T-Mobile SIM and won't progress beyond the SIM set up screen without providing one. Returned."
Lasted only 4 months and after that  the  battery would not charge.
"I returned this in April, nothing was wrong with it, just got something different. Still won't refund my money and it was brand new!"
Did not work when it arrived. Returning it now.
"Description not accurate for the item that you receive. This does not come with a Smart Book Cover. Not only are there pictures shown with it, but it is identified as included in 2 places on the listing. ""Product information --> Item details --> Included Components --> Smart Book Cover"" and ""What's in the box --> Smart Book Cover""."
The device received was defective. It would shut down while using it . Had to return to seller.
Looks like a good table but arrived with a lot of damage a mark on the screen dent in the back a little bent and the s pen was almost broken in half may have been an Amazon problem or a usps problem
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The localization does not work well, it freezes"
"Just got the tablet today ,and was barely about to put on the screen protector, and there's already a scratch on the screen I just bought this brand new"
"The item being shipped has 128 GB. Scroll down to the very bottom of the page. Summary shows 128 GB. If you are happy with that, this is a great tablet. The price just dropped from $599 to $549. Just know that you will get 128 GB, not 256 GB.FYI -Refund required sending a copy of a government I.D."
Can't use superdisplay on this tablet because Samsung cut USB video ability
This tablet doesn't have a IMEI number  no IP address doesn't have a sim card  slot only sd card  slot.
"Device:  Kindle Fire 8 (10th Generation)I purchased 8 of these Fire tablets for use in an elementary classroom.  They were to be used exclusively to access the Myon ereader app through our district’s Clever page.  Sounded simple enough!  Yet, I have had the most frustrating experience with educational technology I have ever had.First, I set up a child’s profile so that I could limit what the students had access to.  The child’s profile comes preloaded with 100 videos/apps on the home screen!  It was insane!  (Note that this is not the “Kids” Fire, just a regular one with a child profile set up.)  It took 4 different customer serv agents and about 3 hours to finally find someone who could tell me how to turn them off.  It ended up being a simple toggle, so how could that many people not know how?  (This was after I had searched through multiple threads online from frustrated parents with the same issue.)  FYI, in the child’s profile, toggle off the option to Enable web access.  However, this means that you will then have to go in an Allow Content for every app that you do want them to access as well as allow every web page they can go to.  For me, not a huge deal because I bought these for one specific purpose, but as you will see below, even that was a ridiculously frustrating process.After figuring out the toggle solution, I started going into the settings of each Kindle to set them up.  On the 8th and final Kindle, it didn’t work.  After restarting and then trying to power off/wait/power on, I finally decided to delete the profile and reinstall it.  Upon doing this, the child profile interfaces of ALL 8 tablets completely changed.  The original wallpaper/setup was single solid light blue page with cloud outline in background.  After I reinstalled the profile, the wallpaper was a black/aqua/purple paint splatter with a “For Me”, “Home”, and some other tab.  Under the For Me tab were ALL the videos and apps that I had disabled access to.  Even though the toggle was set to disable, they were all back and could be opened.  I then factory reset the device, and it still didn’t work.  I finally tried to create yet another new child profile, and then it finally went back.  No rhyme or reason.So, now to the task of setting them up for Myon.  I downloaded the Myon app, but it would not work.  I think this was an issue on our district permission side.  (And even though I did a press/hold and told it to remove the app from the profile and then completely deleted Myon from my account via the Content and Devices setting of my Amazon.com account, it was still showing up!  And if the child tapped it, it became stuck in a loop of trying to install an app that was no longer there.)  Anyway, I was told by our Academic Tech dept to go through the Clever app.  Guess what – it’s not available on the Amazon app store.  So, I had to go through the web.  In the Allow Content section of Settings, you can allow specific websites, which is great.  However, even though I allowed the website to access Clever, at every step, the child’s profile web browser said no permission.  I had to enable every single page the kids will go through to get to their Myon account, and even then they have to know to navigate around an “Uh oh” page that still pops up every time, even though I allowed it.Because of this, I needed to make step-by-step instructions by taking screenshots so I could print for the kids so they could remember all these steps.  However, screenshots taken while in child’s profile cannot be located anywhere, not in the child or adult profiles.  (Camera and photo storage had been enabled.)  Regular photos taken with the camera could be found in the photos app, and I found an online thread suggesting going through the Files app, but they are nowhere to be found.  I can’t take the screenshots in the adult profile because the screen looks completely different.  I spent 20 minutes on chat with a CSR this morning only to be told he would ‘notify the team.’  The threads I read about this same issue were from 2020 and 2021, so I’m sure they know and have chosen not to fix it.My multiple chat sessions were also frustrating.  With this particular one, I took the time to write out, in detail, the exact steps I followed, only to have him ask – two separate times - if I had tried something that I had already said I tried.  I had this same issue with other CSR chats.  These are the least knowledgeable CSRs I have ever dealt with.  One, named Jestin, kept telling me to tap the Menu button, and there was not a menu button on my screen.  After hanging up with her, I continued to research online, and found the exact script she was using, and it was for a Kindle eReader, not a Fire!  She didn’t even have the right device, and she kept getting very angry with me when I couldn’t follow her instructions.  She kept me on hold for 10 minutes when I asked to speak with someone else, then came back on and (unsurprisingly) said she couldn’t find anyone else.I usually have great customer service with Amazon, but they have truly failed with their training related to the Kindle Fire devices.  They would have me wait for 10 minutes sometimes, only to come back and ask me to try something that I had already told them I tried.Almost every single thing I have tried to do with these has required me to spend an inordinate amount of time researching previous threads, chatting online with a specialist, or on the phone.  It took 3 separate calls to finally get someone who was willing to take over my Fire so they could see what I was seeing, and even so, I still cannot use them in the way that I need to.  You definitely get what you pay for, I guess.  Such a shame when teachers have to use their own money to provide these opportunities for their students.  I have wasted hours of my time and a lot of my money.  I hope I can save another teacher some of this endless frustration."
"I was looking for a wall-mounted pad to centralize and control my Alexa-based smart home.  For the price, you can't beat it, but it's a hack (at best) with mixed results. The HD8 is a perfect size for this kind of application.There are several aftermarket wall mounts, I'm very happy with the one I got, but I did need to saw it to get access to the volume controls. You will need to access them frequently so look for a mount with exposed volume buttons. My mount has wired USB power but there are several options from POE to mains on most available 3rd party mounts.Smart Home Dashboard:The ""show mode"" has a dedicated button on the lower task bar which is handy, but it only surfaces ~50% of your smart devices and lacks support for groups, routines and other functionality.  You'll still need to launch the native Alexa App to have the needed functionality.  The native Alexa App is UGLY on this device as compared to the stock android version.  It can only show in white (light theme), and it's missing a GUI — it looks like a 1990's HTML web page that doesn't have CSS support.The main challenges I'll share are two-fold; making the user experience streamlined, and integrating with media playback.User ExperienceShovelware!  The price is low because this is jam-pact with marketing shovelware, everything is crammed with upsells, recommendations, and tons of clutter.  Getting the GUI to be simple and intuitive requires a lot of setup config to systematically remove all the clutter, but it is possible with dedication.  The stock desktop backgrounds are all bright and busy, I had to link to my Amazon photos and upload a solid grey image to replace the crazy graphics because there are no solid color stock backgrounds available in the settings.There's an upsell when you buy the pad to ""remove lock-screen ads"" you absolutely should buy that option unless you want a crazy distracting flashing panel on your wall.I suggest enabling the recent apps ""continue"" option on the homescreen setting that creates a large UI component with the last 6 apps used. Much easier to see than a cluster of small icons spread over the desktop.  This is a great feature and should be developed more. In my application as a smart home dashboard, 6 featured apps are more than enough.Media PlaybackThe speakers on the pad are tiny and cheap, you'll need to bluetooth or hard-wire from the headphone jack to get any acceptable sound. It supports the Alexa multi-room speaker groups feature, but you'll need to add the phrase ""play XXX on the XXX group"" everytime you ask for audio playback, and limit yourself to only a few Amazon sanctioned music services, I think that's a really terrible user experience.You can bluetooth to another Echo speaker, but if that speaker is set up as a stereo pair, you'll only get it to play on one, not both. Basicly the media playback functionality is sub par and needs a lot of work.For my application, I elected NOT to use the pad for the Alexa/music speaker group support and instead bluetooth it to my network Yamaha receiver.  This decision was partly because I use the PLEX app to serve my home media needs, and the PLEX skill only works locally on any given Alexa device and is blocked from using speaker groups. I'd need to enjoy my music on the tablet's 1/4"" speakers, or bluetooth to an external device.To complicate matters further this solution required me to use the Yamaha AV Controller android app to remotely choose inputs and receiver volume or—I'd need to run back to the media hub to change the receiver settings defeating the purpose of a remote pad.Unfortunately, the Yamaha AV Controller android app is not available in the Fire Appstore as is typical with all other audio-gear manufacturer apps. The Fire App Store is for your children. It's only has super-basic apps but with thousands of games for kids—little for the grown-ups—and none for my purpose.I won't advocate that you violate the Amazon terms of service, but I was able to get the Yamaha AV Controller android app installed after some research and effort. I don't suggest you try this unless you're comfortable with android system alterations, but it is possible to put Google Play Services on the pad with the full play store app catalog. We'll see how long it works until future Fire updates break it.Bottom LinePros:—Price—3rd party mounting optionsCons:—Shovelware!!—Lack of full device support in ""show mode""—Ugly native Alexa app—Sub-par media connectivity—Limited to Amazon-sanctioned music services—App store lacking apps for grown-ups—Limited config/UI optionsSomeday Amazon will evolve their Echo hardware with added 5.1 abilities and I'll likely toss my receiver in favor of a native 5.1 Echo solution. Running two independent sound systems, with two independent speaker sets isn't a great experience, but clearly Amazon is working towards a better home media environment.  They will need to have support non-amazon music/media services, especially local playback services like PLEX as any ""owned"" media is currently blocked in their ecosystem, like many others, I'm not happy paying monthly service fees to rent the media I already own and Amazon has stopped allowing user uploads to their music services—only Amazon-purchased music is available. Nope, not a usable solution!Even with all the limitations, I believe it's a tortured but acceptable solution for a centralized dashboard if you're willing to do what it takes to get it to look and function properly.Good luck!"
"Okay, let me start by saying that I am currently on my second fire tablet.  The first was a gift from my last job and was an Amazon Fire 7 2017 edition.  It was, as one would expect from a cheap tablet, very slow and low quality.  However, it was still a great tablet for the price.  I believe that they were running somewhere around $50-$75 at the time I received it and regardless of the quality, it worked far better than any smartphone I had seen around the same price.  I was able to expand memory and I used it for personal and professional services for almost 4 years.  So it definitely served its purpose.  Last year my wife was tired of me always complaining about how slow it had gotten and how limited it was on being able to keep up with newer apps.  So she bought me an Amazon Fire HD 8 2021 for Christmas in the hopes that it would fix the issues I was having with my 2017 model.  That brings me to the real point of this review.  Having used this tablet for almost a year now I can say again that this is an excellent tablet for the price.  I only have a few complaints that I was hoping Amazon had fixed since the 2017 model.1) The screen is just not bright enough.  It's fine when you are inside in a low light area but when you walk outside, especially on a sunny day, you can't see anything on the screen.  That's with the brightness level at max and adaptive brightness turned off. (Wanted to clarify for those of you who might think I don't know what I'm doing)2) The screen lags when switching between apps and when loading apps.  This was a major problem with the 2017 Fire 7 but I had hoped that, with all of Amazon's internal hardware and software upgrades that it would be faster but it's about the same still.  It's just definitely not made for multi-tasking or gaming really.  You can multi-task but it's difficult due to the lag.  However, it's a great option for those of you who just want to binge watch your favorite movies and shows on streaming apps and/or use it for ebooks, music, or shopping.3)  The battery life is about the same as my 2017 which was also very disappointing.  On a full charge I can usually get about 4-5 hours of solid use before it's almost dead (that was brand new), about 8-10 hours of intermittent use, and if left on but inactive (on standby) you can get up to 3 days on a full charge before it dies.  However I will also say that those numbers have not decreased much, if any, over the past 8 months of use.  So at least the battery life seems to be fairly consistent.4) While the tablet is very ""user friendly"", it's not very good for those of you who like to poke around the more technical side of things.  You basically have to download a bunch of secondary apps to read or change deeper settings than what you see on the basic menu.*IMPORTANT NOTICE*You should never change or alter the programming of any device.  Doing this can damage your device, void manufacturer warranties, and may even be illegal in some cases.  So make sure you know what the manufacturer as well as your local and federal law allows before you do anything that can alter or potentially harm your device.  All repairs, alterations, and any other changes should always be handled by the manufacturer or other industry professionals who are trained to work on your specific device.To sum it all up, remember that this is a cheap tablet so don't expect your Fire to keep up with the latest iPad because it can't.  That being said, it really is a good tablet overall. Especially when you consider that the closest thing to it from another company would cost you at least twice as much.  So for the very last time I'll say, it's an excellent tablet for the price!  Thank you"
"Update-I have had the tablet for about 4 months and starting to have issues. After some use the tablet becomes almost totally non responsive.  Rebooting solves the problem. Strange that it would develop this issue on its own.  Just reminds me that while this is a decent tablet, it is frequently on sale for less than $75 and you shouldn't expect much out of it.I've had 2 Fire 7's in the past.  Both were so slow they were unusable even for the most basic task.  I have an iPad that I really like but wanted a cheap tablet that I would not care much if it got lost or damaged  to take to appointments, travel, etc. All I wanted to use it for is to read books from places other than Amazon, read news, play music, etc.  This tablet has usable speed and slightly better screen quality and serves my need.  At the sale price I am not concerned if I lose or damage it.  During the short period of time that I have had the device, battery life has been exceptional, especially compared to the Fire 7 that I had previously.During the setup you will be pushed to buy additional services through free trials.  Just remember to cancel if you accept any of the trials. The build quality is quite good. The placement of the power switch right next to volume is terrible. Be sure to go through your privacy settings after setup to turn off access to microphone, contacts, location, etc that don't really need it.  You can also opt out of personalized ads which limits the ability to track you a little. Turning off notifications will help with the battery life and may help with device responsiveness.The Amazon customization makes the tablet screens look very busy, but do give easy access to anything you want from Amazon.  You can pay extra to limit ads, but that only turnoff the ad when the device boots up, does to eliminate or customize the ads you see elsewhere. You have to remember that Amazon sells tablets at this price to get you to but other Amazon products. Disappointing that the O/S is based on a old version of Android that has security issues.  Not sure if Amazon has done anything remediate this, but I don't keep any important data on the device. You can encrypt the device but I can find nothing that talks to the level of encryption and the device specs are so low that it can't really support the power needs to decrypt any data.You can get 32 or 64 GB of storage.  Since it supports micro usb, go with the smaller.  This is still enough to support the O/S and apps that do not operate from the SD card.  The O/S on my old Fire 7 grew quickly with upgrades.  It appeared that some of the updates were just adding data.  I had to reset to original specs a couple of times so there was any space left.  Hope this will not do that, but if it does the 32 GB will allow me to postpone that as much as possible.Sound level is quite good even if the quality is average at best.  The speakers are both on the ""top"" which makes it great if you are watching a video.The device only has 2 GB of ram, which is a huge improvement of the 1 GB on the 7. Unlike with an iPad that knows to put unused apps to sleep, this device keeps them open and using RAM.  You must close apps when not using to keep performance at a decent level.The tablet does not have GPS like more expensive tablet but depends on ""WIFI tracking"" for location.  This will be ok in town, but of little use where there are few other WIFI points.The camera is barely OK. It works to take a pic to remember something, but not anything you would ever want to view on a larger screen or print out. It low light it’s basically worthless.It is possible to install the Google store and have access to the apps that are not available on the Amazon store. It is not a very complicated process but you do need to follow the instructions exactly.With all of its faults, based on what you are paying (especially if you get it on sale) Amazon finally has a Tablet that is usable.  It get 4 stars based on what it delivers for the price, not compared to more expensive tablets that deliver a lot more. The 90 day warranty is pretty bad. While if there is a problem if usually shows up immediately, that is not always the case."
"There's a few things to be said about this tablet. It's a budget tablet for people who don't know much about smart devices, and it works well for each and every one of them. So it's got more than a few flaws to them.Sticking to their guts, the Fire HD 8 10th Gen (2020) still uses a 1280*800 screen, breaking the minimum definition of HD (being 720p). Why it isn't a 1080p in this decade, I will never understand, but you get what you pay for, and this detail doesn't really bother me. This isn't very futuristic either, the bezels are thick and massive, making the screen-to-body ratio only about 70%. Same 2 MP front facing camera, but selfie camera has been improved to matchBroad improvements across the board. Internally it has a better processor, more RAM, updates to wifi and bluetooth, has a better battery inside, and features their fire OS 7, which is a fork of Android 9 (Pie). Externally there's not much to say. It has a better selfie cam, still holds the 3.5mm audio jack, features USB-C to charge the device, also allowing for some USB-C Peripherals to be used with it. Honestly USB-C is the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars, my problems lie ahead, and would have otherwise given this 2 stars because of the low price, and 1 star altogether if it were 10 or 20 more.There's some really large gripes I have with their changes. They placed the front facing camera along the side. While you can use it in landscape to video chat/conference, the placement creates its own issue. Presuming the buttons and i/o are on the ""top"", the selfie camera runs on left, along with the front facing camera being on the top of the same side. This is unusual, and I'll get to why it's a problem in a bit. But first, being left handed myself, I'm holding the device typically in my dominant hand realizing I'm covering the camera, and finding myself to need to rotate the device in order to use it. Selfies become a bit obscure here, but I'll stick to using my cell phone for pictures. Seriously though, they design this so you can do half the things in portrait, and the other half in landscape.Case manufacturers haven't caught on quickly enough, and when looking for a case with a cover, they all have it fold on the left. Much like a book like you'd expect. And the cases fold in a way where you can stand the case up landscape style along the left side, right where the speakers, and both cameras are. This is where Amazon's ingenuity comes into play, because at the time of this review, Amazon's case is the only one where you have the cover fold like a book, and when you stand it, it's on the right side, allowing the camera to be on the top of the screen, and trust me, you do not want to video call with the camera at the bottom.I updated my tablet from the larger 2017 model of the Fire HD 10. While smaller, cheaper, and less pixels, I was hoping at the very least to have some of the same features. The one in particular was exFAT support for external storage. For a device that allows a 1TB MicroSD card to input, the device does not support exFAT. This was featured on the Fire HD 10, but unavailable for some unknown reason for this device. This may be because they wanted to have their own proprietary SD storage firmware used with their devices, breaking away (again) from typical android standard programming. Honestly this alone is why I'm giving it such a low score. It'd be a near value match to the other fire devices, but this feels like a downgrade with this one change. And they're doing it because they don't want to pay the license for exFAT from Microsoft, just like they don't want to pay Google to use their Android infrastructure (including their play store)Well that's amazon in a nutshell, wanting to engineer their own proprietary designs so you buy more amazon."
"Original is better. Better screen, better icon layout, no forcing ads on me. This newer Fire is not as good."
"This is my third Kindle Fire -- well, really my fourth if you count the first Fire 8 that they had to replace because it could not stay online or even find a signal. Like many people, we have multiple wireless devices in our home. This is the only one that has difficulty finding the signal. I have an app on my phone that shows the strength of a wireless signal. Even when it shows an excellent signal, this Fire has difficulty finding that signal anywhere, home or on the road. Amazon promotes the Fire as perfect for portable entertainment. This ascertain has proven false for my Fire. The latency issue  is very real and very frustrating. Asked to open a book, the device stalls before moving exceptionally slow. Playing a game, even a simple game such as solitaire is frustratingly slow because the device cannot execute commands at anything other than a snails pace. Videos are out of the question due to the lack of speed and power.For those sure to criticize this review because they think I do not understand that this is not meant to replace a real tablet such as an iPad or similar tablet, let be debase you of that theory. I am VERY aware this is not that type device. When needed, I carry a tablet. This device is meant to deliver Amazon content and similar programs, something it does very poorly. As stated above, this is my third Fire. I do know what they are capable of doing and what they are not designed for. My previous Fires delivered on the promise of providing access to books and other entertainment. This device does NOT deliver on that promise. I would strongly recommend finding another device to purchase if you want value for your money.Shortly after submitting my initial review, someone from Amazon contacted me suggesting I contact tech support one more time. Due to my work schedule and other factors, I was unable to do so until today. The short result: I have cancelled both my Prime membership and my Kindle Unlimited subscriptions. Further, I seriously doubt if we will be ordering anything from Amazon in the future.I was on chat for almost two hours, during which time I was switched from one representative to another three times. Why? I have no idea except that the representatives apparently have a time limit for dealing with customer complaints. Each new rep requested the exact same information I had shared with the previous rep - a waste of my time and a waste of theirs. Each rep offered the same steps toward resolution, the same steps we have tried multiple times. Famous saying: doing the same thing in the same way and expecting different results is insanity. Dealing with Amazon is apparently also insanity.The Kindle will not permit the downloading of books, apps or games. It is painfully slow in executing any command and in playing any but the most simple games.  It continues to lose connectivity regardless of location or wifi type. According to more than one rep, the problem is not the device, but our wifi. This is interesting...like most households, we have multiple wireless enabled devices, including computers, phones and other tablets. None exhibit these issues. In addition, I travel for my work and often have to use public and other private wifi. The Fire exhibits exactly the same issues regardless of which wifi is accessed.To resolve these ongoing, constant concerns, Amazon's solution was to inform us that the warranty on the Kindle Fire has expired. Please note: this is the third replacement Kindle Amazon sent when the other exhibited similar issues. A rep offered to replace the unit despite it being out of warranty IF we are willing to accept a refurbished unit. This is outrageous and unacceptable. We paid for a NEW Kindle, not a refurbished one. The others failed within weeks of receipt. This one somehow managed to work for a period of less than two months before failing. Therefore we paid for new and now have a device that is essentially useless for our purpose. Stating that the warranty has expired is patently ridiculous. How can a warranty expire when a device fails within a short period of being replaced because the first ones didn't work? If anything the warranty should be extended and applied to the replacement with a NEW (not refurbished) Kindle Fire. That device should come with the same warranty that would apply to one bought now and shipped in operating order.The ultimate issue is not the device, but the manner in which Amazon chooses to attempt resolution of customer complaints. I have been an Amazon customer for years, almost as long as the company has been in business. In the past, any serious or even minor complaints have been addressed in a polite, customer centric manner. No longer. Perhaps some of the critics are correct in suggesting the company has grown too large and too powerful. Based on my recent interactions, I surmise the company does not give a damn about their customers. Our leaving and canceling Prime will have zero impact on the company, thus they do not have to care about our business. Lesson learned. Time to find another business to support."
"The Fire HD 8 10th Generation (Model KFONWI) should be a much better tablet, but it's not even worth the cost when on sale for half price.For a tablet design from 2020, it's incredibly slow and glitchy. Apps are slow to install and update, they often crash and close, and when switching between apps the OS will have moved the previous app from RAM into storage and has to drag it back to RAM making for a clunky experience. It comes down to (obviously) 3 things: processor, RAM, and storage.The processor Amazon has chosen for this tablet is the MediaTek MT8168. Although released in May of 2020 (especially for Amazon Fire tablet), it only uses (4) ARM Cortex-A53 4 Cores from 2012. And while the Cortex-A53 is a solid codeable ARM core at this point, it has NO PULLING POWER with most modern apps. MediaTek could have/would have been extremely happy to offered Amazon an ARM ""big.LITTLE"" SoC design with a single ARM Cortex-A73 and three Cortex-A53 Cores for pennies more! The configuration would have allowed some heaver hitting when needed with little additional power consumption over all.The processors other shortcoming is the integration of a single (1x) ARM Mali-G52 GPU. Once again, the ARM Mali-G52 is an extremely stable GPU. A dual core (2x) or quad core (4x) would provide more stable gaming/videos/app changes/tab change when using the tablet, but more GPU cores would also add more stress to system RAM and we can't have that!Here's a thought. Since ""big.LITTLE"" is outdated too, on the next gen Fire tablets switch to the UNISOC Tiger T310 processor that supports the newer DynamIQ flexibility and scalability. It stable technology from 2017 with the T310 launching in 2019. This SoC has an up-to-date single (1x) Cortex-A75 and three (3x) Cortex-A55 cores, Imagination Technologies PowerVR GE8300 (from 2014, stable and excellent for gaming). and also sports a built-in 4G LTE modem (FDD bands B1/B3/B7/B8/B20, so Europe only). Or have MediaTek make something similar.Okay, let's' talk RAM. I understand that Fire OS 7 is built on as stable a copy of Android 9 Pie as possible. But 2GB of RAM is NOT enough to satisfy the ""tweaked"" OS, a number of open apps, graphics/video streaming needs, and multiple browser tabs, even when this tablet launched in 2020. It causes apps to close/freeze/crash, slow app launch times as the OS finds a need to ""move"" a currently unused app to virtual memory in the ridiculously slow storage, and the system itself to become unstable at times! The OS appears, on a clean install, is eating up more than 1GB of RAM on every new startup.4GB of RAM is the ""sweet spot"". While even 3GB of RAM would be a tremendous step in the right direction, 4GB would make the Fire OS far happier and give even the largest of apps room to play. Even with the current lack luster SoC the change in performance would be phenomenal!Last we come storage. I'm not here to complain about the amount/size, as the tablet does offer a micro SD card slot for expansion. But there ARE two problems.First, the read/write speeds of the eMMC being used are horrible. While the read speeds are a solid 480Mb/s, the write speeds are down to only 75Mb/s! Some micro SD cards are better suited, and that's sad. And with the OS having to extend the 2GB of RAM in to the eMMC to run a small number of apps, that read/write speed is highly compromised.Second, being able to move more apps to a higher quality micro SD card could easily fix a number of problems. The read/write speeds and ""A"" application rating could be determined during the format of the card upon installation. Running more apps from a qualified micro SD, especially with additional RAM, would make for a happier tablet.Until these corrections are made, please AVOID the Fire HD 8 10th Generation (Model KFONWI)."
"This review comes with a caveat which will be explained. I already had a Fire 8 which I purchased in 2017 that has served me well. But when I saw the new 8 Plus was coming out and the improvements they were making I decided to really splurge for a change. I order the 64 HD 8 Plus with ""no offers"" so the splurgy price was 154 dollars. I had a friend who ordered the lower priced 32 gig with offers at the same time. I began to wonder if there was a problem with the 64 gig because he's came almost as soon as they were available for shipping where I had to wait almost a month more for mine. When it finally arrived I powered it up with the option to restore all the apps that were backed up in the cloud from my previous Fire 8. During the restore process I received a pop up that the restore had failed. When the set up was finally completed....I could see that the apps that I wanted were all available for down load they were just not downloaded in the set up. So I clicked download all. When all the apps were in place I started opening some. I opened that Amazon App for youtube and the main page opened painfully slow and when I did select a video it would try to load and wouldn't play. I have excellent high speed internet so I knew that wasn't the problem. Every app I opened experienced slow loading. My email apps would time out and I would have to try again. I placed a call to Customer Service support. I was asked to restart the device which I did. After the restart I experienced the same problem. Almost without hesitation the technician said to send the device back and they would send another one. So I sent it back and about 5 days later I received another Fire 8 plus 64 gig. This time I called customer service before activating the device because I wanted to see if the restore would work while I had a tech on the phone. The device loaded properly and restored all the apps from the cloud. Again I went to open the apps starting with youtube and it was slow loading and the vids wouldn't play. The tech asked permission to do a shared session so she could trouble shoot the device. I told her I had to believe there was something wrong with the 64 Gig device. I was on the phone for over an hour with her and still the device did not function properly. So she said the only thing we can do is do a factory restore. Initially I was against this because I had already spent so much time on the phone to no avail. But I relented, so I hit factory reset and then with the tech on the other end of the line we started the whole set up over again including the downloading of the apps from the cloud. This took considerable time. So once again I started with the youtube app but this time the page loaded immediately and the videos played properly. With her on the phone I went through several other apps and these worked fast and the way they should. The tech had no explanation as to what might have been wrong or if the solution was a lasting one. Before we signed off, I mentioned that I had paid the highest price for this HD 8 Plus but that the replacement had come in a different box. So I asked if Amazon had sent me a refurbished HD8 or a brand new one. She told me it was refurbished. I said that I didn't think that was quite fair as I had paid for a new device not a refurbished one. She said they carried the same warranty. So now I have a refurbished expensive device that seems to be working the way it should have been from the start. I have a few more weeks to decide to keep it or return it. For now it works very very well.  The streaming quality is good although the sound when turned up the highest without head phones could be louder. Pages load fast as I would expect with 3 gigs of ram. I have not yet added an SD card. And I'm still not crazy about getting a refurbished replacement but at least the warranty is the same. If it continues to work properly then I will probably keep it, but if you are ordering the 64 gig version I would be wary. My friend who has the 32 gig version never had a single problem. Good luck."
"I've had my 2017 model for several years now and liked it. So I decided to upgrade when I saw that there were deals on the 2020 version. I'm not so sure it was worth it. I currently own both of them and have had ample opportunity to compare them side by side. After several days of frustration have decided to vent my opinion in my review.The new one has more memory to load apps and has a slightly faster processor so things run a little smoother. Those are good things, but there are many design changes which are not so nice.The old one has the camera on the portrait side making it a little narrower and easier to handle, almost like holding a large phone, which is very nice for reading online books. The new one has the camera on the landscape side so the tablet is wider and unwieldy. You can't really figure out how to grip it and are almost forced to use a stand.The screens have the same pixels but the 2020 version is darker and won't get as bright as the old one.The 2017 sound quality was never great but the 2020 sound is even worse. It won't get as loud and sounds muffled, not nearly as crisp as the old one sounded.However the most annoying thing to me are the power and volume buttons. On the 2017 model they projected out a nice distance so they were easy to feel, were silver colored so they were easy to see, and were spaced far apart so they were easy to find and not confuse between volume and power. On the 2020 version these buttons are reduced in height so you can't feel them, are now colored black so you can't see them, and are shoved closer together so you are not sure if you are on volume or power. You actually have to turn the tablet edge toward you to look at it so you can see which button you are pushing. This was clearly a design change for style with very little thought for functionality. To make it even worse the volume buttons have been programmed to switch position depending on the orientation of the tablet. If you are in landscape mode the top right button will be volume up. But if you turn the tablet to portrait mode the very same button becomes volume down! How silly is that? You never really know which way you are turning the volume until you see the volume tray pop up on the screen!If this is your first tablet then this is not a bad one for the money. But if you are contemplating an upgrade move I would say that the annoyances outweigh the benefits. If Old Faithful is working fine I would say to forget about switching and just keep it."
"I really liked my Fire 7 so had no hesitation in buying this one but I won't buy another one. Games downloaded OK, and browser has a decent speed. Kindle was tricky to learn; when Amazon changes things with versions they are not very helpful with explaining differences. My biggest problem came with using Bluetooth and the pre-installed maps program. The maps program is useless. If you click on it, a world map focused on Africa comes up; customer service could not tell me how to navigate in it and I found no on-device instructions. If the user clicks on a link that says ""view in Google maps"" in the browser, the link instead goes to the stupid program but NOT to the location in the link. The CSR with whom I spoke could not help. I had to independently enter the location into the Google maps app.I tried connecting Bluetooth to both my car and my laptop without success. I wanted to listen to audiobooks in the car but the audio would not come through the car speakers and volume was not loud enough on the tablet alone. I had to put on headphones connected with a cable because Bluetooth also did not work with them and then angle the headphones to have one ear free to the environment. I tried again with my computer and also could not get it to work through the computer or even stay connected. After 30 minutes on chat with a CSR, she asked if my computer had a built-in microphone. When I said it does (like all computers I have had for years), she said the tablet will not connect with a device with a built-in microphone. How inappropriate both for the function and for not asking me that question immediately upon chat instead of wasting time. If you plan to use Bluetooth, get something else."
Honestly not a fan of the fire tablet. It has so many ads that I hate my kids clicking on. It’s very slow to respond to touch compared to an apple ipad. Doesn’t connect to the hotspot on my phone very well. We ended up buying a 2018 iPad version and like it way more.
"Yes, I am an Apple person but I also own a Windows gaming laptop so I'm not really hooked on the Apple ecosystem. I was looking to upgrade my 1st Gen 16GB iPad Air (2013?) to a faster processor and smaller size tablet so its fits into my hand better without paying the ""Apple Premium"" with the newest iPad Mini.I had Android tablets and phones in the past but ended with Apple stuff because they seemed to just work better. The Android ecosystem is too fragmented. I do own some Ring and other Amazon products that use Alexa. The one thing Apple is behind on is the connected home IMO.When the Kindle Fire 8 HD dropped in price and after reviewing all the specs it seemed like it would be a pretty decent replacement for my 1st Gen iPad Air. And no this is not a comparison between the Fire 8 HD and iPad mini but simply my impression of the Fire.Setup: pretty straight forward, connect to home wifi and just need an Amazon account.Kindle Launch Screen: a bit confusing at first as I was used to stock Android launch screen but it has been awhile.Screen: Had the brightness turned all the way up but still looked kind of dull. The icons wasn't pixellated but didn't look sharp either when I compared with my iPad Air. (I believe the ipad has almost twice as many pixels). However, when I ran Netflix the picture was great.Speakers/Sound: The dual speakers definitely made a huge difference when watching movies and playing games. Clear and sharp.Processor/Apps/Speed: There seemed to be a slight lag sometimes and even when swiping between screens. I was hoping with Quad Core it would be a bit smoother. As I mentioned, with videos it seemed to play fine and screen was actually quite good for watching and there didn't seem to be any lag. The only game I played was Marvel Strike Force and some of the animation didn't seem as smooth but I don't know if its the game or the tablet itself. On the iPhone XR the game runs pretty smooth. Even when swiping in the game it seemed laggy.Overall: Given the price point, it is a decent tablet for casual use if you understand its limitations like for web browsing, watching videos, gaming? Laptop replacement - no, it's an 8 inch screen anyway. It's a great tablet for a young child.Amazon needs to work on the UI (launcher) for the Kindle Fire."
Partially satisfied.  Scratches were visible
"Bought as a replacement for my other one. I dislike the fact it's the same tablet but it has poor quality. My other one worked much better until it was dropped in the tub.Which doesn't make sense, the following apps are not available, Pandora  or silk browser, it's the same tablet. My other one had these apps available and better camera quality."
"The Fire HD 8 is (was) my third Fire tablet. I returned it today, primarily because of software issues. IMHO I think Amazon released the latest generation of Fire tablets too soon. The more I used the new Fire HD 8, the more I felt like I was using beta software.First the good stuff: the new CPU and 10th gen hardware really speeds things up. The power up is many, many times faster than my older Fire HD 7 (4th gen). Same with power down but not quite so noticeable. The faster processor is a boon everywhere. The battery life is OUTSTANDING! When I’m reading a lot, I need to recharge the HD7 about every other day. I used the HD8 a week or more before recharging.Now the bad stuff, starting with a few nits: (1) The AC/DC power adapter is a bit under powered @ 5W. It gets really hot when recharging the HD8’s battery. The adapter should be at least 10W. I switched to a 15W adapter and had no problems with heat. (2) There is no “Low Battery” alert. The HD7 gives a notification when the battery level reaches 20%. (3) There is an annoying beep when the HD8 is powered up. (This seems to have the same function as the POST (Power On Self Test) beep found on PCs. Anyway, the beep can't be turned off nor can the volume be changed. (The dog goes crazy!)Nits (2) and (3) might be resolved in the software. More obvious software issues can be seen in the accompanying pix. BTW the photos were taken with the HD7 and HD8 side-by-side, with both devices connected to Wi-Fi. (4) The HD8’s notification icons are just plain white squares and/or circles. The HD7 has graphical icons that we’re all familiar with. (5) Along the same thread, notice that the shipping icons shown on the HD7 are completely absent from the HD8. Since Amazon sends notifications to all devices associated with a user’s account, there is definitely something missing in the HD8’s software.And now THE reason for me returning the HD8: (6) The standard keyboard options are NOT available in the Kindle Reader app. This specifically shows up when writing notes. (I called the Fire tablet technical support group, and this deficiency in the Kindle Reader app was confirmed.) Not having the ""Next Word Prediction(HD7)/Suggestions(HD8)"" is a deal breaker for me because I write a lot of notes when reading an ebook. Without these options the number of keystrokes while writing notes increases by a factor of 5-to-10 times. That starts to get very tedious! And I’m reading a lot of ebooks now…Finally, whether it’s a hardware issue or a software issue, the display “auto dimming” feature does NOT work! I tried this out one night while reading in bed. Several minutes after enabling this feature, I started noticing changes in the display’s brightness. At one point I had the Settings window open, and with no physical contact with the HD8, I saw the brightness slider moving back and forth! Absolutely crazy!!I do hope Amazon gets the kinks worked out because the increased performance in the 10th gen Fire tablet makes it quite appealing."
"Like the size, weight and high quality clarity of the screen,But It's difficult to read because the pages flip forward or back because the frame is so close to the touch screen and the page changes with the slightest touch of the page frame"
"Review for the 10th generation amazon fire tablet By Micah HebertWith the 10th generation of the fire comes many new features, disadvantages, and material to discuss, now first I would like to talk about the lockscreen. I do love how you can choose between a password or a pin or nothing at all however if you chose the pin option unfortunately whereas most smartphones that I have seen have you put in the code then verify, the tablet on the other hand just requiring the correct number of digits to verify therefore making the whole combination far easier to guess. For example if I set my passcode to my birthday and my sister wanted to see my tablet she would be able to easily see that the passcode was only 4 numbers and then just that alone would narrow down the list of likely combinations down immensely. But the worst thing by far is that you cannot choose a lockscreen as you could on a normal device. Instead the tablet just shows you an  advertisement. I find this appalling and I think that amazon should change this right away Now onto the homescreen. The thing about this is that unlike the lock screen you can actually change the background. My favorite method for this is to search a cool picture on the internet, screenshot it and then use that as my background and I love how you also use something from your own photo roll as well as one of the preset ones. Although there are many stupid apps that you cannot uninstall My solution to this is to Simply put them all in one folder  end call it junk. Speaking of Problems with the apps I want to play with the app store right is that you Can not get certain apps. This has proved to be very annoying as when I went to get the Lego instructions out for a set I was building I don't find it on the App Store and this was very annoying as I had to use my Dad's iPad And then when I see an advertisement for an app I want to install The link is always in the Chrome App Store and often times I cannot get it on the Amazon app store the same goes for QR codes such as the Human Bean or Dutch bros one on the cup. I go to both these places quite a lot and I figured I might as well get the app since I use them so much, however when I tried to scan QR codes of course it redirected to the Chrome web store and it of course was not available on the Amazon one But other than that it's pretty smooth sailing.  my favorite by far is the camera one because well it does not have a video modes like slow motion or time lapse I love it because when you want to print your photos whereas with most devices you have to go to through the complex system with all of the cords trying to connect them with the computer and downloading files which I want no part in, with the fire you can print them directly off the app and have them shipped to you With ridiculously cheap price. Overall the fire is a great tablet for children and adults as long as they don’t need to do much on it, especially for the cheap price, however if you are looking into this for more serious purposes such as work or real pleasure I would not recommend getting this. As for a brand, my personal suggestion would be google products as I have had much better experiences with their products."
"Okay, let's get it over with, which is probably what the designers of this product thought when they were designing it.What's good: The price. It's a good price when it's on sale. It's an okay price when it's not. The battery life is also good. Can't knock it when it lasts a whole day. It's light enough to comfortably hold, even with one hand. I haven't found it to be slow for web browsing or streaming videos.What's not good: Oh boy. You should already know what you're getting into when you buy this product. It's an amazon device, for amazon content. And hey I love my Kindle subscription so they got me there. But that's not the issue. Even if you paid for a no adds version, be aware that does not get rid of adds while you're using the tablet in the various amazon apps you're in. I don't mind having to look at videos and books I have no intention of purchasing in the prime video and kindle apps, but let's be honest, it's dishonest to sell something as ""add-free"" when users are being forced to look product placements under the guise of ""recommendations.""The screen quality is meh. 189ppi? This is worse than most released by Amazon six years ago. Even the tiny Fire HD 6 from 2015 had a much higher denser pixel screen at 252. While technically HD, this screen is a struggle bus. If you hold this thing a foot away from your face as you're trying to read your fave comics before bed, you'll see a lot of blurriness. I'm not sure if it's solely due to the density of the quality of the glass, but it's a mess. I got a head ache trying to browse through amazon's shopping app and seeing blurry images. Screen quality is a weird area to cut corners on a device designed for consumption. Guys, it's not 2011. This screen quality belongs to the early days of the 2010s along with UGGs and Windows phones.This device is snappy enough for media consumption and web browsing. I can't say I play games on it, but I didn't have a problem switching from streaming services nor did I have an issue listening to Spotify in the background while reading. However, when it works it works. When it doesn't, it really doesn't... Is this thing supposed to randomly shut off while I'm trying to watch something? Once is a coincidence. Twice is bad luck. Three times is a pattern...If the Fire HD 10 weren't so heavy to hold comfortably, I would recommend that wholeheartedly. At least that has a decent enough screen. All in all, it's meh."
"The Kindel tablet is a must have if you are ordering from Amazon, the app included in the Kindel tablethelps you with your orders from Amazon of course, creation of the tablet was a smart decision on Amazon'spart, it increased sales.I like to make things like Fedora hats, leather belts and holsters and the Kindel is easy to use for orderingtools for leather work and belt buckles. Being a Prime member I use to get my orders in 2 days time, abenifit of being a prime member, however recently my orders are taking a week or more to be delivered,so now I wonder if it pays to pay for prime membership, I don't watch shows on Prime very much if at all,so whay am I paying for prime membership???While serfing the web if I see a photo of a a hat or something made of leather that is interesting, Idownload the photo so I can use it as a reference, I have tried to save the photos to the micro sd cardso I can removed the card and print out a copy on my computer, the problem is, you can't do that with aKindel, the images are on the kindel not the sd card, and if you purchase a book from Amazon throughthe good reads app, you can't save it to the sd card either. The kindel is a sales tool, with Amazon rulesand restrictions. Plus you don't get to buy one and that is it, we had to upgrade our Kindels because theAmazon app stopped working after 6 years. Think about that before you buy or is that rent a Kindel?"
"This thing is completely useless. Its almost as bad (possibly worse) than an i-pad.My intended use for this tablet was to give to my daughter to use for taking photos, surfing the internet, watching youtube videos, playing games on, etc. in other words, just something for her to play around with. I didnt want to spend a large amount of money on a top-of-the-line tablet. But maybe I should have, this thing was a complete waste of 65 bucks.1. every time I restart it, or every 15 minutes or so of using it, it comes up with a window asking me to ""connect to Alexa"".... I dont use an Alexa. I skip past it, and roughly 15 minutes later (the exact timing seems somewhat random, but I would guess thats an average interval), it interrupts whatever I am doing and asks me again. really annoying.2. You cant uninstall (or even disable) all, or any, of the pre-loaded ads and crap that Amazon loads on there for you. You cant even delete the icons from the home screen (for that matter you cant even customize the main screen, aside from re-arranging the icons, see below) so the home screen is completely filled with a bunch of apps that she nor I will ever use.3. you cant load new apps on it (I presume if the app is from Amazon you might be able to, but anywhere else, forget about it. (now that's an ""Apple"" move in every definition of it, and one of the biggest reasons why I am not an Apple fan!)4. See above, I mentioned you cannot customize the home screen. I literally mean, you CANT customize it at all, except for re-arranging the positions of the icons. You cant change the background image. nope, no option in the settings anywhere to do that. You cant remove icons that you dont use from it. You cant add icons to it (well since you cant install any new apps, I guess they figure you wont need that feature.) you cant remove or turn off the ""news"" feeds (weather, headlines, 'recommended' BS, etc. (which constantly use data by the way as they are constantly downloading their updates).5. The volume will randomly turn up whenever it wants to play some sound. When I turn the volume all of the way down (because its 1am and I dont want to disturb anyone sleeping), and im going along and then suddenly when it tries to show a video, or I get a notification or something, instead of operating in silence, the volume is suddenly turned up to 70% and making noise it goes. I frantically turn it back down, look around sheepishly making sure that didnt disturb anyone, and then carry on. But then next time it wants to play something, that volume goes back up with no input from me. whats the point of having a volume control, if its just going to adjust itself anyway.Im hoping if you are reading this, that you will find it useful and hopefully, wont make the same mistake I did. Im going to go buy a Samsung device (galaxy tab or similar), yes they are twice the cost. but at least they actually work. and let you install your own apps, customize them to get them working the way you want. etc. and I hope you will do the same, but hopefully, skipping the step of wasting cash on a ""fire"" tablet trying to save a few bucks first. Thanks for reading."
"Full disclosure: this is not my first Fire Tablet. But it does have the same frustrating issues that the others had.I am normally an iPad/iPhone user. I usually keep a Fire Tablet at work for occasional use (reading on my lunch break mostly), but the experience is so frustrating I find myself preferring to read on my phone more often. So what are these issues?First, this device is so laggy. Oftentimes there is a noticeable delay between touching the screen and the device registering the touch. I guess it's not a huge deal but its really irritating when all you're trying to do is open a Kindle book or turn a page.Second, Fire OS is very prone to stuttering and dropping frames. The overall experience is pretty janky and reminds me of Android Marshmallow on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Amazon is trying to do too much with Fire OS; no one asked for all of the extra apps they slap on these devices. Email? Documents? Goodreads> Alexa? Why not ship these out vanilla and allow me to download them if I want? I just want an e-reader that also plays movies occasionally. Why do I need a News app? or iMDB TV? Why is there a Maps app? There's too much going on and the processors they use in these devices are not able to keep up with the demands the software places on them (in addition to being very un-secure, so DO NOT USE A FIRE TABLET FOR PERSONAL/WORK EMAIL).If you're looking for a cheap media consumption device, these are fine but janky and overstuffed with apps you can't delete. Go for it if you like, but know what you're getting."
"I enjoyed using this until two features were added:1.  A bogus ""moisture detection"" feature that disable the USB port unless you turn the tablet off for recharging, meaning that I can no longer add any books, documents, etc. that are not downloaded from Amazon, and2. The elimination of the ""My Library"" tab in favor of a ""For You"" tab that forces me to search through a bunch of ads to find my books, and only the eight most recent books, at that.  The screen is almost 3/4 ads.I won't buy a new Fire and don't recommend anyone else buy it either, unless you are solely interested in reading Kindle books acquired from Amazon.  It's too bad, because the physical features of the Fire are good for the price.  Amazon just went overboard in sacrificing most of the useful software features to chase profit."
"I wanted to love it. I got it to share with my toddler. I read on it and we’ve got a few games and apps for her. Great for my purposes but it’s not compatible with a LOT of apps we use for her so we end up using the internet browser and going to the full site (YouTube). I tried some of the suggested game apps for her but she nor I can figure most of them out, or there’s internal purchases to actually play. It’s alright, it gets the job done. It does have Disney plus which is good.What makes me knock off some stars is that when it locks and displays an ad, half the time I cannot… CAN NOT get the darn thing to open back up. Everything just makes me click the ad or “rate my ad experience” but I can’t just open the stupid tablet. I end up having to restart it. It’s so so frustrating.It’s not bad if you’re just reading or browsing the internet but beyond that it’s really not very user friendly. Maybe the kids one is better for her stuff, I just really didn’t want to buy two. So for me it’s just “eh.” Would I buy it again? No. But I got it for $35 on a sale so I’m not mad.I guess you get what you pay for comes into play, too."
"FYI.  These units are not worth the money. Bought one and only used it twice tried to use it a third time and it won’t work. Called customer service and they told me out of warranty.Really lost my faith in Amazon.  It should of worked I know it was past the 90 days but I bought it as a gift and they weren’t given it till Christmas.  It worked one time. Then took a crapola.  Really doesn’t say much for your branded products and reliability.  Was basically told I now own a paper weight.Thanks Amazon. If I new I was gonna get screwed like that would just assumed given my money to charity.Sincerely your disgruntled customer.Steve piotrski.Sent from my iPhoneOn Jan 7, 2022, at 10:12 AM, Amazon.com  wrote:﻿Amazon.comHello Steve piotrski,Looking for something in Amazon Devices Store?

"Likes: - Price: It is a good price compared to similar tablets. - Support for microSD card: It supports up to 1TB. This is great.Dislikes: - Position of the buttons: The volume and power bottoms are on top of the tabled (if you keep it in portrait orientation). That is inconvenient, because my hand does not naturally go there when I am holding the tablet. These buttons should be on the side of the tablet. - Position of the microUsb/charging port: The microUsb port is set at the top of the tablet. From my point of view, they could not possibly have found a worse place to put it. It should be at the bottom. - Fire OS: Bleagh. What a piece of crap. I get that they want to sell their stuff, but bleagh. You cannot customize anything on your home screen, the order of things that they provide is just not what I would choose. There's no widgets, and on and on and on. Worse, they have made it impossible to set a different launcher. Sure, you can start a different launcher, but when you hit the home button it will get you back to their Fire garbage. - Alexa: I like my privacy. I do not need Amazon listening to everything I say all the time. Just like I do not need Google, or Microsoft listening. These ""assistants""-that-are-snoopers are the first thing that I disable. They can shove it up where the sun don't shine. - Lack of access to Google Play Store: WTF? I had to install it as an APK from some APK site. Why? This creates security issues, and require me to ""trust"" that APK site to give me the Google Play unmodified (as in without any malware embedded). Why? Just because Amazon is greedy? - Their own browser: Another snooping tool. I don't need Amazon to analyze my web habits. I mean all this data collections that companies like Amazon, Google or Facebook do is just gross. Talk about peeping toms.Bottom line: OK-ish hardware (with some inconveniently placed buttons), a real downgrade on the OS (from stock Android). Good price for the hardware."
"While this FireHD tablet is a decent, budget-friendly tablet, it does have some awkward ergonomic details.  Power button - is located on the short edge, right next to the usb-c charging port and is used to turn on and off the display and to reboot/start/turn off the tablet.  What is weird for me is that there is no other way to turn on the screen.  Unlike some tablets that turn on by tapping on the screen, this Fire HD does not appear to have that capability.  Volume Control - Alike the power button, this is also mounted on the narrow edge on the same side as the power button and charge port making that edge a bit crowded. With all the controls and charge port on one edge, the tablet is especially awkward to use when the usb cord is plugged in. Further, I find the texture of the tablet to be quite slippery and prone to slip out if my hand while holding/operating it.  I will surely consider purchasing a folio case so I won't need to handle the less-than-sure-to-hold tablet.On the good side, the screen is crisp and clear, and respond well to touch, and the dual speakers reproduce sound well, yet lack a little in terms of maximum volume.  Still the Bluetooth pairing is fast and works well. Response from the quad core cpu is reasonably fast and there us greater than 21Gb of free space for storage, plus a microsd slot for expansion.I rate this overall a better than average tablet for it's price, but still wish a double tap would bring it to life like my phone and old tablet."
"1st, as with more and more things these days there are no written instructions or documentation. Being from the generation that likes to read while learning and not totally reliant on tech to do for me. 2nd, there is now way that I have found yet to access all the books and apps located in the cloud. Seems as I have wasted a lot of $ on things stored there. 3rd, you cannot use any SD card used for storage from another kindle. Re-formats all SD cards to this units specifications and does not recognize any thing else. This has cost me a lot of lost files and data.All this drama and turmoil because nobody would repair a bad USB port on my old kindle. 4th problem, the online help was / is hard to navigate and no phone or email contact found for tech support.This is an update to review. Having tried everything in the book I have lost 5000 old time radio program down loads that were used on my old  unit. The icon for whatever to use Alexa is super sensitive and cuts off what is trying to be used until you clear and reset the screen. None of the YouTube apps that work on the old kindle and on every other device in my possession fails to properly display and permit you to save without actively opening a video and then save, go back to first screen that is totally lost. The position of the volume and power buttons are too close and cause power and volume tone constantly be mixed and loose what you are doing. Basically this latest version is a waste of time and money. Only thing it is good for is to be exclusive to Amazon related. That said the  base Amazon home page is awkward at best to get to. You must go to internet then enter amazon.com to access the main page of your account. Not so on the older versions. Seriously considering g using this only for new orders and nothing else. Lost all books in the cloud and not interested in more financial set backs."
"Well like the headline says, the product itself seems to be working fine thus far. I have side loaded a few apps as I intend to install the Google Play Store and Services at a later date. But so far I have not run into any performance related issues. The reason for the 3 star review is because of their scummy mobile app monetization with their special offers. Now I knew full well going into my purchase what the deal was but I don't understand why I should have to pay an additional $20-30 to have ads removed when everything else about the tablet is the same from a hardware perspective. Its like when you download a free-to-play game or app but then you can pay to remove ads except the game itself is still free. The difference being that usually buying the paid version of an app is I would say maybe $10 or so generally. And also often times paying for an app also gives you access to additional features. But in this case we have to pay $20-30 to remove the annoying lock screen ads and get nothing extra for that payment. Now I may sound stupid complaining about a potentially trivial matter for most people but its just annoying to me and I don't think its a good business practice. Like, is Amazon not going to sell enough of these so they need money from advertisers to afford the cost of producing them? Sorry for ranting on so long but just wanted to give my two cents."
I rarely use this device. It is always making noises like a computer makes when you plus something into it. Constantly does this even when it is not charging but when t is charging it is constant. I let it die and leave it alone now.
"The worst thing about the fire tablets is the volume is very poor on full volume you can barely hear it so I had to get a Bluetooth speaker to use it""!!."
"I got this for Christmas 2020 and so far it is not very kid or adult-friendly. I am trying and trying to like this but I cannot. The interface is not at all like any tablets. It is loaded with way way way 26k+ titles the child can download but I am looking to find a way to turn this off or hide it. My expectation was to give kids access to apps on their home screen that I wanted them to have access to,  but no. These apps are not downloaded but only suggestions on what Amazon thinks is ideal for your child, that is not happening.  Good luck searching through the 26k+ apps that they suggest. To find something that they played before is proving way too freaking difficult.  As far as the Kids Time or whatever you want to call it, that part is way too difficult to find as it is hidden somewhere. Even with all the rave reviews, I am not sure if it is an update but this thing is not easy to navigate, maybe a child doesn't care because they can click on any random link and it doesn't matter to them, but I want to control the apps. Where is the AMAZON APP STORE? this is probably buried somewhere along with the mess of apps also, I haven't found it yet. I do feel like throwing this thing and breaking it a few times just to get the frustration out and finding out if the warranty is worth anything. If you are used to an Android Tablet stick with that and not this thing it will be a lot more user-friendly.  Maybe it's an update as I saw in one review but I am so done with this thing. If you decide to try it save the box so you can return it.Edited: Okay so after googling and tweaking this thing without voiding the warranty there are ways to get rid of the unlimited suggestions and turn this into a tablet and in all it is pretty decent and fast, but still shouldn't have to go through the frustrations (this probably isn't an Amazon solution) But for me I am pleased with the tablet for now and is now kid-friendly with the apps that I want my kids to have. I did reinstall the Amazon Kids since I'm not paying for it for a year."
"I bought this tablet for my kids when it was on sale during Prime Day in hopes they would have an extra screen to use for Minecraft and Roblox.Set up: This was really easy and I selected the option of tieing it to my account when I was purchasing it so when it powered on and started the set up process it already had my saved wifi password on it. It pulled info I had saved on NY account like my kids profiles and it set up profiles for the 3 of them.Installing Apps: The Amazon Appstore isn't the greatest and feels, looks, and performs ""old"". The app selection is terrible and there seems to be a lot of abandoned apps. The process for installing an app is slow and is slow on all my devices (I'm on a 500mb down internet connection, and use the appstore on recent, high end devices).Performance: This tablet runs like you would expect a $45 tablet should. I primarily bought it for 2 tasks, to play Roblox and Minecraft and it does one well. Roblox plays as it should and isn't bad but when it comes to Minecraft it is a laggy experience. Some other games seem to play well (Toca Food 1 and 2).User Interface: I have mixed feelings about the user interface. On one hand it looks fairly nice and modern but on the other hand it also looks old and dated. I say this because the color palette is nice but the large text for the ""tabs"" remind me very much of the old metro style from the Microsoft Zune. Coming from a normal Android device, the way some of the UI works is different from just about everything (like getting into the options/settings on my kids profile) and watching my kids trying to use it for the first time (they have experience with Android, Chrome OS, and iOS) they struggled to do things they wanted to do like change their profile icon (the parent has to do it).Cutting This Short: It's a $45 tablet and it performs like one, it doesn't play Minecraft well at all but plays Roblox well."
"Brief general review before delving deeper into my gripes with the tablet for my desired usage below...As an Amazon ecosystem content consumption device, this tablet is fine. Don't expect upscale build quality, super high performance, great responsiveness, or the ability to access the Google Play Store without additional, non-sanctioned, effort and you're not likely to be disappointed. It's nothing remarkable but fine for the price.Now, on to why I'm rating it relatively negatively given the narrow parameters for which I purchased the tablet.I picked up the tablet on sale as an experiment for use as a front-end audio interface for consuming Amazon Music while working in my home office during the day, i.e. tablet => external USB DAC => discrete AMP => unpowered speakers. In short, the experiment was an abject failure for one primary reason - there is no way to simultaneously charge the tablet and connect it to an external USB DAC. The tablet could probably play audio over the course of an 8-hour workday without being charged, however, this would be predicated on having the screen aggressively power-off automatically. Given that the tablet does not support tap-to-wake functionality, i.e. you must press the power button to wake up the tablet, this configuration was unworkable for my use case.The tablet will interface with an external USB DAC just fine given the appropriate hardware, e.g. USB type C hub / port adapter or a USB type C OTG cable. In my testing, I used a Topping D10s and a SMSL SU-8 V2, both of which connected to the tablet without incident and produced output when audio was played on the tablet.The tablet will charge through a USB type C hub / port adapter that supports USB-C Power Delivery input, however, if a USB-C power source is connected first the tablet will charge and subsequently connecting a DAC to the hub produces no connection between the tablet and the DAC. Conversely, if a USB DAC is first connected to a USB type C hub connected to the tablet, the DAC is recognized and audio output will be produced by the DAC, however, subsequently connecting a USB-C power source to the Power Delivery input port on the hub / adapter does not result in the tablet being charged. None of the various port adapters / hubs / OTG cables I tried allowed for both charging the tablet while concurrently playing audio through an external USB DAC."
"I got this on sale for $40 with a trade in deal for sending in my old 7"" fire (which was a hassle, btw - Amazon accepted it but then said it was defective, it definitely was not, then never sent it back despite me selecting the ""return items if rejected"" option. So they either lost it or reformatted it and sold it, hoping I wouldn't notice? Customer service did eventually give me a credit in Amazon gift cards, however).It's fine for the $40 I paid. Great for watching movies/show via the Prime app, Netflix, or even Plex. Note that some apps need to be side loaded via Google Play for a better experience imo.However, for my other two primary needs (reading ebooks and gaming) it's a mixed bag. The touch screen is poor (trying to type for a web browser is terrible, numbers and symbols require a 3+ second press with no option to change this in settings) so gaming is a struggle. I alleviate this somewhat with a Bluetooth controller however, as of late 2021 a Kindle Fire OS update stopped a key button (Menu, or Start button for old farts like me) from working in Game Pass. I've updated the controller firmware and searched Game Pass & Kindle forums, it's definitely an issue on the Fire side.Reading in the Kindle app is fine, but other apps aren't great. I use Hoopla for my local library ebooks and this screen cuts off 2-3 characters on the right side of the page, making it difficult to read sentences/paragraphs without the occasional guesswork.If you are looking to use this ONLY with the built in apps and apps within the Amazon/Kindle/Fire ecosystem, you'll probably be fine. But if you're like me and you like to do a little more, you will feel restricted. Still, for a budget android tablet, it's good enough."
"I got this tablet a few months ago, hoping to be able to download an app that I like, so I can read ebooks from my local library. The apps are Hoopla and Overdrive.  I got this tablet after I failed to get these apps to work on my daughter's tablet, same one, just a little older. So I thought, maybe her tablet is getting old, and that's why I can not download these apps.  After several try outs, I kept on getting the same highlighted message ""tap over your pending orders and make changes"" I did, it took me to my amazon account, which is updated, working, and that I use all the time to order other stuff.  So, I sign in to amazon, fill out all the information they ask, then the logo for the app appears on the screen, I try to tap on it, to try to download, it doesn't work. I go back to the app store, to try to download it directly from there, and I get the same message again, and then it takes me though the same steps, taking me nowhere. It is just a loop, I can probably spend the entire day trying to do it, and it just doesn't seem to work. This same thing happened with both, my daughter's older tablet, and the brand new one that I got.I just would like to know why is not possible to download an app that you seem to offer on your app store, when you obviously don't want people to get it. I guess you would like to people just get ebooks through Amazon kindle, but that's not always possible. If you don't want people to sign up Hoppla or Overdrive, just don't offer them on your app store. By reading on your reviews, it seems that only people from the UK are able to get this service. The funny thing, is that I used to use these apps in the past, to read and enjoy the library services, and it worked just fine. But not anymore."
"Since Amazon Kindle dropped support for the older versions of Fire Tablets, I was urged by Amazon support to get a ""new and improved"" Kindle Fire Table 8 (10th gen), black, ad supported lock screen, 32GB unit.On the good side: With refunds and various other promotions, I was able to get one for a great price.  Also, bigger screen than my old one, more memory, and the ability to add a micro SD card for tons of storage.  Battery life seems to be a bit better and it is a few fractions of an ounce lighter.On the disappointing side: My old Kindle supported HDMI output.  My bad, I didn't do enough research and read the reviews.  After wasting my time trying to figure it out, I discovered that the USB-C port, which can support video out but doesn't on the Kindle Fire 8 (10th gen), is only for charging.  That is disappointing because I had hoped I could use it like I had my old Kindle in our travel trailer to provide entertainment content to our cheap RV TV.  Not a major issue, just a sad, disappointing fact made even sadder when I found out it won't support screen mirroring (casting) either.  It is too bad since this is advertised as ""designed for portable entertainment.""In general, it does most of what I needed, just not everything I thought it should or could.  But for what I paid for it, it's good enough.  And that is why I gave it 3 stars.  If it had video output on the USB-C port and Screen Mirroring capability -5 stars for sure."
"There is no way to block your child from downloading free content with Amazon Kids, so they fill the tablet up with junk apps and you have to go in and delete stuff all the time. This is a big drawback for me and seems like a simple fix for Amazon to restrict it so your child can only see what you want. Seems like a common thread for others. I won’t be getting a fire again if this one breaks for this reason. Otherwise it has been a good tablet, but make sure you get enough storage as it fills with bloated system updates quickly."
"I got this on a Black Friday sale to travel with, so I don't have to worry about my Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 getting broken or stolen. So, this is quite a downgrade compared to what I'm used to (3GHz octo-core to 2GHz quad-core CPU, 6GB RAM to 2GB, 279ppi 120Hz to 189ppi 60Hz display). Out of the box it was fairly responsive, but as soon as I loaded it up with a bunch of apps, the lag launching or switching applications became very noticeable. Sometimes it even lags using applications. But for its intended purpose, watching video, it does quite well without skips or drops. The image quality is a bit soft and colors a bit washed out compared to the more premium Samsung display, but for 1/10th the price, it's a reasonable compromise.One reason for the poor performance is the fact that I got the 32 GB edition and added an SD card; SD cards are always slower than internal storage. But it didn't make sense to pay a $30 premium for 32GB more internal storage on a budget tablet, when a 64GB SD card is $10. If you're looking for performance, this isn't the tablet to buy anyway.While this tablet sits in a very sweet spot in the price/performance ratio, my main complaint is the slow charging. For the life of me I can't understand why Amazon made this choice unless they're using second-rate batteries that can't handle ""normal"" fast charging speeds, which doesn't bode well for longevity (all lithium batteries wear out with charge/discharge cycles, after a year or two the battery life will be reduced compared to new). But I guess it'll be time to buy a new tablet after a couple years anyway, since they tend to get slower with every Android and every app update."
"the kindle device is so uptight. Specs from amazon claim you can use up to a 1 TB sd card. BUT, the kindle fire hd8 that we got will not read any sd card over 128gb it Claims they ""are not compatible"" we went through 16 sd cards and it doesn't like anything over 128GB.  the 128GB card it did agree to use had to be formatted by the kindle device 4 times each time when it was done formatting it claimed the  SD card was ""corrupt format SD"".. The usb port that is on the kindle device is made wrong. where not just any usb cord will work it has to be the cheap, garbage, not fast, usb cord. if not, it screams all day about water in the port and there isnt any water anywhere near the port, it won't charge and things go bad. and most the cords we tried were new, and just out of the sealed packaging.  if you download items from the apps place and the sd cards goes screwy you cant uninstall them or reclaim the space and reinstall, because the library still claims you have them installed. Now it is faster than my samsung and at times if flat geton with stuff, however the issues to charge and no acceptable storage are making my smart phone look like a better option"
I received the tablet and it was working very well and everything was great. My son cracked the tablet and I contacted them for a replacement and I was given the run around twice. The first girl said they would refund my money and no need to return item and that was about 2weeks ago. I just contacted customer service again this morning and they said they weren't able to offer replacement. I would like some help in this matter please. The tablet was wonderful I just want a replacement and be able to send this cracked one back.
"Purchased my 1st Kindle HD 6 in 2015 and it worked straight out of the box. Gave it to a family member when I purchased a Kinde HDX 7 with Alexa in 2016; it also worked straight out of the box.  Purchased the “All-new Fire HD 8 tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB” in July of this year.  I am now on my 3rd replacement Fire HD 8 tablet.  The initial Fire HD 8 tablet attached to the internet and transferred all my settings, apps, and icons to the new device via the Cloud once I entered the email address and password for my Amazon account.  However, I had to make several calls to tech support because when you closed out of a kindle book, the kindle app continues running which drains the battery. Occasionally the tablet would not boot up when you press the power button unless you re-inserted the power cord that is plugged into a power source.  In addition the Kindle Fire app which allows  you to control your fire-stick using your Kindle 8 device, would freeze or after watching one prime video, the Kindle HD 8 wouldn’t reconnect to the firestick without shutting down and rebooting the HD 8 (as you can imagine this gets old real quick).  In the 10 weeks I've had the HD8 I feel I’ve spoken with every Amazon Tech support organization across the globe. After 30 minutes of trouble shooting and frustration on the part of the technician, they inevitably order a replacement HD 8.  Each time I try to transfer my settings, apps, etc. from the cloud to the replacement device the process comes to a screeching halt when attempting to register the new device with Amazon. To do this requires entering my email address and password for my existing Amazon account.  Each time I try to enter my password, I get an error message.  After attempting to do this several times with Tech support, they wind up putting in an order for a replacement device.  So far, I’ve received 3 replacements including one that was delivered in a crushed, partially opened outer box with an equally damaged inner box that was immediately sent back.  Fortunately, with the 3rd replacement I was lucky to be connected to Amazon Tech support in the U.S. The saving grace was the Amazon support person who was patient and  actually listened  as we repeated the same steps I had gone through twice before including powering the device up and down multiple times, and resetting my Amazon password on my account at least twice. She even went so far as to do a factory reset of the device. Each time the install/transfer process came to a halt when it was time to enter my email address and password.  Finally, someone had the sense (professionalism) to stop asking me whether I was pressing the wrong buttons (I’ve been employed in tech support for more than 15 years) and escalated the problem to their software analysts.  So now I’m just waiting for Amazon to get back to me with a solution (which they may want to do since I won’t be able to make impulse purchases from Amazon using this Kindle HD8  :-o )"
"this is my 5th Fire. Not sure when they changed the design of the power button, but it's in a horribly uncomfortable spot now. I know there is nothing to be done to change it, will just have to get used to it, but wish the designers could have put it in a more comfortable position like the older models were, so you could use it with one hand instead of two. Of course a change was needed so you are forced to buy new cases."
"This is my 4th Kindle Fire after having literally worn out the previous 3 (to the point that not even the IT techs at the university where I teach were able to revive them!).  I love my Fire for reading, listening to audio books, quick Internet to check e-mail or shop, and even for playing games.  I don't use it for viewing movies, TV programs, etc.  As PhD reading specialist, the Fire most definitely has the most readable screen and I understand was designed to mimic reading from paper sources; certainly there is less eye strain that reading from any other screen I've used.  That said, I really dislike that Amazon has sold out to advertisers.  It angers me to see ads every time the Fire is opened, and frustrates me that the carousel no longer includes a list of my recent uses.  Instead the carousel has only the most recent and then a LONG list of items labeled ""Discover"" which is simply more advertisements!  Another negative is that the Amazon App Store of this Kindle version appears much  more limited than other app stores.Bottom line:  this 30 year Kindle User much prefers the previous version to the FIRE HD 8. If you can find an older one, get it instead!"
.... It wouldn't even manually update using a PC to OS8... You'll never be able to run it on google play And the screen is too wide for holding
"My old kindle fire was far easier to use than the new version which is cluttered with screen after screen that requires Alexa - which I don't have or need.  The number of ads when you play a game can be ridiculous if you don't know how to X out of the game screens, even then it takes me about 20 minutes,  Battery life is much poorer than the old Fire - or all those commercials are draining it.  I guess I'll end up paying to get rid of ads, but not unless I'm 100% sure it will get rid of all the game ads.  The cover makes it hard to open and close - I have a second cover I bought by mistake but have tried it and it didn't fit well either.  It's less than half as good as my old Fire due to this Alexa stuff that I don't understand and, from what I've read, don't need,  So sad they ruined this device - I tend to have a lot of hospital stays and this isn't really fit to take to the hospital unless I can find one of my books to read.  and there is a power outlet nearby. And why is Safari STILL the web browser?  Terribly disappointed even with a discounted price."
"This was a replacement for a the same Kindle Fire that stopped working well. It wouldn't play downloaded videos (in Showtime, HBO Max and Netflix) and stopped connecting to my bluetooth. All I use it for is books and downloaded videos to watch while on the stairclimber at the gym. I don't have other apps or use it for internet or messaging (I have a phone for that) So given it wouldn't play videos and I had to plug in a headset made it pretty much worthless. I was able to get a replacement under warranty. This one is marginally better. I can play downloads but always have to close out whichever app I'm using since even though I'm in downloads it must default to streaming and the videos just go into the eternal load mode. Once I restart the app it lets me play downloads. It's also working with my bluetooth. It would be better if you could wake the screen by touch rather than having to use the side buttons which can be awkward on cardio equipment. It would also be better if the volume button wasn't next to the wake button. I often hit the wrong button and end up closing the screen instead of adjusting the volume which is quite a PITA."
"I’m extremely disappointed Not only is this the second time I purchased this type of tablet for a specific need only to be disappointed twice. A while ago, I purchased a Fire tablet 7 Unaware that echo show mode was not on all of the devices so when the opportunity came, I purchased this newer model, believing that the echo show mode would be more like the echo show, but it is not Whenever you ask a question, it goes to a Web browser which switches off the echo show mode The speakers are so quiet you couldn’t use it to listen to any book or music or talk to somebody unless it’s right in front of your face Which defeats the purpose of it, pretending to be an echo show. I also wanted it To use for my Wyze doorbell, I don’t know why it doesn’t work, but it doesn’t, you get no notifications no display just radio silence, I spent an hour trying to troubleshoot it enabling reenable uninstalling, installing just for it to never work.  So if you want a cheap tablet with occasional Alexa connections, then I guess buy it but if you’re trying to use it as a stand alone echo device, don’t waste your money or time."
"A thief robbed us of a Holiday projection light device that we installed on our front lawn to project patterns of Christmas lights on our house for the Christmas holidays. . A family friend heard about the incident & wanted to help us protect against further intrusion of our property and gifted us with a ring doorbell camera & Alexa Echo 5 to monitor our front door & property. In order to install & marry the two devices together, a smart phone or other android device  is required to install and tie  the two items together for  further monitoring of the two items. As recommended, I opted to purchase a Amazon Fire 8.  There was a problem and I could not get the Echo 5 to announce motion at our front door. The two buttons that control that and notifications  were not lit or operable, so I contacted customer service chat and over an day and a half, I  presented my case to no less that 8 different techs on the chat and one telephone call that lasted for over an hour with a tech who later deserted me. Nobody had a solution.  So, from all of that, all I could determine is that the Fire 8 tablet was not compatible, so I sent it back & am now in search of a tablet that will do the job. I thought because all of the three items that were included in the operation were all Amazon products that I wouldn't have any trouble, but I was wrong. The tablet might be OK for an interesting ""toy"" but certainly didn't fill my expectations to tie all three products together. So, I had no choice but to award no better than 3 stars."
"I bought this 8"" Fire because it seemed a good value for $50 and because my old Android Ver. 7 tablet was showing its age, getting very slow and sometimes freezing up entirely.  The good news is that the new tablet is much faster and somewhat smoother in operation.  The bad news is that many apps on the old tablet that would work offline don't seem to work offline on this one.  I'm often not in a Wi-Fi hotspot.  I use tablets mainly for reading and for playing some games against the computer.  On the old tablet once I downloaded a book or a game I didn't need an internet connection to read it or play it.  On this Fire tablet, all the built-in apps and the ones from the Amazon Appstore don't seem to work right if I'm not online.  I keep getting messages like ""Internal Service Failure.""  I even have problems reading Kindle books I've already downloaded when I'm offline.  Very frustrating.  I've recently tried 'sideloading' some Android APK apps and some of them appear to work offline, but I shouldn't have to be doing this!  BTW, the price I'm seeing for this tablet has recently gone up a lot, and at $90 it's not a good value for the money.Update: I'm downgrading the rating for this tablet from 3 stars to 1 star.  It froze on me and refused to work right until I had it 'forget' the SD card.  So, of course, it lost all the apps and documents I had put on the SD card.  This tablet has been much more aggravation than it's worth.  I may try just using it with internal storage only and no SD card.Final Update: I managed to get the tablet working again, and now I think I understand what the problem was with the SD card.  I should have set it as PTP transfer rather than internal storage.  Who knew, and the software didn't explain it that well.  However, now that I've calmed down a bit, I'm upgrading my review to 2 stars.  That seems fair."
"I'm very disappointed with my Kindle Fire tablet. I bought it February 11, 2022 and now it will not charge. No matter how long I leave it charging, it's dead.  So, it needs a new battery. ""Rufus"" says that the battery cannot be changed and it won't recommend the batteries found on the Amazon website. Apple iPad, anyone?"
It got here super fast and before my kids birthday
"This tablet is a decent enough product.  It lets you load videos, music, e-books, photos, and other content, and then to view the content at your leisure.  It is enabled for Alexa.  The screen is large and easy to view.The volume on my device was terrible.  Even at maximum volume, I sometimes can barely hear what's going on.  If I use earphones it's better, but there are times when I simply don't want to wear earphones.  Unfortunately, for those times I'm out of luck.Another problem with the volume is, in my opinion, unacceptable.  If I press the volume control to keep increasing the volume, at some point it ""wraps"" around and you go from 100% to 4% or so.  Then you have to start over again.  This is just plain dumb.  There is no good reason why the volume should suddenly drop down to basically zero, requiring you to repeatedly press the volume control again.The power switch is at an inconvenient spot, where I keep accidentally hitting it as I try to use the volume control keys; and often it happens when I'm simply trying to hold the device.  I'm right-handed, so my finger often winds up right on the power button, turning it off.  Again.I seriously did not like that Alexa was enabled by default.  That caused some mild difficulties when I was talking to a friend and mentioned that the tablet had Alexa on it.  Of course Alexa responded to its name.All in all, I find that this tablet gave me about what one might expect for something as cheap as this was.  It works, it will do, but I wouldn't try to convince my friends to get one."
"I bought this about 3 years ago. It  still works but I don't use very often, only when I need a recipe from one of my ebooks.The operating system is still early 2000's android quality. With a company as wealthy as Amazon you'd think they would have one of the best user interfaces on the planet but I guess that money is spent on moving historical bridges and new mansions instead. I was looking into getting a newer version but the screen size is the same and they still have that huge unnecessary bezel around it. Again, like early 2000's"
"On my new table, the screen initially starts like the old style, the screenshot on the left. At some point, the screen changes over to the one on the right. This message pops up. At first, I don't recall the message pooping up and the screen designed just changed. I later realized that it did and I was just closing it. I also didn't really pay attention that it was telling me the screen was redesigned supposedly to make it easier on me, with just having the three headings or tabs. If you look at the pictures of the tablet advertised, it shows the old style, not the ""new and improved"" style. I called Amazon support and they did an extensive troubleshooting session with me which included a hard boot. The screen would show up as the old way, but then at some point it would change to the ""new and improved"" appearance. I tried registering it many times and most of the time the screen would become the old style only to change to the "" new and improved"" style. Why would they do this? Anyway, I complained so they sent me a new tablet and said to just keep the first one. Well, I got the replacement and guess what? It does the same as the first one!Why doesn't the developer of this particular tablet realize the error in programming the device? Why don't the people that creates the advertisement on the website know this feature put the picture of the ""new and improved"" screen on the website? Why isn't the people that troubleshoot these tablets aware of this?  Why change the screen on the tablet? Who is ""we"" decided? Are they actual customers that have suggested a change is needed?I've managed to keep one of the tablets on the original screen set up for now, but who knows when it will decide to change. Now I have two tablets!  I guess since these are so cheap compared to the Samsung tablet and iPad, what can I expect. I wish I could afford a better quality tablet!BTW, I started writing my review on the new tablet and attach the photos, but I got an error that they are trying to fix it. I had to use my old tablet to create this.  Don't they have people that do all kinds of testing before they actually roll the product out? I used to test software for errors. I wish I could do a work from home job doing testing!Other than having the issue with my screen converting over to the ""new and improved"" screen and not being able to attach photos, the tablet is okay."
"Kindle Fire tablets are a good deal for the money, mostly. I've bought several of them. But two have gone bad for no reason. One after only 18 months. It is either a battery problem, or a software problem. In each case, one day it works fine, and the next, it's dead. Amazon was unable to help me. I even tried going to a forum to reprogram the units, but that didn't work either. So you're taking your chances every time you buy one. The 10"" unit that died at least had a perfect screen, so I got a whopping $15 credit in return for spending over $100 new. Maybe they should sell these by subscription, at $6/month, which is what I ended up paying. I couldn't bring myself to go through that again, so I bought the cheapest option available, and made use of the amazon credit for dead Kindles, to trade them in. I guess if they have a program for that, it must happen a lot. If this one goes bad, at least I'll only be out $35. Buyer beware!"
"This arrived today as a replacement for my daughter's 2018 version that has faithfully served her for the last couple of years. I was excited to get a more modern tablet with the USB C interface for charging since we keep losing devices to loose micro-usb plugs.However, it's not quite ready for release. Just getting it set up with her apps and things I've already had it lock up on me twice and required a reboot, it's generally just as sluggish in the UI as the older tablet, and it's BUGGY. I have been on with support (if you really want to call them that) for over an hour (Edit, ended up at 2.5 hours before I gave up) trying to figure out why apps can't access the camera/microphone in my child's FreeTime profile.The wifi is also horrible - I am 30' from an Orbi router with 3 other devices that have full wifi and this thing has 1 bar...1.  It took FOREVER for it to download apps on our Gigabit internet.I'd hold off on this one and see if they work out the kinks....I know I am not buying replacements for my other kids at this point in time, even if their old version breaks.**UPDATE and adding a couple stars from 1 to 3** Amazon reached out to me today and is aware of the issues with FreeTime and permissions and is working on it as well as the overall service experience. The tablet hasn’t locked up since the initial setup either, so I’m going to remain hopeful that it’ll get there. Still not planning on buying any more and may send this one back due to the low WiFi signal and general instability, but would be willing to give it a second chance."
"For the price this is a good tablet for consuming Amazon content other than books or games.  The touch screen is a little clunky.  I often have to tap several times to get a response.  The device is also slower than my 2014 Kindle Fire 7 in opening books and apps.  I do wish Amazon would be upfront in their advertising regarding the fact that bookmarks, highlights, and notes in books do not transfer.  Also, game progress cannot be transferred from another Kindle device. Many games require an investment of money, and all of that is lost.  Needless to say, I will not be playing any games on this device.  Now I understand why people are ditching their Kindles for paperback books--to lose all of your notes and highlights is bad business practice.  I don't know what you were thinking Amazon, but this decision leaves no incentive to purchase ebooks or invest in Kindle unlimited.  I had thought about purchasing a new Kindle reader this year, but not now.  In addition, I would be wary of using any writing apps, photo apps, file apps--anything that creates something one might want to save and have access to in the future.  Therefore, know upfront that this Kindle device is simply for consuming Amazon content, such as watching movies, listening to music, and making purchases through the Amazon store.  When I think of all the money I have invested in ebooks and games, I should have purchased an iPad."
"There is something wrong with this generation of tablet. I bought one and it would not find my location and kept putting me in a different state. After going through about five or six people I was told that they had to contact the provider and that they would be in touch with me in 4 or 5 days. Nobody ever called me back. These things cannot find your location if something wrong with the software and until they fix it I would not recommend this product to anybody unless you just like throwing your money away. I think when you release a product you should have it test it out and know that it's working properly in all fields this does not work. Customer service cannot seem to help anybody and they say they're going to call me back and they never do. Very poor customer service very poor product. I would wait for the next generation and see if they have fixed the problem but this one is totally unacceptable. Amazon techs can't seem to help and they don't get back in touch with you so all you can do is call and start from the very beginning all over again I've done this five times and the end result is always the same they have to contact somebody and have them get a hold of me and they will get in touch with me four to five business days. Didn't happen and I don't know if it's going to. Very dissatisfied with this tablet and will recommend to everybody not to buy until they can fix the problems and take care of the customers. Very unhappy, very unsatisfied, very disturbed. I probably wouldn't be quite as mad if someone would actually contact me when they say they're going to but as of yet that hasn't happened. Don't buy it you'll be sorry"
"This is my third Kindle, which says how much I like this little book and movie presenter. It is also the most troublesome of the trio. I have called Amazon's help technicians three times in the 2 months I have had it. (And, yes, they resolved each issue I had at the time.) The most irritating issue with this Kindle is that it has a mind of its own sometimes: it insists that I really do want to activate Alexa (I do not); it sometimes shuts itself off when I put it down, and refuses to turn back on until I plug it into an electric circuit; and it interrupts Netflix once in a while to ask me to at least look at what Alexa can do. My other two Kindles, earlier versions, did not have Alexa, and I am convinced that this robot thingie is the real problem. But, as one technician dolefully explained, ""It is incorporated so you cannot delete it."" Arghhh!But the screen and image quality is fine, good enough to enjoy the nature and animal shows I love on Netflix. And it doesn't run out of battery after my full day of print and scenic ventures. It is just overloaded for what I want and need. Amazon, please don't put stuff on my stuff that I didn't ask for and do not want. That's all."
"The charging cable is defective. I can use a standard type c cable, but was disappointed.This came as a kids tablet. This was a problem for me. Too many unnecessary settings to get get set up. Amazon support took the kids requirements off."
"Cons:Shut off randomly and won’t turn on until plugged in. Battery level does not matter.***Sunny day at the beach with your fire tablet- It shuts off and won’t restart without power.***tent camping trip And you are looking forward to unplugging and reading your favorite book? This tablet will turn off and won’t restart.Anytime I am in a No power situation and want to read, this tablet will turn off.We have had three or four of them in our family and they all do this at the most inconvenient time.I’ve used this Amazon fire tablet for the last few years. I’ve had multiple of them.They were great as a reader. They are a little bit slow for ideal Internet browsing."
"I bought the Fire HD 8 Kids Edition tablet, 8"" HD display, 32 GB, Blue Kid-Proof Case for my 2 year old. He was flinging around my Ipad like a rag doll and getting into apps I really didn't want him in. I liked that this specific fire tablet was formatted for kids and allowed a great deal of parental control. While these features are nice....it really is NOT a good tablet. The layout is definitely not as ""user"" friendly as the ipad, my son still asks for my ipad when its screen time. It took a while for my son to get used to it. If he was looking for something specific, I had to search for it because it would not always be readily available in the categories. It also has constant problems and does not run smoothly. For example, it will say it is ""offline"" due to no internet connection, yet all our other devices are fine and connected. This only allows you to access the content you have downloaded locally if it shows offline. I have to restart the tablet almost every time my toddler plays with it because it freezes. This obviously frustrates him and me. One time I was locked out completely and it said I needed to set up a pin (to access the adult account) which I had already done. Thankfully once I restarted it, the system remembered I had a pin! I have also had issues where I have allowed an app for the kids account and it ""disappears"". I have to go back in and re-add it to the kids account. I also do not like that I can not access purchased content from the google store or apple store to add to this tablet. Amazon simply does not have the same kind of content. If you want a super ""cheap"" tablet that is buggy and T-U-R-T-L-E slow when loading, this is for you. If this sounds time consuming and frustrating...look into something else! In my honest opinion, this is a crappy tablet and not worth the money. Right now, the fire tablet is $139.99 on Amazon. Currently, Apple's cheapest is $329 and the Galaxy's lowest is $229-279. I would recommend saving a little bit more and buying one of these instead. I'm currently looking into one of these to replace the amazon fire because I can not do it anymore! A kids tablet MUST work and be useable BY A KID with little to no parent involvement."
"Although internally the Fire uses the android platform, the GUI (launch screen) is not what I expected. The launch screen is covered with short cuts to app I will never use and can not be deleated. I had to dump them all into a folder and drag it to the bottom of the screen where they would be out of the way at least. Also, you cannot install apps from the App Store, only apps from the Amazon app store and they are mostly unusable like the pre-installed apps. If you are some what tech savy you can get on the internet to learn how to modify the unit, enabling it to download and install apps from the android App Store. You can modify the launch screen too if you have a desktop or laptop computer. It's much more complicated, by design I imagine. That said, you know when you buy the thing you are buying into a whole lot of ads (recomendations). All in all, the Fire functions quite well other than the GUI. Worth the money overall, just didn't know I was going to have to spend a couple hours making it do what I wanted it to and not what the Amazon sales people though would be a good idea."
Some kindled are better than others. I'm on my third Fire HD 8 and it has been the worst. It has always just dropped connection to internet and the battery loses power quickly. I'm down to 2 hours of power. It is 2 years old but my other kindled didn't have this problem. It was such a slow decline that I couldn't return it within time frame. It seems quality goes down with every new release.
"The tablet functions as it should.  It comes preloaded with so much bloatware it bogged down my wifi.  I had to go through and remove or force it to stop.  Also, after only a year and a half, the battery stopper holding a charge very long.  At least it still takes a charge."
"I am hoping to be able to update this review if all goes well- the latest in the journey will be up here.___________________________________________________________________Received this tablet for Christmas. It seemed to work great at first (I disabled Alexa when at work, got the apps I wanted). It is easy to use and a nice size and I enjoyed it while the kids I work with were on their winter break. Not even a month into having it, the screen would go black midday and the device would not turn back on.I would plug it in at home to see that the battery was still almost at 100%. Yet the tablet shut off and wouldn't turn back on until being plugged in (as if the battery was being drained, but it was not). I now see from the one star reviews that this is a common issue for this model.I sent it in for repair under warranty. The same tablet was sent back as ""repaired"". A week into trying the repaired tablet out, it is having the same issue. I leave with the battery at 100%, and yet it turns off midday and does not turn back on. I had one customer service rep speak to me on the phone and, upon using remote control to make sure my settings were all good, all he told me was ""Well... it should work fine."" Thanks, it doesn't?One rep was able to tell me that if it did it again, contact customer support again while it was still under limited warranty to get a replacement this time. Fingers crossed the replacement works!"
"Purchased the Kindle Fire 8 HD (2020 10th Gen) because my old Kindle Fire (6th Gen) just stopped working!  Thought the new one would be an improvement.  Finding some features or lack of features, a bit of a problem.1.  The volume buttons and the on/off buttons are now located right next to each other.  And they are also the same color as my case - Black.  Makes it difficult to hit the correct  button at times.  The old Kindle had the buttons on the opposite sides and also had the buttons in a Silver color.  Easy to distinguish.2.  The dark and light theme feature on the Amazon Silk homepage does not operate correctly.  The dark theme I use keeps switching back to the light theme at times.  Annoying.3.  The calendar disappeared completely.  Gave up trying to get it back.4.  Used the Avast antivirus on my old Kindle but the new one does not support it (or Malwarebytes).  Can't find a good alternative for virus protection.  The ones offered in apps are not really good choices.There are a few other annoying features I'll try to work around.  But bottom line is this is my third Kindle and I'm not really sure I'll buy a fourth should the time come. It wasn't very expensive but I didn't think I'd be taking a step backwards.  I'll see what other options might be available."
"My old Fire 8 has a failing battery.  It doesn't hold a charge for more than a few hours...overnight drains it.I ordered this newer model thinking I could use one of the covers I already have rather than spending another $23 for a new one. I'm a victim of planned obsolescence.  This model is a little over half a centimeter wider so the old cover doesn't close.  It is also over a centimeter shorter, so it slides down in the old cover. It doesn't turn on when the cover is opened like the older model, so I have to reach into the cover and the ""on"" button is difficult to find.  I sometimes have to click it several times before it gets the ""on"" message.  I find just holding the unit without a cover, awkward and it tends to slip out of my arthritic hand.Also I want the protection the cover gives it.Another change is the charging cord.  It doesn't fit the old model and the old model's cord doesn't fit this unit. Not a big deal unless you have more than one unit to charge and don't want the extra plug dedicated to charging.It makes a little musical noise when it has been TURNED OFF for hours.  It sounds like someone is accessing it....annoying and worrysome.Another thing I don't like about this model is it doesn't sync with the other Fire 8.  It keeps it's own bookmark, but doesn't recognize I read on another unit while this one was charging.  The older model had this convenience.After trying to get used to this model I've lowered my rating by one star."
"I purchased this Kindle Fire November 1, 2020 and it has been great until recently.  The battery started draining on its own daily even with it off.  I don’t know what’s causing this.  I’m sure this should last longer than almost 4 years.I don’t do anything with this except for reading and it’s less than an hr a day.  One charge used to last me at least a week.I wanted to buy the paper white but it was too expensive but I might just spend the extra money and do that."
I upgraded to this from the first generation Kendall touch device. I was so excited to have some thing that has a longer battery life than an hour. Today I noticed the audiobook I have downloaded at least five times has disappeared yet again. I don’t like that if I don’t have Wi-Fi things I have downloaded and show or physically located on my device get deleted unless I am actively using it. Sometimes I will be in the middle of reading a book and the book disappears even though I purchased it with money and it was download it on my Kindle. I will not be buying any more audiobooks since this Kindle device will not use audio book features unless you have Wi-Fi. I really wish that I had not gotten the audio for the book i am currently reading so that I could use the auto read feature. I may have to dig out my old generation one device so I can bypass the audiobook since the newer devices are ONLY able to play audiobooks AFTER you download them but MUST HAVE wifi. Stupid feature prevents me from giving five stars. If Amazon can get their crap together and fix it so that I can listen to my audiobooks (that are downloaded on the device) off Wi-Fi I would consider five star rating.
Why do these not last very long ? I purchased my in September 2020 and today ( May -28 -2024 ) it just stopped working !!!!!! this is the third one I have purchased !!!!!! Wanda
"So the only reason I bought this was because I had the previous model and it worked amazing up until the charging port became loose and it wouldn't charge anymore. It did everything I wanted it to do so I thought this would be the exact same but with a usb-c port that wouldn't break after time.Idk what they changed or if I just got a bad one but since day one it has been a piece of junk. The browser crashes on me any time it takes too long to load a page. I can't make it past the first page of Amazon without it crashing to the home screen. I never NEVER get notifications as they come in but rather hours later.The worst thing is messenger for Facebook. This worked fine on the older tablet but I don't get notifications on this one. Yes, I've gone through ALL the settings and there's no reason I shouldn't get them. It's like if the app isn't open it doesn't work. So I miss calls from family members all the time. My family lives in a different country and my dad and grandma both passed away this year so it was so important for me to get these calls. :(It's not just messenger but my blink cameras don't send me alerts when they record movement unless I open the app. Then suddenly all the notifications come flooding in. What good is this going to be if someone's trying to get into my house?Every now and again the screen will go black and none of the buttons will wake it up. But you can see a back light, so the tablet isn't completely off. I need to mash all the buttons down and hold them all for a minute or so to do some sort of hard boot. The thing about this is, I don't notice until later in the day that the tablet had crashed. And I miss a lot of messages from family this way.Ended up buying a cell phone and getting a phone plan so that I don't have to deal with this thing anymore. It'll now become a toy for my 1 yr old."
"I have used and loved  kindles for years …. but this one doesn’t turn on every 3rd or 4th time of use,  and have to plug into charger to restart.I put back to factory setting 3xs and  it still does the same.Customer service sends the same link to fix and never calls back when asked for support. Or - the link says call connected but no call actually received.Kindle also won’t go to large print despite set to large print in settings."
"I had been an iPad user for two generations of the darn thing until Apple priced themselves out of my budget.  After deciding to give the Fire 8 a try, an acquaintance recommended the end-around reprogramming to fool the tablet into thinking it was a regular Android tablet. Before too long, I was experiencing so many odd errors that I undid the conversion.  Now, back in the Amazon universe, I can see why my friend made the recommendation.  Locked inside the Amazon bubble, it's like 1984.  I can see the internet, but I can't go there.  Most annoying is this scenario:  I subscribe to Fubo TV.  So, it would be nice to access my DVR while traveling.  I can get on the internet and navigate to Fubo.tv, but the moment I connect, Fubo pops up their app redirect.  Fire doesn't support the app and I can't get past the pop-up.  My second beef... You want to listen to music?  You'll be hounded to upgrade to a paid version of Amazon Music.  I picked a ""highly rated"" but unfamiliar media player from the app store but quickly discovered that, while it works fairly well, it has no ""close"" button.  Try as I might to navigate out of the player ended with utter frustration.  Now I just restart the tablet.  So, while it operates perfectly as a reader, I already have a Kindle and didn't want another one."
"Everything works as advertised just not 100% of the time which, for the price, isn't a bad deal. If you're looking for a seamless experience I'd recommend investing in a more expensive device. I wanted to get an iPad mini but couldn't bring myself to cough up hundreds.- Native app functionality: 2/5Things never seem to work the first time, the first click, etc. The most simple tasks have to be done 3-5 times to go through at worst, 50/50 at best. That stinks. This has been my experience from unboxing through the latest firmware update. My WiFi is very fast and I don't have issues on literally any of my other devices. I have these issues when everyone is asleep as well as during peak use. Pretty sure its the Fire 8, not me.- Size/feel: 5/5. Perfect in this regard. I dig the plastic as well. I did not want a glassy/luxury-feeling device. Not too big to feel clumsy but large enough that I don't want to switch over to my iPhone out of frustration. I also feel like the base model is sturdy enough that I'm not missing a case, which can cost almost as much as the device if not more.Display: 4/5- Punches way above its weight but the blue light filter is lacking. It isn't a very sophisticated filter so much as a hamfisted orange overlay. But, again, the tablet is less than $100.Overall I'm happy with the purchase but I'm also a frugal FIRE-r so your mileage may vary.P.S. bring back 3.5mm headphone jacks as with this device. We didn't need to get rid of them, there are so many other things in tech that need rethinking."
"I had high hopes for this tablet. Unfotunately im a little dissapointed. I bought it mostly for reading because i was tired of the kindle paperwhite small screen. I do have the 2018 fire 8 so have something to compare. Anyway, after doing all the settings and getting down to reading i see that at the bottom of the screen there is under the glass a stain. I would look as if a very diluted lemon juice was spilled and smadged. Its faint, but it is very disturbing to read. On top of that, it looks like that faded light cream color is seen all around the white page when in reading mode. Looks as if its a bit unclean. Almost like a paper was left in the sun and the edges faded to cream color. I tried changing the background color but i dont like it.Hopefully with time i will get used to it and will ignore it. Quite a dissapointment. The 2018 seems just a bit better overall.8.21.2020 after two months of using TWO new tablets i come across a new issue: lately when i buy a few (5-7)  books on kindle unlimited and i go to the kindle app on each of the new tablets, the app opens but does not show the list of my books, it jumps back to the home screen. It happens on both tablets. I try to press the download feature quick to avoid the jump back but it doesnt help. It goes back to home page. I try othr things but to no avail. It alway jumps back to home page.This tablet has a problem thats for sure, a problem with software!!!!!I have TWO new tablets and i cannot get into my library. It is the only reason i bought these tablets, for reading. Im so angry.!!!7.23.2020I just got my second new fire 8 tablet. Comparing it with the one i bought 2 months ago i can see one big difference. The tablet's  screen brightness is not the same. In the new one the light is more faded, less bright. A bit like old paper. Both are on full battery and full brightness. Not very happy to see such a difference between two new tablets of the same model.Shame on the manufacturing."
"I got a new KIndle and sent it back because the sound does not work with any speaker device when using the text to speech feature. (it turns off every few seconds for quite a long time, i.e.,  plays three seconds, turns off for 20 seconds, but the book keeps advancing, so you miss vast chunks of the book! You miss way more than you hear!)  I got my replacement Kindle, and it STILL doesn't work! Not only that but compared to my old KIndles (this is my 5th!)  the maximum volume is way lower than it used to be. So I need a speaker more than ever to use this text-to-speech feature. I've tried with several devices, and it doesn't work with any of them including my Airpods and my Bose speaker. I use this feature every day! I play the audio on the books while I shower, do the dishes, fold laundry, clean, cook, go for a walk, and do all kinds of daily things. This way, I don't feel deprived of reading time while staying on top of chores and activities.  Now, thanks to some change in the Kindle, I can no longer do this. I haven't tried it with paid audiobooks yet, but I always use the text-to-speech feature to do it, and that is no extra charge over and above the cost of the books. I read several books per week and cannot pay for audio on all of them; I like to have the actual text to READ rather than listen, too!WHY AMAZON?  I'm sure it all comes down to being able to make more money, regardless of what the issue is, it is surely an issue that leads to more profit with the new Kindles made this way.  I can't even use the text to speech without the speakers because the volume is so low now compared to older Kindle models!  I can't hear the speech over the sound of the water if the kitchen sink water is running at barely more than a trickle. That's how bad the new volume is. I'm so upset that Amazon has now cheated me out of this simple pleasure and, no doubt, for profit reasons. There is no other reason for this. Either they're trying to discourage using the free text to speech feature, or they are making the Kindle's more cheaply and have ruined the sound quality in the process."
"The screen is clear and the response time is reasonably good. However this reader is no where near as good as the Kindle Fire I bought in 2012, which still works. This one is much harder to navigate. The functionality is not nearly as good as the old one, though the battery life is better and the screen is larger. Also, for some reason, after a year it suddenly quite connecting to the internet. I tried everything, but no luck. I searched online for suggestions. Tried them all. Still doesn't work. I cannot download all the books I previously purchased, so I now read them on the old 2012 Kindle. Very disappointing."
"I bought one of these recently for our 2 year old daughter to use during road trips.  I preload some of her favorite cartoons and some learning games before we go on the trip.  For the price, it's a good tablet for her.  I didn't want anything expensive, and we got the warranty on it really cheap, so should it break, we are covered.Now for the performance.  It seems to work fine, but if you start doing multiple things on it, or try to zip around on it, it gets slow and sluggish.  We have owned various fire tablets over the years and this seems to be a common thing among them all.  Even through these are much newer models than the one we had years ago, they still have that same sluggishness.  It might be the OS or it could just be the cheaper ram or cpu they use to have such low costs.  But for the price, you can't really expect the performance of some expensive Samsung tablet or something, so it's understandable.  For kids, or light usage, they are a pretty great value."
"This is my third Kindle Fire (not including exchanges for defects or repairs) and 6th Kindle over all. After about 2+ years they wear down so I thought I’d purchase another (recently bought my husband his 1st Kindle, same generation). I’m disappointed that I cannot turn off the sleep timer. It continues only to 30 minutes. I use the text to speech frequently due to my daughter being at home and of course distance learning. Listening is great while doing chores around the house and driving distances. This bothers me as I prefer to focus on my driving and not fiddle trying to restart my Kindle.  The new Kindle crashes frequently. The screen will turn to black and I cannot reboot. Frustrating and disconcerting to say the least. I try to make a habit, after reading forums on the battery power, to turn off my kindle as opposed to just letting it sleep as I have my previous Kindles. Nope. Doesn’t help thus far. I’ve begun to listen to my small library of Audible books so that I’m not countering the kindle shutting down on me. Audible is expensive so I use my credits sparingly. With the amount that I read/listen to, it’s great that I can access a vast amount of books on Kindle Unlimited. Love it!  However, again the frequent shut downs disrupts the flow. I’m also experiencing difficulty with the Audible app. One book in particular from my library will not download onto the new Kindle. It continues to tell me either to upload new updates or to upload via the app. I’ve done both. Also followed the troubleshooting instructions to no avail. I’m hoping this just a defective device.Yep, I’m frustrated. Not a happy camper with my new Kindle Fire.The one thing that is impeding my return is that I purchased a new case (no problem with an exchange of the Kindle) but I also added a protective screen guard which is money wasted if I have to do this all over again. Oh and don’t get me started on the charging cords which are no longer the android of old cords. I have a dual pack in my Amazon cart with a longer reach for my bedside reading."
"I am very concerned. After purchasing multiple Kindles over the last 10 years (I think I'm on #10), the last 3 have caused significant issues. Amazon completely replaced the one Kindle three years ago with a kiddie version. That seemed to work well until it didn't about 2 years later. So, last year (2021) I purchased a Fire HD 8. No problems until last week (week of July 18th). Now I have a ""moisture"" problem with the USB charging port. How that happened is a complete mystery. No liquid at all around the device. Perhaps the change from a humid environment to an air conditioned one.Watch out!!! Once this issue arises, there is nothing that can be done. I've followed the instructions to no avail. You can't charge the Fire HD. There is an irritating warning beep. The website warns that trying to continue to charge is dangerous with potential permanent damage. I've turned the stupid thing upside down (as instructed and as if that is the problem), shook it, let it sit for days, tried different cords, tried wiping it with a cloth, tried blowing it with a hair dryer, tried changing environments, tried looking up online. Absolutely nothing!Complaints online say this is a real issue which Amazon refuses to fix. The device is completely useless - refuses to charge. Now, what do I do? Call Amazon and complain? I don't have a lot of hope in Amazon and Kindle now. We have over 500 books we've bought over the years. Buyer beware!"
"I received my Kindle Fire 8 on Feb 6 and I'm returning it today, the 8th. I bought it because my Kindle Paperwhite can only read out loud with Bluetooth earphones or the car which works sometimes. The Fire 8 can use regular earphones so I bought it.  The many downsides of this Kindle 8 far exceeds the minor irritation that Bluetooth earphones cause me. So, yesterday I was trying to read a Kindle text to speech book on my new Kindle. I would get it to start reading but if the Kindle is tilted slightly it tells you that it's repositioning the screen, which makes it stop reading so you have to start all over with trying to get it to read. I turned off the repositioning screen option. At some point I touched the screen and brought the book to chapter 49 when I was reading page 11. It took a while to figure out how to get back to the beginning. Then I was listening for few minutes and, poof, the book goes into lock screen. So I would have to start over. I find there is no way to turn off lock screen and the longest you can set it is 30 minutes. A lot can happen in that 30 minutes, such as my Kindle realized that it can't connect to WIFI. I'm in my car so no, it can't connect to WIFI but it likes to remind me every few minutes, which turns the reader off and I have to start over. But I was driving so I had to wait until I got home. My internet was down when I got home so my kindle couldn't connect to WIFI still. It had to remind me. I was going to listen to my story until I fell asleep so I turned the WIFI off in options and turned reader back on. 30 minutes later, poof, it went to lock screen. I was done. It's going back today. It does not in any way add to my enjoyment of reading. I still don't know what a ""waypoint"" is but it tells me I have four or more on my book screen, covering some of the text. I do wish Amazon would bring back the original Kindle text to speech reader."
"I got a new Kindle fire HD eight for Christmas. I liked the applications and it is good for what I was looking for. After having it for a few days I decided to charge it. I plugged it in with the cord and charger that came with it and when I came back a couple hours later the percentage charge had not changed. There was an error code in the settings under battery that said battery plugged in but not charging. I tried changing cords I tried changing chargers I tried changing electric outlets but nothing worked. I googled the problem and found out that many others have had similar problems with their fire HD tablets.  After watching a few videos I was able to reset my Kindle and it did start charging again. I hope this will not be an issue. I will update again if it is but this is not what one should expect from a brand new tablet. If it wasn’t for this issue I would probably have given it a five star review. However, I will need some time to see if this is going to be an problem. I’m disappointed.Update. So far I haven’t had any more charging problems with my kindle. I would upgrade the product to 4 stars."
"On the plus side, this is a pretty good improvement over the previous generation. You get a bump in the Android OS. Bluetooth audio works much better and battery life is greatly improved. So there's a bunch of stuff to like.Some of the problems, however, make it almost useless if you plan to use the tablet with Audible. If you don't care about Audible, it's a good upgrade.The problem with Audible is that it takes FOREVER to download a book. At about 10MB/min a book can take 30 minutes in the low fidelity mode. The problem is you have to keep messing with the screen, otherwise it goes to sleep, kills the download, and you have to start all over again. Some of that can be mitigated by changing the screen sleep to 30 minutes, but there are plenty of books that won't download in 30 minutes.This problem exits on two different HD 8's on two different accounts. This problem doesn't exist on any other device connected to the same Wi-Fi access point. The only way I have found to fix the problem is to reset to factory defaults, sign in again to your Amazon/Audible account then immediately download everything you want to listen to. They will download nice and fast. When you quit using the tablet, it will automatically ""upgrade"" Audible to the new, fancy version of the app (which you cannot downgrade or uninstall independently) and you're back to the slow downloads.For reasons I don't understand, the Audible app works the worse on the Fire devices. It has been problematic for years through various updates and on different versions of the Fire tablet. By contrast, Audible works just fine on my iOS devices through Echo, or via the web browser. So if you're planning on using this table with Audible, look somewhere else.I would normally rate this tablet at 4-5 stars. It's not an iPad but then again it doesn't have the iPad price. But a key built-in feature is just plain broken and broken so badly that it hints at poor testing and software development. For that reason, I give it a one.I'll check back should the situation improve. I've had messages going back and forth about this problem over the last month, so I am actively trying to find a resolution. But so far the responses have been formularic and have not helped. Maybe this review will get some attention applied to the Audible problem once and for all. (One can always hope.)"
"So I had a couple of Fire tablets 5-6 years (?) ago, and while the hardware has good, the OS and specifically the app shop is (sorry Amazon) really bad. I couldn't find anything in their shop, so I did the silde-loading Play Store trick, and that made it passable, but it was still clumsy.  Had to update Play Store and Services manually, and the home page was like a straight jacket.So I decided to give it another shot, and I'm sorry to say, it still hasn't changed.  If you're looking to play games, there's a decent selection of those, but even there, they are mostly kid games.  I like playing adult board games, and many of them have an on-line version in the Play Store. Not a sniff of them in the Amazon app store.  Then there are things like MyChart to follow your health, tons of financial apps, news apps, etc.  The selection is really minimal (interestingly, they did have the Discover bank app, but you couldn't open it; I had to eventually get it through the Play Store). Mostly infantile games and books, which they want to sell you.  If that's what you're interested in, it's a good tablet (although still locked down on the interface). I had to download the Play Store just now, and it seems to be working OK, but it was working well at the start 5-6 years ago also, and it had more issues as it aged.  The interface isn't a big deal, but never recommend this to someone who's looking for a general purpose tablet, regardless of the price, due to the horrible app store.  Maybe I'll try again in 2027?"
"I chose this one over the Samsung A 8. I just liked the feel better and the way the words looked on the screen and it was a little brighter. I have old eyes, so I need all the help I can get.I primarily needed an e-reader and for this, it is pretty good. I also use it to scroll Facebook and check emails. I have AOL. You cannot use AOL with any of the email apps for this device. The only way to check AOL email is by using the web browser. Apparently their servers are too different and I would assume that it will never be fixed.The worst thing about it is the fact that they put a button for device manager in the corner on the nav bar. This is for like if you want to turn lights on and off using Alexa. They put it right in the corner where your thumb would go when holding it, so whatever you are doing, this device manager screen opens up because you can't help but touch it. I reached out for support and they said they really appreciate my feedback. It is a new button and there is no way to get rid of it, but they will keep it in mind for future updates.There is no Google Play app. You can get it, but you need to go online and download like 4 different things to get it. Amazon is so proprietary that they don't want you using anything that they can't monetize. The Amazon apps are not great. Libby is the app that I use for library books. You can't get that on the Amazon apps. You also need to download Google Play to get any of the Google apps like Gmail, etc.The ads are also super-annoying. You need to pay $15 to do without them.The pros are that it is a little more inexpensive than other devices and except for these annoyances, it is a pretty decent device. I really wish that they would get rid of that stupid device dashboard button."
"I got this because updated apps would not work on my old tablet, also other features were no longer working properly (because of site & software changes), and the battery was weak in the old fire tablet.  What I like about the new one is all that stuff is better now.  What I don't like is that the physical size of the new tablet is just a little smaller and it will not work in my case with the Bluetooth key board I use and of course all the buttons are in different places.  Also there is this GIANT advertisement on the home screen (I call it the Continue/Discover Bar) that I hate and it seems there is no way to turn it off.  I will probably live with the shortcomings of my old tablet and just plug it in if this thing on the home page cannot be resolved.Amazon Customer service has an Excellent Tech Dept. for Fire.  They helped me resolve the Cont./Discover Bar issue.  The Physical size thing I will have to live with..."
"At the time of this writing, this is the only tablet available in this price range. It's fine for what it does. I don't like that the battery is hardwired meaning that when it burns out, you can't replace it easily. Also, Amazon, in their infinite arrogance, defaults to an Internet homepage that is standard for their Silk browser and there is no mechanism to designate your own, preferred homepage. There is a way around this, but you should be allowed to set a homepage of one's own choosing. Also, Amazon does not provide users with Google Play Store where the vast majority of Android apps reside. Again, there is a way around this, but it's far, far more complicated than the workaround for the homepage issue.  Furthermore, since Fire runs the Amazon version of Android, there is no guarantee that Android apps from Google Play Store will work. Having said that, I have not run across  any such problems. I greatly preferred the versatility of the Barnes & Noble Nook, but they no longer produce a tablet in this price range, at least not right now. If you're on a budget like me, you're kind of stuck, but overall, if you can get past Amazon's hubris, it's not a bad tablet at all."
"I like how I can play downloaded games, listen to downloaded music and (possibly; have not tried it yet) watch downloaded videos without being connected to the Internet. That said, I have three issues:1. I apparently cannot set previously connected Bluetooth devices to connect automatically [when they are powered on and Bluetooth is enabled], which is a bit of a hassle with my headphones and keyboard. The worst is when the keyboard automatically disconnects after a period of inactivity.2. I need to email documents to myself from my laptop to access them on my tablet, since items copied to the SD card from my laptop I cannot open on my tablet. Unfortunately, most Microsoft Word documents download to my tablet in read-only mode, and I cannot switch to edit mode. (I have yet to try password-protecting the files before the fact.)3. Persons I know have tablets that can get all sorts of cool games on them, like a Spiderman game (where he runs, sidesteps, jumps and collects things), a Sonic game (similar to the Spiderman game, where he can jump to avoid obstacles and summersault to destroy enemy robots) and a Star Wars Rebels game (side-scrolling with character select). I can get neither these nor Plants vs Zombies, which I really looked forward to playing; I later learned that this last one currently has no 10th-generation Fire port."
"This is my third Kindle - very disappointed with it. Battery life is great, screen quality is also great. Here's what's wrong with it:*Music player doesn't work correctly. It will stop playing songs on my playlist for no reason. It won't remove songs from the playlist at times, and also sometimes won't remove them from my device when I request.*Won't normalize volume like it's supposed to. I've turned it on and off multiple times and it isn't working. I have to adjust the volume manually all the time (except when I'm asleep!)I bought this in June 2020 and wanted to use it for a while before I reviewed it. If I could go back to using my previous one (can't remember which it was, maybe a Kindle 7?) I would, except it had battery issues after many years of use. I would return it but it's too late now. Besides, I have all the songs I want on it, in playlists, that took me forever to set up.I don't know if I'll ever buy another Kindle.*When I set my playlist to Shuffle/Repeat it wouldn't do it. Lately though, it seems to have overcome that. I play music all night while I sleep and I would wake up to no music.*Doesn't add recently downloaded books to my home page. Even though I'm actively reading them. I can't find a way to manually move them there, either. Very annoying - I want my active books on the home page."
"UPDATE 08/30/22I ordered the ""all new"" HD 8 tablet on September 7 2020.  One week before the 2 year anniversary of that purchase the battery stopped charging.  The tablet is dead.  I won't be buying another kindle fire hd of any size unless they reduce the price to around $20 and maybe not even then.  I'm off now to look at Apples and other,  genuine,  android tablets where I can get the google apps I like.Let me say first that I bought this tablet because the battery on my 2011 Fire HDX (gen 1) was finally running out of steam.  Until this last week,  I rated the all new 2020 Fire 8 a solid 3-star device.  It was OK, but inferior in every way to the gen 1, 7"" HDX except possibly for the sound.I use the fire tablets almost exclusively for searching the web and reading books. My rating of a solid 3 stars gave way to a negative 5 this week when the internet on the fire 8 began to freeze.  I would open tabs, but then could not close the open ones and could not open new tabs.  The only way to stop the freeze was to shut down and reboot.  I tried to empty my search history, etc., but it would not even do that.  Every time I pushed the clear button it pitched me back to a list of visited sites that I could not delete.  This tablet is inexpensive for a reason: it doesn't work very well.So, no, I absolutely do not recommend this ""all new"" 2020 fire 8 tablet.  Nor can I recommend the Amazon ""tech"" support people.  I spent close to two hours on the phone with them today and all they did was make things worse.After talking to a clueless amazon ""tech"" support person and pushing all the buttons she could think to push, she said the only solution was to deregister.  Which I did.  This, of course, made everything worse.  All the internet bookmarks I had spent years building on my HDX  and which had been imported to my fire 8 after I purchased it were no where to be found on my ""all new fire 8"".  I was told by a secod amazon ""tech"" support person that they could not be imported from my HDX  even though they had been imported to the fire 8 soon after I purchased it."
"I just received my fire tablet From QVC because it was on sale for half the price. Will you get what you pay for. It did not come with any instructions on how to use it, and it is not Intuitive like a regular android tablet. The touch screen Is very unresponsive, I have to keep hitting the screen Is very unresponsive, I have to keep hitting the screen of times before Is very unresponsive, I have to keep hitting the screen Multiple times before it responds. I tried taking a picture of a beautiful sunset, And none of the colors showed up. Very disappointed. I also cannot find a help button or menu. To address problems or make adjustments. The settings menu is very limited as to what you can actually change or adjust. I only paid $44 for this so It's not worth the time or expense to return it to QVC.  If I bought it on amazon on, I  would definitely return it."
"This is a nice tablet. But unfortunately you can't have anything associated with Google on it. As an android user, this is a big negative as the apps and games aren't as good."
"Saw this device on sale so took the plunge. Granted it's a sub-$100 device so not much expectation. I had installed Google Play Store so that I can play some games as my ipad mini 2 needs to retire from 7 years of service as the battery doesn't last over 3 hours.To my surprise, the same games were loading/running at the same speed as my ipad mini 2. I was hoping for a faster load time experience but no such luck. At least the games don't crash as often as the ipad. It could be the android vs ios platform as well. To give a perspective, iphone 11 loads the game in 12 seconds whereas this kindle fire 8 takes 26 seconds to load.I also compared speed with the 2017 Fire HD 10"" and load times were about the same for the same apps.PROS:- low price - I didn't even buy a screen protector for the device- Amazon apps run fine (kindle books, video, shopping)- USB-C charging - finally don't have to look at the charging port to make sure to stick in the cable in the correct direction- microsd expansion- allows you to install Google Play Store- good battery life (lasts all day)CONS:- screen resolution is not full HD so you do see the pixels- extreme slow speed when running Google Play Store apps"
"Runs slow, lags and glitches, has a mind of its own sometimes being all over the place, some games came be played on them, but we make do for the price!"
"I purchased this product on a deal and at first left it in the box. I had a vacation coming up that I planned to use for watching movies on an upcoming trip a couple months later. I opened the device and set it up and the device worked flawlessly... for 4 whole uses! The device was used for initial set up, a drive up north, a drive back home, and a week later I downloaded a few apps because my phone had broke. That night I attempted charging the device and the device would state it was charging, however in the morning to my surprise it was now at only 10%. I restarted the device and tried another charger.  I checked the device an hour later and now it was at 7%. I reached out to Amazon and since I was out of warranty they would do nothing other than offer me 15% off a refurbished device.  I can say in the past I have owned other Kindles for my daughter. Every single one I have owned quickly has problems charging. Without a doubt I can say I will NEVER waste another dollar on a Kindle device. They have the same problem time and time again and Amazon does nothing to support it's customers in the replacement of a faulty device. This device was used by an adult and has not one flaw to the screen, charging port, etc. I am meticulous with my devices and always only use the original charger for them. I cannot recommend a device that after 4 uses will no longer charge - this device has a USB-C port so it is impossible to connect it improperly.  I will update this review when I receive my replacement cell phone to take pictures of my device and show how it was without flaw. I hope that this saves another customer $89 on a wasted device!"
"The perfect tablet for a toddler, resolution could have been better."
"I paid over a hundred dollars for this Kindle a little over a year ago. Now it's not charging. The support on the device ended. I had my other Kindle for seven years without issue and paid a third of what I spent on this one. Has the device been great? Yes, I read almost every day. However, in the past month it has started to not charge right. I used another cord with no luck. I tried both cords on another Kindle I have and that Kindle charges just fine. It's the device. I won't buy another expensive Kindle again-- spending over $100 for it to not work in a year. I'm not happy that it isn't working just after the warranty goes out and there's no support left for me on the device. Even my Nook, which I've had since they first made them over a dozen years ago or more still works!! It's ridiculous!!"
"Bought in March, Didn't even last a year. Tablet won't charge or turn on. Can't return it on had to April 6th to return. So my nephew don't have a tablet bought for his birthday.  I guess I'll be buying him a new one for Christmas but not this one again! If I can give 0 stars I would!!!"
Never last long but it cute
The frog is not a case the tablet doesn’t come out of it. I thought it was a bumper case on the tablet but the frog IS the tablet. One drop and it’s over for this thing.
Don't stay charge
"This product is essentially an android tablet with a software for kids installed. Your kid(if smart enough) could get off that software and do as they please with the tablet. The restrictions on the tablet are plenty and there are parental codes to keep you off the rest of the tablet. There are also subscriptions that you may need to sign up for, which seems unfair. The product did what it advertised but needs to be polishedEdit: the screen now has a weird mark that looks like there is moisture trapped underneath it. When I push the stand back in place it adds much pressure to the screen which can cause damage to it."
"It's a tablet for younger kids , claims it has pre downloaded learning content for kids that's absolutely a lie , it has pre downloaded apps for learning that need wifi too work, only thing she can do without wifi is play in the art and crafts app .... sorry even with parents controls I will not allow my 4yr to play on something that relays on wifi. I was expecting a learning tablet with off line learning apps and games for a child under 5yrs. Complete waste of money for me . Seriously if I wanted something like this I could've went n bought a normal goggle tablet and just set up parent control on it it would be the same thing 🤦🖕 I'm calling customer service tomorrow asking for a return of the $$$ no where in the description did it say u have to use WiFi to operate everything on this ""kids learning tablet"" just another china brain washing machine here.  I personally expect a learning tablet for kids under 10 to completely be off line capable of doing anything on it...who in their right minds allow their younger kids to play online 👌 if I cant send it back it'll be in the trash tomorrow"
"Runs pretty slow.. works. But, slow"
This tablet is a less expensive alternative for little kids. The battery life is great but prepare to have a time trying to connect to the internet constantly.
Doesn't last long and gets hot when charging
Battery life quickly dies. I guess you get what you pay for...
The battery didn't seem to keep a charge.... 3 months use and this is where we are at. 🥴
I did not get the opportunity to open this product until today just to make sure it works before giving to my granddaughter for Christmas.Unfortunately I'm outside the return window only to discover that Google play store crashes every time rendering this product just about unusable to install apps.
Hard time setting it up due to the tablet will not let change parent code or pull down task bar to finish the set up.  Look online for help at this time could not find anything.
"Bought for my son and it was super slow to get on the internet & open tabs (my internet is fast so not sure what the heck the problem was) I returned this because it’s battery life was around 30 minutes. If my son watched 10 minutes of cartoons & I went to use it again the next day, it would be dead. Just annoying for me personally. Was really cute though and perfect size."
"Was a cool little tablet, though it did have a bit of lag right out of the box. Unfortunately, after 3 weeks of use, the battery stopped holding a charge so it is now broken and useless and my son is pretty disappointed. I would recommend just springing for the Amazon Fire kids tablet because my daughter has had one of those for three years and they are basically indestructible."
The product stopped working after 2 months of owning and barely any usage.  Contacted Support and nobody was able to help.  I got bounced back and forth between departments with nothing to show for it.  They said to just return it and get a refund instead of fixing or sending me a new one. DO NOT BUY.
So I got a pink one and green. The kids opened them at the Same time and all that but hours later when it was time to charge both  the green one isn’t charging that well and these were Christmas gifts. Straight up. I don’t recommend these tablets. They are very small also and when you go to add your WiFi it states a Chinese symbol wiFi already stored. So Beware
The touch screen stopped working after 30 days to return
I bought 2 of these tablets and within 2 months they stopped charging
"Don’t waste your money, been dropped a few times and now it’s broke. Very cheaply made."
Not a satisfied customer
This hasn’t even lasted 2 months and won’t even turn on. We’ve charged it and still nothing! Waste of money
PLEASE JUST SPEND A. LITTLE MORE MONEY AND GET SOMETHING THAT WORKS. THIS JUST SHOW PICTURES AND A LOT OF NITHING. TOTAL REGRET.
"We tried for a whole week but it was too slow, difficult to use even for myself, even tho I consider myself a tech savvy lol"
Don’t recommend it It won’t charge no more
The picture quality is horrible. It goes from fully charged to dead in an average of 30/45 minutes. I bought this for my grand daughter and she became so frustrated with the tablet she has lost all interest in it.
"I Used it one time, it turned off and never turned on again . Too late for a return"
"I received the item quickly however, it has a scratch on the camera and it doesn't charge.  Such a waste of money. Stop selling people second hand items ! I wish I could give this 0 stars"
Broken the rubber is too thin and can’t protect the tablet itself
With in 2 minutes of me turning on device to set up for my child screen started bugging out and everything is now backwards
The worst tablet ever returning it
It makes me factory reset it all the time for no reason. And it barely charges :(
Just 1 week.... even free it's expensive...
"I got this for my nephew and we were pretty excited about it. We are not super familiar with tablets so I guess we expected it to do more. You'll need to spend money to get more things. And now after a couple months it isn't working well at all. This might be user error or product error so I am reviewing this in the middle. If other reviewers start to mention that it doesn't work after a couple of months, then you'll know it's a widespread problem."
"This worked well enough at first, although the battery wouldn't hold a charge for very long. Now, 4 months after purchase, it won't charge at all. I have a very disappointed 3 year old on my hands :( I would not recommend anyone purchase this, even though the price may look appealing."
"Kids Tablet 7 Inch Tablet for Kids 32GB Toddler Tablet Free Kids Software Installed, Kids Learning Android Tablet with WiFi YouTube Parental Control for Toddlers Boys Girls Childrens TabletThis is a really cute tablet and easy to use.  It is surprisingly fast once you set it up and the connection is rather good using WiFi.  The screen is not the greatest and you have to angle it directly in front of you to get the best view which a child will refuse to do. The screen scratches so easily that just a few uses and it looks bad."
"I loved my first Fire tablet, an HDX that I purchased in 2013.  It was lightweight, and pretty sleek, and it had a higher DPI screen.  It operated on the older carousel style interface, where my most recently accessed content was displayed first, regardless of what type of media (book, audio book, file transfered by email address). Every thing was pretty quick to load. I could organize into collections, but I didn't have to wait for each media section to load (because recently accessed stuff was front and center.  Then, Amazon started to keep up with other Android trends.  Everything became more like an app, with a sort of tabbed content for that type of media (book, audio book, music, ect.).  To open ebook, you have to activate the Kindle app icon, and wait for it to load.  Or, do the same thing with the Audible app.  Even on this new Fire, it can take several minutes for my music content to load, and come up on the screen.  I see the blue whirl of world wide wait ""loading"" more than I'd like.  Even with some of the shorter MP3 ""albums,"" like Metallica's Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning, there can be quite a wait for it to load.  If I'm trying to load one of the large classical music sets, like 99 Mozart classics, snoozeville for the loading time.  For whatever reason, a lot of icons for my books are blank white, and not selectable.  Almost like the image cache is corrupt and needs to be recompiled.  And, I have a very good internet connection.  It's really frustrating, because the Kindle Fire was my first modern tablet device, and I loved that first one so much.  I think it was the last year Amazon produced the HDX model.  I like this tablet it's a big improvement over my 2016 midrange version  (I don't remember the name for that class).  It's a big improvement on my two 2019 basic $50 models that I sometimes pack around, and sometimes do...precarious...stuff with (I really can't play music on the 2016 or 2019 models anymore).  However, I just am not head-over-heels in love with it.  And, I really wanted to be that crazy about it.  It's a good device, for the price.  However, I'm underwhelmed with the ability to access my Amazon content on it, particularly when it comes to the ease, and speed of doing so.  I think a big part of the issue is treating each media type ecosystem as an app. Select the icon, and wait for that app interface to load.  Then, choose which item you want to open within that app. I think the previous carousel idea was much less convoluted.  I can't say it's a regrettable purchase, because I do have a substantial amount of Amazon digital content.  Amazon devices are all I've had, until fairly recently.  I just want to access my content more easily and quickly, without any drama.  Especially my bigger musical collections with 99 or more tracks.  Please, Amazon, do better.  I honestly think it can be done.Update:  I will say that the stand-by time, time between charges, is impressive, when in limited use.  Especially if you close out apps, and re-start the tablet (before you put it away for a few days.  And, it keeps a charge really well if you're just doing a few simple tasks every day.  Say just a couple web searches, and a few e-mail checks (via webmail, not download client).  So there is a nice foundation here."
"PRICE POINT:The price point for a tablet of this caliber is very good considering it is a 64G.  Comparable units are either more expensive, have less clear screens and features, or are made of cheaper materials.  I recommend to make this a great product; a longer C cord and a protective Folio cover.  A c cord runs about $10 and folio $15-25.13 HR BATTERY LIFE:  *FAIL*  - can be solved with a new, longer C cord then it is VERY GOOD.2 new 64g tablets were bought for my kids just 2 weeks ago so they would have the best version with the most storage space.  The intended use is for entertainment and their school app.  I ensure they are charged fully daily, which takes a few hours.  They do about 1.5-2 hours on it before it dies from a fully drained battery.  They do not watch tv or Youtube on it, just access apps like school and a few game apps. This is a problem because they were bought because it said it has a 13-hour battery life, but it doesn't so I then have to have it spend 4 hours charging again so they can do more on it. This is an annoying big problem because we have to do school work on it that takes more than 1.5-2 hours in a day to do, which means they need to stop working on what homework they are doing and wait several hours to resume using it when the battery is recharged.  This doesn't do the job because of the poor battery life.  In the course of a day, the tablets each get charged 8 hours and get used under 4 hours if we don't use a longer cord and keep it plugged in during use.  Not a great thing if you need to use it on its own like it is intended or how the ad states you can for 13 hours.I did not care for fact I needed to get 10 ft C cords so it can stay charged while my kids used it.  The cord that comes with it is small, so much so that I can't plug it into a wall and have it rest on my desk.If you need this for games in the car, I recommend getting an auto charger with a very long C cord.If you need this to be charged more than 2 hours max, then get a very long C cord.  They make them in 10-foot range for like $10.IF you want to charge it then use it the next day, you need to turn it off first by powering down the unit. You cannot just turn the screen off to standby (not powering it down totally).  It will drain the unit.  Most tablets don't do this and actually have a longer standby battery life, which is why I mention this.  If you aren't gonna use it, just power it off is the point.PARENTAL CONTROLS:  *OK*I like the parental controls make it so kids cannot charge things on the tablet but even though I set it so they cannot download other game apps on it the tablet still allows them to.  Why add the feature and make us go thru the process of that setup if it doesn't work?  This is not a problem though because even if they download more game apps, they still can't charge any purchases.  I do have to go in there every few days to ensure I remove the ones I don't want them to have.  The directions how to setup the tablet for a child and block purchases, make account changes for the kids, and how to do things you want to is not clear at all.  I had to watch YouTube videos because instructions in and with the tablet were nonexistent or horribly unclear.GRAPHICS AND TOUCHSCREEN:  *VERY GOOD*The touchscreen is very responsive and the clarity is extremely clear for graphics.  It looks sharper than my 4k ultra HD TV and my Macbook.  I am very impressed with the graphics.SAFETY:The tablet is made less flexible than some, but still has a bit to it.  I would not own this tablet unless it was used with a protective cover you slide it into.  The one we have is very good and you can use it as a protective cover when closed or open and it props up too.  I very much recommend this case for this tablet.  It is made better than any other case I have tried.  It fits my iPad and my daughter's 10""kindle.  It is called a Fintie Folio Case for All-New Amazon Fire HD 10 and 10 Plus Tablet (13th/11th Generation, 2023/2021 Release) 10.1"""
"I shop 90-95% of purchases from Amazon. Seems obvious to go with their new fire tablet during a sale.Love/hateBIGGEST PROBLEM:I don't have any ""computer"" and survive on high end Chinese made ""Smart Phones"" under $200 using ANDROID (I have Android 13) along with more than a handful of still partially working or somehow can still use all the Chinese brands of my past.I am all AMAZON for shopping and ALL Google (biggest & free access to the world & www).Google's ""play store"" for Google apps and ALL APPS EXCEPT APPS THAT ARE EXCLUSIVELY FOR ANY/ALL AMAZON tablets etc ..Go all low end Chinese is better ..... Way better than thinking I or anybody could integrate Amazon and their proprietary app store.I can't take the endless ways of only partially getting the Amazon Tablet ""in sync with Google & all apps on planet earth that is only available to get & only available to use by with for The Fire Tablets.THE TABLET:A LOT OF PROS1. It's sold from & by Amazon meaning free & if necessary, super easy 30 return2. It's super lightweight but has an overall feeling of competent sturdy construction.3. THE PRICE (should be first pro it's so low versus whatever else is out there.4. I live by a dream, if more RAM models are available - always spend more it will make all the different. Only ""a dream"" I'm so poor, but Fire Tablet price so low I COULD CAN AND DID get the model with the extra ram5. It is a smooth quite impressive device. I'm NOT a techie. Won't give any of opinion that is based on specs and or performance.CONS:Endless and can't list eve a tenth of construction.BUT in short the inability to integrate with an Android phone using any version of the same app on both tablet & at same time or individually with future possible headaches from trying a manual syncing that always is never a complete full accurate sync.I think I am 4 days too late to just return it & go back to my ""not so smart"" phone for everything."
"This is my third Fire tablet and the worst one I have had. My first one just died one day. Number two fell on a tiled floor and cracked the corner of the cover. It works fine but when I got an offer to get a small refund for buying a new one I thought it sounded like a good idea. It came yesterday and I spent all day downloading apps, updating passwords, emailing myself notes from the Notepad app so I could copy them into the new app (it doesn't sync when you get a new tablet). Then last night I turned the tablet off because the new one does not work with the charging platform number two works with even though I thought I was getting the same thing. Then a while later I wanted to look something up on the internet and when I turned it on it would not accept my security pin number which is required for viewing saved passwords on web browser. I tried over and over and finally contacted phone support. The tech was very patient and we worked on it for an hour. We got it to accept the pin once but couldn't get back in after that. He finally said we would have to do a factory reset. My phone was losing its charge by then so I told him I could probably handle it from there. This morning it was done reseting and my apps were all there. Of course all my passwords the browser had saved were gone and all my notes from Notepad. I'll work on reseting them some other day. What really frustrates me is how sluggish the typing response is. It skips letters sometimes and when touching the page to turn it on the Kindle app it does not respond. My old Fire tablet, number two, works much faster. And there is a notification on my home page that I can clear. It says ""NEO delegate"". The tech didn't know what this is and could not clear it either. I wasn't going to add the security pin number afyer all the trouble we had last night but I was trying to set up a backup email account for gmail and needed to see the password I chose yesterday. You can't see the letters if you don't have the security pin number, so I entered it and hope it won't lock me out again in the future.Each time I have replaced  a Kindle or a Fire tablet in the past the new one was an upgrade. This Fire tablet is definitely not. I have sent my old one, number two, in for the refund that was offered and I tempted to just send this one back. I'm so fed up with it at the mom I'm not sure I can make a good decision so I'll give it another day. I deleted apps from tablet number two as I downloaded them to number three thinking I would be sending it in for the small refund so it has none of my apps or passwords on it and I'd have to download them all again. I just want to cry. Apple I-pad is sounding better every day. There is one for about the same price I paid for this one. I would not rec this model of Fire tablet.Update: After spending another hour on the phone with customer support we agreed it would be best to send this tablet back.  I cancelled the replacement tablet because I no longer trust this product."
"I have purchased 6 Fire tablets over the years. They have all been reliable workhorses and excellent devices for movies, music and media. I have used my Fire 8 for heavy work research and extremely active social media and blog posting. No, you can't use these devices to edit films or create graphic art like iPads, but you get a ridiculously great value for top notch media consumption and reliable performance for all web browsing.Until now.I am so disappointed in this version of the Fire tablet.  The audio is substantially worse than previous versions, including audio from plugged in headphones and earbuds, not just the device speaker.The performance SUCKS. I've had my device for only one day and I've had to reboot 6 times because Audible freezes and won't play. Audible!? Audible is a standard Amazon app that should be fairly bulletproof at this point in Fire tablet history.I also really dislike the new nightshade filter. The almost orange-brown hue of previous tablets actually worked to block blue light. Many of us with light sensitivity issues appreciated that old filter. Yes, it made the screen orange, but it also REALLY prevented eye strain. The new tablet is vaguely amber, similar to the Iphone night shade, and does nothing for my sensitive eyes, even when turned up to the max level.  Others likely find the new night shade appearance an improvement over the former orange screen, but I miss how soothing it was.The new Fire also has terrible connection to WiFi.  Nothing in my house has changed but unlike previous tablets this one can't stay connected.  I even sat right next to my WiFi hub, and the device kept dropping connection.I've noticed a lag when typing, too, that no other tablet had.If you have never owned be previous Fire tablst you might not notice the changes, but if you've loved your previous versions, dont get this ""upgrade.""UPDATE:It is not just my Fire 10 device.  I spoke with 2 friends who ""upgraded"" -- one for their children and one for an older mom.  The speakers and internal audio on all devices are USELESS.  Kids can't hear movies in the car and barely in quiet room unless right up against speaker. No headphones or ear buds can be turned up loud enough.  My friend's older mom with audiology-measured MILD hearing loss (no hearing aid required) can't understand language unless holding device speaker up to her ear, which negates how she wanted to use it for Alexa, Zoom calls and YouTube recipes in the kitchen.I still have a functional Fire 7. The speaker can be heard in the next room. The 8 I still have in my office is great for music and videos. Not as good as the 7, but still functional. Both Re on par with my iphone 14 and gaGalaxy phone speakers. To use the Fire 10 I and the two others I know with this version have to connect to external bluetooth speakers.Amazon devices keep getting shortchanged from their original offerings. My daughter's 7 year old regular kindle has better text visibility than my new one.  How much profit is enough, Amazon?The other bugs in the 10 continue to frustrate me. Audible  won't consistently work, the device crashes, text input often lags.Get the 8 instead! And hopefully Fire's next iteration won't suck.UPDATE May 19, 2024Ok, after numerous complaints,about the horrible audio from other friends, one suggested downloading a speaker booster app from the Amazon app store. Another one used an APK mirror site to download an Android equalizer/volume booster.  I chose the highest rated Amazon app store app. I can now hear everything perfectly through both both external speaker and headphones, equalling and even excelling the audio performance of the Fire 7 which has always been superior to subsequent models.  This tells me it is not a hardware issue but rather volume throttling in the Fire OS. WHY?!!!???My Audible app started working fine after the latest OS update last week, but keyboard lag and WiFi drop are still problems -- ones I have not had with my previous Fire tablets. Regarding WiFi, Amazon PLEASE allow Ethernet connection for future tablets!Anyway, a free app solved volume issues for me and several others, and OS update fixed Audible . At least I can use the tablet for audiobooks, music and movies now. Keyboard lag is still too irritating to use consistently for writing, web searching, social media, etc. YMMV.UPDATE July 12, 2024RIP crappy Fire tablet 10!  After a week of weird bugs—notifications I couldn’t dismiss, inability to open Audible books, inability to open library books in Libby, inability to open Kindle books, inability to play Prime videos, crashing Safari, freezing videos on Netflix, etc, etc, etc—I decided to do a factory reset and restore to backup.Guess what? I have been waiting 2 hours for the backup to restore. It is still at 0%. I GIVE UP.This is the WORST version of Fire tablet. Of my friends previously mentioned, 2 also had critical failures with their tablets that were similar to mine, and earlier than it happened to me.  I am so bummed out because I have loved all the other, now-obsolete Fire tablets.Several people have mentioned this on Amazon forums, and apparently the last OS update at the end of June is buggy, but now I have a brick and can’t even wait for the patch."
"This is my 3rd Fire 10 Tablet. They have a real sustainability problem and die before having them 3 years. Luckily it's not too expensive or I wouldn't bother. I'm already having to have this tablet replaced after less than a week, but Amazon's customer service was very helpful with it. Here's my thoughts in no particular order.1. Like the lilac color & that the covers have a translucent back.2. This tablet is nearly an 1"" smaller than my previous Kindle. Don't have a clue why, especially when tablets are now trending to 11"" because of the OS. Feels heavier, too.3. Because of the good deal on the 64MB, I purchased that and - finally - Kindle makes a bit more sense. With all of the bloatware you can't get rid of, especially the kid stuff when there is no kid in the house, I literally could only download a handful of apps. I can download so much more and still have room!4. The On/Off button has been moved to the left side. I don't get this. With the majority of people being right-handed, I don't understand why it was moved to where you have to reach across the tablet...especially if you want to take a screenshot.5. If you want to use the camera on the back, you'll have to remove the tablet from the cover. I can't recall where the camera was on the previous tablet because I didn't have a cover for it. Now, the lens is on the same side as the On/Off, which means when you fold back the cover, the lens is covered up! Who in the world didn't test this? The point of a cover is to make it easier to handle & provide some protection and in an action that literally is the riskiest move to make w/a tablet, Amazon has rendered either the camera useless, or the cover. I'd really like to know what they were thinking on this one.6. Battery life: Not good at all. Like I said, I've had 3 previous tablets - one 7"" and 2 10"" - and there's been a definite trend downward on battery life. I'm on it for several hours cumulative per day - playing a few apps, reading, ""X""...and I have to recharge at least once a day. It also feels like it takes a lot longer to charge than my previous tablet. I've had this plugged in for about 40 mins and it's gone from 13% to 28%. That's not great.7. A lot of apps are not longer viable. I don't think this is an issue with Amazon, just an issue with the new OS and developers not keeping up, so I'm guessing a lot of new tablets are having the same issues. Kinda sad. Some of these apps I've been playing for years and years!8. It took 10 days to arrive. I could have ordered some weird brand tablet and have it delivered literally that afternoon so I'm truly befuddled as to why ""2-day Delivery"" Amazon would force Fire purchasers to sit on their hands for that long. My tablet was in ""Order"" mode up until the evening before it was scheduled to be delivered. Why? We have a distribution center very near so...My mom has a Fire 10, I think 12th Gen, so I'll check this against hers, especially w/charging. Also, since my tablet appears to be defective, if this changes with the replacement, I'll update the review.  Again, this is just my thoughts on it and those things that bug me may not bug you!UPDATE: Amazon being Amazon. They lied. They won't ship it until Monday. So much for a responsive Customer Service. Removing a star."
I bought 2 of these 1 for myself & 1 my husband as they were on sale for $89.99 which was an amazing price. They arrived October 30th & I quickly set mine up. Worked well until the week before Thanksgiving. I suddenly had problems with my keyboard so I first tried going out of the app I was using & going back in... didn't work. I then tried restarting it only to have it turn back on with a black screen & something about a reboot in the lower left corner. I tried turning it off & back on only to have the screen come up totally black that time.  Contacted Amazon customer service via chat & it took them what seemed like forever for them to understand that I couldn't see anything on my screen. They then told me to hold down the power button & the low volume button at the same time which was supposed to bring up a different way to factory reset the pad. Nope didn't work. Thank goodness I was under warranty as they're sending me a new pad which is supposed to arrive today.Took an extra day but my replacement pad is finally here. Hoping it lasts longer than the last one.
"I decided to pay an extra $15 to get a tablet without lock screen ads, which was annoying. Performance is decent for the most part, and the screen resolution is good. The camera is ok, but if I want a quality photo, I'll use my phone.  The speech to text function is terrible. Rarely does it ever get the words right, it has a lot of hesitation and sometimes just never reacts to your voice. It also doubles the words for some reason. A lot of editing with speech to text. I was quite disappointed with the very limited selection of apps that are available for the Fire tablet. I still have to go to my phone for about 50% of my most used apps. It has the Facebook app but it only works in portrait mode, even though auto rotate works with all other apps, you can't view the Facebook app in landscape mode. It connects to my Bluetooth speakers easily and performs without hiccups. All the buttons and charging port are located on the top which I thought was kind of a weird placement. If I had to choose a tablet over again, I would probably avoid the Fire tablet, spend a bit more and get a Galaxy."
"My first Fire tablet gave up the ghost after 4 years. I put it away for vacation, and it wouldn't charge or turn on when I returned. I tried everything, including talking with Amazon support, all to no avail. The customer service rep did tell me about trading in the device for a new one, with a discount. That worked out very well, and I got a great deal.Now to my issues: it was hard to reproduce all my programs from my old tablet. I had to try 6 Spider Solitaires to get the one back I was used to. I can't get rid of Amazon Kids off the front page. My email that comes through the internet doesn't display the same, and I can't delete things without scrolling through pages to get to the bottom to see the delete key. There's no way to make that tool bar stay on the page. Every time I come back into the internet, it makes me refresh the page. The old tablet did none of these things. I had another talk with customer service, and the rep scrolled through my tablet with me (very helpful), but the final answer was Amazon did an upgrade, and all the rep could do was bring my customer complaint to management's attention. Also, there is no user manual (except the Hello pamphlet), and no one ever answers my questions on the user forums.If the email thing doesn't get fixed soon, I will slowly use this tablet less, and default to my laptop. It's great to play my Spider solitaire, see my other email, and read the paper, but having my primary email be uncooperative is a breaking point for me."
"I bought this for my elderly MIL so she could easily listen to audiobooks, play games, look through photos, read books in large font, and listen to music.  I needed the ability to make it very simple for her to use. 5 folders only into which I would add the photos, books, etc that I thought she would enjoy. I created a child account for her. Unfortunately there are apps on the home screen you can't get rid of. When I added games, the home screen became very cluttered. I discovered I am not able to create the 5 folders I want to organize content.  I could have created a folder called unused Apps and at least moved the unwanted ones into it so it didn't confuse her. I'm still trying to find ways to make this work for her and will experiment with the adult account but I think everything is way too complicated for her."
"I'm leaving this review in hopes it helps others before they buy it. I'm considering returning for a couple of reasons. I'm not a tech person and I don't need a tablet to do work on, it's just for pleasure. I have 3 shopping apps on my phone and my old Samsung tablet. Amazon, WalMart and Home Depot. I can't get 2 of the 3. I can't get certain games either. I want a tablet that I own and can do what I want with it. This isn't it. Amazon does control what you can and cannot do on this, which is not what I want. Simple. I'm still going to buy from both those stores amazon. You're just making me not want to buy as much from you!"
"I bought these for my elderly parents. I was trying to upgrade them in place of their old tablets. I did not realize Amazon Fire tablets required an Amazon account prior to having access to each tablet or it will continually remind you to register the tablet. This complicated things as my parents live with me and are on my account. When registering the tablets the tablets automatically connect to my credit card linked to my Amazon acct for all of the tablets pre-installed apps. I tried to disable the pre-installed apps so my parents wouldn't accidently purchase anything with my cc and the tablets won't allow you to disable them. I went onto Amazon and unchecked the one click purchase option, but my credit card  still shows up on those apps that I wanted to delete or it will require a different credit card before it allows you to manually remove mine. The home page is complicated and the app store does not allow you very many options for the launcher. The tablets' preinstalled keyboard has no lines and blends all the letters and numbers together which would be difficult for people with eye issues. I could not find any apps on their app store that would allow me to change the keyboard. (This all could be user error , but would also be complicated for someone who is not very good with technology like me). I bought both tablets new at the same time. Their boxes looked exactly the same, but the system setup was slightly different for each one. So one may have been resold. One had more options than the other so I software updated both to try and get them to be exactly the same and both tablets stated they were both up to date, but were still slightly different.  One had a minor scratch. One already had a ""French"" and ""German"" custom keyboard installed and had ""salli's"" voice chosen where as the other tablet had no options chosen. The tablet uses ""Silk"" system. I tried to download Google and Google Playstore as those are apps that we familiar with. The apps I tried to download, that my parents were familiar with, stated that they could not be uploaded. After several hours of trying to mess with both of them, I finally gave up. I am returning them and just going with the android or Samsung brand that we already arr familiar with where all Google apps will be preinstalled already."
"The tablet is very nice and fast, also light and easy to handle. The feature I purchased it for has been removed from the 13th generation, the ability to use it in show mode. The Library tab on the home screen is also missing.  I have ordered a older version (9th gen) for half the price that supports the  feature I desired.  I wish Amazon would disclose features that have been removed from products. I am thinking about returning the 13 gen as I do not need two tablets. I dislike returning products that are in good working order, but I was looking for that feature to be on the product I purchased."
"After researching tablets for a while I decided on another Fire. But this one had to have much better sound (as the other 2 Fires did not). I have had this tablet for under a week and on the first day I noticed, in the upper left corner with the time an app that said “NEO Delegate” and one other message.  For a brand new tables just a day or so old that should not be! So, I called Amazon for help to have these messages REMOVED. I called TWICE (2ce) the first cs person got rid of one of them but this “NEO Delegate” popped up again. So, I called back and the second cs person could not get rid of it, I suggested she get some help to do this as she could not fix this error in this tablet  She told me it was not bothering the working of the tablet ( I guess she did not know HOW to fix this error) she  also became irritated.  I explained to her I just purchased this Tablet, but she really did not want to be bothered.I am a Prime Member, which as we all know is not cheap and I also purchase Music Unlimited, also not cheap, but this does not bother Amazon and this is exactly the kind of treatment which looses customers.  I am pondering my Memberships now. Why pay for Memberships and New Tablets when Amazon does not care if their product work properly. This will be my last Fire Tablet.I recently had an operation on my eye so returning products is not an option as going to where ever to return a product is not presently in my activities.I will leave it at that, even though there is more… And will not purchase as much onAmazon any more.  The experience left me really let down and disappointed."
"A little different than I expected because I didn’t read the size measurements. My Fault! It’s pretty large. It can be a bit cumbersome to hold. I purchased to read books on Kindle, stream video, and most of all - to play Monopoly Go! I already have a kindle paperwhite, so didn’t really need this, but really enjoy this game while I am at chemotherapy for hours or waiting in doctor’s offices. It’s a good distraction. I didn’t realize it’s not connected to the Google Play Store. When I downloaded the Monopoly Go game, I discovered that there is no link to send to others to trade stickers or to connect and play with friends. That is the main point of the game for me! I tried to use the 2 methods it showed to add contacts because there was no link to send others like there is on a phone (my phone is too old, hence the kindle purchase). I sent to all contacts (yellow button with white phone) inputting my phone number multiple times and no one received the invite that lives in my home, or that I know including a chemo friend while we were both there and sitting side by side for a few hours each week after multiple attempts. I tried multiple times with other friends & at home with family also. I messaged support and they told me to connect to Facebook. I opened a Facebook account and sent friend requests. No link possible there either, no friends received requests even when I made a second Facebook account on a separate borrowed device, logged into MoGo and tried the process again. I messaged Scopely/MoGo support 3 times after installing FB, and they basically told me they already answered this, don’t message again. I googled this and it’s a common problem. I wish Amazon would fix this with Scopely because it made playing pointless. If I can’t trade stickers, I can’t finish the albums. Overall, I wouldn’t repurchase this. I would buy a cheaper tablet with access to the Google Play store. The touch screen can’t be adjusted and my touch is not working constantly as well, but I am losing my fingerprints due to cancer treatments, so I don’t know if that is a common issue. It’s hard to toggle between apps because you can only use an arrow at the bottom and that closes the apps I am trying to toggle between. The battery life is good. It’s a bit slower than my phone and doesn’t pick up wifi as well. The appearance is nice, seems high tech when looking at it. It does stream well from Hulu and Prime. Readability is nice, but I wish I could lower the brightness more at night."
"It's a good tablet its not expensive but not worth it overall. I cant download any apps I would normally get on Samsung or Apple devices. Investing, banking, shopping, and food apps none are on the amazon app store.It also costs 15 bucks to get the ads removed, the tablet is like a giant amazon advertisement. I do have prime video, audible, Kindle so it's nice to have that right there, but the rest of the stuff can't be removed and just in the way.I will never purchase another amazon tablet unless I can get all the major apps I would need."
"This tablet has an excellent viewing area. The sound is amazing. It is very fast and very easy to use. There is only one problem. I purchased the recommended SD CARD and the device tells me that the card is ready to accept transfer of data. But, it does not work. I received a message from Support that instructed me on what to do. I did all as instructed but still no go. I received another message that said the device (HD10) had limitations when it came to the use of SD cards. Amazon should probably add that remark to the Product Description."
"This is the 3rd tablet I've had from Amazon, and my least favorite.Pros: the price was right. With the sale price and credit for my trade in, it was a great deal.Cons: the touch screen is not very responsive. I often have to close a page because it won't respond to taps. Maybe it's doing something in the background that I'm not aware of, but nothing else is open and it just locks up. If I go back, then reopen the page sometimes it will work, but it's very annoying.The operating button placement is also annoying. The on\\off button is right next to the volume buttons on the top left of the device, making it very easy to accidentally turn the device off while trying to turn the volume down.I read a lot so use the Kindle library. The library screen is baffling. If I download a loaned book, it doesn't appear in my ""continue reading"" column unless I immediately open it to the first page. However, every single book that I have finished reading and returned already stays in that column. Forever, apparently. I've even gone to the ""manage my content"" page and deleted the downloads but, voila! Open the screen and there they are again. But the ones I wanted to read next? Nowhere to be found.No, I would not recommend this version."
"I picked this up as an inexpensive Comixology-focused tablet primarily because of the inability to purchase from the Kindle store on iOS. For that purpose, the tablet serves pretty well. It's fast enough, can purchase directly from the Kindle store, and has expandable memory. If you're interested in also using third party comics subscription apps like DC Universe Infinite or Marvel Unlimited, however, you're not going to be happy. The locked down nature of the Kindle Fire HD 10 means you cannot install those apps without jumping through some hoops that I don't personally consider worth the effort.  Comixology Unlimited has a lot to offer, so it's not entirely a deal breaker, but this limitation can keep the Kindle from being your primary tablet for digital comics if you're a a subscriber to those other services. Three stars for its functionality. However...The Fire HD 10 is a cheaply made tablet. I knew that going in, but I didn't expect it to fail on me within a week of my purchase. After less than a week of ownership, I went to use it one day and as soon as I unlocked it, the screen rapidly faded to black and became unresponsive. I could occasionally wake it up, but the fade to black would still happen, which made it essentially useless for reading or watching anything. Occasionally it would mix it up and fade to a bright white, but in every case the tablet was useless. I tried to RMA for an exchange, but the automated system claimed that the HD 10 was sold to me by a third party seller (not the case) and that I would need to send it back, have a refund issued, and then buy another if I wanted. Having not had time to ship it back to Amazon, I experimented with it over the course of the next few days and was able to stabilize it with some percussive maintenance and made the decision to hold onto it.So what's WRONG with the HD 10? It's cheaply made. If the casing flexes in the right (wrong) way in your bag, presumably some connections become flakey and it affects the functionality of the display. If you're dead set on buying this tablet, I recommend a nice rigid case to protect it, because at the end of the day it's a bit fragile. I certainly didn't beat mine up, it simply couldn't handle a couple of bike commutes in a messenger bag. If you're okay with being soft locked into Comixology/Kindle and are okay with putting it into a heavier-duty case then I think this is a nice tablet for the price when you can pick it up on sale."
We have bought about 6 Fire tablets but this one has problems charging. We changed out the useless power cord that came with it we now use one of the old ones and that works about 75% of the time. I haven't had the time to spend on the phone complaining with Amazon the customer service has fallen to a new low in the past year. Phone numbers have been changed and it's an ordeal to get a hold of someone that is trained with the fire tablet. TOO MANY TRANSFERS WHILE WAITING ON HOLD!
"You buy the tablet from them, pay for Prime, and buy the books from them. That's not enough money for Amazon they have to have the display DOMINATED by the Discover section where they will try to get you to buy more stuff from them. If you want to be able to see anything more than the last 2 books you touched you have to go scrolling through menu's and can't find them on the home screen. Beyond that highly annoying feature, it's fine as a book-reading device."
"This product wasn't terrible by all means just not what I was looking for but I probably will never buy a amazon made device ever again.1. There are ads on the home screen, which is annoying to say the least. (I paid 200 dollars for this thing just to be met with adds every time I go to use it)2. Though this tablet is an android it doesn't use google play, I didn't find this out until after I bought it but it was rough to say the least to find good apps i.e. the ones you played on other devices.3. If you don't pay for prime there is basically no point in getting this because of how many features you'll be locked out of or reduced to the free version.4. With all this being said, they some how made an android feel as non-flexible as an iphone in my opinion.Overall I'd recommend spending the extra money on something better, trust me you'll thank yourself later."
"Had all kinds of issues getting the new Kindle to bring over all apps, data etc from the old one.  We followed the direction exactly but many things did not work as indicated and it took much manual intervention and some things simple did not come over.  A lot of pain and frustration.  The device works fine.  The transition process is a nightmare."
"This tablet is just okay. Its Amazon's own OS, not the well known and common Android or Apple. So, this means many apps aren't compatible. It will not connect to southwest in flight WiFi (entertainment portal) because it is not an approved OS. It would be nice to have a better connection to my phone, like you'd get with Android or IOS, so I could switch back and forth more easily. For the price, its fine, but its basically best for internet browsing (again, Amazon's own browser - other common browsers aren't an option) and some streaming. If I had realized about the OS and compatibilty, I would've gone with another brand.Also battery life is disappointing. Runs down relatively quickly for a brand new machine. Touchscreen is a little wonky, often off just slightly making it difficult to choose the correct option."
"I like using this product to play my favorite card game, hand, and foot. That is actually my main reason for buying it. It also works well to read my books on Kindle. I have no complaints with that.My complaints are the nonstop advertisements. I don’t understand why if I own the unit, why I still have to see advertisements every time I open it? I would never buy another Amazon electronic device such as a TV for this reason.Also it’s not great for searching online. Maybe it wasn’t meant to be used for this. But it’s a cheap version of an I-pad. That’s why I bought it in the first place. I wanted something cheap to play my games on. Since then I’ve found my old IPad and enjoy that for useful information and going on the internet."
"Password keeper not the best. This tablet is loaded with Amazon-focused content. Meaning, amazon.com controller the tablet.  They ""flush"" their apps and products they sell. In a nut sell, the owner of this tablet cannot download their favorite apps like Google drive much less the Google browser. Its frosting for me to use I reset to manufacture setting then toss it aside."
"I don't like all the ads, it's distracting. If I want an app I will get it. The ads make the app that I'm  on disappear and it's difficult to get back to them. I do like the size of the tablet and the color is good..The sound doesn't have much volume. I think this tablet may be defective."
I love my tablet. There is however a problem The charger cable will not work. I have been using an old one I had. However this is very aggravating to say the least. I paid good money for this tablet and would to be able to use it. Can you please send me a different charger. Thank you
"I had to replace my old fire, this is my 5th device! They are all still working its just the batteries don't seem to last they work but don't hold the charge very long! This new one seems faster to respond but the sound is terrible, im not sure if its a defect or not, I will use ear phones so I will keep it especially after I put my personal apps on it, with this fire everything I have loaded on the only I have to manually load on this new one! I got this for 40% off  and that's why I decided to buy and on cheap payments no interest Amazon offered so I couldn't say no! I'll say its ok but not better then my last fire!"
"I am 80 and I made the switch from paper to ebooks over 10 years ago and like it. I do not and never have played games on my phone or tablet. I chose the fire tablet because it was much less expensive than a Kindle? Why the difference in price as it does less I have no idea but the fire served my needs of just reading a book very well. It was nice as I got notifications when there was activity on a blink camera and I had Google if I needed it. life was good. My fourth fire tablet battery is wearing out so I looked for a sale on a new tablet.I just got it yesterday and the easy set up was not so easy. It failed to find my library and no books? Amazon customer service three times told me I had no books in my account? Finally got them transferred to my new tablet. THIS IS WHERE THE NEW REALITY HIT ME! THE DARN THING IS SET UP TO LOOK LIKE A CELL PHONE. The screen is filled with nothing but categories of movies, games, ads for stuff  I have never heard of? I called again and was told my books were there but I had to search for them and then download them AGAIN and where I was in a book was lost. I had to go back to my old tablet and find where I left off?IF YOU ARE OVER 60 AND DO NOT LIVE YOUR LIFE ON A CELL PHONE AND DO NOT LOVE ALL THE JUNK THAT IS PUSHED AT YOU THIS TABLET AND OPERATING SYSTEM IS NOT FOR YOU. On my previous tablet my screen only had the icons I loaded and used! My books were lined up nicely and when opened went to where I left off. NOT NOW!Look I am not being judgmental to the generations that live this life. There is an amazing variety of entertainment available. This type of screen is second nature to many generations but not to me. At my age I do not want to spend many frustrating days figuring out how to simply access the book I was reading. I do not want to see a screen filled with icons of offerings that mostly offend me, and there is no choice here. I paid extra for a no ad opening screen. I got that only to have a screen filled entirely with Amazon offerings, most at a cost? What did I pay extra for? Honestly I feel ripped off.I remember back with a new Windows version where the screen was so radically different that they offered a “classic desk top”. Amazon has made the decision to abandon our generation and not give any option. This is just my opinion but I wish somebody had written this review before I had to waste a day and still have to drop off the return of my new tablet at UPS. It is probably a great item for many but for many of us it is not so great. Caveat emptor."
"Ordered a new tablet with a larger screen., issue is a lot of apps seem to not work with the newer model.  Amazon App Store needs to work better with others to have compatible apps with other manufacturers.  Silk browser needs an update or Amazon needs to open up to other browsers"
I have always liked Amazon fire tablets. This will be my 3rd one so fat. I bought this one for my grandson. I dislike the fact that the board looked as if it has been opened before I received it. I can't set it up until later because it's a gift.
"Very good quality but as an android device I expected to find Google Play and chrome etc already set up on device,instead there was set up with silk and own playstore for Amazon.if had google play store I could of used for what I needed for but making it an Amazon only tablet took away so many possibilities and limited the device for just entertainment which I think takes a high margin of customers to look else where maybe open it up next time and I would give 50 stars but I may have to go with pixel or galaxy until then.sorry I returned already so no pictures but I hope developers see this and think about it."
About50% of the time my stylus won't work on the screen. I have to use my finger and that's painful. Would NOT order another of these for that reason. At first it did ok so I missed the return window.
"Got this for my parents. Their doctors suggested some apps to help with various issues. I was not able to download any of them. There were lots of games and other things available, but not what it was purchased for."
"Thought this might be a bit more powerful than my current one. It may be a bit faster but what put me off  was there is no app for Shop Amazon. The icon is there but it just appears to open the web page. It has none of the features like the app on my 11th generation.Amazon giveth  and Amazon taketh away.Seems every day Amazon gives me one more reason to close my account and find somewhere else to buy..Update: 11/22/2024 I just discovered that all of my fire tablets have been updated to use the ""new"" Amazon app. I believe this is a considerable step backwards as far as useability of the app. As mentioned previously, the new Amazon app appears to be a clone of the Amazon website.While the websites features may have been appropriate for that environment, those features do not convert well to the Amazon app on the Fire Tablets. I believe the reason for this is due to the limitations of the environment on the tablet. The UI on the website relies heavily on the mouse both for moving around the screen and selecting links, etc. The precision of the cursor on a webpage is much superior to the touch screen, especially given the much smaller text & links on the tablet.Personally, I have rarely had an issue with links or selection with a mouse on the web. Almost 100% of times I can select the exact link, button, or menu selection I desire precisely because the exact action point of the cursor is always easy to find and select on the UI objects on the page and is me er larger than any of those objects.However, when the size of web page is reduced significantly to fit the screen constraints of mobile devices and the mouse is not available for moving or selecting the cursor, the entire dynamic of the UI is changed in less than ideal ways.With the exception of very young infants, most finger tips are much larger than the objects on the page which completely destroys the precision needed to navigate traditional style web pages. This limitation is precisely why new controls and objects were developed for mobile devices.Also, by forcing web page style actions on a mobile device displaying the same page as a web site forces the user to  switch methods even though the visible objects on the two are virtually identical. Taken to the next level, the exact same issue exists when going from a web page format to a mobile UI app.Finally, the former mobile ready Amazon app had extra controls and interface objects that were designed for that environment. By converting the app to a web page, that functionality is destroyed.I almost never use  my tablet for viewing videos or streaming because I have one of those larger screens we call a television.This means that the only things I use my Fire tablets for are games and shopping on Amazon. Due to the drastic changes made by the switch to the web page for the Amazon app, that is essentially removed from the list.Please consider returning the mobile ready app for Amazon."
"I like Amazon fire Kindles. I've had one for almost 10 years, but I mainly use for reading. This is way larger that my previous one. I know it's a difference of 5 generations, but for an updated digital reader it's a bit much. Now for the screen freezing, I could be scrolling while reading and all of a sudden it won't move. Thankfully I'm at the top of the screen reading and I have some patience, as I read down, but once I'm ready to move again I can't. Next thing you know it closes the book, and I just reopen it, but don't let me read like 5 or so many chapters and it freezes in the middle of one because now I'm back to where I was when I first opened the book that day. I tried closing the Kindle, to lock it and it wouldn't, still frozen; it'll even highlight things I don't highlight.😩 At one point the whole tablet restarted, and took 5-10 minutes. Mind you this is all while not connected to wifi. I actually don't even get ads on the screen when I open the tablet, just a black screen with the time and normal header stuff, when connected or disconnected to wifi. I miss my old tablet. 😥The power button is even in a different place (don't get me started with the camera). The thing I love the most though is that the pen is fantastic, but I have a button on the pen that doesn't do anything (the pen is specifically for the newest Kindle fires)."
No khan academy or epic reading. These arr important for kids to use them.Device is good value for money but app ecosystem is still far behind how is that possible after so many years launched
Due to the black Friday sale I decided to get this to replace my android tablet. I do a lot of ARC reviews using multiple sites to receive the books and post reviews.  Several of the apps that I have on my old tablet isn't compatible with this one.
"I picked this up expecting it to work like a normal tablet that can do tablet like things, like helping me with a 3D printing business, accessing 3D modeling software, or at the bare minimum at least be able to handle the Bambu Handy App so I can browse and send models to my printer from the tablet and check in on one of my printers. Google Play Store has the Bambu Handy App, plus a plethora of other 3D related apps. So why would Amazon shoot themseves in the foot by not offering the Google Play Store and giving them a much wider variety of app options for free rather than trying to pick and choose only a small number of apps for their own app store to put on this tablet? So far it looks like all this tablet can do is play music, movies and access social media! It lacks access to apps available on all android devices, making it of even less use and value than a phone! This is NOT a tablet this is just an HD Kindle! PLEASE Amazon do NOT call this a tablet and confuse loyal customers like myself! It looks like I will need to return this now and all the accessories I ordered for it, because Amazon is calling this a tablet when it can't do tablet things and can't access simple 3D printing apps and software that my phone can! This is a piece of junk! I am happy to change my review if Amazon can respond to this within the next few days and explain how to unlock and access simple 3D print apps, like the Bambu Handy App, otherwise this is going back.If your looking for a TABLET to handle apps associated with a small or personal business, stick with your phone, or keep shopping.  This is NOT what you are looking for.Edit: I did wind up finding a hack to add the Google Play Store to the ""tablet"" so that it functions more like a tablet, but I should not need to do that and I found this information on my own. As a result I upped my rating to 2 stars since I can at least now get this thing to do most of what I needed to do with it. I expect better from Amazon. Very disappointing."
"I bought this to replace a broken Samsung tablet, hoping it would be an acceptable replacement.  As an Amazon Ebook reader, it's great- 5 stars.  As a tablet, it's hobbled by not being able to use Google Play.  The version of Facebook Messenger causes an echo, so now I  use my phone for that.  Also for the NY Times, since there's no app for that.  I just don't go to chess.com, I  haven't tried the Fire specific chess app.  I think the Suduko app is fairly good. The app library is very limited."
"Nice tablet for a senior but it doesn't support a Walmart App and I was forced to return it. Otherwise, it was a great price, visually pleasing and easy to use."
No problem with the seller. It arrived on time and was packaged well. I liked my old Kindle a Lot better tho! It's going to take some getting used to because of the updated technology in it.
This is my 2nd Kindle Hd 10 and so upset that the new HD 10 is NOT 10 inches…feeling so ripped off! I feel that this is false advertising*
I like the speed and the graphics; the HD is nice.  But I can’t get it to pair to a fire tv.There’s a glitch that says moisture in the charging port which is a common glitch it seems from reading other reviews.Very disappointed Amazon is selling these knowing full well about the glitch
This is the latest Amazon fire tablet. It does not support my online banking app! Found some apps not available in app store. Works well just disappointed that my old no name tablet supported  better than this.
"I have had Samsung Galaxy products for years, but those are getting rather expensive. So I got this the other day for entertainment. It is definitely not android, but it's cool. It actually moves pretty fast, probably because it doesn't have as much unnecessary software as Galaxy products. This tablet is definitely primarily for reading and streaming. The three buttons on screen (back, home, recent) look so old and simple, but they work. The screen is pretty good too, not as good as the Galaxy A7 screen, but definitely functional. Its not the most responsive, but you may have to tap twice on more specific areas or text, again it feels like it's made for kids or older people. The tablet itself feels like a nice toy. It's very light, and feels almost hollow. It's definitely not a cutting edge innovative design. But it's not for that. This is a nice tablet for daily reading, entertainment streaming, kids, or in my case, going on a trip and I don't want to take my Mac Book. I can't imagine doing any kind of actual productivity work on this. But this is a fantastic extra curricular device for reading, streaming videos, or some light writing if you have the keyboard attachment. If you have kids, or expect to carry this around with you, or put it in bags, you need some kind of case because it doesn't seem too durable. BUT at this price...if you break it, or lose it...just get another one LoL I definitely would."
"I bought this because my laptop broke and I couldn’t afford to replace it but needed something to use for work and school. This is fine but definitely not great, and I plan to replace it as soon as I can. The lack of apps to download is really frustrating. In particular, I had hoped to download Google drive so that I could enable offline functionality since I sometimes don’t have internet. The Google drive “app” that is available, however, is basically just a link to Google drive on the browser. If you like Google suit, Gmail, etc, forget about it. This works okay with Microsoft but that’s it and even then, I’m often frustrated by it. It also takes photos that are .heic and makes it very difficult to convert them to another format, which was not great when I needed to upload a photo for an assignment.Battery life is good, and it’s definitely portable and easy to set up.  If you just want a tablet for streaming and games, then it’s fine, but I do not recommend it as a tool for work or school."
I would have given this a lot better rating if they had put the shut off button up on top and not near the volume buttons.b
"I downgraded from the Max 11 2023 latest version because that version was simply too big, had only one USB-C input that you could ONLY use for either charging or connecting an accessory. It also had tons of bugs with touchscreen such as scrolling up and down with your fingers being mistaken as a click. At one time I lost the touchscreen completely. The unit was not responding to anything. I had to connect a wired mouse via USB-C to get the unit to restart and resolving the issue. Otherwise, the unit would be locked out completely. There is no external reset button on that model either.This one (Version 10, 2023) that I am reviewing here doesn't have the above issues, smaller but the right size and manageable specially for closeup work and applications. I found the Max 11 to be too big.  However, the issue with lack of support for simultaneous charging and connecting a wired accessory via a USB-C splitter adapter remains. You have to only use bluetooth accessories like the one Amazon want you to use. This is a terrible and dreadfully limiting feature.Forcing the user to only use  bluetooth means they have to discard perfectly serviceable wired accessories that would otherwise work with the unit. Bluetooth is not always desirable or convenient plus it adds further risk of radiation exposure that is otherwise eliminated with a wired accessory.  Some people can actually get headaches when exposed to a close and constant sources of bluetooth emitting devices. There are also security issues that are beyond the scope of this review.In the next variant of this product, Amazon should build a simultaneous support for charging and adding an accessory via its only USB-C input via a adapter like the one I've attached a photo of or simply offer several USB-C inputs; one for accessory, one for charging.In my case I have a wired keyboard that is super ergonomic with built in USB inputs of its own that allow you to connect a mouse directly into it, hence you only need one input into any device to use both keyboard and a mouse without the needing of several inputs. The keyboard pass on any USB device connection connected to it to a device you connect it to.  With this current version, you can only use an accessory or charge, not both."
"I need an e-reader that I can use for multiple different apps (Libby, Hoopla, NetGalley, Kindle). This one allows for me to use all of those. But it’s MASSIVE and cluttered and not very customizable. My hands free page turner doesn’t work well with this tablet. The glare is pretty intense. She’s too much and she’s too big. Overall the cons are outweighed by the pros so back she goes. Obviously I should have known because it’s sooooooo affordable. That’s what I get for cheaping out."
"The fire is good, but not great as a reader. It’s okay for passing time browsing internet with silk, but, is not practical for anything else. I searched for other browser suggestions, but have not figured out how to download Firefox. I am not familiar with android systems, but, wished I had either purchased a kindle, or upgraded to a more useful OS. I appreciated the cheaper price, but, I find myself needing more. I wished I had bought an affordable iPad option instead."
"Pros: great price, good speed, long battery life, charges quickly, monitor sharp colors. Cons: Can't find half the apps that have been part of my world for years bkz Amazon Fire only offers Amazon Store and their apps, especially gaming apps, are inferior to Google Store, and unless you're super tech savvy is not available for download on this tablet. Couldn't even get a very popular discount book app. Gifted it to a friend and bought another tablet. This was a costly boo-boo."
"I shop on Amazon daily and have purchased many hundreds of items and spent great time providing thoughtful , accurate and helpful reviews over many years. I've never ever received any form of acknowledgement and I've never used AI to write ANY Review. I take pride In helping customers and can't believe I've never been invited to join Amazon Vine. I've been a computer software coder since the early days of the. BASIC and COBOL languages, back before software was do developed to write Code.This tablet is Suitable for Kindle and does a good, but not great, job overall.Screen quality very good. Screen brightness very good.. Basic games, like slotsx can actually work well but it's ALWAYS hit or miss. The unit is built good, however a 4 foot drop onto the floor caused enough screen damage, even return protector, that my thumb was bleeding today from glass that was painful.The file system is from the early 90's and I'm not aware of ANY similar product without common advancements. Changing the ""bones"" of this isn't easy even for a programmer. The brightness is good but adaptive brightness not consistent with any competition. For kids to watch cartoons it's a good device.I would help Amazon if they cared enough to use my help but not for Free. The apps they have are the most limited of any. And most all applications are abysmal and i concur. For under a dollar better hardware could readily be includes but isn't so it's clunky. My church Review is1 deserved star.There are huge issues with this device and Florida humidity. It will provider a high humidity detection warning and ways to rid humidity In ports buy no longer charges like before.Very poor typing and Swyping when writing all emails, completing online forms,etc. The quality is very inferior to Motorola phones, Google Pixel phones and other android devices even with old operating systems.This doesn't replace a laptop or other tablets by any means and requires that I see an Amazon advertisement each time I have a screen timeout of sign in.For $79 it's great for Kindle and similar applications. I received as gift from my brother ago who wanted me to watch videos on a bigger screen and I'm grateful. However, this isn't worth the extra effort and time it takes to just type an email. I've corrected this Fire tablet 13 times with predictive text errors just typing this review."
Love everything about my new kindle except for font sizes…is there a plan to update to make larger fonts available in the future?
When you type in a search it changes your words to something completely different.
"No matter what I am doing on my tablet, it will turn off.  Laying solitaire, it can happen five times in one game.  Highly annoying!  I've had kindles for over ten years and this one is horrible.  Now you turn it on but need to gently turn it off and on quickly to be able to put your pin in.  What the heck?"
"I like the older model better. They changed the format for photos and its  not as easy to use. Its much harder to find photos from the past and editing is a lot harder ! I have 2 older models and 2 new one. Since I take and save a lot of pictures I will keep one of the older ones until it ""dies"" just for that purpose ! Otherwise not a lot of changes !"
"Please read whole review...I have an old Apple device that needed replacing. For various reasons I didn't go for a new one. I have a relative that got a Fire 7. They seem to be happy with theirs.  So, got a Fire HD 10.  Set-up was fairly easy & quick. I liked the size & the feel.  So I sat down and wrote down all that I wanted to load onto my NEW tablet.  I was only 1/3 through my list when the memory got full. So I griped some. But I had a SD card that I loaded up. Then I went about working on my list.  A few days after I had placed the SD card in I decided to check how full I was.  I was at 34G. that just hit me wrong. So, I got the breakdown of how much was music vs. photos vs. Apps, so forth.  I was just over 2G of music! That was 98% of what I downloaded...The reason I got the device...THE reason I put in the SD card because I that I had maxed-out the memory!!!...  According to the SD listing 30G was Apps!?!?!  I did NOT add any Apps. So I checked to see what was loaded... ACCORDING to the read-out There are NO!!! Apps. It just created space to store any Apps I may add later.  So, 30G for Apps & 2G for music.  Correct me if I am wrong. But...I got a 32G tablet that was ALREADY  at peak capacity at roughly 30G BEFORE I even started loading my music choices!!!  THAT people is WRONG! Period. end of statement.  Now...Battery life, screen picture quality, ease of web browsing have been fine. A hiccup here or there. But, I have only had it like a fortnight or so. I can write most of that up to learning a new device."
"Overall:We bought this tablet to monitor our Ring cameras during the day in the kitchen. For this purpose, it does the job well. The device has plenty of memory for this task and stays plugged into the wall so the battery life is not an issue. The device is light weight and a sleek black design. It isn’t the biggest screen so if you need larger text to read, you will need to adjust that in the settings. So readability I would say is average. Our kids do not use the tablet, so I am unable to comment on the parent control features.If I used it as a tablet, I probably would not buy it. The software is a bit clunky compared to Apple. But the price tag is considerably cheaper so may be worth it for some users."
Volume can't be turned up loud enough other than that great tablet
"I like the size and the price.My biggest complaint is it won't let me add Walmart, Etsy,Ebay,apps!Basically any app that I can buy from other than Amazon!!!!!!This has to be some sort of a monopoly!!!This really pisses me off! Like they don't already get enough of my money.I didn't see this anywhere in the description!"
Screen isn’t very bright does not have Google play store
very difficult to use.  Will not let me install the app I want.
Sluggish performance but gets the job done I suppose.
"This tablet is great for basics but is very limiting. The first thing I noticed was that the app store did not have all the apps I would like. I can't screencast to my smart TV without hooking up my old Roku device and the playback varies with playback issues. I understand that Amazon's main point is a Kindle for reading books but, if you are going to market this as a tablet, it needs to be as functional and versatile as other Android tablets on the market. Please work this stuff out. I like the tablet screen display as it is quite vibrant. I will use the kindle reading app and other apps as well I would just like to feel like an adult using this tablet not a child with so many limits."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Honestly, this tablet has so much potential because not everyone wants to pay hundreds of dollars for a tablet, but this tablet is limited for the reason of it supposedly being at war with Google, and there are some apps that you can't find in the store. Please fix this!!!"
"tried to send the following email to Amazon support cs-reply@amazon.com, but got this email instead:""You've written to an address that does not accept incoming direct e-mails, ......""I tried to go on the website to find support, but it only shows how do use information that I already knew. It also keeps going back and forth to the same web pages! Very frustrated! I don't want to call them, because I cannot remember everything. I would like solutions in writing for reference. Can someone tell me how to get help?  Below is my original email:There are a number of problems with my new Fire HD10 2023 tablet. Below are the problems I found so far.  Please help fix!1. The videos are not clear. Some videos are fussy and hard to hear, even when all the sound settings are set to high!2. Screenshot does not work, does not do anything.3. The touch screen sometimes does not respond, had to touch it a few times, especially in the lower left corner.  Sometimes it responded with something else as if I touched a different area on the screen.4.  Several times it won't charge due to moisture. I had to wait for the next day to charge and cannot use the tablet for the day.4.  Silk is not very useful, does not even download webpages!  When downloaded in other browsers like Chrome and Edge, webpages are stored as BIN files, and cannot be played back, kept saying ""WPS office is determining the type of document"" and then quit, do nothing. Why? What is WPS office? It is not shown anywhere and no icon to access it.  I need to save webpages for later access/reminder, when Wi-Fi is not available, or the webpages are deleted or too old ....., very important to us users!Please help fix as soon as possible! Thank you!"
"I like the size and weight of the tablet that’s about it, we’ll wait the battery life is great the design fees a bit play like. If you want an Amazon enabled tablet I guess it’s a good option. I made a mistake. I prefer not an Amazon tablet"
Tablet will not allow Google Chrome!  Very disappointed.  Will require that I spend a significant amount of time to set up.  Amazon's limitation on search engines other than Silk allows them to collect more data.  Not cool.  Older generation of Fire Tablet allowed Chrome.
"Hardware is fine.  The unit & the ""free"" games downloaded from Amazon are loaded with ads.  Also, appear to not allow any games from Google Play for Android.Overall I was better off with my last Fire Tablet.  Regret this purchase."
"It is jam packed with advertising software that cannot be removed.  The lock screen is always an ad. The battery life is pretty pathetic. Lasts about 4 hours of continous use.  There is no low battery warning, it just shuts off."
"I should have done more research before impulsively buying this on a day it was on sale. I am shocked at how slow the reaction time it takes when I try to open an app or navigate an app. I have not downloaded any books or videos. I had no idea that the YouTube app would not be available when using this. Which was my main incentive for purchasing a tablet. So I could use YouTube and workout. Obviously since I'm not using the app and basically just a shortcut to YouTube's website. It's awful. It's not a user friendly experience. I would use my phone but the screen is too small. It's annoying to try to play videos, pause videos or fast forward videos. It lags. The touch is not intuitive and I have to hit a specific part of the screen. It's ridiculous what I have to do to return to a playlist I have created. The amount of time it takes for me to connect to my Bluetooth headphones is ridiculous. They do not connect automatically. I have to go into the Bluetooth menu and manually connect them. Every single time. There is no option to automatically connect to Bluetooth. The range of the Bluetooth is also abysmal. I own a Kindle and would never read a book on this tablet . It is extremely uncomfortable to the eyes . I honestly wish that I spent the extra 50 to $75 to get a tablet with a more mainstream OS. Do I take responsibility for my not doing adequate research when it comes to lower price tablets? Yes. But this is borderline trash. I would rather use an unknown branded tablet with an Android operating system then this. The only redeeming quality of this tablet is that the screen is big and I can grin and bear it once I get my playlist going to watch my Pilates videos. I occasionally will use this to watch videos while I'm cooking. Other than that I do not reach for this for any other digital need. I would recommend spending a little bit more and getting a tablet with an Android operating system. Or if you're feeling extravagant. Go Apple. This is a tablet for people who are technologically under a rock or drank a bottle of wine and thought it would be a good idea to browse Amazon on prime day."
What I dislike about the tablets is that you have to have a Amazon account to use it. Second thing I dislike about the tablets is that you can't download apps from Google play store.
I really wish that they would allow you to download the google play store or include the apps that are available on the google play store.  I bought it to play my games and they are not available on the amazon app store.
I am having some issues with this tablet . keeps flipping to the keyboard window in the middle of a game or shopping  takes numerous touching to get a response. not a happy camper
I like the tablet a lot. the only issue I have is that the port where you connect the headphones does not work!! is there anything that we can do about that?
Didn’t like the ads. Bought it for my kid but the annoying ads were not appropriate for him to look at. Returned it and bought an iPad. Good for an adult.
"Doesn't support quite a few apps, such as Google Chrome or Gmail or NYT Cooking, to name a few. Just clunky enough to be annoying but works fine to read kindle books."
"I got this tablet about a month ago. Suddenly, today, it will not connect to my internet even though it is right in front of the router."
"Updated review: now that I've had a day to actually use this new Fire, I don't like it very much. As stated below it is big, heavy and awkward to hold while sitting. The font sizes are limited and some look way too tiny for such a big tablet; if you choose the largest of five, then some thing like ebooks are HUGE while the icons are a good size. I am so disappointed that I wish I hadn't let the return window expire, even though i bought this on sale. I guess I'll be it to a family member.I bought this newest Fire to replace my much loved and very used kindle fire from the previous version when itarted to get a bit glitchy from being dropped so many times. Definitely larger and definitely heavier. Not nearly as portable as the other Fire because unfortunately, it is too big to go in most of my purses! Sad face. Therefore it's not really getting used as it's pretty heavy for arthritic hands to hold to read books but if you want it to watch movies/stream content from the web, this new Fire is a good choice."
"This is my 3rd Kindle Fire…I think the previous 2 were the 8 and 11.  Both of them ended the same way—one day they just wouldn’t wake up.  No drops, extreme temps, children using them, wrapped in cases their entire lives….just dead after about 3 years.  So it was time to order a new one.  Ordered the newest one (13th gen).  First thing I noticed was the 1st time I had to replace Amazon sent me a box to ship the old one back in and a discount on the new one—this time only the discount.  On my own for the box.  Last time it was delivered practically overnight—this time had to wait 4 days.  Not a super long time except for the fact there is an Amazon distribution center less than 5 miles from my house.  I finally get it and open the box…one of the things that is hyped up is how light it is.  It is very light—but it feels cheap because the plastic feels a lot thinner.  I ordered a case for it that has the light magnet just for closing purposes.  First thing that happens is one of the metal tabs comes off the kindle and is stuck to the case.  Seems to work ok but I am not holding out hope that this Kindle will last as long as the last two."
"I've, had my Kindle Fire 8 for about 13 Years, and as to be expected, the battery life has really started to dwindle. It's been a great device, so I decided to upgrade to the 10 for my replacement. So disappointed. Says the battery life is supposed to be 10 hours or so, but I barely get 5 to 6! My old one would go for a couple of days before needing a charge, and I ran a couple of streaming services on it. I can't get Pluto to download on the 10 nor some of the other apps offered in Amazon's App store so I'm not using anything draining on the system. That said I only get limited time before needing to charge the new Kindle 10. It's also combersome compared to the 8, but it is larger so that's to be expected. The other super annoying thing for me is that it always wants to throw a comma between words that you have to backspace out. Other than that, it seems to be okay."
"ABOUT A YEAR AGO, AMAZON DISCONTINUED SUPPORT AND UPDATES FOR MY OLDER KINDLE 8 HD TABLET, DELETING ALL BOOKS & CONTENT I HAD SAVED IN CLOUD ""WITHOUT NOTICE"".  DESPITE EFFORTS, I WAS NOT ABLE TO LOG ON. WHEN I CALLED TECH SUPPORT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO RETRIEVE MY SAVED AND PURCHASED CONTENT.  I  STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY BOOKS I PURCHASED WERE DELETED. CURIOUSLY, MY FIRST KINDLE, THE KINDLE KEYPAD STILL WORKS..DUE TO POORER VISION, I CAN NO LONGER READ PRINT ON MOST HARDBACK BOOKS.  THIS IS WHY I NEED MY KINDLE PRIMARILY FOR READING.  ESPECIALLY,  I LOVED HOW THE 2014 KINDLE 8 HD TABLET BOOK SHELF WAS ORGANIZED.  MY BOOKS WERE NOT IN AN APP, BUT ON THE SHELF.  ALSO, THE SIZE OF MY OLDER KINDLE WAS PERFECT FOR READING, OFFERING ALL THE SETTING I NEEDED TO ENLARGE FONT, ETC.AFTER MY KINDLE 8 WAS DEACTIVATED, AS A GIFT FOR MOTHER'S DAY, I WAS GIVEN A KINDLE READER THAT I DID NOT LIKE.  IT WAS NOT AS STURDY.  INSTEAD I BEGAN READING BOOKS ON THE KINDLE APP ON MY SAMSUNG TABLET.  I ADJUSTED.  NO PROBLEM. YET WHEN MY SAMSUNG TAB WAS LOST, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THIS NEW KINDLE FIRE HD 10.UNFORTUNATELY, I DID NOT REALIZE THIS NEW KINDLE HD 10 BEARS NO RESEMBLANCE TO MY OLD KINDLE.  INSTEAD, THIS  VERSION IS ORGANIZED/ARRANGED SIMILAR TO THE SAMSUNG GALAXY  TABLET 8 WITH PREINSTALLED ROWS OF APPS.  IN THE INITIAL SETUP PROCESS, I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN WHAT I WANTED MOST WAS MISSING. INSTEAD OF THE BOOKSHELF, THERE IS A KINDLE APP,  WHICH I DON'T LIKE AS MUCH AS I LIKED THE BOOKSHELF ON MY SOLIDLY BUILT OLDER 2014 KINDLE TAB 8.OVERALL, AS A SENIOR WHO DOES NOT GAME OR WATCH MOVIES ON A TABLET, MY PRIMARY REASON FOR THE KINDLE WAS READING.  IT IS DISAPPOINTING HAVING TO USE THE APP TO ACCESS BOOKS.  WORSE, THIS NEWER KINDLE HAS  SO MANY ADS.I ADMIT.  I SHOULD HAVE READ DETAILS PRIOR PURCHASING.  NEVERTHELESS, I AM KEEPING ONLY BECAUSE THE PRICE WAS REASONABLE, AND I ENJOY READING.."
"I had been buying Amazon Kindle tablets for years, naively believing that bc the price was so low, in comparison to other tablets, I was getting an fantastic deal.  Although it's embarrassing to admit, I reviewed my past purchases of Kindle tablets over the past 2 years, and discovered, to my chagrin, I had bought 7 Amazon Fire tablets in the past 2 years. Because EVERY Fire Tablet failed (FUBAR), on average, in less than 4 months. This totally unacceptable poor quality tablet was present in many different versions/generations of Fire tablets.  I will NEVER buy another Amazon Kindle.  You may read many 5 star reviews, but please be aware of how long the reviewer has owned and operated their tablet. I would have given very favorable (5 star) reviews if I had written the review within 3 months of purchase. But the inevitable failure (average time to fail is around 3.5 months, one did last about 6 months), seriously undermines their supposed 'value'.  Please consider tablets made by other manufacturers. I'm afraid I don't have the experience to advocate for another tablet maker.  I am able to write with high confidence:Avoid Kindle Fire tablets. And be wary of Apple tablets - I don't have the experience  to say whether they are better or worse than Kindle Fires, regarding their longevity. However, I do KNOW  that Apple tablets are extremely costly."
"I got my kindle fast, it was here in just two days. First impression was good, it was easy to set up and well packaged.Now for my gripes. I got the Amazon photo app figured I'd save some photos. There's no way to stop the upload had to uninstall the app. Second, it won't let me signs into Facebook. When I do get in it logs me out and I can't get back in. This tablet is limited use and it can't handle the simplest things. I'm returning it. I'm sure there are Android tablets for this money that will actually work. Very disappointed. Amazon this has your name on it, you should be ashamed of yourselves.Update: I uninstalled FB for a few days and used FB light with no problems. Today I decided to give it another try and low and behold it works. Not sure if it will continue to work but have closed it and rebooted a few times and it works. Ill keep the tablet now that it does what it should do.12/5/24 updateAfter having this tablet for a while it's just a cheap tablet that should be much lower in price. Issues: the on screen key board is horrible. The spell check is near worthless. Alexa is stupid compared to Google. It randomly freezes while on FB and TT. It's short on memory. There is nothing special about this tablet. I'm sure your money could be better spent."
I loved it for the first few weeks.  Now is losing games a I download
"It has been a good tablet. I’ve had it for a year. Unfortunately, it was dropped on the floor by accident and even with a protective case on it the screen messed up and not able to use now. But it was an amazing tablet and I was really excited to get this one. I would still recommend but get a better shockproof case. I thought mine had good protection until this happened."
I really liked until it did an update and changed the interface of my shopping app now its so hard to read . I tried costumer service which was great but couldn't figure it out why it happened.My husband has a later version and his app didn't change I think they made an error with the update. Please Amazon change my shopping app the way it was.
"My old 2019 is much better than this 2023. I never had WiFi signal strength issues with the 2019.This 2023 signal sucks, it works but barely. This might end up my back up instead of the 2019.Glad I got this one cheap not even close to worth the original asking price if I had paid original price it would of been returned."
I have a cover case from my old tablet (which just stopped working) The new tablet I bought will not fit in the case cover that I already had. They are supposed to be the exact same size. According to the box and  Amazon website. Now I will have to buy a new cover. Seems like the new one is made just a fraction smaller so you have to buy a new cover. I am very disappointed that I have to spend more money. I have bought several of these in the past for grandchildren and myself. Amazon should be ashamed that the size would be a fraction smaller than my old one. Personally I think Amazon should give me a new cover since this one is useless! Shame on Amazon that the box says 10.1 but the tablet is a little smaller than what they advertised.
"I have been using Amazon tablets for many years. They are always a little bit slow, but for the price they are a great deal. It is disappointing that they do not have Play store access. Battery life is really good. I find that it's a little slow for charging. Overall, I think Amazon fire tablets are a good value."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Got the tablet for 70 bucks on prime day. It is beautiful with the lilac color, lightweight and the screen is bright. I’ve called support and they told me to factory reset and instal new updates which I did but after trying for a while the problems persist. I’m playing a card game and it constantly freezes. Tried other games and freezes as well but some less than others. My doubt is to keep it because it was so affordable or returning it. In the end I’m going to try and get a replacement because with so many 5 star reviews mine must be defective. There is no reason why a new product should operate like this, even off brand tablets are able to perform well on common tasks. I tried several apps and even browsing is enough to stagger the tablet. Disappointed."
"There isn't a Chrome or Firefox browser in the Appstore. There isn't Google docs, sheets, or calendar, as apps, must be accessed in the Silk browser. There's no Google authenticator. JavaScript performance is okay, but a little slow. It doesn't support the JavaScript web audio API. That's just so far, I've had it less than 24 hours."
"I've owned seven Fire tablets over the years, two 7's, 3 8HD's and 2 10HD 13th Generation.  I've loved every one of them till the latest operating system update to one of my 10HDs.  Only one of my Fire tens has updated to 8.3.2.5 operating system.  Included in this update is a change to the Amazon Photo app and the addition of an app called Gallery.  In the past I had created albums for my photos and was able to view the pictures, in the albums, whether I was at home or away.  With the new update, the only way to view the photos in my albums is when connected to wifi.  The Gallery app lumps all my photos in a single album with no way to of recreating the previous arrangement.  It displays the images by date or in one album.I contacted Customer Service for a solution to this issue and was able to upload needed information to help resolve it.  After weeks, I received an email saying that the engineers said that it is the expected behavior.This is a classic example of software engineers creating content to justify their existence and claiming it's new and improved.  All they've accomplished is to lose a previously loyal customer."
But still very similar to previous models.
Tablet does not support the NFL Plus App
Mainly work puzzles and emails on it
"I have owned quite a few Fire tablets over the years and have liked them all, but, this one is an exception.. It has all the best qualities of its predecessors with the exception of one. It doesn't have a back arrow. Why??? Is Amazon reducing costs by eliminating this feature? Not likely. I just don't get it. Please explain."
"This is the actual Kindle device. It doesn't sync with anything else. I have the kindle app on my iphone and two of my computers and they all sync with each other, but the Kindle device never syncs with anything. I always have to ""Go to Page"" to sync it manually and it is extremely annoying. Not happy."
"This is a great beginner iPad. The A14 chip makes it fast, and it can handle most of the workload that many conventional users would put into it. I use it as an interface for recording musical instruments, and even though I'm aware that iPads are not meant to be used for this, the newer ones tend to handle the processing load of the programs that I use better. Pricing is excellent, though."
"It’s a good iPad and it works well, I just think the camera not being at the top is very weird. You have to use the tablet horizontally for the camera to look normal. 6/10 for me. I liked the 7th generation better with the home button and camera at the top"
Back of new iPad has multiple scuffs/blemishes and appears to be a refurb or second. I've been buying apple devices for a decade and they are always in pristine condition. The photos don't really capture how noticeable the marks are. Returning and buying directly from apple
Seems like a good iPad so far. We bought this on a Black Friday sale or I would have probably returned it for a new one because when we got it there was a pretty significant dent in the back at the top.
This box was cut open on the top. It seems okay but a bag that was delivered was also ripped open. Usually amazon packages are perfect 2 of them have been tampered with prior to delivery.
"The new software they’re using is a Royal pain. I’m so used to what’s on my new phone and old pad that it’s a pain to figure out. Like you can’t shut it down unless you go into settings and find SHUTDOWN! That is my biggest beef. Next is the fingerprint reader! Takes almost 10 min to scan your finger. It’s on the power button which does nothing but turn it on.  NOT HAPPY with this thing and I’ve had it a month! I’ll stick with Apple, but I’ll stick with the older stuff as long as possible in the future! Way too much hassle with the new and usless for me changes."
"Upgrading from an old 5th Gen iPad, I found this to be a very pleasant upgrade overall. The USB-C connection significantly improves the charging process compared to the old lightning cable. With the previous iPad, the lightning cable often caused issues when charging the device during use. There were numerous occasions when I had to stop using the iPad because the battery was nearly dead, and one time it actually died. Now, with the USB-C connection, I can simply plug it in when the battery is low, and it charges while I continue to use it without any problems. Additionally, connecting the iPad to a PC via the USB-C port is much easier, and the cost of replacing a USB-C cable is almost negligible since I have an abundance of them from purchasing other devices. A primary reason for getting a new iPad was the need for a faster device, as my old one was slowing down. The new iPad is noticeably quicker, which is a welcome improvement. Overall, I am very satisfied with the purchase. However, I do have a lingering complaint about Apple's decision to reduce the storage capacity of the device, which I find concerning. Devices should never have less storage or RAM; they always need more. I typically buy the lower-end iPad models since I use them mainly for reading and streaming. My old 5th Gen iPad had 128GB of storage, whereas this 10th Gen iPad only has 64GB. In my opinion, this was not a wise decision by Apple."
This item was opened and unpackaged at one time.  I thought I was getting a new unopened product.
It came with a small mark. As it wasn’t a big difference it was still there I returned it for a new one.
Had it for a few hours so far so good I love it !
Works fine but with a cover it is heavy.
"Searching the internet, social media, shopping, games"
Fully charged to zero is about 4 hours.
It came demage
"Bought for my son as x-mas gift. Box came damaged and dirty so I could not wrap it as it was. Opened to set up ipad and find another creative way to present as a gift. Trying to set it up was a headache, I have never had these kind of issues with an Apple product before so I knew this was a refurb. Since my son is a minor I began setting up this account and it asked me to set age restrictions...well after setting them it literally stayed on that screen even when I hit next a million times. I had to google how to restart it and start over, I did this 4 times. Finally I did a master reset (googled that too), and I was able to restart AGAIN and set him up. When I tell you this was so frustrating and I can only imagine the time it would have taken away from my Son on Christmas trying to set it up for him. PLEASE if you get this ""ipad"" - SET IT UP EARLY! Do not wait until the day of to take it out of the box. I really believe the iPad was damaged upon shipping. The box looked like it had literally been crushed....what a disappointment."
"I am really a bit disappointed, because I bought the iPad to send to my country and the return date passed during the shipping time. If I could, I would ask to exchange it for another one. The iPad has hardly been used and the battery does not hold a charge."
You would think for a brand new ipad that both speakers would work. The speaker on the right doesnt work. To shut down ipad i have to go into settings and hit shut off. The buttons on the face of the ipad do not shut it off.
So I am deciding to write a review in case others come to see if they have similar issues. It’s been exactly a year and for the last month or so the screen has at random times not responded to touch. I will be reaching out to Apple.
The ipad didn’t have some functions like not supporting second generation of the apple pencil 2 but overall it is still great for it’s s price
"I just wasted an extra $400 buying a newer Apple iPad Air 11 inch because four people at the Apple help desk could not figure out why my voice dictation wasn’t working.The new iPad 11 inch air also didn’t work with voice dictation, but,  this time, I was lucky enough to read an online post that said it could be the case or the screen protector. It turned out it was the screen protector.I could have kept this older, less expensive model if only somebody at Apple has suggested taking off the screen protector. I’m pretty irked, to say a least.Just for the record, my old iPad Air four worked fabulously until the battery suddenly became an issue after three years."
doesn't seem any better or worse than my 6th generation
"As an entry level iPad it’s pretty good. I needed a cheaper version of the iPad for my upcoming camping trip. The one thing I don’t like, it feels hallow, just like the iPad Air….The screen is not glass. I’ve been an iPad user since day one and this model and the iPad Air come with a “plastic” screen.This model definitely is slower than my other iPad, but I think it will do what I need this for. Hope to have an update after my trip."
I was expecting more slim design. Touch is good but not that smooth.
When I purchased this iPad w wifi.  I thought after time I could have data connected to it from my phone service but that was impossible to have  after I found out it was too late to return the iPad so it’s just used at home with wifi.  I am not able to travel with it without connecting to the wifi from local places.  Wrong idea
I wish I has bought an older generation . These is no home button.everything is slide .the on off button is awkward to use as you need to press two buttons at once . Not a simple device and hard to like it .I bought 10 th generation . My husband has 9 th gen and it is so much more user friendly
"Product is great.However delivered late. ordee was not processed, delivery date just kept extending. it was only processed after i called to complain. It was a gift and did not make it on time despite ordering it early to account for unexpected issues."
"I went from a 128GB iPad to this one.  While I thought that it would be enough, I was wrong.  As I transferred my information, I found out that it was already full. A bad way to start for a new iPad life.  My wife convinced me that I need to upgrade to the 256GB, which I feel is overkill, since I will undoubtedly add more to it.So I ordered a 256GB and will be returning the 64GB.  I just didn’t want to spend the additional $150 for it.  The screen is bigger than my 2017 iPad and I swear that I will do one OS upgrade and that will be end of it since by the time it can’t upgrade anymore, it will be too late and the iPad will slow down to the point of not worth using."
Low volume quality and when i'm on facetime they say I sound like i'm under water. It's pointless to keep paying on this product.
Everything else is great however the iPad arrived with a damaged power button .
I very much liked it and all was fine but after short of 2 weeks it got over heated.  Just hot. 2 days after it cooled down but I didn't want to wait for the warranty to expire in case it happened again.  I waited a long time for that purchase and now I have to look for another one. I am returning it. Hesitant bying the same  the same thing.
"I'm really disappointed. I've had my previous iPad since 2019. It's still working OK, but no longer holds a battery charge. But I expected a big improvement in this new device. Instead, the screen resolution seems worse then the 2019 model, no sound performance improvement (volume is poor), the camera placement on the back is awkward for holding the device, the slightly bigger size is uncomfortable, and I miss the home button terribly.Not a good choice for disabled users with low fine motor skills:The case assortment is minimal. That may not be a big deal to some people, but I have nerve damage in my arms and hands and require a case that is easy to grip. For anyone out there with fine motor skill problems, I'd seriously warn against this device. Go to a store and test it out. The lackmof home button really slows down switching between apps, and I can't do the basic gestures. I've programmed in some easier ones with the accessibility options, but it's not ideal. The width in landscape mode is so uncomfortable to hold, and the lack of a ""buffer"" area around the screen means I keep hitting the screen by mistake.When I opened my box, there were fingerprints on the shiny parts of the device, which makes me wonder if Amazon sent me a used one. I won't be buying expensive electronics from Amazon in the future. I'll do it in person in a store.My advice: skip this one:I wish I'd waited a few months and gotten whatever new device, 11th Gen, comes out next, as this was so underwhelming. As far as I can tell, there are no new features, yet it is physically harder to use. I keep reaching for and using my 2019 iPad instead of this new one. It took me so long to get a properly fitting case that I missed the return window."
"This iPad is okay if you have a child or just want something simple for mini games, however it’s processor is way slower than my 2019 IPad Pro as well as the screen reaction time is slower too. I notice my older iPad feels way smoother when switching between apps & the Home Screen. Another note: this iPad does NOT have a flashlight… idk if that really matters but for scanning documents having a flashlight is useful when using an iPad. The black boarders around the screen are extremely thick as well as the iPad itself it’s very heavy. I’m unsure of why it’s heavy seeing as it’s bringing nothing to the table other than looks.. it’s cute but if you’re looking to UPGRADE, I would recommend going on apple.com/compare so you can compare you previous model to the next one you’re interested in getting & you can see the specifications on the devices ☺️"
"I used my previous early-generation iPad extensively as my electronic flight bag and never had a problem with battery life. This new-generation iPad works well and has GPS and more memory, but it does not provide long battery life for my intensive flight or boating apps."
"I brough this iPad for work purposed, but it's not allowed me to do what I needs it too.  i need to exchange for more Wi- fi build in not internet access outside the house."
"One of the main reasons to buy a new iPad is the out of the box ease of startup and info transfer. Not so with this one, which comes with a forced install of the buggy IOS 18 and the install doesn’t work on this iPad. I had to get an appointment at a local store, where I spent an hour waiting for them to use a PC to push through the install. We have two Macs at home and neither was able to do it. The Amazon support staff want me to use iTunes which hasn’t been available for years now. I suggest waiting until the new IOS is further along in its catch-and-release cycle before purchasing, or go directly to an Apple Store to buy it so they can do the setup right there."
"My iPad box had been opened, but I ordered a NEW. If I wanted to order an open-box I could better save 20$ and do so… not a pleasant experience"
"This is a very attractive case, but it is 15 ounces compared to others at 1-2 ounces.  It adds a lot of extra weight to hold and carry."
"Pros:1. Visual pleasing to the eyes.2. Comes in different colors. Pink was my pick.3. Processor runs smoothly.4. Siri runs smoothly and fast.5. Folders allow apps to be organized.6. Apple pen 1 works excellent with the 10 generation.7. FaceTime crisp and clear.8. WiFi and Bluetooth connects quickly,9. Apple gives 3 months free trial on their tv and etc.Major Cons:1. Hardware issue with on and off button on the iPad gen 10. I did research after my IPad would not turn off. Research said it was a known hardware issue in Gen 10. However, Siri will turn off for you if you tell her.2. This company will not exchange the IPad, only accept returns minus the tax paid.My intake from interaction with this seller:The seller only offered a return, no exchange allowed.  Seller only gives back the computer cost and not the tax paid for iPad. Seller raised cost for pink iPad by 20 dollars on Amazon website. To send back and wait for refund  takes up to seven business days. Cost to send back and rebuy would cost would increase due to iPad color price increase, the loss of tax already paid, and the added new tax fee for new iPad. I added up the addition cost. It would be close to 100.00 for the same color and specs. So, the only choice I’m left with is to be stuck with the IPad unless I want to pay out around another 100.00 more after waiting for refund, then buy a new one, and wait for its delivery. That would put wait time about 1.5 weeks for a new computer to be delivered. That is a long wait when it is needed like yesterday.My only other solution:Contact Apple limited warranty to see if they will back up their Apple product and their solution.Lesson learned:Purchase iPad directly from Apple website. Cost is the same. Apple website offers an optional free engraving on their Ipad 10 generation.  The wait to receive Ipad is about a week.I hope my review will help others when deciding what is best for them and their decision on Ipad purchase."
The Ad Shows an Apple Pencil but it did not come with one. Misleading and very uncool sales tactic.
"For me, not worth the money. Just and over sized iPhone. Should have bought a computer."
Okay but did not realize you could buy one with cellular capabilities.
"As a long time diehard Ipad user for both work and pleasure I naively believed much couldn’t get by me in the marketing sales pitch on these $321.00 new Ipads.  Wrong.  Nowhere does it indicate that using the rear camera is impossible to use for selfies. Or use for anything at all.  Before you waste a bunch of time looking for the ""portrait"" mode don't bother there isn't one.  In the last 2 years alone I have used my Ipad 9- Air to take a thousand pictures using the rear camera or selfie mode for pictures of so many family/friends/pets.. spur of the moment.  Cherished memories for sure.  What a stunning snow job with this item!The rear facing camera is a huge staple who would think to notice there isn't one that works or the lack of it mentioned in Apples description, copy attached to this review above, when shelling out hundreds of dollars believing this is such a great deal.  Maybe this is your first time owning an Ipad..  maybe it's taken you a very long time to finally be able to afford one.. if that is the case the cheap shot Apple just took at you is almost criminal.In addition to the camera situation the battery life is horrible!  Even after spending 4- hours deleting all ofApples useless built in utilities and going through each and every system to shut off crap that takes upspace, or scarier, shut down every one of their systems that collects your information, the battery lastsfor 3- hours tops. After fully charging it quickly went down to less than 10% within 3- hours of doing nothing but reading an online news ""paper"".  If I had young children or in their teens I would be very, very hesitant to let them use this IPad.  There are no less than 10 built in applications tracking you and gathering your personal information, maybe more.  It makes sense now why they've posted that legal notice in the main description ^^."
"Great speed BUT I hate that you've done away with the ""Home"" button.  My iPad (10th Generation) will lock up trying to switch from my Brainium Solitare game to anywhere.  I get this blank stare and NOTHING!  I've got to ""fiddle"" with the existing physical button to try to get it to shut down so I can restart it.  Most times it will wake up.  Good thing I've done away with my violent response when things go wrong.There must be an issue with its software that causes the lock-up or whaterver term you'd like"
"I ordered 2 of these and received one in an open dented Apple branded box.  The second was ""packaged"" in a brown shipping box rattling around loose with a used charger and cable.  I wanted new and was disappointed the sale price was too good to be true."
"If you have a newer iPhone with an OLED screen you are going to hate the screen quality on this ipad It's very low resolution compared to any OLED screen on smartphones today. I returned this because it hurt my eyes to look at in comparison to a modern smartphone. This display looks the same as the one you find on the ipad 3 but phone screens have drastically improved so this one is just rough to use.Last, Don't buy this on Amazon I returned to whole foods as they requested about 10 days ago. They confirmed they received the return but I still haven't gotten a refund. I even selected refund to my Amazon account and it's literally this slow. Def considering canceling prime bc of the con games Amazon plays with your money once they have it. Again, this ipad has a low quality LCD screen so I suggest you avoid. It's pretty much the same as any budget android tablet screen. You definitely will care and you will notice if you have an oled smartphone so be warned."
The tablet itself is fine and easy to use but I am really disappointed in the battery life.I have an iPad 8th generation and I bought the 10th because the battery is failing.This brand new 10th is not much better.
"The box came dirty with fingerprints (I think with grease or some sticky product) and mistreated, it is a gift for someone and I didn't like that detail of the box. Other than that the iPad is fine"
"The iPad packaging came super dirty, looks like grease. What’s weirder is that the actual iPad itself had some grease marks too..? Functionality wise is fine, hopefully no issues will come up"
"Bought an IPad 10 generation in April and now when I plug in the charger it gives me a picture Of a cord and some other  symbol, I was hoping that it would have survived longer than 7 months"
"Almost all of my devices are Apple and I have been happy with them .  However, this is the exception.  To say I hate it is putting it mildly.  The on off button rarely functioned.  Loading info from another Apple Ipad to this one proved to be impossible.  Swiping the screen and getting results was a joke.  I spent HOURS trying to load my information.  Called Customer Service but kept getting passed around.  Finally they sent me to Apple who sent me back to where I started because the screen would keep freezing.  Sending it back is also proving to be a fools errand. I must now sit around and wait for UPS to come and pick it up. What happened to taking it in to a return center?  I was told Apple will not allow it!  I read a lot and wanted and needed a new Ipad, expressly for my reading instead I got nothing but days of frustration."
"Overall decent iPad. Bought to replace an old, outdated one. The battery life has turned out to be very upsetting. Seems I constantly have to be charging it. Sound isn’t great either."
"When I work on it, the battery only lasts about four to five hours. And it gets really hot.I didn’t realize I would have to plug it in all the time. My granddaughter has a old model and she leaves hers unplugged all day and it doesn’t go dead.Seems like my old one was a little bit better in that way. The brightness is good. It’s easy to use."
"Have an older IPAD which I loved but Apple no longer will let it update so one by one my apps no longer function so I bought a new one.  Out of the box it asked me if I wanted to transfer the information from the old IPAD and I said yes.  So I put both on chargers and close to one another and they started doing their thing.  However, after doing that overnight, they still are in transfer mode.  I was allowed to stop the process on the old one but the new one refuses to stop or even turn off.  So, at the moment it is useless and so is Apple help.  Trying to decide whether to send it back."
"I cannot get this ipad to not sync with my personal apple phone!  This was a for for a different new user.  It would not let me make a new account for the individual.  So, all my pictures transferred & messages to this new ipad already took away 38 GB, out of 50GB should gave since my phone had that much gone.  This is so unacceptable & if I was aware - I would of went to Apple store to buy.  Then, the cover cade that I as well purchased saidvit was to git the ipad does not.  So, all a waste of money - threw that right out the window.  Just presented the gift and now no return!"
"Don’t like: no earplugs, sound settings complex & not loud enough, not worth the price, battery doesn’t last as long as described. I wanted this bigger size, but also expected more functionality in apps herein… nope. Disappointed!"
"first of all my package came in a smooshed box, granted the mail drivers deal with many packages and don’t know what’s in each one, you’d think amazing would at least throw in some bubble wrap, no. hard brown paper smooshed on top on my already opened ipad box. i don’t remember buying my ipad reused but that’s okay, i’m grateful there isn’t any chips or cracks in the screen but only half of the sound works on the dang thing. oh well, the rich get richer and the poor stay poor :) great ipad and it works like it should, just makes me uncomfortable when my things are A. obviously not taken care of and B. messed with without my proper knowledge"
My dislike is it telling me I have to change my email address I've had this email for years & dont want to change it . Can you help me to keep my email .
"My wife has been using ipads for the past decade. She loves the ability to use facetime with our children and grandchildren. She has been through 3-4 ipads in that timeframe so she's more than familiar with how to use them.After about a month of this purchase, the audio has been acting up. She hears the other side fine however the other side does not hear her.I went through all of her setting and everything was set up fine so not really sure what the problem was.Called the Apple Store and just get thrown into constant looping and never get answers."
"Everything is great so far, but they did give me the wrong charger for this."
I didn't receive the keyboard or pencil that was supposed to be included.
This product was advertised to work with the Apple Pencil.  I ordered the one that was supposed to work.  Will not pair nor recognize.  I'm now stuck with an iPad that won't work for the purpose I purchased it.  NOT a happy customer.  Amazon will not allow me to return the iPad.
This doesn’t hold much. Save your money and go for the larger one.
"I purchased this iPad on August 10, 2023. I am studying Radiography and am required to have an iPad with the HanDBase application for clinical tracking. If I don't have an iPad with the HanDBase app when I show up for clinical rotations I will be sent home and receive an absence. This is not good - anyone in school for the medical field will say that these programs are strict. So, I did the responsible thing and purchased a NEW, 10th GEN iPad. And it has been great for almost six months. Today I noticed it didn't charge when I plugged it in. I tried other outlets and other charge cords/blocks to no avail. I did all the troubleshooting - restart, hard restart, reset the entire device. It IS covered under a basic one-year warranty so I've made an appointment to get it fixed on Monday - but I have no idea how long the repair will take and need it by Thursday at 8 am. I'm so disappointed and frustrated. I've kept it in a case, and never let it get anywhere near moisture; I've always taken good care of it and this is unacceptable - a product like this should last longer than six months. What are my options now? Buy ANOTHER iPad? Ridiculous. Get an unexcused absence because of a faulty charging port? More ridiculous."
I’ve had this product since June 2024 and it only last 3 hours with battery life. Do not recommend. Highly disappointed. I literally only downloaded 3 apps on it.
"Day one found, then see how it is going..."
"This is my fourth I pad, I bought my first two several years apart after great service and really liked them both. Still have one that is several years old and it’s battery will stay up as long as this new one. In 2000 got a new 12’9 screen bigger one. I like it and it was the last one I got but it also has never kept a charge very long since new. I just live with it and keep the charge cord on it while using. I got this 10.9 really just because it advertised that the battery life would last all day so I was suckered into thinking it was going to do that. Never dreamed it would go down soooo Quick. I thought this morning that i would just return it since it does not last long and my old one works just as well and found out that the return day expired a few days age. I have not even had it a month usually get at least 30 days to return stuff. Wish I had my $550. Plus tax back. If you want a ipad that last a long time after full charge this one is not it. Very disappointing!!!"
The on and off set up is inconvenient
"My wife said it felt cheap, so returned it."
Whenever I’m in calls I sound fat and people have a hard timeUnderstanding what I’m saying something wrong with the microphone
"It's a strange product. The performance is fine. The quality and condition is broken down. The box is terrible, it tumbles during shipping. There's no plastic or padding anywhere anymore. And, it looks like there's some fibers right behind the screen glass. Otherwise, it's small, light and beautiful."
"There is much to like about this, but not everything is greatThe removal of the home button takes a lot of getting used toThe process to shut this off is over complicatedI am not sure how you do a hard reboot, which may be necessary if the device becomes unresponsive."
Ipad came in with the corner of the box dented and didn’t turn on. I then charged it for what seemed like forever for it to turn on and I then realized it was the incorrect version I intended to order.
"I bought the pink iPad for my daughter’s birthday in May. From the start it didn’t come with a charger to support the iPad, the iPad did not charge with the charger provided and when it did finally work, it was slow charging.It’s now June and the iPad is turning off while in use then powers back on after 5 min.This isn’t my first iPad purchase but this is the worse experience with an iPad I’ve had. I have the same iPad from a different store and no issues what so ever. I regret I spent my hard earned money to make my daughter’s birthday special with this iPad all for it to malfunction already. She had an iPad for 3 years with no issues but wanted this pink one."
"Bought an Ipad pro in 2019. The newest 10th generation not only feels like a cheap piece of plastic (screen) and the pencil touching the screen feels uncomfortable. How can 5 years make a product worse?For one, I can't use the original pencil i bought for the pro 5 years ago. It's somehow not compatable with the new 10TH GENERATION NEW IPAD! Instead, I had to buy a NEW pencil for 65 bucks (save your money buy the cheap off brand one and here's why: THERE IS NO DOUBLE TAP FUNCTION ON THE USB C crap-tastic pencil) It has to charge via a cord. My earlier one was wireless and connected to the ipad itself. Someplace, I have an off market pencil that probably wouldn't work either, but at least that one charged wireless and was only 18 bucks.Apple, if I wanted a crappy tablet, I would have bought a crappy tablet. This thing is garbage compared to my 5 year old tablet.Stellar job. Just stellar."
"This is my 4th IPad. I made a mistake and bought the 64GB version. This holds almost NOTHING!. The price is wonderful, but not worth buying due to the lack of any realistic capacity. Lesson learned. Daaahhhhh."
"Our house burned down and ILost my IPad that I loved,  I have been trying to figure the new home me out for weeks now, I’m so frustrated,  How could it be so diffrent? I followed the instructions on the trouble shooter I could not even get on the thing,  Now that I’m on it I’m still can’t g e t it to work  I’m very disappointed"
Apple needs to step it up a little bit. The iPads don't change much every year but they market it as a new product.
"This is a sleek, quick running tablet, that is gorgeous. That said, I was buying it for my son as an upgrade from his Amazon Fire. We have no other Apple devices (we use Samsung phones/ PCs) and the device is basically freaking useless without another Apple device if you care about setting up parental controls. The app download approvals CAN be done ""in person"" but then it sends a 2 step verification text to my phone. After downloading 10 apps while setting it up, I was locked out of my account because I was sent ""too many verification codes."" I tried using the last code I was sent, like the iPad said to do, and then I got completely locked out for ""too many incorrect verification attempts.""There's no way to turn off ""Ask to Buy"" if you don't have another Apple device 🙃, so my son's new tablet was basically useless and couldn't be set up until I was allowed back into my account.Sending it back and getting a Samsung Galaxy Tab instead."
"This ipad came without a charger.  And the add boasts and ""all day charge"" and this iPAD only lasts 3-4 hours with a 100% full charge.  I like the size of the screen and it was easy to set up.  When I called Apple they said they could not send me a separate charger.  I won't be ordering again."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The iPad had horizontal lines going through the screen. I was very disappointed as soon as I noticed this. As this is supposed to be an early Christmas gift. As I’m typing this review; We decided to restart the IPad to get it ready to be returned and the lines have now disappeared. I will keep an eye out. If the lines return I will go ahead and return the iPad immediately. But for now the rate will stay at 2 stars.
Love the functionality and look' but it looks like a dead pixel or some sort of dust is already behind the screen. Of course return window closed yesterday' 👎
Battery life is terrible. At most if watching a show on it you get about 4 hrs life starting at 100%. I would say it’s a nuisance.
I had this iPad a few months and now all of sudden it freezes won't turn on or off. I tried everything and it won't work.
Screen froze several times within hours of receiving it.
"I was looking very forward to using the new iPad, it even looked nice out of the box.... and the screen came broken. I can be very satisfied with anything as look as the screen is fine, like a scratched cover, heck, even a scratched screen, even a small dead pixel wouldn't dissatisfied me,  or even some minor things, but the actual screen being broken is one of my limit. I will make sure to update this when I get another iPad after sending this one back. I hope to have a better experience than this."
"I purchased this iPad on October 22nd as a gift for my daughter. She has loved using her iPad up until today, her iPad died and now it will not charge. She is using the charger that came with the iPad and it is not reacting at all. The iPad is not hot or cold. For some reason it just is not charging. To be as expensive as it is, this should not be an issue. I am going to contact the seller and Apple for a resolution. No reason a device purchased less than 3 weeks ago is not charging."
This comes with a short power cord.  I’ll need to buy an additional power cord unless I set a table at the wall where the outlet is located.  The picture is very clear and bright which is a good thing for an elderly person.  The jack for earbuds is 3.5 which means another extra purchase.
"The ipad works fine and i understand that it’s used but it came with literal crumbs sitting on it out of the box. It also had finger prints on the back, I don’t care that the box was taped together but why couldn’t the ipad be wiped down before it was shipped out??? gross"
"I replaced my 9th generation Ipad with this 10th generation. Every single day it gets worse and worse. It disconnects from my Beats in the middle of my workouts. It does not automatically connect to any wifi. It does not automatically connect to Bluetooth. I'm out of space and I did was download Tidal. I've taken it to the Apple store and they can't understand what's going on with the device. I want to return the IPad. I have never been so pissed at a purchase like I am with this one!! The battery doesn't last, even when I dont use it the battery drains."
"I made a huge mistake.  I have been using Android phones, computers and tablets since 1974.  I currently have an Amazon Fire HD tablet that I bought two years ago for $79 during Prime daythat has been giving me some problems..  Every thing makes logical sense in the OS.  Starting to use this iPad has been a shock.  I brought because it was in the midrange of prices for a new tablet of any kind.  I wrongly thought that is has to be similar to Android after all this time and playing second fiddle.  There is no logic.  Their mail program does not work right with AOL.  Safari does not even display a full Internet address which I need for my writing.  Tabs in Android are a thousand percent better than what Apple offers.  I know I will eventually have to use it full time, but it will not be fun for a while.  I would not recommend changing from Android to Apple unless you absolutely have to."
"If you are a student like me, you want the Ipad Air. The compatibility with the apple pencils sucks. All I wanted was to use the newest apple pencil because it has every feature I need. ALAS. This Ipad is not compatible with it. Otherwise, I’m happy with the device."
"I haven’t purchased and iPad since the 2nd generation and was really surprised to see how previous versions quality was far superior. The screen sound like plastic every time you use the pencil. Overall, it works well but the materials are really poor."
"Ok, yes the tablet is fine. However, I’ve had this for about 8 months and I’m having a problem with the touchpad already. I shouldn’t be having issues with that. It’s very frustrating when I tap it and I have to tap it 4 or 5 times more to get it to work. And they claim it has an all day battery life!?  Not even when I first got it did it have an all day battery life. When I first bought it, it had maybe a 5 hour battery life. Now, it’s only two hours. Tops!  Did I get a used tablet?  This is my third iPad. And it will probably be my last. I’m not going to waste my money on iPads or iPhones for that matter.  If you have one and bring it with you everywhere, make sure you bring a charger."
When I received the iPad the box was heavily damaged and I was given no discount when I asked. I feel like for the price it should be in pristine condition when it arrives at my door step.
The box was open and the tablet was used. If I pay $500 I expect it to be new
"Like the iPad, but not that they sold me one that had been returned. It was in the original box, but had been opened and repackaged. iPad appears to work, but was dirty and someone had partially setup an account. Happy to pay less for a used one, but not okay to sell an open box return as new.I recommend you check the box for a label with an ""LPN"" number and adding packing tape to repackage. Apparently that means it's likely a return."
"It was working great until June 2024 when it completely stopped working. The screen turned black and you couldn’t turn it on, so we took it to a local screen fixing place and he told us to go to apple for help. I went to Apple with an appointment and they just said that it’s unfixable. I want my money back!"
"I bought this IPad because I thought it would be a good investment since my old iPad Pro battery was going out and because the screen was already cracked on it. I didn’t feel like it would be worth it to get it repaired. I did my research before purchasing this one. I read all of the specifications. I was especially excited about the 10 hours of surfing and the better processor. However, upon using it. I found that I only have be on it for a 3 hours (not continuously) and the battery would be down to like 37 percent. After adjusting my power saving features and turning off certain apps. The battery life only improved a little at best. So I’ve traded my old Pro that I had for 5 years for a new one with poor battery. Disappointed!"
"I bought this early in May for my spouse's Birthday gift. Her birthday was June 30. It is NOT a good iPad. The battery drains completely in a few hours. The screen freezes too often. The iPad will, without prompting or warning, restart. This is a touch screen, the screen only responds to touch around the outside inch or two screen perimeter. Normally I would return this as a defective product. However, I bought the gift early and the ""return window"" expired JUNE 21 and she didn't get it until JUNE 30. I hate to leave such a bad review, but I have no other way to possibly contact the seller. And, because it was opened after the return date had expired, there appears to be no other way to contact the seller. So I  hope the SELLER sees this and opts to either exchange for a working iPad or refund me. Please know that my spouse is a 100% Disabled Veteran and the iPad was a way to stay connected with the outside world, family and friends. Please help me help my Veteran. Thank you!"
"I've had the Fire Tablet Max for several months now. Initially, I really loved it. I wanted an ebook reader with a large enough screen to read my Kindle books, plus I wanted the functionality of having a Personal Assistant. Plus, I wanted something I could go online with. At first, the Fire Max 11 provided, well, 2.5 of the 3. As an ebook reader, it's great. With the larger screen, I can easily read books from my Kindle library, so I'm very happy with that.I can go online BUT the Fire Max 11, like all Amazon tablets, uses only Amazon Silk browser and only apps from the Amazon App Store. Many apps I would  like to use are not available, like Dropbox, Adobe Acrobat (to read pdf's), Internet security, and many othes. And while it has Bluetooth, I've thus far not been able to pair my laptop with my Fire tablet. My computer will pair and connect but the Fire Max Tablet will NOT, even when the ""numbers"" match on my computer and tablet. So there's no way to share files except with the USB. I haven't tried that yet, so can't speak to whether it works or not. However, because most of the files I want to view on the Fire Max 11 tablet are pdf files, there's no way to read them without a PDF viewer. So, that's a downside, as well as the limited apps from the Amazon app store. Also, there's no way to add an antivirus or firewall or adblockers, either. So going online is extremely limited without the security one would like to have.Finally, Amazon Alexa. Initially, she was a godsend. I  could be reading an article on the NY Times or Washington Post app (both of which are available in the app store), ask Alexa a definition of a word, and she would give it, all while my Fire Max 11 stayed on the article screen, which provided a streamless reading experience. Since I could choose to have Alexa respond even when the device is locked, I could wake up in the morning and ask her the time, the temp/weather, and she would respond immediately. I  could set reminders and alarms and she would give me my reminders even when I wasn't using the  Fire Max 11 tablet and the screen was locked. The same with alarms. So if you wanted to set an alarm for each morning, that worked quite well. The only issue I had  was that for some unfathomable reason, Amazon designed the cover for the Fire Max 11 to actually cover the speakers, so that the sound is greatly reduced and sometimes hard to hear or even miss. The cover should open and close on opposite sides to work well with the speakers.However, since Alexa's latest update a few days ago, all that functionality is gone. Frankly, I'd fire the tech team that came up  with this update. I've come to the conclusion that Amazon intends to phase out having Alexa function as a personal assistant on the Amazon Fire tablets, much as Microsoft Windows phased out Cortana from functioning as a personal assistant in Windows (a big mistake, imo).The first thing I noticed after the update is that  when I spoke Alexa's name, a textbox, much like the one you'd see on your phone if sending a text or using Messenger to send a message, pops up. So, if  I'm reading an article now on the Washington Post, NYTimes, etc., and ask Alexa for a word definition or who a person mentioned in the article is, the screen reverts to Alexa's text screen immediately. Their customer care team says that's so we can ""see what we say and how Alexa responds"" - which I think is idiotic. However, since the screen  leaves the news app, in order to get back to the article I was reading, I have to close out Alexa's ""new""  text screen, go back to the home screen on the tablet, select the news app again, and go back to the article I was reading. WAY TOO MUCH hassle, does NOT make for a seamless reading experience, and frankly, it's  just as fast to use  an old-fashioned dictionary. So that functionality  is  lost.Perhaps more importantly, Alexa no longer works when the device is locked. I don't know about you, but I don't use my tablet 24/7. There are times during the day when the screen is inactive or when the cover is closed.  Since I want to protect the screen on my tablet from spills, accidental falls or something falling on it, and prevent cracking or breaking, or getting liquid from say, coffee or water on it, I close it when not in use. Closing it automatically locks the device. Not sure if it used to in the beginning, because Alexa would still work back then, even with the cover closed, but it does now. Also, the device automatically locks after a period of time - which I can set at certain increments between 5 min and 30 minutes. There is no option not to lock the device at all after a period of inactivity. And why would I not want to have that security? First of all, to keep the Fire Tablet Max always active, would take up  alot of battery power. That means I'd have to keep it plugged in all the time or  be constantly recharging it, which wears down the battery. And the purpose of a tablet is  to have a mobile device, so keeping it plugged it makes it more difficult to use, especially because the charging cord is less than 3 ft long. I'd say more like 24 -28 inches. So, that's not really feasible. And again, probably not good for the battery.However, since Alexa no longer responds from the lockscreen, it's not just that she doesn't respond to questions, but the reminders and alarms no longer work now, either, unless the device is active and I'm using it. That rather defeats the purpose, since if I set an alarm to wake me up, I'm sleeping and so not using my Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet - meaning it's locked and the alarm won't work. If I set a reminder for a birthday, to take out the garbage, a doctor's appt or whatever, I will no longer get that reminder unless I am actively using the tablet. That, too, defeats the purpose of a reminder, because I have to remind myself with some other device, to make sure I'm using the Fire Max 11 tablet at the time the reminder (or alarm) is scheduled, so I can get it. And if I have to set a clock alarm and paste a sticky note on it why I set it, like so that I can unlock my tablet so Alexa can remind me to take a pill or that it's someone's birthday, etc., then I already have the reminder on a sticky note and an alarm clock that goes off so that I'll read the sticky note. No need for Alexa. But also, no functional Personal Assistant, either.So, again, Alexa on the Fire Tablet Max 11, and I'm guessing all tablets, has been essentially  neutered in her functionality as a Personal Assistant. So I'm guessing, although customer care denies it, that she's being phased out on the tablets, which I can't understand. Frankly, this update looks more like it should have been only for a phone, and not for a tablet. When I go to the help section now, for example, it gives specific instructions for help with Alexa on mobile phones or on Echo devices, BUT NOT TABLETS. It's as though the update was meant for a different device, but all devices got it. And there's no way to undo it.Here's some of the literally  stupid responses I've gotten from customer care: 1. To not see the text box pop up when I say the ""woke word"", aka ""Alexa"", they've told me to disable hands-free Alexa. Well, that means the only way I can use Alexa to ask a question, give a command, etc....wait for it....IS TO USE THE TEXT BOX AND MESSAGE HER. So how does that ""solution"" even made a modicum of sense? IT DOESN'T. If I don't want to see the text box or use the text box, why would I make it so that's ALL I see and can use? Not sure who thought that one up, but it's literally laughable it's so idiotic.A second solution I've been told is to do a factory reset and then Alexa will be in it's original state - maybe. I shouldn't have to tell an Amazon tech specialist why that solution won't work, but I bet most of the people reading this  can guess. Yep, once you do a factory reset, you not only wipe out all your data and have to setup the device all over again, BUT all those apps that are installed, including Alexa, will begin to update. (Alexa comes embedded in the Amazon Fire Max 11 software, so it updates automatically.) In a matter of hours, or even days, you'll have to do the reset all over again. Great way to literally ruin your tablet. Or maybe Amazon's plan to have you keep replacing them? Fool me once and all that. There'd be no second purchase.Oh, and as I mentioned, Amazon Alexa is embedded in the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet software, much like Cortana used to be embedded in Windows (and is now embedded in Microsoft Office 365 and only works with office applications). There's no way to uninstall her and reinstall her.  Or even just uninstall her. I suppose I could just disable her, I'm not sure. But again, she can't function as a Personal Assistant if she's disabled.Oh, and here's the  final bright solution one tech gave me: ""Tell Alexa to exit Show Mode"". I tried several times to tell her that my tablet isn't IN show mode, so how can Alexa exit from something that isn't enabled? She kept insisting, though, so I unlocked my device and told Alexa to ""Exit Show Mode."" Alexa's response: ""Sorry, I can't help with that."" The agent asked me to do it again (rotflmao). So I did. ""Alexa, exit Show Mode"". Alexa: ""Sorry,  I can't help with that.""Alexa is officially dead as a Personal Assistant on the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet. I'm guessing this is true of all the tablets, but I can't speak to that. I just know that functionality is gone on my Fire Max 11 tablet. I've called and complained and told them all of what I've said here, but to no avail. There's no way for me to ""roll back"" the update to the previous version. Again, my guess is that this update was more intended for Alexa apps on mobile PHONES, but so far I've not gotten an answer on that. But just looking at the ""new"" Help section, all the solutions or issues listed now  are specifically for mobile phones, whereas previously that was not the case.So, while I would have initially given the Fire Max 11 tablet 4 stars, without Alexa, I'm downgrading it to 1 star. In my opinion, buy a real tablet if you want a Personal Assistant. Just don't buy one that has Alexa. Buy one with either Siri or Google Assistant. While one customer service agent tried to tell me they're no good, I know people who have ipads and other Android tablets who use the Personal Assistant all the time, with no problem.Why  Amazon would remove itself from this market, i.e., having a tablet with a functioning Personal Assistant, is beyond my comprehension, but that is what they did. So therefore, no longer worth the money.And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Apps that are suspicious and full of ads abound in the Amazon App store, but functional apps like antivirus and security software are nowhere to be found. You can't even find a  Starbucks app!So as a tablet, I could not recommend this. Whatever potential or functionality this glorified Kindle reader had is now just that - a Kindle ebook reader. Shame on Amazon. This tablet had real potential to compete with some of the other tablets on the market, but instead, Amazon shows its short-sightedness by taking away even the limited functionality it had in this last update.And  don't even get me going on its ""customer care"". Clearly, that has been outsourced to a planet or country where solutions are not part of the package and representatives barely speaking intelligible English read from lame scripts that are laughable, as in the examples I have already given.After using this tablet  for several months now, I've had to downgrade my review down to a 1 star. All that's left on it, really, is the Kindle app. It's great for reading books, but that's all. Of course, Amazon could, in their infinite lack of imagination and competence, decide to take that away, too, at some point. As a Kindle ereader, I could offer some suggestions here, too.All in all, this device does not qualify as a true tablet. The name is misleading and Amazon should really downgrade the description, to be fair to consumers."
"Bought my first Android tablet (a Galaxy Tab S9) today. Why?  If you want a tablet simply to watch videos, shop on Amazon, read Kindle books, play a few games and use a few apps, there's probably no better deal than the Max, and the S9 is both way more expensive and complicated to set up than the Fire (unless you've got a Samsung smartphone.) But I am tired of needing to boot the Max 2 or 3 times in a row before it truly works. I'm tired of the Max hanging and kicking me out of apps. Now, I have a lot of apps and do a lot of multitasking so I've probably simply outgrown Amazon. I  hope this helps with your decision-making.9/25/2023:TL;DR - By the start of this month, I had had it with this tablet. When it worked, it was fine. But it froze constantly, kicked me out of apps, took up to 2 minutes to reboot, sometimes required two reboots in succession to work properly. But on Sept. 16, the OS was updated to version 8.3.2.0. In the past two weeks, most of the problems have disappeared. There are still occasional glitches, but recovery is quick.I'm hoping this won't change, but will update this review if it does.N.B. This is my 8th Fire Tablet, starting with the original. My current tablet is the HD10 (2021)N.B. The restore problem has more or less (maybe less) been fixed (see below), so I've upgraded my review to 3 stars.July 3, 2023 Update to Performance section.What kind of buyers should look at this tablet?Apple users? You're kidding, right? Of course not.Android users who want a  less expensive tablet? Not unless they're willing to accept a stripped down, less functional interface. Skins for Android are usually designed to enhance the experience. Amazon, on the other hand, removes functionality and is based on Android11which is, per The Verge, nearly 3 generations out of  date. I don't know if this is by design, contracts with Google or what. But Amazon clearly has no interest in competing in the wider Android market and doesn't mind shortchanging its own customers.The Amazon ecosystem? Yes. If, like me, you have hitched your pony to Amazon Prime and Kindle, yes, then take a look because it does appear to be the best Fire tablet yet. I ordered it because my 2021 HD10 has slowed to the point where molasses moves faster. I am hoping I can get this Fire to work without spending hours and hours and hours to reconstruct my environment. N.B. As an original Fire owner, I own a lot of apps and games I would have to buy if I bought a non-Amazon tablet.If you already own a Fire tablet, most of the things I dislike about the Fire tablets in general do not appear to have not changed.Unboxing: Hands down this is the easiest unboxing of any Amazon device ever. You simply pull off a strip with arrows on it and pull out the Max11. The tablet boots up in landscape mode (which some professional reviewers have asserted is how the tablet is designed to be used) but then quickly reverts to portrait mode. N.B. I had to hold the power button (upper left) down for 3-5 seconds.Display: Amazon's ""latest & greatest"" has a screen resolution of  2000 X 1200. The 2013(!) HDX 8.9 had a screen resolution of 2460 x 1600. What was Amazon thinking? (It's not that the resolution isn't good, it is, but it could be better.)Form Factor: For me, the 8.9 inch HDX was the perfect size. Large enough to comfortably read a book or watch a video, small enough to fit in a courier bag. The 10-inch HD, which I've had for two years, is very uncomfortable to hold and will not fit into a courier pouch.  This tablet is, however, lightweight (without the cover and keyboard) and feels quite speedy. I've written a review about the bundle elsewhere.Folders: You still cannot create a folder on the Home screen, then click to see a list of apps and add them in. Every inexpensive Android smartphone has had this functionality for years. I assume every one of Amazon's programmers has such a phone. Why Amazon can't add this simple feature is beyond me. Also, you still cannot sort the apps in a folder.Keyboard: You  apparently cannot use the on-display keyboard if the physical keyboard is attached. I think I understand the logic, and  it is easy to attach/detach the keyboard  with Amazon's bundle, but I wonder how it will work with other physical keyboards.The recharger: It ships with a 9W charger. Why oh why oh why. You'll need to buy the 15W recharger yourself. Don't bother unless recharge time is very important to you.Performance: This tablet is quite zippy. I was able to move between Silk, email, Kindle and Twitter quickly and easily. I didn't do any benchmarks, but performance seemed almost as good as my Galaxy S20+ or my XPS8700.  Except, well, sometimes it slows down to molasses - because, apparently, it can't handle background downloads.ALERT: If  the MAX starts to slow down or freeze a lot, check for downloads (app/game update, email, even notifications). Most Android devices can handle a 20 or 30 MB background download with no effect on performance. Not so the Max. Set your updates to Manual, and then update each app/game independently. {See top of review, TL;DR, for update on performance.)RESTORE PROBLEM:As I posted with my 2 star review, the restore from my HD10-2021 failed completely. None of my apps, folders, bookmarks or Silk history were restored.Unable to reach a person at Amazon, I finally simply restored the Max to factory defaults and set it up again. This time the restore did work, sort of.  It took almost 5 hours to get most everything. I got my Silk bookmarks back but not my Silk history. There are still a bunch of anomalies I am working through. If you're interested, I'll post all the gory details in Amazon's Digital and Device Forum (https://www.amazonforum.com/s/topic/0TO6Q000000QQOxWAO/fire-max-11) in the next day or two.Old Stuff: The Google Play StoreI can't confirm this is still true with the Max, but:1. No. Amazon still does not support the Google Play Store. I don't know why. I assume it makes too much money from its own inadequate play store?2. You can download and  install APKs from trusted sites and they will run, provided you allow the installation of external apps  (Apps  & Notifications/Special App access/Enable for Silk.) They will work provided they don't need access to Google Play Services.3. It has been possible to install the Google Play Store on most of the previous generations of the Fire, and I assume it can still be done. It involves downloading four apps in a particular sequence. The hows are available on the net.  It is possible that this may create a problem in the future, but, so far, most of those who go to the trouble of doing it don't regret it. So, if you are a techie and desperately want something that will only work with Google Play Services, it's worth a try. You can always uninstall the components later."
I bought this for work since it was suggested by the American Librarian Association. When I set it up trying to add my email it failed and restarted the setup process. When it finally set up the fire os I was greeted with was not right. Even amazon labeled it as an android device rather than kindle fire. It is supposed to use a cloud based anti malware platform but I don’t think it is working. I even had to press it down to a corner that was slightly open. It was labeled new but I think it was refurbished. None of the bonus software was available for it like the previous one and it keeps telling me a moisture problem with the pins and it is dry. I updated it and it still doesn’t seem to install the most recent version. The cloud reliance is insane nothing seems to work properly unless online and since activating it I had to put it on my personal account to try and fix it. This followed receiving text messages of fire fox accessing my account messages all fake. The app store is very limited now and it says it is encrypted but it doesn’t seem like it. The biometrics don’t seem to replace unlocking on device options either I have to use a password. Also everything seems to need to use the silk browser rather than have apps. I have seen this before in compromised android devices so it is going to be reset and then a backup for another kindle will be applied. The quality is pretty much the same as the previous kindle fire but the screen is better and wifi 6e is wifi 6e. Pure fire os limits the productivity it advertises and the way it works is just strange. I try and get an app from the store and it doesn’t seem to be available and redirects me to a website. I don’t know what is wrong with it but it’s not hardware related just the firmware. I even tried external storage and it changed the settings to use outside the store access in the app store and it updated to the same os it came with and added the missing apps but now some daemon runs every time it boots. The daemon is a screen cast daemon which is concerning. The pins and pen with the new screen is useful but adding a microsoft account links them which does attach the account email to the microsoft account also. So far it seems to get worse as I use it the cloud reliance is forcing me to use the same email to every service. This kindle seems to need everything on the same email and the cloud platform it uses doesn’t seem to work. It is heavier and runs faster but it just doesn’t seem right. I can’t recommend it for productivity and unless you have every amazon service using the same email and using a microsoft account. The best part about it is no latency bluetooth and wifi are so fast remote play is more efficient than older devices. Proceed with caution this may be unique to my experience but if youtube and reddit are to be believed I was compromised during setup. If not then it has to be the new cloud platform amazon is adopting. Hardware wise no issues better everything just lacks apps. My Kindle fire 10 is running better than this one so hopefully a transfer will fix it and as far a work tablet for a library not recommended. Not worthless but not a priority purchase.
"Update 11/10/24: Contacted Customer  Service a couple times about the issues I have been having with this Kindle, we thought we had fixed the issues but not to long after working through things with them I ran into issues again, I called about getting a refund but, could not because it was passed the 30 day window. :(  I personally think that they need to give more than 30 days for a return especially with electronics/digital device. Anyhow, when I talked with someone last week they said that they could send me a replacement because I did buy the extended warranty for the device. (as it has now been over a year since I got it) They said they would process the return & that I would get an email within $ days & receive my new device within 5-7 days. Well, that was last week & I didn't receive anything from Amazon so I contacted then again today (11/10) & low  behold they did not have any record of a replacement/return being processed. I am glad that I contacted them again or else I wouldn't be getting what I requested. A couple of the things that frustrate me about his whole process is1) Not following through with a customers return when you said you were processing it2) I had to call someone again to find out the status on the replacement as I never received the email that they said I was going to receive only to find out that nothing was done.3) The fact that since I have requested a replacement because this device isn't working properly & instead of them sending me a new device (because I bought new when I ordered it) they are sending me a refuberished one not a new replacement.I like the tablet BUT, I have never had as many problems with a fire tablet as I have had with this one. If I could get my money back on it I would & I would get an iPad as I can get a new one that costs less or not much more than this Kindle did.Update: Here we are now into December more than 2 months after I got the the Fire Tablet & at least 6-7 weeks since my review: still have heard nothing back from Customer Service. Had to once again restart & register the tablet because power ran out & after charging apps wouldn't load. Now I have to make sure that if it is getting close to being without power I need to plug it in before it dies & also no completely powering off the device ever if I want certain apps to keep working which means that battery will not last as long as it should because of that. super Frustrating & Annoying.Update; Amazon Customer service contacted me to see if we could work out the issues but, I didn't have the time that it might take to try to fix the issue at that moment so they said they would call me the next day. Needless to say I am still waiting to hear back from them. This was probably at least 2 weeks ago or more; shortly after I posted my original review.I really like this tablet (I had 2 fire tablets before this one & this is now my 3rd fire) I love the larger screen & the fingerprint ID. One of the big problems I am having is with the Hulu app & sometimes the Prime Video App. The Prime App i sometime have to restart my Fire Max 11 in order for it to open up; why you ask?, that I cannot answer but, the other HUGE issue is with the HULU app. It keeps crashing every time I turn off my Fire Tablet (power it down completely) & in order to get it to work again I have had to backup, reset my Fireback to factory setting & then restore. I don’t understand why this keeps happening but, I know I am not the only one that this keeps happening to. I also have the issue with my SD card store not being with recognized; as it it says that the device isn’t there, to reinsert it or that it is corrupted. This doesn’t happen all of the time but, sometimes. And, the SD CARD slot is a bear to open; that part was very poorly designed. When you push the little SD Card holder slot open with a pin or SD card key it barely opens & you have to fight with it to get the tray out so that you can load your card in.If all of these issues were fixed I would be giving it higher ratings. At the moment I am very frustrated with it. One of the reasons that I got it was so that I could download & watch movies & such on a trip but, when an app keeps crashing after shutting down a device that was impossible."
"I got this for something I could use while lying in bed trying sleep to watch movies, videos and to read forums, on my couch to check emails or to use while learning new guitar techniques online. It's good in the sense I can upgrade the storage with an SD card to a full terabyte and when fully charged will last all for my uses. If I have to recharge I just do it while I'm sleeping and it's charged by the time I get up. Here's 3 major drawbacks. 1. No Google Play Store. You can only use Amazon apps and the YouTube app isn't that good. The way around that is to use the web browser and watch YouTube on there. 2. No headphone jack. I ended up buying a USB type C to a 3.5mm adapter so I could use headphones. 3. I tried everything and this tablet would not pickup my WIFI 6.0 network. This tablet is advertised to work on WIFI 6.0, but mine didn't. I call Amazon for support, but they were more useless than a one legged man kicking contest. To add to the list, but this shouldn't be a surprise at the price point you pay this is not an idea tablet for power use applications. 4gb of RAM just isn't enough memory to run powerful applications and a lot of games. This isn't an Android tablet so it has no phone capabilities.If you want something simple and cheap to play movies, music, videos, check emails, use a messenger or surf the internet this will work well. Anything more demanding you should just pay more and get something better."
"BACKGROUND:  I have worked in Information Systems for decades (as a help desk analyst, business analyst, technical analyst, developer, project manager, etc.).  I have owned varieties of desktops, laptops, peripherals, smart phones, iPhones, etc.  This Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet is absolutely the worst computing device I have ever owned.  It's too late to return it, so I'm considering selling it for $50 just to get it out of the house.-------------------------------------------------------THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS ARE DOCUMENTED BY OTHER FIRE MAX USERS (...just Google it):A. Applications simply shut down, for no reason, without notice, after five to ten minutes of use (e.g., MS Word, YouTube, etc.).B. Doesn't remember  settings from one startup to the next.C.  In many soft or hard device re-starts, the Fire Max 11 tells me the Sandisk SD Card I added for extra storage is not recognized and has to be re-inserted.  A reboot causes this ""tablet"" to forget the problem.  The issue is not that I have to re-insert the Sandisk SD card.  The issue is that the Fire Max inconsistently does or does not recognize the Sandisk SD card.  Sandisk SD cards are high-quality storage devices.  I do not have this problem with Sandisk SD cards that I use in my Fujifilm cameras, audio devices, or other laptops.D. File Management utility has very poor functionality.  Intuitive right-click functionality is not available to move files around, copy/paste files.  Cannot rename files.E. Downloaded/installed Amazon's ""Notepad"" utility, which is a joke.F.  ""Silk"" Browser lacks important and useful functionality that can be found on ALL browser utilities for over twenty years (e.g., bookmark management, font size, available settings or setting retention, color choices, etc.)G.  Silk Browser offers ZERO options to adjust font size or Zoom the objects in the screen...features that ARE available in other browsers.  The ONLY option provided by Silk is the ""Pinch-Zoom"" which truncates all content on the right or left of the window in use.  Compare this with any browser on a laptop computer, where the +/- Zoom enables objects to be zoomed...but the content still remains INSIDE the physical screen of the laptop.H.  No good browsers are available to install on this Fire Max 11 tablet (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)  You are stuck with Silk as your only browser option.I.  Installed MS Word software functionality is incomplete, when compared with modern word processing tools.  But you cannot use the ""Wordperfect"" option that the Fire Max 11 repeatedly offers, because of errors on attempting the install.J.  Just saving a Word document of simple text is a struggle.  The ability to CTRL/A highlight the text in the file, to then set all the text to the same font type and size....is NOT A FUNCTION THAT IS AVAILABLE.K. Almost ZERO third-party software utilities exist to download and install on this ""tablet"".  Compare this with other brands of tablets where good third-party software is available.L.  Weird error messages pop-up in almost every session, about some already installed utility being too new or too old for the version of Android on the device.  What is causing all these weird, random, out of context error messages?M. In conclusion, I wasted $200 on this Amazon Fire Max 11 piece of junk. I will sell it for $50, just so I can stop looking at it.  Do not make my mistake.  Go check out Google or Microsoft or Apple tablets.  I love Amazon, but Amazon needs to leave tablet manufacturing to companies that have a history of tablet manufacturing.-------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:  AFTER ANOTHER MONTH OF USEA. Application shutdowns have become more frequent (e.g., YouTube just shutting off).B.  Application lock-ups have now started.  Previously, YouTube app would just shut off.  Now, it locks up while a video is playing.  No mouse clicks or keyboard clicks can get the screen to respond.  Only solution is the to do a ""hard reboot"" by press/hold the physical power button.C.  After YouTube lockup and ""hard reboot"", YouTube then FAILS to restart.  Clicking the YouTube icon activates YouTube as usual, and begins the ""increasing percentage"" display that occurs with each start up.  However, when activating YouTube after a ""hard reboot"", the ""percentage"" display never goes beyond 10%.  Instead, I am required to do a soft reboot or hard reboot of the device to get YouTube to start working again.CONCLUSION:  I consider this device to be pretty much unusable.  I purchased this device to check news during the workday, so that I would not use my employer laptop for personal stuff.SELL THE FIRE MAX?  I previously thought of selling this device.  But I now feel it would be unethical of me to sell a device to someone, knowing that the device is defective.  I will keep the device in hopes that I can use it as just a poorly functioning Kindle book reader."
"This is my 6th Fire. It replaced one that was malfunctioning. Or so I thought. Unfortunately this one has the same issues. The biggest complaint is the Amazon app no loner works. It sends you to the internet website page. This forces you to login every time. And the lay out on a mobile device is awful to use.  Second, when you open Silk, two tabs open every time. The ability to transfer files is also challenging. I purchased a compatible micro SD card and was only able to transfer pictures. No notes or .pdf's. Customer service was of no help. Multiple resets and power actions would not resolve the issues. They issued a repair ticket. This is a preloaded software problem, not a hardware issue. The end result is that I have to use a device with reduced capability and to add salt to the wound, I spent money on a new device to correct issues with an older Fire to find out they downgraded the operating system across the board."
"I bought this thinking I could actually use it with the keyboard/pen combo as a normal tablet or microsoft device.  I have been disappointed and have had nothing but problems.  This does not have a lot of access to programs using apps in the Silk Web Browser.  My primary need for this Fire 11 as to use with Truefire and Youtube to study guitar.  The amount of lag and other problems with inability to use some printers is not a deal breaker.  However, the inability to use Truefire and other paid subscriptions without spending an inordinate time and for work arounds has me ready to toss this in the trash.  Furthermore, Amazon led me to believe thru website advertizing I had until January to return this product, which is not true.  I am a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer and hold over 40 IT certifications for everything from radios, telephones, satillites and computers -- and this is probably the wrost interface I have ever used."
"This is my eighth Fire tablet, beginning with the first issue 7 inch that basically did nothing. I've found previous Fires ranged from serviceable to truly splendid (that would be the Fire HDX 8.9). The Fire Max 11 started out in the serviceable category. Initially the battery life was better than previous incarnations and the speed was slightly better. But the touchscreen response has always been worse, but still acceptable.But then several months ago my wallpaper started changing on its own, as often as once a day. I emailed support and was told it was indicative of a larger problem so I needed to call in. That seemed a waste of time then. But lately a host of new issues has popped up, from apps mystically kicking me out to frozen screens to keyboard freezes. So I called. The tablet is still under warranty so I was told I could get a replacement -- IF I sent in my tablet to be 'diagnosed' first. And oh yeah, that would take a minimum of ten days *after* they received it.I use this tablet several hours a day, every day. So it's a kick in the pants to be told that the warranty is useless unless I'm willing to do without for an extended period. Amazon used to a great company to deal with. No more. Next time I'll get an iPad."
"The Fire Max 11 is a step up from the previous model but not a huge step up. You can read and compare the technical specifications for yourself. I'm coming from their previous ""flagship"" tablet, the Fire HD10 Plus. Here are some of my thoughts. It has a premium feel with its aluminium body, but it is also very slippery. The previous model was plastic, but it felt really good in the hand, and really didn't look bad at all. The screen seems to look a little nicer on this one, and the speakers seem to sound a bit better. My previous Fire came with a max 64 GB of memory, this one 128 GB. It does seem a bit faster, but it is also new and doesn't have a ton of stuff on it... yet. It comes designed with contacts built into the side to fit in its own special keyboard, which I did not order. Side-by-side next to the old model in portrait mode it is a bit taller. When held in landscape mode while playing games, it is very easy to accidentally touch the volume buttons. There is no headphone jack, but it connects flawlessly to my wireless headphones.It was easy enough to install the Google Play Store following online tutorials, but it seemed just a bit more glitchy downloading some software from the Play Store compared to the previous Fire tablets that I've owned in the past. I'm not sure why that happened, or if Amazon cares one way or the other about people side loading the Play Store on their tablets. But the day they prevent it will be the day I stop buying Fire tablets. And finally, I always buy either Fentie Honeycomb or Poetic Turtle silicone cases (with front-facing speaker ports) for my tablets. They redirect the sound towards the user, making it much louder and clearer. Unfortunately so far they don't appear to be available for this model tablet. Anyway, that's my experiences and thoughts. Your mileage may vary.EDITI've been putting this tablet through it's paces and one thing I can say is that compared to the numerous Fire tablets that I have owned in the past, I have never owned one that has been this glitchy in the software department. I'm not only having issues with some sideloaded software, but even Amazon's own Kindle reader software is acting up and not displaying the cover art on many of my downloaded books in grid display mode. I'm hoping a (near) future software update will fix these issues. I think the tablet itself is great, but glitchy software really puts a damper on the user experience.EDITWell, now whenever I restart the tablet it asks me how I plan to use my micro SD card. I don't know what's up with Amazon and their software, but this is getting to be a headache that I don't need. I'm seriously thinking about returning this thing.EDITOK, so all of my downloaded books completely disappeared. I'm in the process of downloading them again, and it appears that they are downloading property with the cover art displaying as it should. I'm going to go ahead and keep the tablet and hope for the best going forward. Maybe they just need time to work all of the bugs out, I don't know."
"Honestly I was debating whether to get a refurbished IPad10.5 Or this , Because most of what I do on my phone is watch YouTube Videos and Pay my bills End play games So in order to save my eyesight I thought this would be a good idea I love this thing But what's the deal with not having a YouTube App? Yet They put a tab For their browser For YouTube 🤷🏻‍♂️I guess it's a licensing issue Because they're part of google.... And also no fandango at home app, So I have to use movies anywhere app Which connects me with all my movies that I have on file for the past 15 years... The tablet on the other hand is beautiful it looks great Works great AI generated Review says above About the reviews of this tablet Apps are very very limited.... Get us together guys you're amazon!"
"Initially I was very impressed with this tablet and the value. Unfortunately after using it for a few weeks I'm running into a problem with video that apparently many other users are also struggling with.  After a certain amount of time using the tablet , hours, It suddenly will not play video.  Amazon says they're working on the problem but there's been no change.  Each time this happens the only way I can get video to work again is to restart the tablet. Of course amazon troubleshooting recommends that you restart the tablet , Also reset the tablet, Reset the tablet to factory mode, etc . These are not acceptable answers to this problem.  I primarily use this tablet for video function so restarting all the time just doesn't work for me.I'm sure the problem stems from The complication Of android And amazon working to maintain a separate release but they are apparently struggling with quality, and there is no way to change the version of android to the mainstream version.  The ridiculous part about this Is I don't believe The products or services that I use.I wish that I could revert back to an earlier version before an update Before the problems But once again they have this thing pretty well locked up so until it improves I can't recommend buying this tablet."
"Can't download any Google software like the calendar. They would say that the fire calendar imports your google calendar entries, but I DID NOT CHOOSE to use it. Also, bluetooth will not connect with my Apple headphones. What are they afraid of?  I will keep trying things, but I believe that Amazon is doing this to hurt the competition. Nothing was disclosed to me about this before I bought the Fire tablet. They might say that the tablet uses their own OS, and android stuff sometimes won't work. Why not? Also, by the way, I'm not displeased with the computer, or how it works, but I would like to keep using my email software, which is not amazon. The amazon email app works OK, but I DID NOT CHOOSE TO USE IT."
It’s a good tablet overall just very limited. For one it doesn’t have the App Store which would make some sense but the games and apps are VERY limited. Theres a 50 percent chance you can search a game and it won’t pop up.Overall it’s very boring and isn’t really good for entertaining teenagers or younger people. Theres only real reason I use it is to watch YouTube on a larger screen (I can really just do that on the TV) and I’m pretty sure my sister doesn’t even use her.I’m also pretty salty that Amazon music and kindle aren’t free even thought it comes with the tabletOverall compared to an IPad it’s better to just get your teen the iPad (from personal experience
"After some reconsideration and some updates to the Amazon apps, such as Kindle and to Amazon Music Unlimited and whatever is on the FireTV devices and this device especially I have to remove some stars(now technically a 2.5 star product) for the philosophy that makes them take away the feature that let's you resize font on an e-reader, why can't we make a book's font or pages fit to the size of their own fire tablet or whatever this thing is called... I spent 30 to 45 minutes looking through the app for this feature, to find nothing of course. What will go next? Why don't you take page turning away and just put us on a timer, we all should read at the same speed, don't you think?? Hahaha What other conveniences should go? I can't buy another Amazon device again because I know it will never stay the same long enough to enjoy it the way it was when you bought it and it is never for the better.~~~~Original review formerly in progress~~~~I bought this primarily for kindle books and I do even more reading on it than I ever thought I would so I'm very grateful for that and the battery has lated even longer than probably the specs say as well. I turn the display brightness down to about half and it makes the battery last longer and keeps my headaches away too.I find myself searching on every link I come across and listening to so much more music now. The bad thing is that I'm shopping more too. Haha I guess that's what we work for... and to keep Amazon in business.As I wrote earlier, even at about half brightness the display is very detailed and lively, I don't feel like I'm missing anything.The things I feel I'm missing that I'd pay a higher price for the pen if it would be included(I know it can be bundled), headphone jack/plug(I miss having the separation from USB and heaphone out and having another option from Bluetooth earphones), and bigger or louder speakers, richer more lush sound, maybe back to 4 channel. Oh and if it had Google appstore support completely, I have read some reviews and some say you can sideload it or something like that, but I did that with Blackberry, and no, it isn't an option I'm too old now if you had to ask. Lol thank you for bringing up my age btw."
"The first thing to be aware of is that the box that the Fire 11 Tablet comes in has almost to protection for the device. Mine was delivered by UPS in a lightly padded envelope and the tablet box was crushed to the point that the tape seal was broken on the Fire box. While there was no obvious damage to the tablet, it's too expensive to take a chance that there was not some internal damage. I did set it up partially so I could decide if I wanted to return it or replace it.On the plus side, the screen is nice. In portrait mode, the screen is much taller versus the width than I'm used to, but after using it for a short time, I grew to like it. In landscape mode, it probably uses the entire screen for wide screen video, although I did not test this.While this is probably far from a high performance Android device, most of the time the hardware handled my normal activity without a problem. It did slow down to a crawl at times, but I'm not sure what caused this. There are some complaints about the WiFi dropping out in the reviews but I did not use it long enough to determine the cause. It worked well most of the time.If you have used an unmodified Amazon Fire tablet before and liked it, you will probably love this tablet. The addition of the fingerprint reader (must have for me) is what got me to try this tablet and it worked perfectly in my testing.If like me, you need to use apps that are not available in the Amazon App Store, you can easily install other app stores, like Google Play and F-Droid, but the apps may not work the way you expect. You will also need to install something like ""Launcher Hijack V4"" if you want to replace the default and only supported launcher that comes with the Fire tablet. I did not see any other launchers in the Amazon App Store and I think Amazon prevents you from changing the launcher without and side loaded app (see below).The default launcher is very limited, it has 3 screens, 2 of which look mostly like Amazon advertising it's products and services (I bought the Fire without ads) with one screen storing all of your apps. If you have more apps than will fit on one screen, you have to group apps in folders or scroll up and down to get to all of them. I did not see the basic App Drawer anywhere until I replaced the launcher so until you move them, I think they are only on the main screen in the order you installed them.I tried a few widgets but they did not work well. Even if they did, they share limited space on the app screen so they are less useful.Using Launcher Hijack V4, I was able to get Nova Launcher to take over as my launcher. At this point, I figured I was going to be okay with the Fire tablet.Further testing of my apps ended that thought pretty quickly. While I was able to install all of my favorite Google Apps, not all of them worked the way I expected them to. I was not able to get my Contacts to show up in the Google Contacts or in Google Voice.The final straw that made me give up on the Fire is the inability to save links to web sites on the desktop (the Add to home screen option is missing from every browser I tried to use on it) and the inability to save a link to friends I'm sharing locations with in Google Maps (the Add to Home Screen option is available but it does not work).I guess Amazon is not making much money on the tablets so they try to lock you in to their very limited version of Android and there even more limited App Store. I already use lots of Amazon services so they aren't going to make any more money off of me by annoying me. It would be nice if they sold this with no restrictions for maybe a little more money since the hardware i good for the price and my needs.I was hoping to avoid spending $200 more on the new Google Pixel Tablet but I just ordered it (from Google since Amazon does a lousy job of packing fragile devices so they are safe from UPS). My wife may be okay with the Fire, she will decide after seeing the Pixel."
"The tablet is great, except that it’s super limited when it comes to mainstream apps. It sucks that the big corporations can’t get along, cause the majority of the apps I use aren’t even available on the Amazon fire.It’s basically just relegated to a tablet for my niece and nephew to watch a movie on or play some game.Also the Amazon photos app doesn’t work on the tablet and Amazon can’t find a fix for it yet. It just redirects you to the website on the Silk browser. More annoying than anything else.I’ve got a mild case of buyer’s remorse…"
"Have had a series of Amazon FIre tablets ranging from the 6, 8, and 10 and multiple iterations of those and now this Fire Max 11. My favorite of them all is the Fire HD 8 (2020 version). Why? It's the most reliable of the bunch. I  do need to give some background and context. I don't live only in the Amazon ecosphere and rely on Google apps. This Fire Max is basically an Android table with Amazon's OS/UI sitting on top of it. If there were no side-load option to install the Google Play store, I would give up all Fire tablets. So, like I said, the Fire HD 8 version is the most reliable because it is stable. Apps don't close unexpectedly or slow down the whole tablet which happens often on the Fire Max 11. Ideally, I wanted to rely on this tablet for a lot of stuff when traveling and not bring a Chromebook, but I realize I can't depend on this. Last trip, I had to use my Android phone for most apps I expected to run on this tablet. The screen on the Fire Max 11 is great and when it works, I do enjoy it. It just doesn't work like I expected. Hate that I have to keep testing earlier versions of the Google Play store and associated files (if you have side-loaded the Google Play store, you know what I mean). If I wanted to spend that much time on IT admin, I would have stuck with a regular PC. No, thank you. So, if you only utilize apps that are in the Amazon ecosphere, this is a 5 star product, but if you are like me and rely on the broader array of apps in the Google Play Store, this is a solid 2 star tablet. Speed is the main thing going for it when it doesn't lock up. Overall, a 3 star tablet for me."
"Well, I am not going to write pages on the review of this absolutely horrible item.  This new Fire tablet has been nothing but problems from day one.  I literally have to reboot  constantly throughout the day.  Not to mention it has corrupted 2 brand new Sandisk Extreme cards, a 128GB and a 512 GB.  It manages to uninstall software on its own????  I have never had a tablet do this.  ever.The system crashes and rebooting are just seriously frustrating!!!12\\27\\23.  After working with amazon staff and going through 1 new, 12- refurbished and another NEW Fire 11 (only lost another 32 GB card on the new Fire11 this time) I learned that you cannot move one SD card to another Fire 11.  It will kill the card you try to move over.  Amazon needs to do some serious work on the ability to move SD cards from one Fire 11 tablet to the next.  I never had any issues on my older Fire 10 with moving cards.  Never lost a single card on the Fire 10.Any way, now that i have a NEW tablet that works!  I went ahead and ordered the Fire 11 keyboard. Hopefully it works right!  The SD card issue on the Fire 11 is VERY annoying.So far I have NOT had to reboot this third tablet once.The working tablet is just amazing.  Video on it is outstanding.  Absolutely love this new tablet.  Hopefully there are no issue with the keyboard etc.  going forward.I would give this tablet a solid 5 if I didn't have the issues and then have to work with the Amazon CS agents.  Not a fan of buying a NEW table and having issues just to be given a refurbished unit that had the same issues and then having to get upset at the service level I received.  Seriously bad business model.  But in the end I hopefully have a great tablet for many years.Thank you Amazon for FINALY fixing the issues by sending me a NEW tablet.Peace out!I spent over an hour this morning with Amazon people (yes people) about the issues.  They will send out another tablet to try.  Buy they're not sure about replacing the brand NEW! MicroSD cards?  Hey Amazon, it was YOUR product that killed the NEW cards!!!  Nice customer service.  BTW mazon you are most welcome to the useless NEW cards,  I can send them back with the bad tablet that killed them.  If Amazon refuses to replace my SD cards, this will be the last Fire tablet I will buy.  (I give these tablets as gifts throughout the year)  That will end.  I will move to Samsung or some other product.I will update this review via the return outcome."
"It's not that this is a horrible tablet. Its slightly better than previous iterations. In most areas. Some areas its actually worse.Keyboard is slightly worse than before. Its almost the same, but seems off a tad. Maybe its spacing, maybe its slightly smaller, cant quite put my finger on it, but, something is off. Not a major issue.Size. Dont let them fool you. The tablet is for all intents and purposes the same size. Just slight enough of a different to make sure you need a whole new case.Battery. The battery is not all that improved. It takes longer to charge, and i dont see it lasting 14 hours. At best, by their say so, the battery lasts only one hour longer. But, id be surprised if it lasts even 10 hours.In this sense this kindle is better. It has more Ram, the camera, still nothing to brag about, is 8mb. Almost twice as good as the old 5mb cameras, but, our phones haven't been this bad in almost 20 years.One nice improvement is the shell. Its actually metal. So maybe when I drop it, it wont shatter!Because this one arrived sooner, I purchased the ad-free lock screen kindle. Its no big deal, actually. Generally, and usually, the ad-free version is $25 more expensive, but not worth it. Once in a while, as was my case, the ad-free version is cheaper. Well, I certainly didn't want to pay extra for ads.Overall, Im not impressed by this one. And as a result, I may just return it."
"The Good:The Fire 11 tablet has by far the best hardware and build quality of any Amazon Fire Tablet.  Previous models just don't come close.The Bad:Unfortunately, Amazon is still skimping on the ram which really affects performance and reliability.  Amazon should include at least 8gb of ram.  There is no excuse - The Raspberry Pi 4 now comes with 8gb of ram for $75 which is one third the price of a Fire 11.Software is the other major problem.  In fact, it might be a deal breaker for some.  Amazon really needs to improve their core apps.  The Silk browser for example does not come with an adblock feature nor does it apparently allow browser extensions.  Websites viewed on an Apple iPad using the Safari browser load quickly without slide over ads, flashing lights and pop up advertisements.  Why?  Safari allows ad blocking browser extensions.Open websites with Silk and then in Safari and you will get quite a comparison.  Websites opened with the Silk browser have flashing text and lights, along with slideovers and pop ups that get in your way.  Safari websites are clean and fast.  No slideovers, pop ups or flashing lights.The situation would be much better if the Amazon Appstore had other browsers to choose from.  Firefox, Edge and Chrome don't appear to be available at this time.Other Software Issues:The Files App, which is a built in app, notifies you that the document creation option is not compatible with the operating system.  (See attached images)Amazon needs to get busy and create their own software.  The existing software is nowhere close to the quality available on the Apple iPad.For starters Amazon needs to include:- A good Note Taking App. Microsoft OneNote for FireOS is way behind the Apple iPad version.- A PDF editor- The Contacts app should allow a couple of pictures to be inserted.  It should also include a map link.- A good scientific and business calculator with graphing capabilities (Schools recommend)- Decent movie and audio editors- Word Processor, Spreadsheet, Presentations - They come free with Apple!- A weather app with a Satellite view, dewpoint, humidity, barometric pressure.In summary, the Fire 11 is an improvement over previous Fire Tablets.  It is not enough of an improvement to justify purchasing it over an iPad.  You can often purchase an iPad with all of these features and more for only $40 more."
"I have the Fire HD10 which I'm fairly happy with, despite its numerous shortcomings. Other reviewers have already written about some of the HD10 issues (internet disconnect when idle, Up to 30 sec to reconnect, very limited apps in app store, somewhat sluggish performance, etc).So when there was a good sale on the Max 11 I decided to upgrade and trade-in the HD10 for an extra discount and trade in credits.  I ended up returning the Max 11 and keeping the HD10.  Here's why:1. Max11 lacks a trrs headphone/headset jack that the HD10 provides.2. Even with the USB-C to 3.5mm TRRS adapter, the mic will not activate for use with the Max11.  There are no instructions on how to activate an external wired mic nor options in the menu to do so.3. Touchscreen is overly sensitive. Sometimes just holding the tablet at the corner results in unexpected behavior due to ""touches"" it senses.4. There's no option to keep the Max11 unlocked so I can quickly start using it, without either using its fingerprint sensor with the registered finger, or entering the 4 digit unlock key.5. When using the Silk browser, it seems to ""hang"" between web pages for many seconds at a time, sometimes quickly displaying that it can't connect then coming back.  This never happens with the HD10 after initial connectivity is established and not idle.On the plus side its beautifully built, has a slightly larger and more brilliant screen, and has better performance than the HD10.  The price of the tablet is far better than similar tablets from other manufacturers.Yet I found the Max11 to be less convenient than the HD10, so I've decided not to trade in the HD10 and return the Max11."
"It has a beautiful HD display.Other than that it is a NIGHTMARE!!!!I bought the Ad Free 128GB model.I bought TWO 1TB Cards because the first Sandisk was recognized as defective.The second does not work either. That was picked out by an Amazon Tech who told me what to buy.It keeps not recognizing the SD cards as installed, you have to keep Mounting them.The customer is who is getting mounted.I had Four techs try to help me with this thing.Two deliberately disconnected.A third picked out the new SD card.The fourth tried for a while and said he could not figure out a way to fix it.  At least HE really tried.PHOTOS before that and three other Amazon Apps crashed leading to a Factory Reset constantly dropped or filed saved photos hundreds of photos away was BAD.  I was always having to search everywhere to see if my edited photos had been deleted. After the Factory Reset the online Photos and new SCREWED UP GALLERY APP launched. There is NO Way to get back to the in tablet nicer Photo App.  Gallery App is Horrible.  In the new not improved format it is No Longer Easy to use. The editing screen blocks much of the photo itself and I cannot use the Text Function.  I guess some geniuses just had to roll out a non- functional piece of crap to look busy and stay employed.****Amazon you need to can this bunch of idiots and Update to the Previous Version!****If you buy the very overpriced magnetic cover you will find it sticks out so far and so near all the buttons it is very hard to press any of them.  I ended up cutting the edge off and scraping and filing the hard white plastic inner board back just to use the buttons.They put the on/off/screenshot button in a horrible new place. In vertical mode you have to reach across the screen diagonally with your right hand to reach the upper left button.  I do many screenshots in my research.  This is tiring and hard.There is no longer a headphones plug unless you buy one or two splitters you can plug both the new USB-C plug headphones and your charge cord into.  I prefer to use my old RCA lighter headphones so I bought 2 splitters and their new expensive headphones they designated for this tablet.It is pretty hard to open the magnetic tablet case.  The cover that opens is so close to the tablet my big fingers have trouble grasping it.I am pretty certain the battery life is WAY Overstated.  When the lights went out watching a movie with only Prime Movies App open burned through the battery in about half the stated time of 13 hours.  I do not know what they used it for but I think they Lied.This Thing was Designed to Sell Expensive Peripherals for Profit.It was Not Designed to Work Well.Overall in my Experience It Is a Piece of Expensive Crap!I went back to using my old ten inch Amazon Tablets I was happy with.I actually sank about $500 in it and the peripherals.Frankly I am Quite Angry at being Stuck with this Mess.Not much about my eighth Fire Tablet works.  Damn you Amazon."
"long term customer. I've had many kindled loved them all Except this one. I've had nothing but issues with this thing....error messages on SD card, ghosting of apps even the prime video app!  No updates for many of the apps! Some apps that are working don't work correctly. Yes I've try to update if there is one, unloaded  reloaded, cleaned the cache, deleted data. This kindled is NOT all that! I was better off with my old ones. I've called, emailed helpdesk. Nothing helps...I'm done uninstallingreinstalling, cleaning cache,Restarting!  To say I'm disappointed is putting it mildly! Everyday is a crap shot as far as apps icon appearing see photo above. I've even had apps installed that I swear I didn't install. I'm beginning to wonder if this kindle is a refurbished kindle Max, they say no, Sorry not I'm not believing it."
The antenna is abysmal. My cheap $30 roku in my bedroom that's 5 has better range. Standing right next to the WiFi Router I get half the speed I should be getting That any WiFi adapter would get. And there are virtually no decent Drawing or graphics applications available for this tablet. That's pretty depressing honestly Considering kindle fire tablets have been available for a very very long time.
Not enough space around the perimeter to avoid accidentally touching the screen and causing the current screen to go elsewhere.Sensitivity of the touch function lessened. It sometimes takes three or four taps to open a video on youtube for instance.Volume buttons almost flat with frame making it difficult to feel them.Volume not very loud requiring me to use earbuds which is annoying.
"Nice sleek design and excellent graphics but very little android necessary apps like ""meet"", etc .. Does not have a Google based Play store with the same choices of apps any other android tablet has which only leaves this with good streaming of movies from favorite apps like MAX, PRIME VIDEO, NETFLIX and a few others. As for PowerPoint or serious work, it requires MORE APPS !!!!"
"Hardware great , easy to use easy to see. Software is so limiting , now you can't even get Google Play apps. you used to be able to opt out of the software restriction. Basically your buying an Amazon buying machine that is very good at shopping Amazon ,not great at anything else. If you buy it without ads which is extra cost you should have more freedom to get a larger variety of apps."
"I originally bought the Max 11 to replace my Fire 10 that had CAR MODE on it after being dropped.  After numerous chats and emails from Amazon help center, I now have 2 tablets with CAR MODE.  The 11 seems to only have CAR MODE with new books that I get.  Don't understand that either.  Both tablets were restarted and back to factory setting."
"I guess I didn't read all of the reviews before buying so it's kinda on me. the tablet is great EXCEPT for the fact that you can not put CHROME on it. so all of my favorites and keys that are on chrome can not be used. I know that there are videos that show how to do it, but some of the comments say that it impacts the performance . so I will get by without it. other than that, the performance is very good, the screen is great and the overall experience is good. it's unfortunate that this is the result of a fight between two tech giants and we...the public have to suffer."
"If this is a gift, make sure they have their own mobile phone.  purchase one for my wife, and she can't claim it because she don't have her own Cell phone, or e-mail.  We only have one computer, and she doesn't do computers.  purchased this to teach her."
"Unlike my fire 10 tablets, I find it almost impossible to enjoy reading or playing games. Every few minutes, I get interrupted by popups and ads. I have to leave my book and delete the history from my browser before I can go back to reading."
"I'm not a power user or gamer and wanted an affordable quality tablet mainly to access and enjoy the 7K+ Comixology purchases I've made over the last decade. I was disappointed at the way Amazon ruined the Comixology app/experience but took some consolation that my purchases were safely integrated into my Kindle library. So I jumped on this tablet mainly for comics but figured that I could also use it to stream movies from Prime, Netflix, etc.I have the Kindle app on my Android phone and that version of the app displays access to all of my Comixology-specific purchases, which are categorized under ""Comics and Manga"" as opposed to ""Books"", making them somewhat easier to filter and select titles to download to my phone.I figured that a flagship Amazon device such as the Max 11 would work the exact same way, so I purchased with confidence.Huge mistake.It turns out that the stock Fire OS version of the Kindle app on this device DOES NOT SEE YOUR COMIXOLOGY PURCHASES. I'm fairly tech-savvy but couldn't figure out why those books were showing up properly on the web browser as well as my Android phone but not the Max 11 itself. The only comics I could see were a handful of books I'd purchased over the years from the Amazon Kindle store (not the Comixology storefront).It took two unhelpful hours of being transferred several times from one Amazon customer service rep to another via chat (which included them clearly cutting and pasting from a script of unhelpful solutions as well as multiple resets of the device) and then an attempt via phone where they disconnected me and didn't call back before I realized I was on my own. Terrible customer service!Browsed Reddit to try and find some answers. The only way you can access your Comixology purchases on the Fire Max 11 is to log onto a web browser and manually send each title to your device. To make matters worse, they 1) show up categorized as ""Books"" and not ""Comics and Manga"", and 2) you CAN'T DIRECTLY DELETE THEM FROM THE MAX 11 TABLET! You have to log back onto the web browser and send a request back to the tablet to delete the book! What a miserable user experience on their own branded device!Long story short: This device (specifically the Fire OS version of the Kindle app) is useless if you want to easily access your Comixology purchases. Nobody at Amazon customer support seems to understand the issue and from the way Amazon has treated Comixology, I'm guessing they really don't care about fixing the stock version of the Kindle app anytime soon. There's no way that you can sideload or overwrite the Kindle app with the working (!) version created for stock Android. You're stuck.It's such a shame because the tablet is otherwise great. I can still read comics through my local library via the Hoopla app and it's fine for watching movies, but that's not why I spent hard-earned money on it.You'd think that with all of its resources, Amazon could make sure its own reading app works.***UPDATE 12/24/23***Apparently some switched was flipped and now Comixology purchases do show up (it takes a while to sync if you have a large library). You can also now delete them from the device itself without needing to log in from a separate browser. Much (!) better than it was but I'm still seeing a few titles that won't load. Also, unlike the Android version of the Kindle app, there is no way to jump by letter when browsing comics, so you have to scroll and scroll and scroll - not a big deal if you'd like to read your Batman comics but frustrating if you want to catch up with Spider-Man or the X-Men.Still, it's much better than it was and I would revise my one star rating to a four overall (it'll get that fifth one from me once I can browse/enjoy my comic purchases the way I could on the now defunct Comixology app)."
"I have to say the Firemax 11 is fast compared to other versions of Fire tablets. It holds a charge well, but there's a couple of things that are debatable deal breakers for me. First of all, why make a tablet that uses a stylus but the apps aren't all usable in landscape mode? For example I like to use the tablet like I would a mini laptop. However, when I rotate the tablet by physically turning the whole tablet on its side, not all of the apps rotate into landscape mode so I end up having to physically turn the tablet back into portrait position to use those particular apps. It defeats the whole purpose. Secondly, i don't know if it's just my tablet or what, but when I tap on something specific on the screen, it taps in the place I tapped prior to tapping the new spot I'm trying to tap. In other words, it's always a tap behind. Thank goodness, it doesn't do that when I'm typing or playing a game, but it does with everything else especially when I'm trying to tic off boxes or something like that. When it's something specific, it seems to be a tap behind. Hopefully you understand what I'm saying. I'm thinking I ought to talk to customer service about this. Otherwise it has a great picture on it, runs videos and movies smoothly without hesitation, and is otherwise great! With the exception that it's still Android 11 with no promise of any future updates. Keep that in mind when you're trying to decide if you should purchase one! That's a drawback as well."
"I have tried using Fire tablets in the past and was disappointed each time. I really wanted to like this tablet because I thought some features would be added or improved, but that still is not the case with Amazon's latest offering. For context, I also own a new Galaxy Tab S6 Lite that is the same size and price as the Firemax 11. The difference in the speed and overall functionality of these 2 tablets is night and day. Let me first list the pros and cons of the Firemax 11:PROS:-Screen is beautiful-Price is reasonable-This iteration finally has Split Screen capability-Stylus Pen capable-Lock screen offers some useful ads for me-Camera is decentCONS:-Touch screen has been agonizingly unresponsive. Please be ready to apply extra pressure to get anything to respond-Connection to internet has been iffy. It has randomly disconnected about 7 times now and I've only had the tablet 24 hours-Customization as an absolute joke. There really isn't any besides being able to change the wallpaper and re-order the apps in different positions on the same page. This tablet will not allow the creation of additional screens for other items. You are just stuck with the 3 that are there. This tablet also has no widgets to speak of. The Samsung tablet allows many ways to customize with many widgets to be positioned wherever you want-The size of pages on the recent apps screen cannot be changed. Each page takes up the ENTIRE screen, so you can only see one app at a time. Samsung allows for the layout to be changed in several different ways including a list option, a grid option, a stack option, a vertical option, or a slim option so that all can be viewed simultaneously. There is also an option to close all apps. I don't see this on the Firemax 11.-The stylus pen. Even though that is a welcome addition, I paid separately for it and it doesn't really do anything but allow for screen writing within boxes and certain apps. That's it. The pen is also cumbersome and somewhat heavy, as it needs a AAA size battery inserted to operate. On the other side, the S-Pen on the Samsung tablet functions completely different, but in a GOOD way. With the S-Pen, the tablet can be operated hands-free with gestures to navigate through apps and music and has all kinds of other options such as language translation, controlling of the camera and its features, magnification anywhere on the screen, starting and stopping videos and music, screen writing, lock screen writing, and so much more. The S-Pen also does not require a battery. It is charged on the back of the tablet and is very lightweight.-The sound does not go very high, so please get some bluetooth earphones for consuming media on this device-For a device having 4GB RAM, it is not very fast or responsiveOverall, it is an ok device for people who don't care about the things I listed. I will be keeping the Firemax 11, as it is a gift from my employer. However, I will not be using it myself. It will just be an extra device I have for when guests visit. It is good for media consumption or playing games, but not a serious everyday driver. The functionality is still too limited for that. This tablet needs the actual ANDROID operating system to really be any good."
"For some inexplicable reason the on/off button was moved from the top right hand corner to the left top corner........immediately next to the volume buttons. Why, I wonder? Consequently, it is far too irritatingly easy, now, to turn the device off when all you wanted to do was change the. volume. If you're not careful you end up turning the device off multiple times during use. I paid for a ""new"" ""updated"" version of the device for that!?!?!. A button move and no other noticeable improvements that I have noticed. Seriously considering returning it."
"I just want to know who the idiot was that thought it would be a good idea to only have one port for charging and earbuds. You can't charge the Fire Tablet and watch a movie at the same time. Additionally, the on/off button is really hard to operate. It barely sticks out and you have to have two hands on the tablet in order to operate the button. I'm not a first time Fire Tablet buyer. I've had one since they first came out years and years ago. And I've owned eight tablets during that time."
"30 Day Update:  Still not seeing the great improvement over my old Kindle Fire 10 7th gen.  It is much better in bright sunlight.  It is faster.  But for reading books and just looking up the weather it's just about the same.  I'm keeping it, but only because my five year old Kindle Fire 10 battery is getting old.Original Review:I've had a Kindle 2012 Fire 8 which was good, replaced it in 2018 with the Kindle Fire HD10 7th gen which was good, and now have just purchased the Fire 11 Max.The Fire Max uses modified Android 11 software which I'm still getting familiar with.  I don't know that I like it better.  I might like it better eventually but right now it's not the old familiar comfortable Android 5.1 which is easy in every way.The speed of the 11 Max is better, the screen is better, it's slightly lighter but more slick in the hand until the case arrives in a few days.  It seems more sturdy with it's metal case verses the plastic case of lesser models. I guess the front and rear cameras are now useful where as it was the weak point of the HD 10 (but I haven't used it yet).  The finger print access is not useful to me as I've always found them problematic as I like working with my hands and my fingers won't read after car projects, yard work, repairs, and such. I also find the fingerprint readers more difficult to use with a case.I might end up getting a keyboard for it so I like that it's got enough umph to operate like a small laptop during travel on my motorcycle.I haven't really used it much for reading but the blu-screen function is not like my old Kindle so that's not good.  I put it in night mode and it pretty much did nothing.  Hopefully I'll find I'm doing something wrong and figure it out.  I guess the old symbol of a bed for night mode was too easy.So overall I'm not really impressed with the Fire Max 11 as I was with the Fire 8 and the HD10. I guess it's more focused on watching movies and gaming than before. Good thing it was on sale or it would be going back."
"all i wanted from this was to be a couch tablet to do web browsing and watch videos, maybe if i had to do some light photo or video editing. this tablet basically only provides frustration free video watching.browsing web and app feed the touch screen is highly inaccurate on numerous apps. it can pick things more than 3 inches away from where i typed. i put it on a flat surface to eliminate possible detection of my palms that may throw off the accuracy and just used my one finger with the same issue.  deleted and reinstalled apps and the OS numerous times, even used firebox to get the google services and store. nothing helped. tried a USB touchpad and the gestures were again a mess of inconsistent results.battery life is middling at best. for a modern tablet and the light stuff i ask of it i get about 75% of the uptime i would expect. it does charge fast enough so point amazon?apps hang and freeze very often, close out open apps and run one app at a time  resolves nothing (yes i know the OS still keeps them running and the closing of apps is more of a cosmetic function).the screen is the only redeeming feature. but it's nothing special, and i shouldn't have to praise adequacy. it gets bright enough, with good color, and the size is nice.oh, and it still has an SD card slot so you can load up movies, photos, and music for on the go. second point amazon.this is the 3rd Amazon tablet i have bought and i knew it would be no where near what i could get from an iPad, but at the price i just needed basic. this tablet has failed miserably. YouTube or local content playback is the only thing i pick this up for now. i gave it 3 months to try and impress my low expectations. can not recommend this for anyone, unless it was $50 or less. it's that much of a one trick pony."
Screen lacks sensitivity. Very difficult to change settings. Screen does not flip by itself.  It’s very annoying. First thing when it’s turned on does not flip either.
"For me, this wasn't worth updating for. I don't find it much different than my 2 year old Fire tablet. Infact, I've been using it for several months and find it has annoying issues. My most annoying issue is with the keyboard, if I don't hit the space bar exactly in the right spot, it puts a period instead of a space between words. I spend half my time typing searching for and taking out all the extra periods. I never had this issue with my last 2 Fire tablets. The touchscreen is extra ""touchy"", and I constantly have to watch where I put my fingers when scrolling or else I will be spending a lot of time closing tabs/clicking back. Again, did not really have this issue with previous Fire tablets. The screen to me isn't any more brilliant, and as of yet I haven't found a cover that fits it properly. The one I have now is basically upside down and so the camera is in the lower right corner when I'm holding it vertically for reading etc. Just not impressed, should have waited or bought another brand.Update....hate this tablet. Keyboard just does not work well and is VERY fussy. Now buttons/icons are freezing that I want to click on (not the page) and I have to restart the tablet to get things going again. Annoying, very annoying...again, not impressed."
"This was a mistake purchasing this tablet, compared to an Android device it was not impressive at all. I returned it for this reason."
"Unfortunately, this tablet does not connect to some of the sources I wanted it to so I replaced it with a Samsung."
"The Fire Max 11: The Vampire of your Time and Productivity!The Good:It has an acceptable screen.Great colors and good for reading; at least I do use the Moon+ Reader PRO for reading and It is OK.The screen is very soft for scrolling and regular use.The fingerprint sensor works just great and it is very useful.The construction feels very sturdy.Very fast downloads and apps installation.Ease access to the power on/off button when using it portrait position.but...The Bad:Amazon have doomed this device… Even if you manage to install the Play Store, you won't be able to use some of the most popular and productive Apps, and in some cases, the apps would crash while using them. It’s like this version of Fire OS is an intentional incomplete android version... I would (and I'm pretty sure others too) pay up US$50 to Amazon to get rid of its Recalcitrant Policy of restricting some of their devices from having full access to the Google Play Store and its Apps ecosystem.Just to mention some useless, none-working or buggy apps on Fire Max 11:• PowerAmp (only works while the tablet is disconnected from any Bluetooth audio devices).• Internet Samsung (Crashes frequently. Sometime works once you restart the Device).• Google Translate (No online Translation, which means, only Offline translation is available).• Poweramp Equalizer (Crashes on start, so I cannot use it for optimizing the Spotify sound)• LG XBOOM (it permanently keeps on asking you to allow it to access to your location, although you have already allowed it).There are a lot of apps that don’t work on this tablet that I didn’t include in this list, and I understand it is important for you to find out which apps doesn’t work on this tablet before you make your decision. You can find some reviews that mentions some others apps that you won’t be able to use on this device.Apps Replacement:Although the apps in the previous list don’t work properly o don’t work at-all on Fire Max 11, you might find some apps that can replace them and are somehow acceptable; Instead of installing Google Translate, you can install the Microsoft Translator.Dolby Atmos:It almost feels like a Gimmick, because there is no way to access to any of its configurations, as you can do on other android devices. You can find the Dolby Atmos app executing in the list of running apps, but you don’t have an interface or a way change nothing.The LayoutAnother thing that some may find it annoying on this tablet, and it is something that it is also present on the Google Pixel tablet, is the layout or distribution of the Buttons and Rear and Front Cameras. The layout of those Tablets has a design flaw in which if put a Case Cover that opens book-wise like (right to left), you will cover the rear camera and the front camera will be placed on the bottom if you put the table in horizontal position. Otherwise, if you put a Case Cover that opens book-reverse like (left to right), you will have the rear and front cameras placed at the top of the tablet if you put it horizontally (which is normal on the Ipad, Samsung and other tablets).Update 20240310:Definitely, I feel 205.67% dissatisfied, disappointed, regretted of having bought this tablet... even its own ecosystem applications keep on crashing randomly. Applications that sync online with someone cloud service struggle to reach out its respective servers."
"NO SUPPORT FOR SIMULTANEOUS CHARGING AND OTHER  WIRED ACCS LIKE KEYBOARD/MOUSECompared to previous version where the Fire had a dedicated USB-C charging input and another 3.5mm audio jack input, this one only comes with a USB-C input. There is no reset button either.I tried numerous USB-C splitter adaptors that would allow for simultaneous charging as well as connecting a wired accessory like a keyboard, mouse or headphone and NOTHING works. You can only use one function at a time, either charge or attach an accessory.This device was engineered without  implementing this essential and basic functionality in mind. When you remove the 3.5mm headphone and replace it with ONLY ONE USB-C input that is the primary way to charge the unit, you have to first solve the simultaneous charging and accessory connection issues first.True, using bluetooth is the only option on this unit, but it is not always convenient or practical, plus I have concerns for added radiation that can be avoided by using physical wired accessories. I don't want to throw away perfectly serviceable accessories and upgrade to bluetooth capable ones.When USB C Splitter charging/data transfer adaptors are connected, the amazon says the charging cable is too slow and can only be used when unit is sleep. It isn't. The charging cable is the fastest USB-C with a dedicated outlet, but that annoying warning disables any wired accessory functionality.Long story short, you can only charge or use a wired accessories one at a time with its only USB-C connection.TOUCHSCREEN BUGS WHEN SCROLLINGThere are issues with touchscreen specially in vertical mode that were absent in the previous generation. I would have kept my previous version had I known this will  be an issue.When scrolling video websites on the browser like youtube, the mere act of scrolling in the form of using your finger to go up and down are mistaken as a click and it keeps taking you to whatever video that happen to be under your finger while  scrolling. Same applies to any active links even if the site is not youtube, etc.You must use the front end of your finger ONLY to prevent this behavior. Otherwise if you are swiping with the side of the finger, it will be invariably mistaken as a click. Really drives me mad. I updated all the firmware and the issue still persist.Also, I ran into another odd issue where the touchscreen input of any kind were TOTALLY disabled. The screen was not responding to anything. Couldn't turn the unit off either by pressing the side button, because after that you have to choose among three options of taking a screenshot, restart and shutdown. All of them can only be chosen with touching the buttons only. I reset the unit by attaching a wired keyboard via the USB-C that allowed me to use a mouse to shut the unit down and restore functionality. Otherwise, your unit may become inoperable.SCREEN PROTECTOR BUBBLE ISSUESThe issue of a working and compatible screen protector have always plagued the fire tablets. Screen protector installation should be an option for Fire that is offered by amazon out of the box at  extra charge. It shouldn't be left to the user to do it.The third party manufacturers that make the screen protectors always create crappy, cheap and non-working products. Even after thorough cleaning of the screen and following instructions, you get bubbles under the screen protectors that persist.  They are extremely prone to cracks, glare and reflections, even though the description says neither will be an issue."
"I've had a number of Amazon tablets over the years.  I started out with a Kindle when they were $399 if I remember correctly.  Just an e-reader at that point but I was an early adopter.  The Fires I have had have been hit and miss.  I've bought them at different time for myself, family, and friends.  Reliability is not great.  Not horrible but not great.  One of the recent ones I bought quit after about 3.5 years.  Newest one, max 11 is somewhat quirky.  Freezes sometimes and I have been disappointed in some of the app offerings in the Amazon ecosystem.  Overall for $184 with stylus and keyboard cover, it's a good bang for the buck.  The iPad is still WAY better in every way except price.  It's nice that you can actually get a fairly decent discount on iPads now if you are smart  about it and don't have to have the very newest generation.  If you want to spend $200 and more than that is not feasible, the newest Fires are the answer.  If you can swing $400 - $600, get a brand new iPad Air or possibly even a Pro.  They are still the best of the market in my opinion.  Keep in mind, Apple is crazy priced on some accessories so figure those into your purchase."
"I love the size and speed, but hate the power finger print button doesn’t work well for me."
"Update: I received a replacement, and finally was able to return both it and the original defective item and get a refund. I have since purchased a similarly priced Samsung tablet + pen, which works worlds better. However, I have noticed one thing that the Amazon tablet was better at. Handwriting recognition from the pen with the Amazon was phenomenal and much better than on the Samsung, even though the S pen itself is great. So here would be my final assessment. If you get this at sale price, it's worth it IF either you already use exclusively Amazon apps for music, video, etc and want the upgrade of a pen and/or keyboard, or IF you want to use the pen with the Microsoft apps exclusively and don't need any other productivity apps. For me, it was initially tempting to buy since I mostly use Microsoft for work and was looking to take hand-written notes in OneNote, however having no reliable access to Google products and other basic apps such as Whatsapp, along with an unstable OS, it was not worth it....Update: The dance with customer service has been absolutely unreal. I was finally able to obtain a replacement, but I really just would love to return the dang thing because I am no longer secure in their unstable OS or their nonexistent customer service should I have any further warranty issues. Again, good luck talking to anyone who can understand you or has any knowledge about Amazon products or Amazon returns, warranties, or exchanges at all. It's like we're back to those early outsourced call centers of the 80's and 90's all over again!...Update: Customer service called to apologize for their service. However, the crashing apps issue persists AND now any apps that claims to be 'stored on the SD card"" (I have not inserted any external SD card) are endlessly ""optimizing"" and can't be used. DO NOT BUY. Defective and Amazon will not troubleshoot or replace their product....So much potential. In theory. In practice, it is totally unusable as even the most basic preinstalled apps like internet browser and settings crash constantly upon opening them. Other standard apps, such as Microsoft apps, crash on download from the Amazon app store. Backup & Restore does not work so the factory reset required to temporarily fix this each time means losing everything and starting over constantly. Customer service is a joke, they just copy and paste the same prewritten troubleshooting steps that you can Google yourself without actually listening to what the issue is. I tried with them for hours, but they litterally don't even understand basic questions in order to answer them. They're just like chatbots even though they're real people. They see a keyword in your question and paste in a search result related to that one word even if it has nothing at all to do with what you've asked. It is too bad, it seemed like the perfect entry level option for somebody like me who just wants to take notes, check email, and browse social media. The pen works really great. But too good to be true. I can't get customer service to help me troubleshoot or replace, and I already tossed out the box so I can't return it. Now I have an expensive paper weight. Lesson learned, will never by an Amazon Fire product again, big mistake."
"I traded in a Fire HDX that I bought years ago that had basically become useless after Amazon ended support for it, which is a shame because it was still an impressive tablet nearly 10 years after its initial release. I used the credit and trade-in discount to preorder a Fire Max 11 with the keyboard and stylus bundle and was very excited and impressed when it arrived. The frame appeared to be of solid construction, the screen clarity was comparable to an iPad, and the accessories worked seamlessly and were a pleasure to use. I was particularly impressed with the responsiveness of the keyboard and loved that the back cover and stylus both attached magnetically. On initial impression, I was very satisfied with the purchase.Then came the part that I figured I would be less impressed with, the software. Amazon's proprietary Fire OS is a notoriously dumbed-down and cordoned-off analog of Android. It restricts what you can do with your device and what apps are available to you through the Amazon Appstore. For instance, you have no access to adblocking apps that allow you to browse the internet in peace. The Silk web browser doesn't allow browser extensions even if you could download an adblocker from the native app store. Many other apps that I use regularly on iOS were also unavailable, such as my various fantasy football platforms, Duolingo, and Google Translate. Fortunately, you can easily sidestep these limitations by installing the Google Play store using fire toolbox. In doing so, you must disable automatic and over the air updates from Amazon to prevent your alterations from being overridden. I was able to find everything that I wanted to have on the device and added a couple of web browsers that support ad blockers, but I quickly ran into complications. I have not sideloaded apps onto a device before, so it may have just been a lack of knowledge and experience. I was unable to sign into my Google account on Chrome and Microsoft Edge was not fully loading webpages, leaving me with an error message when I attempted a search. A few other apps added from Google Play had issues with screen orientation and frequently caused a crash. Perhaps a savvier user could've gotten everything up and running smoothly; maybe the Fire Max 11 being so new was causing compatibility issues, but after troubleshooting for several hours I came to the realization that this was all too much work to make a brand-new device function the way that I wanted it to. Even if I could find solutions to these issues, I could easily see it being a constant struggle to keep everything working long term, especially considering that you have to disable updates just to get this far.The Fire Max 11 is a nice tablet, and the keyboard/ stylus bundle makes it a well equipped laptop lite. Realistically though, the keyboard is only going to be useful for a handful of tasks like editing a Word document or searching for a better tablet on Best Buy. Amazon appears to be half-heartedly swerving back into a market that it abandoned years ago. After discontinuing the HDX line of tablets Amazon focused solely on low-cost devices intended mostly for video streaming and shopping, leaving the mid and top shelf markets to Apple and Samsung. This feels like an awkward attempt to bridge that gap with a device that could be so much more were it not hampered by substandard software. If you're looking for a mid-range tablet that could function as an entertainment/ productivity hybrid device, buy a Lenovo. Similar quality and price, but without Amazon's bloatware and inferior operating system."
"I’ve owned this tablet for 1.5 years and at first I was happy with its speed, improved display, and size.  This is my 6th kindle tablet.  However, Amazon has quietly and with no warning removed two of the reasons to buy this tablet instead of an Android tablet that gives you full access to all of the google play store apps, instead of the limited selection Amazon gives you.  These two distinctive features are no more:  (1) Show Mode, which lets you use the tablet like an Echo Show, which is very handy when traveling especially, and (2) Hands Free Alexa.  Now you need to unlock the device and be in the Alexa app to get Alexa functionality.  Until just a few weeks ago, they advertised these two features right here.  Now it is removed, and those of us who bought this because of the Alexa features now feel cheated.  Don’t buy this if you don’t want limited functionality.  You’re so much better off with an older iPad or Android tablet that is a fully functioning tablet with no restrictions on the apps you can install, including the Alexa app.  Amazon’s customer obsession is non existent here.  Stay away."
The screen is very sensitive... the older versions are much better.
"There are things that I like and dislike about this tablet. First let me say that I’m a “fruit brand” lover. I’ve always owned “fruit tablets” but I’m sick of paying the price for them and they don’t have expandable memory. Also, they usually lasts for about 2-3 years and it slows down or stops working and you need to spend another 1600 bucks for a new one.I researched Fire tablets for a while before purchasing. I love that they are expandable and bought the biggest memory card to go with it. It took a day or two to get used to after using a different brand for so long but it is easy to use and the battery lasts forever! Love that! I enjoy that I don’t have to worry about running out of memory. I don’t have to delete pictures or anything.Now the thing about this that really grinds my gears- I understand it’s an Amazon product but does Amazon think that consumers only shop with them?! The tablet will not let you put other shopping widgets on the screen! You can type them in, but you can’t put the shortcut icon buttons on your device! Now, with my fruit tablet- I have their music app and their tv and movie app but they don’t stop me from adding the Amazon prime icon or widget to my device! They know the customer is going to use more than just their app. I love the price of the Amazon tablet. Is it worth not having the convenience of the widgets on my screen? Probably. I’m sure I’ll get used to it in time but I think Amazon should not be so insecure and allow customers to do whatever they want with the device they purchase. If I want to put the popular auction site on my screen, I should be able to. If I want to put the big blue box store on my screen, I should be able. If Amazon changes this, I’d buy another and gift this one to a student or someone in need.I hope they read these."
"Although the Max 11 is faster than the previous model I owned, I have had instances when it returns to the lock screen while I am reading a book. I read daily, & this has occurred 4 times in the brief time I have owned the device."
"I bought this tablet to use solely for video steaming and viewing. I have an iPad Pro which I love and use for everything else. I get nervous taking that out all the time though, as it was so expensive. I like to have a cheap tablet I can throw in a bag and not worry too much about losing etc. I have a Kindle Fire 10 which has served this purpose well.I was very impressed with the Fire Max 11 when it came. It looks great. The reduced bezels and metal design make it look a class above anything else they have made. It is much snappier and the screen is amazing for the price. I was very pleased with the purchase.Then I started using it for my intended purpose. The app I use the most is Plex. Every time I pressed on a thumbnail for a show or movie in the app the movie or show next to it would open. I have no idea if this is a bug in the app, the OS or the a hardware issue, but whatever it was it was driving me insane. Next was the video playback itself. In Plex, Netflix and Prime Video all the videos looked over-sharpened to me. Like how a photo looks when you go crazy with the sharpening slider in Photoshop. Again, I don't know where in the process this was happening. I Googled and Googled and couldn't even find anyone else with the same issue. In the end I sent it back. Such a shame, but I'll stick with the Fire HD 10 until the next gen comes out. I'll try that in a store before I buy."
"The Fire HD10 is a better choice, less expensive and better app support.  Peacock TV app is not supported at all. The Android default control on screen bottom buttons are in the way with some apps. The HD10 software quality, should be a goal for the Max 11. Better hardware must be matched, with quality software and consistent behavior as provided in the Fire HD10. Maybe the developers should pull source code from the HD10’s build tree? Need Peacock TV and same functionality as in the HD10. No reason to upgrade, if loose out by paying more. Keeping my HD10. Disappointed."
"This is the fifth Kindle tablet I have purchased.  I have always been very happy with my tablets.  I opened the box and connected it to a charger.  After several hours, I tried to use it.  It took many attempts to get the touch screen to respond using my finger or a stylus, and when it did finally respond, it needs to confirm it is me.  I receive a code to enter.  I enter the code, and it says that I have deleted my phone number from my account, which I most certainly did not.  Again, back to the touch screen not working.  After a restart, reboot, and whatever it is if I press and hold the volume down and power button at the same time, the touch screen still doesn't work.  Back in the box and back to Amazon it goes.  What a joke.  Update:  A very pleasant and helpful customer service rep, Brandy, called me, and she was able to get the touch screen to work, and it has been working fine over the last 24 hours.  Kudos to Brandy for being kind and patient with a very cranky customer.  I haven't done much other than play a game on it, so I'm rating at 4 stars until I can use it a bit more.  So far, so good.  Update:  I sent it back to Amazon.  The touch screen didn't work consistently.  Amazon blamed the third-party cover, but they sold the cover to me, so that doesn't make any sense.  I couldn't get it to recognize my Bluetooth headphones, let alone pair with them, and there is no way to plug in wired headphones.  I would have enjoyed the larger screen if it had been enlarged horizontally as well as vertically.  The new configuration seemed awkward to me."
The buttons are on the bottom.  If you buy a cover with a picture the picture is upside down in order to put the buttons and plug on top.  My old 11 gen has the buttons and plug on top.
"I bought this tablet to be an all-around replacement for an old tablet I have that I use for light surfing and different social media apps. This tablet, with the included keyboard case sold as part of a package deal, is not Facebook-friendly. The tablet, when docked with the keyboard case, is in the landscape orientation for the screen. The problem with this is that the Facebook app doesn't rotate to the landscape orientation. You have to undock the tablet from the keyboard to make Facebook readable. Every other app auto-rotates, that's one good thing about this tablet."
"Love the tablet, but you can't change the wake word.  This is a disadvantage when you got multiple fire tablets in your household forcing me to turn the hands free mode off."
"I don't like that my photos are now in ""Amazon photos,"" and they cannot be shared. I also do not like the Gallery app. Neither one is user friendly. I miss the photo app that was on my old Kindle."
I'm not able to download Netflix or Paramount+ but i am able to do that on my other Fire devices.  It keeps crashing.  So it doesn't last
"It's sluggish for a brand new tablet, the operating system is also strange and keystone apps are not there. Like YouTube or normal Google search."
"I tried to connect an external mouse. For ergonomics, I bought a stand and thought I could use OTG like my Galaxy phone and attach a wireless trackpad or one of those presentation clickers to swipe pages in a book or skip to the next reel. Doesn't work. They are locking these devices down more than the previous ones. It's sad because I own 4 Fires, and with Amazon moving away from Android, I doubt I will buy another one. Amazon should be focusing on making books easier to read. You shouldn't have to side-load Google Play on an Android device. These devices would make excellent alternatives to iPads if we could only get Google Classroom on them. Oh well.On the plus point, you can actually stream to another device from this tablet, and the screen is leaps and bounds better than the last Fire 12 HD. The price, on sale, is very reasonable. They need to open up these devices on the software and peripherals. Amazon will make money if we keep shopping, and limitations limit the need for shopping. I would have gotten an air mouse and a wall mount if OTG was supported.Lastly, they don't want us to use a microSD card. It's clunky. Memory is cheap. This is supposed to be a budget device; at least fix the microSD card issues. I almost returned the whole thing. If you can look past those few things, it is everything I expected and more. Clearly leaps and bounds over the Fire 12 HD."
"there is no place to plug in headphones.  you can buy an adapter for usb c, but then can't charge at the same time.  I did find an adapter to allow charging and earphone, but i shouldn't need to have this extra adapter in the USB C port.  also, 3' cord is a little short.just put a headphone jack in.  don't assume everyone wants Bluetooth earbuds."
"Wish I could write a better review.  Okay so I bought this for a Christmas gift for my Aunt to replace the one that she had that bit the dust. And this one was good until the first week of February.  Mind you this was a Christmas gift , so barely a little over a month old.  She had told me about the continuous ads always popping up I said that unfortunately that’s part of there deal to keep the games/ puzzles free.  She said it goes from ad to ad to ad and then something about her keyboard language.  I told her when I come up to visit in a couple weeks I will check it out and as soon as I got on it, I could tell it was jacked up it flipped from page to page to page page, and it would land on a page that said, selector keyboard language, so we tried to reset it and change the settings on it. We called customer service three different customer service specialist to finally have them say that they could have it sent back in and they could see if they could fix it and if they can’t, they would replace it which OK that’s fair enough , but needless to say it’s a pain.  And who knows how long that will actually take to get it back. Just very frustrating."
"The tablet itself is great and it runs smooth.However the keyboard leaves a lot to be desired, firstly there is absolutely no escape key and no way to program it unless using a 3rd party software (I have not tested the software). Next the mouse pad does not have a right click...... I have no idea why they left out these basic functions but it is very frustrating."
It jumbs to different screens.  Not easy to use like the last one.  I would not buy again.
"I had to send the first one back because the speakers stopped working right. They were fine at first but after a few days they were only putting out about half the volume. I thought maybe the volume in settings needed adjusted but it was where it should be. I contacted customer service and they sent a replacement. A short while later I started having the same issue. I hadn't had the volume cranked too high on either one until after they quit working, I had to just to hear it a little. Then there is the fact that the number of available apps has gone down. Apps that I had on my previous version are no longer available. The ones that are available are generic and from developers I've never heard of. I will say that this one does run a lot faster than my old one. I'll just have to use a Bluetooth speaker to listen to anything."
"I had purchased an Amazon fire tablet 11 Max. I loved it. It had echo show toggle and it connected to my Enterprise Gmail account. So I decided to purchase another one and mount it on my wall. I built a whole platform on the wall. At the beginning of the day, I could ask Alexa to show me my calendar and show me my emails before I walked out the door. Now that I own two fire tablet 11 Max, they took the show mode away I assume they did it with an update. And now my Gmail account because it's Enterprise won't connect to Alexa. I just wasted my money. I would have never purchased another one knowing that they could take features away from your tablet later on down the road. I spent weekends to build a special place for it on my wall. I am seriously frustrated that they can do this. It's not right. It's not ethical"
"This Fire tablet is advertised as Hands-Free.  Occasionally, about twice a day. In response to a question or command I am told to unlock the tablet.  This means typing in a PIN.  How is this Hands-Free?Aside from this, it works as well as all the previous versions of Fire."
Works good but a bit slow. Needs access to Google Store.
The tablet works fine! What I don't like is the only things you can download are Amazon approved Apps and games. The selection is very limited.If I were to purchase another tablet it would not be the Kindle Fire. I was in a hurry and this was next day delivery. :(
Nice size.  Nice color photos.  Constantly does not stay on page.  Often sticks when doing something like games or posting.  You have to wait until it catches up.  Annoying.  Always have to hit back arrow to continue.  Freezes to much.  I wish I kept my. Old kindle.
"I'm a big fan of fire tablets but there's a few big problems with this one. First is the sound, it doesn't produce enough enough sound to be able to be heard all the time the range of the speakers is pretty low. Second is the Bluetooth connection it is pretty bad a connecting automatically it usually requires a manual connection which is really annoying. Other than those two things which are pretty big in my mind it is pretty nice I like the qualities of the thing I wouldn't buy the keyboard again if I had the option but I really like the magnetic case that Amazon makes for it. For the money I still think it's one of the better tablets."
"I bought this tablet for a mostly entertainment and occasionally some light productivity such as reading emails and maybe even occasionally doing some light work-related things that I don't need a full laptop for.The physical device itself is great, it has a bright screen and seems sturdy enough. I would have appreciated an audio port for corded headphones, but not very many devices these days have them so I can't really deduct points for that.The user interface (Fire OS) is trash though. As soon as I set it up, I wanted to install the Gmail app, Chrome, and YT Music since these are the apps I use most often on my Android phone. However, NONE of these basic apps exist for the Fire tablet. It has its own custom Amazon app store which IS NOT the same as the Google Play store.It also has apps that you can't delete, and the purpose of these apps is to try to sell you services that are owned by Amazon. I get enough ads shoved in my face on the Internet so I paid extra for the ad-free version of this table, yet I still get push notifications to buy things. I declined Office 365 when I set up the tablet, but it was installed anyway and after a day or so started sending me push notifications to buy it. Freeve is pre-installed and can't be removed, along with Prime Video, Kindle, Amazon Music, Goodreads, and so on. Notice a pattern? All are apps that are owned by Amazon and have ""convenient"" in-app purchases and upgrades that you can spend money on.I bought the tablet, paid extra for the ad-free version, and it still keeps trying to sell me things. I just want to use the tablet in peace without being pushed to buy things."
I have tried to stop the drop down notifications even with Amazon help nothing works. Notification drop down shuts down anything that I'm doing. it never stops. If it wasn't for this the fire would be great. As long as the notification drop down is left I would not recommend the fire.
The only bad thing I can say about this Fire Max tablet is that the batter sucks. It doesn't last long at all. I can charge it to 100% play it for less than 30 minutes and it goes down to 72%. That's NOT good.
After 3 months the battery is so slow to charge and drains fast although I am using the original charger that came with product. Idk if that is a problem from the beginning because it never lasted as the other one I have and that one works just fine.
"I had a kindle fire 10 9th generation die. I was not able to restore my profile from this tablet to the new fire max 11, but instead gave me no choice but to restore from the older 8 inch fire. I cannot choose which tablet profile to restore from. I lost a lot of games and information. This situation is very frustrating and I am on the fence on whether to keep it or send it back. Had to get Amazon technical support involved they were very helpful but couldn’t transfer everything….just sick over the whole situation…games lost and were paid for…Update…after going through my game and app purchases, I was able to restore my games on my own just by selecting and downloading each individual game that was still available that i had purchased in the past. There were some games I had paid for that were not available any more for download or purchase. So after some time spent I was able to just about get my tablet back to the standards I like for my enjoyment and everyday use…That being said the tablet is nice and picture is great. just would have liked more stable or better quality case selection than what’s available…"
I don’t know why but Roblox will randomly kick me out and I have had issues with the Otto correct duplicating words over and over. You also have to get a subscription for apps that are free in other devices like fortnight
"I have had many fire tablets.  I believe upwards of 18.  Some were replacements.  I have two autistic 6-year-old boy and girl twins, so it is what it is.  I really like the metal construction.  The back can and does scuff but remains stable.  I like the larger screen and my kids have no issues navigating this.  The battery lasts quite a bit longer.  I have to punch in a code every time it is turned off but no big deal.  The old fire tables would break on the back and the screens would crack.  I could have my kids playing on them for months afterwards.  The Fire 11 screens are definitely much stronger but when dropped in a way that they crack they are useless.  I purchased four of these at the reduced holiday price and the same thing happened to all of them.  When the screen cracks it creates tiny, razor sharp shards of glass that can rip your skin or actually come apart off the surface.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS if you have children that could drop or throw this.  You will be putting your children at risk of glass in their fingers.  I did an excellent job of installing the custom-made screen protector, but it is pointless if you have children in the spectrum as they will find a way to peel it off."
"Although it is very all encompassing with all the bells and whistles. I'm still using my older Kindle.At night, when I'm reading, this one is just too heavy for me."
"If you plan to expand your Fire Max 11 memory by using a micro SD card then plan on going through a complex and difficult process. The vast majority of micro SD cards with capacity greater than 32 GB uses a disc format called ""exFat"" and this is NOT compatible with the Fire Max 11. Fire Max 11 can only use memory cards with the Fat32 format. In order to use a micro SD card larger than 32 GB you will have to ""reformat"" your micro SD card. This is complicated and time consuming and usually requires the use of third party formatting tools. In other words it is a pain in the backside and if I had realized this is what is required to expand the storage capacity of Fire Max 11, I never would have purchased it. Be warned!!!"
Doesn’t come with correct case
"The graphics are good as is the response to touch operations.Big gripe: the battery drains quickly and recharges slowly. So, unless you bring your charger along, I consider this tablet a bad choice for portability."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This review has been updated. The Fire tablet is working as intended. Software updates have fixed most problems of glitches and app crashes.It feels very premium. But it is very heavy. I couldn’t recommend this tablet over Kindle because it is very heavy. I mostly use it for Amazon content because I subscribe to various Amazon services when there are promotions.But even though I mostly only use Amazon's own apps, there are a few apps that I deem necessary for the tablet user experience that are not currently available on the Amazon Appstore. The Amazon App Store is crippled and handicapped, but has potential.(Many of the problems with Fire tablets can be circumvented if the Google Play Store and the Aurora App Store can be side loaded, and Google Services can be given permissions to operate on the background in the settings. For example, many sideloaded Android games that say that they can't be played on this Fire Max 11 tablet, all of a sudden work when I gave Google Services to operate in the settings/background).Apps that had to be sideloaded, unfortunately, was the official Microsoft Outlook email app, the Blink camera app, the official Microsoft One Drive app, Microsoft SwiftKey keyboard app, Microsoft Xbox Cloud Gaming app, the official YouTube app, free Library apps, MGM+ app, and even Amazon's own apps that don't exist on the Amazon Appstore but are available on the Google Play Store."
"What a nightmare, changing from a Fire 8 to a Fire 11!  Not  fun . But I like the tablet."
"I am excited about this purchase and it worked well last evening, but am giving it three stars as I am concerned that we received an error when charging it for the first time about moisture being in the port or charger right out of the box.  I did a Google search and see other individuals have received this error as well and it really doesn't mean anything which is extremely odd."
"8/9/23 Update looked into the accual codec support and it does support HDR but does not work as Atmos as before. There are so many bugs in the Fire OS. I guess I really don't understand how these things are missed during the QA process before releasing it. For the price there are better options out there. If Amazon wants to compete the need to correct it.  Let's start of by saying there are issues with the new Tablet, It does not support Dolby Atmos even though it states it does. When playing videos it only reports Opus audio no matter what video I use. It defaults at times toOnly 720p and not 1080p. It also appears that it's running the same software as the 2022 8 HD plus witch also does not play Atmos even though they both have the codec for it. With the resolution of the new 11 I am surprisedIt will not support 1440p. Even though the new CPU supports it. I am hoping these issues can be corrected in a timely manner for what Amazon is asking price wise. I mainly use it for videos and streaming along with shortwave software and my SDR. I have installed the Play store without any problems and changed the stock keyboard for Gboard instead along with some apps. Overall the new 11 Max has a lot of potential if Amazon decides to do so.I will update my review if updates correctly resolve the issues. Amazon I hope you read this because there are alternatives for the user for the price. 😉🙃"
"I liked the overall quality and function of the hardware. I would have kept it if it would do what tablets (should) do and not do what tablets shouldn't. But I returned it and here's why.I expect an Android tablet to sync my passwords, emails, calendar, etc. through my Google account or alternative browser (e.g. Firefox or Edge). All such apps should integrate with each other and across devices. You don't get any of that with this tablet. I mean it. NONE. You're back to the days of manually typing your contact list into a new device.The product description says the Google Play Store isn't available on this tablet. I could live with that; I don't use many apps, and there are quite a few apps in the Amazon app store. But the limitations are far more severe than a lack of third party apps. You simply cannot sync to anything Google. And you can't do a work-around through any major browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).  To me, that means I can't do most of what I bought the tablet to do.I also noticed while looking through security and privacy settings that Amazon asks for a lot of access to your data--and your voice and ... well, I'm not sure how much, but I read enough to know I wasn't comfortable with it.In summary, if you use this device the way most people use tablets or if you care about security and privacy, you probably won't be satisfied with this tablet."
"The unit itself has a nice display, but the built in software is not so good. The interface is clearly meant to support Amazon products and the search engine is seriously lacking. For all its faults, Google is still much better at locating information. If all you want is a tablet to shop on Amazon or watch Prime videos, this is your baby, but if you need a more robust tablet, keep looking."
I returned the tablet. I don't think there was anything wrong with it. I have problems with my eyes and couldnt' find an adjustment to the brightness setting that made it comfortable for me to see it. I returned the time and they received it on March 6th. I had returned another item that they received 2 days later and received a prompt refund.I am still waiting for my refund. I called last week and was told that it would take 30 days to receive a refund. Today I chatted with customer service and they refused to put the funds back on my debit card. They forced me to take a refund on my original credit card. So now I still have to wait til whenever they decide to do my refund to get my money back. They said they processed the refund and it wil take 3-5 days for it to be creditted back to my credit card. So still waiting for my refund. I'll probably see it the 12th of NEVER. Bad experience and when I get the money back it will be spent somewhere else.
"A little back story, my laptop died and I didn't really want to get another laptop with Windows OS. I needed something in the budget category too.I got a Fire 11 because it was less expensive than the tablet I really want. It's also less expensive than tablets with similar specs.I was looking for something that I can mostly use as an e-reader, streaming, browsing, and occasionally use like a laptop for doing things like taxes and word processing.It's a decent budget tablet.PROS-the price is low compared to tablets with similar specs-the screen is pretty good-decent speakers-good performance for reading, streaming, and browsing-light weight-accessories aren't overly expensive-it's possible to add the Google Play store and access more and better functioning apps-good battery life/10 hours of reading, surfing, and you tubing with 20% charge left-it's possible to add additional storage-it only costs $12 to go ad freeCONS-4GB RAM-low power CPU- multitasking will cause lagging and stuttering ie more than 3 tabs open while browsing, multiple apps open at the same time-Amazon app store is less than stellar-bloatware ie all Amazon, all the time-haven't found a way to remove the device dashboard icon from the task bar-device dashboard opens whenever it's touched ie by accident or just holding the tablet with the left handI'd rate the Fire 11 as 3.5. The bloatware is tolerable. It can be put in a folder and ignored. Device Dashboard is truly aggravating. The price increase to go with 128GB storage was approximately the same as the cost of the SD card. I didn't have a spare SD card so I went with extra storage."
Not happy with  the product. Had the Fire 11 tablet for 25 days and loaded all my books and lost money and time returning . would not allow return for replacement . Had to pay more to get a replacement of same Produce. Tablet worked great but shut off on it's own after about 45 minutes.. Customer service were helpful but supervisor would not approve a one for one swap. Price increase was charged.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Dies pretty fast and takes a while to charge
"I love watching movies in bed, it's great for that. I have played some games on it, it works fine for streaming those. I do have a problem with my touch screen lagging when I tap on anything. Sometimes it taps the wrong location which is annoying. If that's a problem with manufacturing I'll try returning it for a replacement."
"Only issue - The speakers worked well until i plugged in a set of headphones. After unplugging and trying to use the speakers the sound level kept getting lower, even though I had it all the way up.  I tried doing a factory reset and that worked for a couple hours and then the same thing happened with the sound level getting lower.  I did not plug in any external speaker and it still happened.  So now if I want to watch something, I need to use an external speaker. This issue is not worth the cost of this tablet. I have 3 other Fire tablets going back 10 years and have no issues with them.  This one is a pain without speakers."
"I used to love my old Kindle. I buy a lot of e-comic books and I could use the Kindle to keep my collection organized and accessible. Then Amazon shut-down the e-comic book site, Comixology. Their comic book reading interface dropped in quality immediately. I couldn't zoom in on small panels that were hard to read. I complained to Amazon but got no help. (Apparently, what happened was that when they got rid of Comixology, a lot of the function went away but Amazon did NOT explain that.) I bought a new Kindle thinking that would help. Made it WORSE. There's a panel that's supposed to open so you can add storage. I used the tool they included and it will NOT open (I watched How-To videos and saw a number of comments that the panel is hard to open. Why is this device HARDER to work than earlier versions? Shouldn't it be getting better?) The full list of books I own will NOT load if I want to see what I have. It takes a very long time for even the list of A through D to E or so to spottily appear, often without the covers, and some titles do NOT show on the list.  You can look up titles by name but that would be like going to a bookshelf for A book ... readers don't do that. You go to a bookshelf to see what catches your eye or what title you've been meaning to read but forgot... Not to mention that I'm a comic book reader... Trying to look up by title? How many books do you think have the words ""Batman"" or ""Spider-Man""? This is typical Amazon arrogance and disdain. They own all the markets. There was a good thing with Comixology but Amazon bought it, killed all the functionality and usefulness and what are you going to do?  They own the market, as I said, so they know you can't just find a better service.  I'm so furious. I love to read and Amazon has made it a CHORE after I gave them hundreds of dollars and bought this useless hunk of electronic junk. They'll probably never run this review but save your money and buy paper books."
"I dislike the ""volume"". Even at its highest setting the sound isn't really loud enough for videos.  I have started using the subtitle feature so I do not miss key pieces of dialogue.  I am using an Amazon keyboard case so the speakers aren't blocked. I remove that case when watching feature films sometimes, because I thought perhaps the keyboard case might be affecting the power going to the sound function.  (Sorry, definitely not an expert on such things.)  Headphones usually work, but shouldn't be necessary.  I miss my Fire 10, the sound was better.  Otherwise, I enjoy my Fire 11.  (I am not fan of the touchpad in the Amazon keyboard case by the way.)"
"First, I don't really notice any significant size increase... compared to the last tablet I bought. I've purchased four Fire Tablets over the last several years and each had a HEADPHONE JACK. ... I listen to music with headphones and also enjoy late nights watching Prime shows using headphones... so its extremely important to have a headphone jack on Fire Tablets... I frequently charged the tablet while using with headphones... that was great to be able to do that with all my other previous Tablets.  I think it's heinous that Amazon did not add a headphone jack to this recent tablet.  So to help resolve this issue, I searched Amazon for an adapter that supposedly would allow me to use headphones and charge at the same time-  Bought two different adapters... neither worked simultaneously... meaning it would charge but sound would not be heard through headsets...  So after that I literally spent over an hour on Amazon Chat trying to get advice directly from Amazon of what adapter to buy that would charge while listening to headphones simultaneously.  After being transferred multiple times from agent to agent, one of the agents claimed he searched Amazon and found two adapters that would be compatible with this Fire Tablet to charge and listen to headphones simultaneously. I asked him directly is he sure the two adapters he recommended would work. He assured me they would work fine. So I trusted him and bought both adapters... and guess what ?? Neither works !!! Neither can charge and have listening capacity by headphones at the same time !! So now I've spent money on four different adapters that do not allow to charge and listen to headphones simultaneously... This could have all been avoided if Amazon had simply included a headphone jack. Utter disappointment.  So as far as I'm concerned this new model is definitely not Max upgrade quality."
"Nice tablet. However, it is not really customizable, like I prefer. You can't clear the icons from the home page of the tablet but the icons can be placed in folders to declutter the screen to some degree. Live wallpapers and gifs(applied as wallpapers) are not supported. There's also a suggestion page that doesn't go away(see pics). In order to remove certain suggestion tabs etc from the screen I had to go through a bit much. Google helped a lot in navigating where to go in the settings to clear somethings from the screens of the tablet. The touchscreen is responsive but just slightly sluggish(slight delay)at times, but overall, it's fast enough. Storage space can be extended with sd card. Lightweight and sturdy build. The sound quality is not the best...not very loud nor super crisp(probably the most standard speakers built in), but it'll due. Video quality is decent. Camera is not great, the pictures look a little gritty(last picture shows picture quality). Zoom is supported, but some apps are not supported like Google meet. But overall, it works for what I need. Decent price for what you get."
"I've had ""10 inch"" tablets and but wanted something smaller and lighter.  I don't use it much as it always has advertisements, but then it is a Amazon device.  The OS is quick and responsive, as it is fairly well built for light as it is.  Would I buy another, no.  I do not like advertisements which is why I use a web browser that blocks them, and I refuse to pay a company to watch content which they also get paid to run advertisements. But I figure you and Amazon should know as to why it honestly got ""Three Stars"".  For those who like or accept advertisements, then it would perhaps be a ""Five Star"" device."
Sometimes its slow and not very responsive.  And now since the Amazon software update it seems the wireless charging capability has disappeared because though it starts to charge wirelessly but when I come back a few hours later it has not charged wirelessly at all.  One of the reasons I bought the Plus version was the wireless charging which just the month or two since I purchased it no longer functions.It just doesn't feel as reliable as my old Fire Tablet 10.  Hopefully I am within the time frame to return it because I don't think its going to hold up for me as I expected.I did a restore to factory settings to get rid of some pesky issues but it still seems lacking.  Very disappointed.
I was really excited to get this because it was on sale it was a good price and I wanted a little tablet that I could play some games on and watch movies and some TV shows. Introduce some shopping Wow Wow imagine I can't load Well imagine I can't load anything I'm on this thing Walmart forget it I know they're in competition with Walmart so they won't let you load their app I get paramount through Walmart and a good price well paramount is like you gotta pay Walmart forget it I know they're in competition with Walmart so they won't let you load their app I get paramount through Walmart and a good price well paramount is like you gotta pay us to get into this thing And then I have games and then my exfinity my provider And then I have games and then my exfinity my provider my internet provider they won't take that app either However there are apps I can buy to get into the apps I want For like399 a month. So I wasted all that money on paramount that I can't access on this thing I won't be able to pay my X. finity bill on this thing I mean I should have saved to get an iPad Small iPad cause this thing is useless to me They have apps I don't care about they have things and games I don't want to play I have games that are established I have monopoly I can't get monopoly on this thing I have to pay to get it before I didn't have to So I'm sure there are things that This thing can provide but I'm not interested in any of the games This is like A hack it's it's no good But I'll keep it to Who knows what I can do with this thing I'm not gonna pay other apps so that I can get into the apps I want For $4 a month forget it and I know people like this thing it is fast there are some positives it's fast it's it works you know but I had this before and I didn't remember but after the year the port went so I couldn't even charge it But it was a good price so but I'm saving for an iPad Small 1 so that I can actually get some things done and things I want because this is I I feel like I I've been taken for a ride with this thing In some you say well And some you say well why don't you return it well I can't cause I already started loading things in and I don't trust anybody to give a cleaning out so And some you say well why don't you return it well I can't cause I already started loading things in and I don't trust anybody to give a cleaning out so I don't know have my bank thing on it or anything because I doubt if it would even take my bank app so well good luck to anybody who really likes this thing I think it would be OK for kids but Amazon is too competitive with other place Especially Walmart Which I find rather amusing isn't there enough money to go around for everybody OK well just be careful if you buy this thing That you know what apps you got what can be loaded checking to it I can't even get it to google play on this thing it goes right to amazon
"This is my third kindle fire and is little to no improvement over my previous gen 7.  Speakers provide less volume vs my tiny Samsung s22.  Performance remains a little buggy on these fires for internet and most apps.  Alexa sucks up way more time then she saves. Her most popular response to simple requests ""I am not sure...""  The value is great compared to other options."
"I got the original 7”32gb  tablet in 2014 and only problem with it as constantly ran out of space.  I decided to try the new 8” fire tablet and was quite disappointed.  A lot of the apps I used 9yrs ago had disappeared from App Store and the apps they did have seemed 2nd rate compared to google play store and Apple Store.  I had wished that I had spent my money on a Samsung galaxy tablet (which I have also had in the past which costs around $100).  I do a lot of ancestry and it didn’t have an ancestry.com app….so I use the browser for that.  I have a lot of movies & tv in Vudu app…again, Amazon Fire store doesn’t have Vudu app…so I use the browser.  Fire store also doesn’t have a YouTube app.  So again, I use the browser.  The icing on the cake, which is why it’s a 2 star rating, is the sound is terrible, even all the way up!  My original 2014 7” fire tablet sound was much better as was my old 2014 8” fire tablet sound….i would’ve thought in almost 10yrs that this tablet would’ve improved and not worsened.  I would’ve also thought the App Store for Fire table would’ve improved with more apps also…sad to say, it lost popular apps I used in 2014 such as the ancestry.com app and CamScanner app which I used 10yrs ago on my Fire tablets.  As for the space, this one I recently bought does have 64Gb and I got a SS card to put into it.  I use it alot for reading.  I noticed like my other 2 fire tablets, kindle app takes up slot of internal space and doesn’t transfer to sd card.  I have a few streaming apps downloaded but there’s no setting to have movies downloaded to sd card.  Some apps do download to sd card.  But it seems that the ones I need to ad to sd card don’t for some reason.  Fortunately I can’t do much on fire except use browser…so it doesn’t matter much…yet.  I was really disappointed in this fire tablet.  I wish I would’ve taken the money I spent on this and gotten a Samsung galaxy tablet which is about the same price as I paid for this tablet, but has good sound and a lot better App Store.  When I watch movies or videos in browser on this fire tablet, due to the poor sound on speakers, I have to use my Bluetooth speaker to actually enjoy the shows.  It is a nice and light tablet, especially compared to my 2014 7” fire tablet.  For watching videos on fire tablet, the screen is good.  You also can’t use other browsers on this fire tablet, just the Amazon browser.  So that was also disappointing.  Would I buy this fire tablet again or recommend it?  Probably not.  Even with headphones the sound isn’t good, though as I mentioned, does sound ok if you use a Bluetooth speaker.  If I couldn’t use tablet with its browser to do my ancestry stuff or to read, it would be a one star rating.  The battery life is good and pretty much lasts me hours without having to recharge.  I also found that on occasion, I couldn’t access stuff using the browser on this tablet that I could with my phone.  Which is also a problem if you need it to do for stuff for work.  That’s happened on at least 3 different occasions in the few months I have had this tablet.  That was another reason I had purchased it.  If I had to do it over again, I wouldn’t choose this tablet, I would’ve gotten a Samsung galaxy tablet which is about same price as this tablet.  If I had a few hundred dollars to spend, I would get an iPad, which I have had 2 in the past 10yrs and haven’t regretted those purchases."
"Updated 10/21/2024: I had finally gotten the newer tablet (2022) version to retain the Audible files on the SD card, even tho I still get a read-only SD error, but the latest OS version installation completely wiped the downloads. Again, I think it's a software issue. Only occurs on Fire devices.I have the 2018 gen Fire 8"" Kindle, but bought the 2022 gen because the SD kept giving me memory errors, so I thought the Kindle was going bad. After spending hours downloading Audible books, I either lose them (they uninstall from the SD card), or I get a pop-up saying the SD is read only, which then forces me to reformat or reinstall, which in-turn uninstalls the books. I've tried different SD brands and sizes (128 GB up to 1T, EVO and SanDisk) and they all fail. They DO work in other devices though. Frankly, I think it's a software issue (OS) because Audible works fine on my Android phone. I paid a lot for the 1T feature and now it doesn't even work. Won't buy another until Amazon fixes their software."
"This is the fourth Kindle Fire I've owned. They usually last me a year or two before they get cranky. Even so, I think they are a good deal for the price.With the first three Kindle Fires I was able to easily sideload Google and Google Play. The process is detailed on several websites. You have to download four apps or programs and then activate them. It went well the first three times.This time, I could not get the process to complete. When I went to activate the last step, which is the step that allows Google Play to function, the tablet kept telling me that it could not parse the program. It appeared that the loaded app was not compatible with the tablet's OS.  I tried again a few weeks ago and tried again more recently after my tablet updated itself. It still won't work.This is a big problem for me. The Silk browser is subpar and that is as nicely as I can put it. Facebook works well, but one of my main uses for my tablet is to read the New York Times and it is at best a wonky process.I am still thinking about returning this tablet and buying a cheap Android one.Another problem is that the best case, the one I love, is no longer being made and everything else does not function as well."
"This is a good idea at the price point if you need a Kindle reader. Beyond that I don't find it to be all that useful beyond using Amazon on it, because they severely restrict the apps that you can use on it. You can't even use something like Google Maps if you wanted to use it as a GPS device in your car. Most Android apps are not allowed and you have to use apps specifically tuned for Fire Kindle readers. So for about 55 bucks you get a decent quality Kindle reader that works fairly well. If you want something more versatile, you'll have to invest in a high grade Android tablet or Apple if that's your thing."
Takes a long time to start and touch to work. Battery goes down so fast not working well at all as time goes on.  Only part I like is the books that I read are better seen on this than a reader. I returned to UPS on November 25 and it does not show up? I am glad they gave me a receipt.
"It was time to trade up and get a newer model of my Fire 8 Plus.  I ordered the latest generation, and I am not impressed at all.Set up was easy and Wi-Fi settings, etc. were ready because it was pre-registered to my account. That was the case with all of my previous trade ups.The reason I am giving this Fire a three star rating is due to terrible performance of the Silk web browser. Although I have excellent Wi-Fi, this browser is slow, buggy, and not what I am used to from Amazon at all.I'm not a newby to the limitations of Fire tablets. I bought the First generation Fire and have had one ever since. I don't care about the limited selection of available apps that most people complain about. I do care about being able to browse and shop with efficiency without the pages lagging and having to constantly restart.I need the browser to work because I don't like using my phone for shopping, and the 8"" Fire size is perfect. Just not this one. I'm considering returning it, but I just hate the hassle."
"I purchased this tablet because I have had two previous Fire HD8 Plus tablets. In fact, I wore them out. For this Fire, I purchased the extra memory card and installed it. It worked sporadically and programs moved to the card kept giving error messages, if they worked at all. Finally, the card quit working entirely and froze the tablet. I had to remove the memory card and reset the tablet to original factory settings, losing everything I had loaded or configured on it. I am slowly getting back to where it was before the factory reset. HOWEVER, the Fire I purchased was ad free and now it has ads on the the main screen. I paid good money for a product that does not meet expectations. When this one wears out, I will move on to a non-Amazon Fire product."
"I’ve had 3 kindles over the years. Average standard time for my first two would be 2 days, sometimes more. This one? I charge it at night it’s dead by the next. Not sure if I got a dud or what. Going to try it for a couple more weeks then will probably return. Very very disappointing. Buyer beware."
Had issues downloading some of my apps then there was the issue getting the play store to download. It's just OK
"I have been unable to transfer the data from my previous, no longer usable kindle.I have tried several methods suggested by customer service, but nothing changes.The few usable items are my music and most of my books.Over the years I have had several kindles, this is the first time I seem to have lost all my info.A new kindle should not be this difficult, there are several other glitches when trying to play games."
The OS doesn't seem to be a real android. It won't sync up with my android phone.
"Back in the days, the Fire tablets were great for the price because all other tablets were really expensive.But, nowadays, the market is far more competitive for the price that you pay for a Fire tablet.First thing's first, you're stuck with the Amazon/Fire OS ecosystem, so you better hope you like it. FWIW, I hated it.Also, this tablet doesn't include flash feature for the cameras. To be fair, many tablets in this price range don't include flash (some do), but I was hoping to use this tablet as a tool for DIY projects where I can reference instructions/tutorials and take pictures of areas that are dark and uncomfortable so I can look at it without breaking my back.These two downsides were enough for me to return and get a refund.Years ago, I probably would've kept it but, nowadays, there's just a lot better options and ones that don't limit your freedom."
I specifically upgraded to this version to include wireless charging and my tablet fails. Charging stops well before 100%. I had to restart charging twice to reach upper 90%. This needs to be fixedAn update; I was told that I would receive a follow up to my original posting. That has not happened. Am I to assume my issue cannot be addressed?
I’m not pleased with this tablet as it seems very outdated .. purchase the newer models if you can . It’s definitely a kids tablet and I am unable to add a lot of apps on it because it’s not supported .. specifically I wanted to add the SHEIN app but I was unable to do so
"I didn’t think the Amazon operating system could get worse. Well, it did.  One of the top selling points was ‘show mode’  when I purchased this tablet. They removed it… (probably to get sells for the echo… cause you could dock this & put it in show mode & the echo became the doorstop that it should be ).  The docking station was an add on for ‘show mode’ & I purchased it when buying the tablet. I have no need for it, now. I can’t figure out how to get that ugly square off of the top. The navigation buttons don’t disappear anymore… they will sit on top of every app except for the kindle app. I had to change navigation to gestures. I feel like I’ve been bamboozled. There’s probably other things as well that I just haven’t noticed. I totally hate this. The only thing good is it’s rugged so I would use it when not willing to risk my iPad. I’ve been buying the fire tablet for years. As I type this from my iPad mini 7, I’ve decided I’ll never buy anything fire again. And you don’t need a wireless charging dock!…especially for  an e-reader like kindle paperwhite & regular kindle with their long battery life (the paper white holds a charge for months). The fire is useless unless you’re a child. You probably thought since once upon a time it had kindle in it’s name it would be great for reading… only if you have a matte screen protector cause the glare is ridiculous. I seriously wouldn’t recommend buying this, but to each their own. If you’re looking to read get a designated e-reader. If you want a little more look into the Samsung S series (A if on a budget) or an iPad. This is not it… it’s not even budget friendly… because it’s trash and a total waste of money!! As with anytime you see fire run…"
Bought with the intention of having a Kindle with a good browser. The screen wasn't that good for long reading and the battery went down way too fast. The browser was proprietary and not user friendly for me. Returned it.
"On paper, this is one of the best (and one of only a very few) smaller tablets still available. And by ""smaller"" I mean hold-in-one-hand size, with a screen in the 8 inch realm. An iPad mini is the other obvious option, but it's pretty expensive for what it is, and has its own drawbacks. So I opted to give a Fire a try.Many things to like: it seems solidly built, has good resolution, and reasonable performance. It's a pretty lightweight device, too -- light enough for one-handed use, and isn't awkward to handle for super casual use.From there, though, are so many negative factors. First and foremost: I really wish Amazon and Google would work things out such that their devices and services worked together. I get that they each have to protect certain aspects of their respective marketing domains, but not allowing the Google Play store for an Android device is frankly ridiculous. It's just too limiting. (To be fair, Google not allowing one to make in-app purchases from Amazon is equally limiting.) I think very few people live exclusively in the Google or Amazon ecosphere. Making it overly inconvenient to access one, from the other, works against consumers and -- ironically -- makes certain devices or services a non-starter (at least for me).Then there's the issue of the Kindle app -- on the Kindle device. How on earth is the Kindle app, on the Kindle device, so much worse than the Kindle app on any other Android device? Why, on my phone for example, can I adjust font sizes, type faces, colors, spacing, et al., with about twice as many different options as on the Kindle-based Kindle app? How does this make any sense?The limitations on customizing the home screen are maddening. I paid for an ad-free device, but the ""recommendations"" banner on the home screen seemingly can't be dispensed with.I returned the Kindle Fire; replaced it with a Samsung A7 Lite, and couldn't be happier with the switch. About the same price, but the Samsung is agnostically Android-native. The Kindle app is the same I've become used to on my phone, and the device overall is simply better. I won't buy such a heavily brand-specific device again, that's for sure."
"I ordered this because my Kindle is too old and isn't holding a charger. I thought that I could transfer my kindle books to this Fire tablet but it doesn't allow me to and if there's a way, I must be too dumb to figure it out!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The packaging consists of a standard slim cardboard box that can be effortlessly opened without requiring scissors or a knife. This type of packaging is akin to what Amazon employs for their Fire Tablets.Included within the package are the tablet itself, a 9v charging adapter, a USB-C cable, and an instruction manual.Regrettably, the screen is excessively reflective. While watching a film on Prime Video, I can see my own reflection, which proves to be quite distracting. A matte display or an anti-glare screen protector could potentially alleviate this issue.The device's body is composed of a durable plastic that exhibits a firm texture, yet it maintains a smooth sensation when touched. The unit I acquired is grey and features the recognizable Amazon arrow emblem.When holding the tablet vertically or in portrait orientation, the primary buttons can be found on the top edge, along with the audio port. The memory expansion slot is situated on the side. Interestingly, the front-facing camera is positioned on the landscape side, while the rear camera is located in the typical spot on the back. The image quality captured is satisfactory, though not exceptional.Thanks to the upgraded chip, the tablet performs more smoothly compared to earlier models. While it may not be as fluid or responsive as high-end tablets, it offers commendable performance for its price range. The loading speed for apps is neither notably fast nor slow, striking a suitable balance in terms of performance at this price point.In conclusion, this tablet presents a reasonable option for those seeking a budget-friendly device that delivers adequate performance and functionality. Although it has its shortcomings, such as the highly reflective screen and average camera quality, the overall user experience is satisfactory given its price range. The tablet's smooth operation, convenient button layout, and sturdy build make it a viable choice for individuals who prioritize affordability without compromising on essential features. Consider investing in an anti-glare screen protector to enhance your viewing experience and make the most of this cost-effective device."
"This device is great for reading.  The screen is nice size, good definition, and easy on the eyes.  The device  is pretty light weight.  However ...The browser ""Amazon Silk"" is awkward to use.  If you are used to Apple or Windows products/aps, the kindle aps and operating system are NOT as intuitive.  Thus, quite frustrating.  I did not use it for music or videos or games.I had hoped it would be a multi use device that would replace my phone for my recreation/entertainment needs (surfing, social media, shopping, email, reading, etc).  Then I could leave my phone strictly for tasks - talk/text/navigation - to reduce distraction from the phone.  My expectations were too high for this price point."
"I really enjoy my Fire Tablet HD8PLUS 64GB. I love being able to listen to Audible books, music, play games, and read books. I have hundreds of books stored on my Fire Tablet and it's nice to have all of my books in one place.My biggest complaint is the fact when I SIGN OUT of my AMAZON ACCOUNT, ALL my SAVED passwords and bookmarks are wiped out along with my EMAIL ACCOUNT.In order to use my FIRE TABLET I must SIGN BACK INTO MY Fire Tablet as if I were REGISTERING MY FIRE TABLET HD8 PLUS for the very first time.  I have to completely RESET UP my Fire Tablet HD8 PLUSIn order NOT TO LOSE ALL of your SAVED PASSWORDS, BOOKMARKS, ADDRESSES, etc, you MUST stayed SIGNED IN TO YOUR AMAZON ACCOUNT 24/7, 365 Days a year.  I notified AMAZON of this and they said they had never heard of this. I've read one other review stating exactly what I have said.AMAZON sent me a BRAND NEW FIRE HD8 PLUS 64GB, however, this has NOT FIXED this issue.It appears AMAZON has set their FIRE HD8 PLUS 32GB & 64GB TABLETS so that you HAVE TO STAY SIGNED INTO YOUR AMAZON ACCOUNT 24/7, 365 DAYS A YEAR or you LOSE ALL your SAVED PASSWORDS, BOOKMARKS, etc.NO ONE should have to stay SIGNED IN TO THEIR AMAZON ACCOUNT IN ORDER YO USE THEIR FIRE HD8 PLUS TABLET.AMAZON DENIES this is true, however, I have now had it happen to me personally on TWO DIFFERENT FIRE HD8 PLUS TABLETS.  In my opinion I believe this is AMAZON'S way of keeping track of what their CUSTOMERS ARE DOING.  I find it a infringement upon my PRIVACY!This is something each person must decide for themselves.Other than this ""PRIVACY"" ISSUE I truly enjoy my Fire HD8 PLUS TABLET."
"I bought this newer version to replace my old Kindle Fire HD 8 seeing how this new one is supposed to be 30% faster.  Yeah, right!  It may be a ""tad"" faster and hold its charge longer, but those two things are not enough to buy this new device!  My advice is keep your old one!!!  There are a few changes to this new and supposedly newer version that really are aggravating.  One is the power button is no longer at the top on the left side, its now at the bottom on the left.  What's the big deal, you think.  Well, with it being at the bottom, when you hold it with your left hand, it is very easy to accidentally turn it off when your palm hits the power button!  The second extremely aggravating thing is the changes to auto rotate.  I like to lock auto rotate to horizontal.  I do not want it changing, thus the reason I lock it.  Well on my old kindle fire HD 8, this feature worked great as it really did lock the screen position.  On this new version, you can select the lock feature, but here is what happens.  So I have it locked for horizontal and I'm reading a ebook, then I click on Facebook or Pinterest, and it goes to a vertical view instead and then  locks to vertical!!!!!  Next step, you have to unlock and relock in horizontal.  This is very inconvenient and aggravating!!!!!  My point is, if your old device is still working well, don't waste money buying this new version!!!!  I regret buying this."
"The device is very slow compared to an iPad which is to be expected but the difference is way more than I actually expected. Many of the predownloaded (and unable to delete) apps including the Amazon shopping app appear to be old versions compared to what is currently offered for iphone/iPad. For the price and for casual activity like reading or browsing the internet, I would recommend but for anything more in depth, I just can't"
"Slow, but I expected that from 3 RAM (& confirming reviews). But I bought this AMAZON tablet to view AMAZON videos & stream AMAZON music so that I wouldn't keep burning out phones by doing these activities on them. Naively expected an AMAZON tablet to perform AMAZON tasks even better than an Android phone, but wrong! Fire can't play my sole self-curated all-access music playlist in my desired order, as phones can; won't even download its songlist. And whereas my phones can handle my several hundred prime videos with ease, my Fire tablet keeps error-messaging out, requiring me to delete all videos and download them again! Who has time to do that every 3 days? I'd expected the Fire tablet's Amazon music app wouldn't crash and crap out on me repeatedly, but it's worse than the phone app (if that's conceivable). No one will ever know why Amazon won't update the software on its own tablet to be at least as current as that on an Android phone; it's just one of life's mysteries we have to put up with. Mistaken purchase; should've bought Samsung or other Android tablet."
"I love my Kindle Fire HD 10 tablet. So much. But it's a little big. Enter, this little guy. Perfect size for reading books and watching streaming TV. The form factor is five stars for sure. I especially love that you can turn the volume button into a page turn. I just like a physical button for that.But! Unfortunately it loses the WiFi signal if I get more than a dozen feet from the router which really blows. Also, 90% of the time it forgets to sleepy time itself off and so hello battery drain if I don't remember to manually shut it down.So close and yet so far in terms of the perfect Kindle Fire. It sucks to be browsing the Kindle book store, pick a book to look more closely at and to then get that lost WiFi signal message. I literally see it every night in bed. Sigh. It does reconnect after a few moments, but then will lose it again invariably.I love the Kindle/Kindle Fire ecosystem but don't love this little device as much as I wanted, unfortunately."
"My eyesight is failing. I needed a small tablet rather than my phone. Got Kindle as it was well rated and I buy my ebooks here. I wanted it for three apps. Kindle, Nook and NYT games. That’s it. Once I bought it, I found out it had its own App Store and I could only get the kindle app. I was going to send it back but my son googled a work around and now my kindle takes any android apps. Problem one solved. Next I paid for no ads but on the opening screen there are three gray bands. Two with amazon and one that says whisper sometging or other. They interrupt the beautiful picture the kindle has on there and bug me. I contacted customer service by email. They were so busy adding all those prewritten apologies and how valued a customer I am to the emails they never answered the question. Multiple back and forth with a new person each time and no help. They wore me down. I quit. Not impressed with it. Wish I had understood what I wasn’t getting when I bought it. I should have bought a tablet from just about any other company."
"Bought this for my 91 yr old mom. She was capable of using a mouse and computer (barely) for accessing Facebook to keep up on family and friends. But the computer got too slow and ancient so I got this for her to use. The developers of this tablet and of Facebook have no clue how to design an elderly-friendly device and OS.  No clue!  Maybe they should rethink their target audience for at least a model of their tablet that works for the elderly. I adjusted all that I could to make it readable... large fonts, large buttons hopefully to let her ""hit"" them with her trembling fingers. But it's next to impossible for her to use this device. I regret getting it for her. It's just too difficult for her to use. I won't go into all the details of why it doesn't work for her, but just take my word for it. Unless your elderly parent is savvy with smart phones, etc. don't bother with this one. It just ends up being a waste of money for something they can't won't use due to difficulty. Device makers out there are totally missing a huge market for the elderly... there's a lot of them and could benefit from an elderly-friendly device and operating system."
"Among other defects, it disconnects itself from internet every day at least once. I was a little past the warranty period when the defects started up and received no help at all from Amazon. I also hate the way they keep changing the homescreen and library willy nilly. It's more difficult to assess and keep track of books. It constantly marks new books as read. At 82, I don't want to lesrn, say, a Galaxy, bu am seriously pissed at Amazon' casual approach to dfeective products."
"When trying to listen to Audible books, it tends to stop mid-play and exit the Audible app to the home screen, same thing happens when trying to look through my cloud library to select a title. The sound from its built-in speakers is absolutely disappointing, they're sooooooo low that I must always use headphones/earbuds or external speakers. The power button is always getting pressed due to poor design placement, too. The processor may be faster, but I don't see it running any faster than my much older Fire HDX 7"" tablet. Oh, and the display is definitely not as crisp and sharp as my older Fire HDX 7"" either. I havebonly been using my Fire HD8 tablet for a few weeks after purchasing about a month ago in September 2023 and Inhave already had to factory reset it due to repeated crashes and hanging up while trying to use Audible. Sadly, I lost my Jackpot Party Casino app slot game unlocks, purchased coins and current player level, as a result. Nothing, absolutely nothing, other than a factory reset helped to allow me to use Audible, which repeatedly kept kicking me out to the Home screen. I regret my purchase of this tablet, truly. I gave it 3 stars only due to it working alright more than half the time."
"The recent Alexa update (Nov 1) disabled or changed the functionality of this tablet. Alexa now thinks my tablet is a phone. Alerts appear as 20 second text bars with no audio. It will not respond to voice commands unless you unlock the device. Show mode is no longer compatible. Alarms are inaudible. I spent three fruitless afternoons with tech support who were unable to fix the problem.Finally someone told me that show mode was no longer compatible with the device. Can still order from Amazon, read Kindle. and surf the web but functionality is now very limited on Alexa."
"This tablet is perfect for light internet usage. But know that the app store is not the google play store, so you can't get most apps, like different browsers."
"A good product for the price, and would be good for kids, but I’m used to an iPad and this is kinda meh after having that. I can’t use all the apps I want to use, but it’s good for reading and Spotify and Candy Crush."
"Loved this tablet and Bought several for friends and family along with the wireless charging dock.  What I liked most was the show mode that displayed some Alexis skills, a clock etc.  it was great on the dock.  Worked perfectly from March until today.  Then an update Nov 10 and the show mode is completely gone.  No toggle in the settings, no show mode details in the settings, no screen saver options in the settings.  It's just gone.  Countless videos online show you how to access this feature which no longer exists.  Then if you go to the Alexa app support it shows this Fire HD 8 plus does not support this feature- which is strange because it was there and working for 8 months.  I'm so frustrated.  Here is how it was advertised and how it functioned for 8 months:This is from the product page for the tablet and the dock.""The Fire HD 8 Plus tablet switches to Show Mode when placed in the wireless charging_ dock.The Wireless Charging Dock automatically launches the Fire HD 8 Plus tablet into Show Mode when placed on the dock in landscape position. Show Mode provides a full-screen Alexa experience to view news, weather,_ camera feeds, make video calls, play music and enjoy other content. Several customers also confirm that the dock enables Show Mode on their Fire tablets. One review mentions the Echo app converting the tablet into an Echo Show when docked.""November 2024 software update and now there is no longer a show mode, Alexa barely functions- only off the dock intermittently, no screensaver. Oh but they added a stupid AI wallpaper feature. It's now paperweight."
"My brother bought this for me to replace a Fire 7"" tablet that was very reliable, but which I accidentally broke. The new HD8 Plus froze at random requiring resets.  Happened on the home screen, settings, browsers, etc.  Podcasts stopped playing at random.  Also, continual error message saying ""Whisperplay Core services starting""  After four days of waiting, the services were still starting.  At the request of Amazon service I did a manual backup and then factory restore.  The tablet told me the backup completed.  But no files went to the cloud or could be restored.  I lost my files.  Amazon turned off the WhisperPlay Services.  I continued having problems with freezes.  Amazon sent a replacement device.  I again did a manual backup of the original HD8 Plus.  Again, no files or settings were restored to the replacement tablet.  I called customer service and a woman who sounded like she was talking in a cavern told me that the backup only backs up settings.  That's not what the tablet says.  It didn't backup my wallpaper, sleep, display intensity, volume settings, browser tabs, text size etc.  I told the woman that the WhisperPlay services is again ""starting"" and she told me how to turn it off.  I asked what that would do, and she told me it would disable backups.  No kidding!  Sounds to me like until Amazon fixes Whisperplay Core Services NO backups will work.  I'm waiting to see if this unit freezes like the other.  Thus far, only twice in the first hour of use.  Not a good record..."
It is very disappointing I hate the ads on the lock screen it's kind of depressing and the app store doesn't have anything you can't even use TikTok on it I would have just gotten an iPad instead if I knew it would be like this. I feel like I wasted money even getting a case for it the only thing i feel like works with it is just reading books
"This was the perfect little tablet for me. I could read and listen to books. I got verbal reminders to take my meds or of things I had to do. Unfortunately, that changed with the latest update, it no longer does that because Amazon decided to take away Show Mode If you're thinking of buying this model, think twice. I spoke to an Amazon rep but she just said people were having problems with Show Mode, so they removed it. Duh, that's the main reason I bought originally. I still haven't heard anything about a fix for this problem."
"I got this to read graphic novels with my daughter, and this tablet does a fine job for that. It's easy to read and snappy to use. I've tried using it for other things (shopping on the app and watching videos) and this is where it falls short. The screen has terrible viewing angles. The moment you are off center you lose color and contrast, this is easily noticeable when the screen is primarily white, like when using the kindle app to read a novel. The speakers are both along on side, it would've been nice to have them placed at the ends of the tablet instead of along the ""top"". My hand easily blocks the speakers. The app store is weak. A lot of apps found on other stores are missing, like Bose. I know this is cheap, but I may be returning it."
"This tablet comes with 32GB, too small for my Amazon movies, Audible books and Kindle books. But it has the handsfree charger which i already own. So I bought a 256GB MicroSD card to extend the internal data. I inserted the SD card it said it formatted and was ready to use. So I started downloading my Audible and Kindle books thinking they were being downloaded to the SD card. That is not what happened it went to the system internal drive. I tried moving the data to the SD card still no luck.I called Amazon customer service and was told my purchased movies can not be sent to the SD card. He said I had to watch from my purchase list, too bad you need internet to do that. It defeats the purpose of taking the table to a non internet place. On their advertising for this tablet it clearly says you can use a microsd up to 1TB. Unfortunately that's not my experience with this tablet. Things do not download to the SD card, thus the deceiving advertising.Then I got cut off from the call when he told me about not moving my movies over to the SD card. He didn't even listen when I said the Audible and Kindle were also not moving over.I'm calling again in the morning and if there is no satisfaction then I'm returning this miserable piece of a tablet."
I’ve purchased this tablet a while ago and I can’t recommend buying any fire tablets. Amazon is as bad as Apple. They only want you to buy the stuff from them. So you can only buy or download and install apps that are in the Amazon ecosystem. Even though this tablet is based on android You cannot download all the android apps. You can only download what is in Amazon App Store. One of the main reasons that I purchased this tablet was to be able to play Ultimate Golf. Ultimate Golf is not available in the Amazon App Store now there are workarounds where you can actually install Google play store and download apps. Of course this does not work with Ultimate Golf. I am sure there are tons of other apps that are like this
"The amazon store is terrible.  Way too many missing apps.  With the tablet based on android I can side load the applications I need, I would rather get them from the Amazon store but it is very very deficient.The speed of  the tablet is ok, not great, but ok. I can watch videos, and shop on amazon fairly easily.  Screen is ok for what I need.  Not fantastic but not bad.  Battery life is decent.If Amazon moves on from Android, I will not be purchasing any future tablets, the android software base is what makes it usable."
"I wanted a tablet that I could read my e-books and access all my streaming apps on.I'm also Autistic, and I like when user interfaces are free of clutter and ads.I'm just not impressed with this Amazon Fire tablet.There's very little ability to customize the interface, and the apps are very limited. Plus, you get a bunch of ads for random shows and games that I couldn't find a way to hide.I have a Google Pixel phone and I was hoping it would be at least SOMEWHAT similar, so I wouldn't have to learn a whole new interface, but it's not.I ended up returning this tablet, and splurging on a Google Pixel Tablet, and there's just no comparison!If you already have a bunch of Amazon media/Alexa products, this might be a good choice for you, but otherwise, I'd save up and get a Google Pixel Tablet, instead."
"I absolutely hate this device.  My old KindleFire died so I purchased the newer version. This makes my fourth Kindle. So far I hate it.  I lost some apps I use regularly and will have to buy them again as they were part of my skin and healthcare regime, if I can even find them, bummer.  The front screen has to be scrolled to open but it has ads all over the screen, YUK.  My cell phone has to be scrolled but there are no ads on the screen.  If I rented the device I would say ok there are ads; but I bought the device and cannot seem to get rid of the ads, it is just some more flagrant corporate greed.  The older version seemed more user friendly, in general.  I had control of the ads flashing and scrolling -- it makes me physically ill to see the images scrolling up, then add the flashing and I am really sick and there is no way to get rid of the ads.  Calling Amazon customer service is a waste of time and a serious lesson in frustration that I am given every time I have to deal with them.....  I will never buy another Amazon device again.  I am disappointed with my purchase."
"No substitute for a full-powered tablet, this Kindle Fire is pretty slow and frustrating for web use. However, it does view movies fine."
"Disappointed in  the item. This the 3rd Kindle Fire i have had and the first with any major issues .instead of a  attempted repair i would like a replacement because i have had to use the  power many, many times trying get the device to open. It would  open and close over and  over. Repairing would be  like getting a refurbished device since this  one is just over a  month of use."
Bought this after researching putting the Google play store on it.  Got the play store installed fine but a few apps will not run on this tablet regardless.  Can't really deduct points for that since Google play is not officially supported but its still a minor annoyance.  Other than that it seems to work well if you can live with the heavy Amazon focus.  Deep Alexa integration and works well as an e-reader.  Battery life seems good so far.  Only had a week so far.Bigger complaint is that I paid extra to have no lock screen ads and Amazon is still pushing ads for their services and products to my notifications and lock screen.Got the maxed out model to hopefully ensure it lasts a few years longer than typical for this type of device.  Time will tell.
"I use my tablet fairly heavily and I have already noticed that the battery isn't lasting as long as it use to. The device doesn't give any status. However, My best guess is that it has lost somewhere between 15 and 20% of the max batter capacity.... In about 8 months. I can still use it without issue but I am having to make a deliberate effort to keep it charged."
"Replaced my old 8"" with a slower processor but this is no better.  Keeps freezing.  I used the 10"" instead."
"This is my 6th Kindle Fire. I am usually a big fan and have enjoyed using these as my main tablets. I can shop Amazon,go on the Internet, easily access my email, and read all my downloaded books. So nice to have this in this  8"" easily held and accessible sized tablet. HOWEVER, something went wrong with this 2022 iteration. It is so glitchy!  It stutters when I'm on the Internet. Pages freeze, websites won't come up. It's glitchy on the home screen as well- sometimes my apps just disappear, or I can't access them. I have to keep shutting it down and starting it up again. Then there are the Kindle books... If I touch a page wrong(which is constantly -somehow-and as I've mentioned this isn't my first Kindle rodeo)  it skips ahead a lot of chapters. In order to get back to where I was I tap the page to get the page number that I last read to go back. However, sometimes it saves my place when this happens but often it loses my place completely and I'm left searching around until I can find my spot- grrr! Even the Amazon shopping app is gitchy and freezes up a lot while shopping.Also, even though I got this Kindle Fire Plus with the highest memory ,my internet searches come to a standstill when I use a certain amount of memory online and I need to manually clear my Internet history in order to keep using the Internet.I would not recommend this Kindle Fire Plus and suggest waiting until Amazon(hopefully) fix all these problems.Last thing - my review is for the:Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus tablet, 8” HD Display, 64 GB, 30% faster processor, 3GB RAM, wireless charging, (2022 release), Gray  Ad Free - but has an incorrect attribution for some reason above the review"
"I have hundreds of kindles books and have enjoyed the text to speech for my long commute to work. Amazon 'improved' text to speech by making it highlight the words as the voice reads through the text. This is called ASSITIVE READING. Problem is that when the dispay times out or one darkens the screen to avoid unwanted touches and thus disruptions in the playback, the text to speech stops. Now if one is doing 70 on the free way, it is very dangerous to have to fool around with the tabliet to start text to speech again and again. This 'improvement' has made the text to speech feature useless to me, for it cannot not be turned off--if you want text to speech it only comes with ASSISTIVE READER working. I picked up some older Fire tablets on ebay and therefore an older OS that doesn't offer this ASSITIVE READING nonsense.  I have worked in software development for many years and at some point you must stop 'improving' the software. I called Amazon support many months ago and carefully explained this problem after spending much time talking to a number of entry level support people.  My concerns were ignored, hence this negative review. Is this a sinister plot to force customers to get the more expensive Audible versions? Unfortunately, almost all of my kinlde books have not been recorded by a live person, so I have to use text to speech if I want to listen as I drive."
"I bought this as an affordable replacement for an iPad mini. And while I think it works pretty smoothly, I might not have bought this had I realized a lot of the apps I use are not available in the Amazon Appstore. This is particularly frustrating as apps like Libby (for library books) is not available, and you can't access audiobooks from the library via the Kindle app. Additionally there are no branded apps for text messaging, banking, airlines, Airbnb, Starbucks, etc.  I'm beginning to see all the limitations as to why this is just a Kindle with video, social media, and email access, and not a fully functioning tablet.The battery life seems pretty good, but perhaps that is a function of having to switch to my phone or laptop for half the things I would normally do on my tablet.I'm also not in love with the Silk Browser. It just seems clumsy and can't handle many tabs.Finally, the advertising. I paid extra for no advertising, but my front page is clogged with  ""Sponsored Apps"" which are full of trashy games and I have no way of removing them."
"Got this to replace a fire 8 that i owned for 3 years.When i turn it on , it took forever to load and wake up.It feels slow and dated like the old one.Screensaver ads  very annoying.I`m returning it."
"I like it, however it keeps going out when I want to read outside."
"I should start by saying that I've been a loyal Amazon shopping customer for 20 years. I also pay for streaming services. I have had issues with a few delivered items over the years, but Amazon has always come through in a snap and made it all okay. This was the first tech item I've purchased within the ""Amazon family."" This Fire is nice, no question. I needed technical assistance because the location service on this Fire device is defaulted to a location 2000 miles away from me. Odd, certainly, but three different apps confirmed this through their incorrect function, and a dozen different attempts at resetting the location service, and the device, failed. So I called for help. And I was promptly disconnected without a word 5 times. Finally, I was able to get who I think was a real human using the website chat feature. I told the reps the problem, and what I'd already done to try to remedy things. They insisted I try again. *sigh* I faithfully followed them through the same steps of turning this off and turning that on and restarting, three more times. Nope, fails. I will say that during this process, it became clear-and quite scary-that the reps are not even as familiar with this device as I am, and I've only owned it for a day. The worst part is, while this device continues to show incorrect information in the apps that were the original selling points of this specific model for me, the reps tell me through chat that there is nothing wrong with the device[how would they know?], and expressed their opinion that it was somehow my incompetence as an end user, and that I just needed to ""spend more time learning how the device operates."" ...sure... I'd love to... but... the point of the whole encounter is that it does NOT operate correctly, so...???  I'm getting the impression that if a problem exists with the hardware, firmware, or software on an Amazon device, the reps are not trained to help, they are trained to deflect and cast blame. What a frustrating let-down."
"Got the Fire.  Only realized THEN that while ""wireless charging"" is the key benefit over the non-plus, it's NOT included.  You're not told on ordering.  And, so I'm back, getting ready to pay a healthy amount so I can easily charge the beast - if I'd known, I'd have bought the cheaper beast.  Obviously, 1st world problem, but, c'mon Amazon.  ya know I luff you, but sneaky low blow."
"Freezes & apps take longer to load, some barely work!I thought I was upgrading from a Kindle Fire HD 8, 10th generation (2020).Very disappointing, will be returning."
"I work at a TV station and we have a very rudimentary Fire app for our channel. The feed kept pausing. I have fast internet. It doesn't do that on my old phone's app nor online, so I can only assume it's the tablet.It also offers 30 days of free Audible, yet the button to accept says 3 months. Get it together Amazon!"
"Needed a cheap tablet to play music, surf the web/watch videos and other minimal tasks.If you're looking for a budget tablet, this is good enough. Details below:Opted to have my information preloaded on the tablet and setup ran smoothly with the exception of the intro video/unable to skip but can fast forward. Back to this below/factory reset was a mess.Next, I tried searching for some apps and noticed that the search recommendation/completion actually slows down for a noticeable second before loading all the related apps. It should run smoothly since this is Amazon’s environment and store and the latest tablet!Tried watching YouTube via the silk browser and inputting searches was a bit slow too. Video playback was initially smooth, but scroll searching was choppy at best.Then I tried loading a SD card that was previously used on an android phone, the files work across other android devices with no issues but this tablet indicates that the SD card was corrupted and requires reformatting. I can pull files off that card on a Mac, PC and other android devices, so no thanks!Finally, thinking that this brand new tablet needs a fresh start, I factory reset it via systems settings (yes, I removed my SD card). Then the whole non responsiveness started. When I tried inputting a new country and selected the American flag it would be none responsive for a few seconds, then jumps to the sign up screen. After entering my information and click next it would also be none responsive for a few seconds, this went on and on until I was finally set up… and then the final issue… it asked for some sort of information in Spanish!Anyway, long story short, this is not the right tablet for me. I would actually go a few dollars cheaper and get the cheaper non-plus model and most likely wait till Black Friday for additional discounts. 1.5 stars, this new tablet should run smoothly but it doesn’t."
"The new Assistive Reader, which replaced Text to Speech, has a major flaw which has yet to have been fixed. If you are listening to a book, you cannot close your cover or shut off the screen, which is a major battery saver. I use the narration while shopping, which helps me function in public. The ability to listen while doing other things is the whole reason I chose a tablet. I feel Amazon is trying to force me to go Audible, which I cannot afford. Many of the books I like don't even have Audible versions even if I could afford it. Because ive moved around without the protective cover, i already have a chip in the protective glass i put on my Kindle. Until they get this issue fixed, I'm having to use my husband's older generation. So why did I bother buying a new version?"
"Had it for 4-5 months picture beautiful sounds good but could be a little louder.  But yesterday I put on a movie and it was almost done charging and screen went black and it stopped working,so I don't know if it was rebuilt or brand new but it is broken doesn't work  using my old one I bought from Amazon 3 years ago it still works but got to much junk in it so slow as hell and it isn't a fire tablet,, but want to give Amazon a nother chance so ordered another fire tablet and if this one dies I will be screaming on the internet about the junk they are selling to us the people who depend on Amazon for a lot of things.. As and still waiting for the parts to finish putting together my treadmill 5 messages to the seller still no parts to finish putting it together 7 months ago I got it and been waiting for parts the sure cashed the check fast enough but pasts no dice 🎲🎲"
I love the Fire HD 8 Plus the picture is clear and the speed is much faster than my old one.  The problem is even when the volume is turned on high the volume is too low you can hardly listen to a video.  I spoke with a tech and she had me do a factory reset and that fixed it volume but it didn’t last.  The next day it had the same problem.  I exchanged it for a new one and now my new one has the same problem.  I went to the APP store and downloaded a volume booster and it instantly fixed it.  The drawback is you have a 30 day trial and then you have to pay for it.  I quickly uninstalled it.  Amazon you could fix it by providing a volume booster software for this problem.  So instead I ordered from Amazon a new Bluetooth speaker so I can hear the videos.Amazon you could easily fix this problem so please do so.
"Screen locks up occasionally and have to leave the Kindle off for a  awhile to unlock it.  Also adds games (three to four at a time) that I don't want and didn't request. Otherwise, I love it like all my Kindles."
"This tablet has got to be the most confusing piece of crap I have ever used.  I wanted a simple kindle that worked like my old one.  I can't find the library for books, click here. click there and still can't find it.  I still might send this thing  back if I can or give it away!!! Try downloading an app and it won't open.  I've done everything it says to do.  Not happy!!!"
"Coming from a Galaxy S2 tablet which is old and failing, this tablet is a suitable inexpensive substitute, especially if you use the Amazon universe. The screen is no match for an OLED, but I cannot complain considering the low price. The interface is a bit clunky IMO, but overall it works fine.  I am not a fan of the mandatory opening ads that greet me and am still deciding whether to pay the $ to remove them.  This tablet is a very good value and a good addition to my travel gear.UPDATE Dec. 2023:Had I known the limitations I would NOT have bought this.  A huge problem is that the tablet will only read micro SD cards with FAT32 formatting, which is antiquated and prevents you from inserting and playing existing files on a micro SD card, especially one larger than 32GB.  Finding this out just took me 2 hours of frustration and searching google. So if you want to insert a card which has your pics or videos on it, it will mostly not work.  The tablet says ""card corrupt"" and wants you to format (wipe out) the card before it will let you use it.  This is beyond belief. I hoped to take this tablet on a trip and view/show pics I took on my camera and GoPro but that will not work, as far as I can tell."
"I bought the Fire HD 8 plus tablet with accompanying charge dock specifically for the show mode feature which allows me to use it as an echo show or tablet and was immediately in love with the versatility of the device. This is my third fire tablet so I'm familiar with how they operate. Things were great until on Oct. 29th 2024 an automatic update completely removed the show mode feature from the device. I spent about an hour in chat with customer service with three different people each telling me to tap the show mode button to turn it on. I couldn't seem to make them understand there was no longer a show mode button to tap. Asking Alexa to switch to show mode resulted in her saying she could not help with that. It's my first experience with buying a perfectly good product and having the company I bought it from turn it into a piece of garbage after I bought it. To make it worse , there is really no use for the expensive docking station if the tablet doesn't have show mode."
"I returned this tablet after noticing its very unsatisfactory image display. Not only is the image resolution poor (only 189 PPI) but, also, the image lacks sufficient contrast, and there is a yellowish color cast (no clean whites) along with a somewhat muting of all colors, resulting in rather fuzzy, hazy, yellowish tinted images with weak overall color saturation. By comparison, the FIRE HD 10 (2022 generation) delivers far better image quality - images that are sharp and crisp, with a clean, accurate color balance and pleasing color saturation. So, even if one's preference is the smaller, lighter and less expensive 8 inch screen tablet, I would definitely go with this somewhat larger, heavier and more expensive 10 inch screen Fire tablet instead. (Currently, Amazon does not offer any 8 inch screen Fire tablets with acceptable image display quality.) Since most of the enjoyment in using tablets is derived from viewing image products (such as both personal and media source videos, photos and other images), image quality should be one's top priority when choosing which tablet to purchase  - unless you use a tablet simply for reading books."
"I purchased this in April 2023. It's okay. Not everything I wanted, but I knew that going in. One feature I did want is the ability to use an SD card to expand storage. And that worked for a while, but in the last few weeks, it's started being a problem. Every time I power up the tablet, I get a message that the SD card isn't functioning and I have to reinitialize it--which means wiping out what's on the card--to get it to function. Every. Single. Time.I've found that if I remove the card and then put it back, it works fine. Until the next time I use the tablet and the message pops up again. Annoying as (fill in the blank). Otherwise, it does most of what I'd like it to do--hence the 3 stars. Will I buy another? Absolutely not."
"I wanted to like this little machine. My 2019 tablet is getting logy and a bit brain-dead. This was highly reviewed, and so I tried it. Alas, after a day, I knew it wasn't what I needed. The hardware was excellent for the price. The software wasn't. Thank you, Amazon, for a good return policy. It's going back today.Efficiency: It's very cost efficient. You get more for your dollar than anything else there (HD 8+)Effectiveness: It doesn't do everything I wanted it for. Mainly due to Amazon's software environment. It just can't match Google/Android's infrastructure. There are probably a lot of people who it would serve well. Just not me.Efficacy: In the end, it doesn't meet my needs. So, farewell, little computer."
"Another OS update has rendered 'recurring' alarms impossible! Another scam to keep you buying new products. Amazon, you are deplorable!This is my second Kindle Fire HD 8. A feature that I liked, Show Mode, has been removed from the operating system. I could use the tablet for reading and social media by day, and while it was charging on my nightstand it was my bedside clock. Now I don’t have clock on my nightstand and there’s no room for one given the size of the charging dock. I still want it by my bed because it is my alarm. I can’t find anywhere on the Amazon site to express my dissatisfaction so I will put it in a negative review of the product. It’s clear Amazon doesn’t care to get feedback on their products or services or they would make it much easier to do so."
"The kindle fire eight has problems, like the cover of the books does not always pop up, it harder to find your library, not only that but I seem to mysteriously lose books in my library, and it's slow as he!! To pull up a book! I recommend buying a seven at least I know they work."
Gets laggy and hiccupy when running 2 large apps at once.
"I own an apple iPad mini 6th gen , 2 onn tablet 7 inches 2024, a samsung galaxy A+ 11 inch and this disaster of a product fire 8 barley HD .. first of all if you like being limited on the apps you can download and use or the games then this is for you, I have not used this device since I bought it , there is nothing about this device to actually love it's your basic of the basic. I wouldn't recommend I would go with an onn tablet or samsung at least you have more options with apps and games .... all in all complete garbage I will be selling to someone who wants this garbage lol 😆"
"I am a long-time user of the Kindle Fire and the HD 8 plus 2022 is the thirteenth Fire I have owned.  I have the HD 8 plus 2020 and was able to make a direct comparison with the newer unit.  My impression is that the newer unit is not worth the money over the previous generation.  The main changes are a faster processor and slightly increased battery life, none of which are apparent in every-day use.I returned my first 2022 unit since it would not sleep/wake with the cover as promised.  I tried two different covers with the same result.  My 2020 unit does sleep/wake with the cover, so online support thought it was a hardware fault and replaced the 2022 unit.  The replacement still does not sleep/wake even with the cover designed specifically for the 2022 unit.In case it is important to you, it is easy to install Google Play services on the 2020 unit but as of late October 2022, developers have been unable to install Google Play on the 2022 unit, which of course limits you to consuming Amazon content.This is a fine basic tablet to consume Amazon content, which is of course what it is designed for.  Knowing that the hardware changes have little significance over the previous unit, that sleep/wake does not work, and you cannot install Play services would all steer me away from buying the 2022 unit if I had the previous generation."
"I'm having too many problems with this Kindle 1. I can't close the case for the book to keep reading. I know this started with the new update. All I have read on my Kindles, is Kindle unlimited, and I could close the case and the books would keep reading. Now you're telling me that I have purchased books from Audible to be able to use that feature, close the case and the book keeps reading. I never read Audible on my kindle. I listen to audible book on my phone, because I can listen to them through my hearing aid. 2. When I'm listening to a book and suddenly, I'm listing to something else. 3. My screen turns black; no, I didn't change the settings. 3. Sometimes it stops reading and then I must start it back. 4. I see you took the library off the top of the screen. I guess it started with the new update. I'm not going to just buy audibles just to close the case. I can't believe you made all these changes with these new updates. I can't believe you did this. I will never purchase another Kindle.  I know I'm not the only person that has complain about this BS. Mamie Durrett.  I've purchased 6 or 7 of your Kindles and, if this doesn't change this will be the last one, I buy."
I replaced my hd7 only bc its software was out-dated for Libby.I risked going up a sz and regret it.Batt life is great compared to old one.
see above reply.....Internet failures
"This is my 3rd Kindle and I really like them.  I used an iPad for a year and it just wasn't the same.  This is smaller, light weight, and easy to set up.  I really love it except for the battery life is rubbish.  I remember my last kindle could go weeks without a charge.  Not this one....and I do the airplane mode blah blah. I don't like working harder than my devices."
"Our family has used Kindle Fires for years, including for our kids.  Now that we have a 13 year old we would like to give her more freedom than a Kid+ account allows.  But you can't select her Amazon Teen Profile on her new Kindle Fire.  The only available option is to put the device on an adult profile and then enable Parental Controls which is extremely cumbersome.  Please make the Amazon Teen Profiles available for use on Kindle Fires (and Echo Dots)!"
"Disappointed that this really isn't an Android experience at week. Might as well be on an iOS or Windows tablet. I knew it wouldn't work with Google play, but didn't realize how annoying that would be for things like viewing photos from my phone. Insulting to have Amazon try to sell me apps I already own on Android. For consuming Amazon content it is OK, but ironically worse than my Android phone. Finally, this keyboard is a mess. Really too bad how horrible the swipe system is. Anything other than consuming Amazon content is clearly to be discouraged on this thing."
"I am disappointed in the way that the new software has not arranged my library in a logical manner. When my library downloaded, the books and authors were not sent down in a logical manner, that is at least grouped ab author and the authors arranged alphabetically. They are a jumbled mess and it is difficult to locate books without using the search function and then it will not open with any degree of regularity. I think the hardware is fine, it is the soft heads that write the software that are the problem. It should be a simple matter for the programmers to arrange the authors and their books in a logical manner like authors alphabeically and the books  in order of date of publication. At least my earlier Fire HD 8 the authors were alphabetically listed and their books were all under the correct author, The only benefit for this new version of the Fire HD8 is the ability to use a 1 Terabyte micro memory card."
