"The microwave does not function correctly.  Use the “add 30 seconds’ button and it works fine (for only adding 1.5 minutes) but that is about all that does. And yes, the microwave is cleaned regularly, and especially if there are any spills.Try the Auto Cook popcorn, auto cook potatoes, auto defrost, etc., the features do not work.  I followed the directions, and I still had to manually add time at the end to get my potatoes, popcorn, etc. to cook all the way through.  I guess Toshiba does not know what “auto cook” means.The defrost function will only work for about 4 minutes then trips the breakers, whether by using defrost by weight or defrost by time.  I tried to boil water for 7 minutes, at 4 to 5 minutes, it trips the breaker.  I turn the breaker back on and then the microwave only works for 1.5 minutes then trips the switch again.  Same thing when trying to make rice, trying to cook a pot pie, trying to do anything!  I HATE THIS MICROWAVE!!!!The original breaker was only a couple of years old, a 20 AMP breaker in a complete new Panel.  It was checked out and functioning properly.  We replaced the breaker with a newly purchased breaker, 20 AMP GFCIs, and it behaves the same.  TRIP, TRIP, TRIP.  The microwave keeps tripping it as if the microwave is not built to take the heat, the steam, not built to do anything but “sort of” look pretty !!!Brand new out of the box, when the microwave was used, it smelled like burning rubber.  2.5 months later and it STILL has times where it smells like burning rubber.  The part that goes under the glass plate wobbles, even after inspection to be sure nothing was on the wheels.  What a feature.  OH and don’t get me started on the sound when it is finished doing something.  Pressing the “STOP” button does nothing, so you have to listen to the beeper for all the programmed beeps.  MORE INSANITYThe spaces around the microwave exceed the required amounts.  We use only microwave safe dishes, never metal, etc.  I’ve used microwave ovens for 40 years and have NEVER had as many issues as I am having with this BRAND NEW oven.  I tried to get support and they closed my trouble ticket after 2 days of not providing additional material; I was out of town.  I will never purchase TOSHIBA Again.  Don't believe the other reviews.  You will be sorry."
"The microwave works fine for heating, cooking. My complaint is the control panel. The buttons I use most are on the bottom and small. The buttons I will probably never use are on the top and take up half the space. I have to press cook time before I enter the seconds I want to cook and I have to look around the panel every time to find it. When cooking at a lower than full power level it doesn't show on the readout so I don't know for sure if I pressed the tiny buttons correctly. My old microwave did show the power level. For me larger buttons and fewer things I will never use would be much better. I also don't like it starting automatically when I press a button without pressing the tiny start button. Sometimes I want to get it setup while cooking other things and want to press start and go right back to the stove. But it's tedious to get it setup on this microwave. Instead of just pressing the numbers and start I have to find the tiny cook time button with a flashlight and then set the seconds. Otherwise it just starts when you push a button. I would buy a different microwave just for a simpler control panel if I can find one without all the fancy useless buttons. From what I see most microwaves do the same as this one so I might be out of luck?Update after having it for a year. It works fine but can't stand the hard to use control panel and just bought a new 6 in 1 that has simple controls. Selling this one on craigslist for $20."
"I  don't think Amazon offers a better looking, option packed, or quieter microwave for under $200.I received this unit 30SEP2024. Placed it in service 08OCT2024. I have been the only operator of this appliance. It wet the bed on 15NOV2024. Symptoms; muffled thumping and erratic turn table turntable rotation. Unobsereved point of failure - broken gear tooth in the turntable motor's reduction gears. (and internal part of the microwave)Presently, I  am researching a placement motor.FYI, if you choose to purchase this or similar, to will need a mat to be placed between the counter top the hard plastic feet of the microwave or the entire oven will slide off the hard smooth counter's surface when you attempt open the door.Update."
"Purchased TOSHIBA EM131A5C-SS Countertop Microwave Oven in Jan. 2023. Less than 2 years later, the turntable has stopped working. But that's not the only problem we had within the 22 mos. we owned it. Around 1 year of ownership, the timer began to malfunction and the microwave would run double the time chosen (i.e. I set it to run 1 minute, but it would run 2 minutes). The problem occurred sporadically for about 1 month. Then the timer worked correctly again. Go figure. At roughly month 18, the turntable started to run whenever we opened the door. This problem existed for about a month before the turntable stopped working completely. I'm still congratulating myself for buying the extended coverage. Received a 100% refund within minutes."
"Never have post office deliver a heavy Microwave for anyone to have to go to post office , making 2 trips as it is on the truck still, then carry it , load it into your car , when your  female recipient is not healthy to be lifting  such  a box which is placed in larger box. Where is Amazon Prime delivery that I pay for monthly? Would have been very helpful to have it delivered  at her doorstep  Amazon  was a complete failure  on this order."
"I liked the idea of inverter technology. We have an AC unit with it that saves money and lowers power usage as necessary. Unfortunately this unit was lowering power to what I believe is the odor eliminating setting. We set it for 06:10 at full power to boil 4 cups of water for tea and at timeout the water measured 134° F. Just after opening the door the unit gave a series of bangs for about 10 seconds and went quiet but the clock was still working so we continued. We tried other settings including odor eliminating and put 1 cup of water in for the cycle. The temp raised 45° F telling me the magneto was working but the control board was not. After calls to Toshiba and Amazon tech support we got the same answer. Return it. Of course we didn't want to get the same one so we have to wait 3-5 days for refund to show up while we bought the one without inverter which has now worked three times at different settings. Now the funny? part when rotating the unit slightly to unplug it a flash and pop  came from the right rear where my hand was, I jumped. At least we are now assured the circuit breaker for the microwave outlet works. Worst part is the embarrassment of having to ask our younger neighbors for lifting help through this ordeal. Thankfully we have good neighbors. Also the control panel is not very easy to use!Update Aug. 10. The non inverter is quiet and it cooks in the same time as our dead 1200W one did. However time is the magic word. I have to think the 1st year high school student that designed the software for this was strictly a 1s & 0s person. Why on earth would anyone decide that after pressing the cook function you need to enter a 4 digit number is beyond belief unless you are cooking a turkey. Unless the processor and other chips are froms  the 1960s 3 digits and start should be sufficient. Easy to enter 4 you say. Not on this control panel, it's poorly made and any extra unneeded touch will wear it out at a faster rate. I'm not sure but it seems to be heat activated or a flexible touch screen. In any case this seniors is one it doesn't like warm, cold, wet or dry. It seems to hesitate to be sure it's what you want. My wife has the same problem. From other reviews I see many comments regarding how to use the control panel is a learning experience. WHY? It's a microwave. It should be a no brainer!"
"We purchased this microwave about 4 months ago, based on many great reviews.  Sadly, that was not our experience.  The unit started doing strange things within a few days.  Either the control panel would go blank when you attempted to input a command, or it would look like it was cooking, but did not heat what was in it.  At first, we thought it was user error, which is why I didn't contact Toshiba earlier.  But more thing started to go wrong.  The clock was never stayed set.  Either it started counting down like a timer, or it would just reset to zero.  After resetting the clock a few times a day, I gave up.  The turntable starting squeaking like it was 10 years old and the whole unit made strange noises.  The malfunctions just kept getting worse; it became quite apparent we weren't the problem.  I'm no Elon Musk, but I can read a user manual.  I finally contacted Toshiba customer service.  The bright spot in this story is that they were very helpful.  I had to send them a fair amount of documentation and answer quite a few questions, but in the end, they agreed to refund me.  (The check has not arrived yet, but I'm taking it in good faith that it is on its way.). As the title of my review states - this was our first Toshiba, and it will be the last. I replaced it today with a Sharp and sent it to electronics recycling."
"We purchased this on 9/01/24 and after minimal use by a household of two adults, as of 12/02/24 it is producing a burning chemical smell when used. It technically works, but we’re afraid to use it because it seems to be a possible fire hazard now.  Up until then, I considered it a good purchase. It’s outside of the return window, but I’ll reach out to the seller and provide an update. As of now, this was wasted money.Update: the Seller is the ""Toshiba Store"" and has no contact information, so I have reached out to Toshiba directly. No response, yet."
"The microwave lasted a little over two years. If you open the door, it turns on—with or without time on the clock. So, you can judge if a two-year-plus lifespan is a good run.  I don't think so."
"I looked at over 70 something microwaves and came back to this one for One reason, The Door Has A HANDLE instead of a push button.  My SO has arthritis in his hands and fingers, pushing down the door button HURTS, I hate that anything should cause him more pain than he already has.I wish more microwave ovens had Door Handles instead of push buttons!!  Wake Up Corporate America, Arthritis is a thing!!The reviews on this were not much different than other microwaves, choosing one comes down to a crapshoot.  Well, maybe you won't want this one after all.  Sometimes it overheats your food, sometimes it doesn't heat your food at all, and you need to give it another go around.  DON'T BUY THIS.I only wish it had acted up in the first weeks so I might have returned it.  My SO says, ""well it works good enough for now"".  I know this, I don't think it will be safe in our old Airstream when we become homeless, and we would not be able to afford to fix that should it blow out all the circuits.  So now I'll have to buy another for that. UGH12/16/23Our ""TOSHIBA EM131A5C-BS Microwave"" has a new and exciting trick, every once in a while a button you hit continues the beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... in a never ending sort of way until you unplug it."
Styrofoam was broken which is ok but microwave was dented.
"I saw a YT video on the Technology Connections channel about the popcorn button and why bags of popcorn say not to use it. It's because for the most part the popcorn button is just a pre-set countdown timer and the time to cook actually varies between bag sizes, brands, and type of popcorn. He later explains that some new microwaves now come with a humidity sensor to determine when food is done cooking leftovers and making popcorn by sensing steam levels inside the microwave.I thought that was really cool and started looking at new microwaves to replace my 15+ year old one. There isn't anything wrong with my old one but it doesn't really get used for much except making popcorn and occasionally reheating leftovers. It also asks how big the bag is to adjust the cooking time and will occasionally burn a little bit if I'm not there to stop it about 10 seconds before it ends.After a bit of research (which turns out was not ENOUGH research) I settled on this Toshiba unit. I mean 52,000+ reviews at 4.4 stars as of the time of this review can't wrong right? Got it all set up and it looks gorgeous. Pop in a bag of popcorn and hit the popcorn button and it asks me how big the bag is... WTF? I bought one with the sensor in it so I wouldn't have to do this and so I wouldn't have burnt popcorn anymore...Turns out it does have the sensor but it does not use that sensor for making popcorn. Only heating/reheating food. So now I have a new microwave that looks great but doesn't do the one thing I bought it for.... fantastic."
"The microwave still looks almost new, turns on and sounds normal, but has suddenly stopped heating after only 2.5 years! Nothing in the manual describes an easy fix, and we didn’t buy a repair plan because it had over 20k great reviews! Very disappointed! Don’t know what to replace this with because reviews seem to be written, most commonly, within the first month of purchase. I would never have guessed that a Toshiba would have such a short lifespan!"
I spent more than a half hour with manufacturer.  Got a case #112183184.  After asking crazy questions that had nothing to do with the power level button and over half hour 45 minutes later to be informed I could use as is or return it I am within the return date.  Well I knew that already however I didn't want to buy a new one and charge it while this one is being sent back.  They should  have issued a call tag picked this up and refunded me so I didn't have to charge another $200.00. Not too happy with customer service that's what we did when customers got incorrect or faulty items.
"When it came it was extremely heavy and large. I bought it on Prime Day think it was running on a deal. It was not true. It's running all day every day for $170. I'm very upset and felt cheated. You should put a badge that says Prime, correction you should be able to put a Prime badge on product and say it's on sale when it is not. What a Walmart thing to do."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Great for when it worked! But, recently saw that it kept on microwaving some food I was heating up past the timer. Opened the door to stop it and remove the food. Closed the door and it kept on going. 3 stars for every year it worked I guess. Hope everyone else has a better and longer experience!"
"As a microwave, it performs well enough but there is a serious design flaw. The picture shows the position of the ""power level"" and ""start"" buttons. If you fat-finger both of these at once (which is very easy to do) it will reset the electronics and even popped a breaker once. It's not a deal breaker, I'm not gonna replace it but it is very annoying."
"The first one we got was crushed either in storage or shipping. The replacement is fine. It works well. I especially like the sensor cooking. The plastic cover over the button/screen area isn’t perfect, a little wrinkling, but I don’t see it being a major problem. There is a slight bug however. Some times, seemingly at random, the display will go off and the clock is reset. No power outages, no tripped breakers, nothing like that. Just a random bug of some sort. It cooks food fast, the sensor system is spot on.  I do wish that the start and stop buttons were reversed from their positions though. They are the opposite of most microwaves, including the one we used for years. Oh, and I hate one-touch timers. You know, you press a “3” and it immediately starts cooking for 3 minutes.  Are we all really that lazy?  When I want 3 minutes, I expect to press 3, 0,0, then ‘start’.  But this “feature” seems to be on most microwaves nowadays. If you can catch this on sale, like we did, you can be sure you are getting a good microwave.  There may be better ones, but at this price?  Probably not.UPDATE:  I am returning this. Right after posting this, the next day, it malfunctioned. My wife pressed “1” for the quick one minute cooking. It let out a continuous loud beep and wouldn’t stop. When it worked, it worked great. But too buggy. Perhaps I was unlucky and got a bad one, but I paid for a working microwave."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Even with the reviews stating that the cooling fan shroud usually arrived blocking the fan, I chose to buy it. It arrived that way and in less than 10 minutes I had it bent back out of the way and working. It didn't take long to learn its little quirks and programming, and I grew to like it overall. Mostly...The reviews also said that the lighting of the keypad was subpar, and for almost 2 years now I've struggled with that. I mean, come on, guys! Gray keys on a gray background with minimal lighting? Even for me with eyes that are more sensitive to excess brightness, it was a struggle just to see them!But no more!October 2021 I purchased this, and July 2023 it died with Error E-6. A search revealed a fault on the board that may be fixable, or may not. Either way, I just don't want to dive in a second time only to find that an item I bought to replace one that lasted over 10 years hasn't lasted even 2, and may not last 3 or 4.I've decided that I won't buy another Toshiba appliance. This makes 2 strikes in 2 years, and I don't want to become the victim of a third.Sure, I could chance it, but I think I will find some friend or relative of a friend who will relish the chance of fixing it for the bargain price of zero dollars.Sometimes ya just gotta know when to throw in the towel and walk away."
"This was a great microwave while it still worked. I especially liked the preset sensor reheat functions. Today is 1 year and 6 months after date of purchase, and it began turning ON when you opened the door, without pressing any buttons. As in, lights on, plate spinning, transformer running. Could cause serious burns! Called Toshiba customer service and they said it was likely a faulty unit, and they recommended replacing it or having it serviced by a technician, but there was nothing I could do at home to fix it. The 1 year limited warranty had expired, but the credit card I purchased it with offered another year of protection, so I’ll be replacing it with another of the same model. The fault is easy enough to identify and immediately stop use if and when it does happen again, but I purchased the additional 4 years of warranty this time."
"purchased in May 2021.  Noticed that food was not heating evenly this year and it just stopped working now.  Anytime it is turned on within 15 seconds it trips the breaker.  For 3 1/2 years of minimal to moderate use, I expected more.  The average life span of a microwave should be 7-8 years."
After 2 years door was malfunctioning and paint was peelinghad to throw away
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Realistically, I have only bought maybe 2 microwaves in my 50 + years.  All purchased have been in the medium price range and each one lasted over 10 years plus.  Generally, microwave technology is great and you really don’t have many problems.  Until I bought this Toshiba.  When it got delivered, it did not look like the packaging was damaged and due to going through a remodel, it sat for 2 weeks before we plugged it in.  We have a small place and didn’t expect any problems therefore plugged it in and threw away the box.The microwave worked about 5 times before it started screeching a loud very concerning noise (Watch video).  We troubleshot via the instructions which mentioned the turning tray may have came off track so I realigned the tray. It worked 3 more times whereby the “death howl” continued.  Again, tried different troubleshooting ideas from manufacturer without success.  Called Toshiba and explained same to Customer Service who took down information but said she would open a case. I explained that the microwave was purchased from Amazon and had a 30 day window which was approaching in 5 days.  She said return it with Amazon.  However, the return requires the microwave to be repackaged and sent via the use of a UPS store only.  So now I have to get the UPS store to properly box the microwave (I paid for it) and to ship back, at my expense.  The moral of the story is Do Not Buy this microwave!  Find another brand and buy from a big box store locally for an easy return if it turns out the quality was poor or was dropped and damaged.  Let my story serve as an example for a headache you do not need.  I was most disappointed that upon calling customer service, Toshiba failed to stand by their broken product and was robotic in determining how to make it right.  Go with a different brand."
I unbox the microwave oven put it where it belongs and the next morning I'm adjusting the position of the actual whole body and they are scraping noises and then I'm wondering what the hell's going on and I looked underneath and one of the rubber feet it's supposed to be standing on it's on the floor on my feet and there's another one missing in the back in the same side of right side
"I like the features of this microwave.  Pushing the start button adds 30 seconds. The ""1, 2, or 3"" buttons add that many minutes, accordingly.HOWEVER.  We bought this less than 3 years ago and the INVERTER has gone out suddenly with company on the way tomorrow.  The inverter can be replaced, but I am not in the know-how to do so, so will not keep this.  The part number is 17170000024509 and is not available at Toshiba till February 2025, but maybe can be found elsewhere (also according to the redp).  Just FYI, this microwave according to Toshiba support needs 3 inches of flow space around it, so don't put stuff beside or on top of it if it's in a small cupboard space like ours was.  So ... partially my fault.  I actually am going to purchase this again and see if it happens again.  Will let you know in three years."
"It fit perfectly in our kitchen cart. However,  the instructions are several pages long and somewhat confusing.  For example, there are 3 popcorn settings. The dark metal finish is very attractive and modern without being intrusive. The power cord is a bit short so definitely have an appliance extension cord on hand."
"We bought this microwave at the start of the pandemic. It recently started acting strange. The first thing it started doing about 2-3 weeks ago is when we’d open the microwave door, it would spin/rotate while the door was open. I unplugged it and left it unplugged for about five minutes to see if it would reset itself but once I plugged it back in it continued to do it. Then this morning I woke up to make a cup of hot tea and it would not heat. It counts down, but it doesn’t make it’s usually heating sound and the timer only counts down with no heating element to it. Purchasing a new microwave this weekend."
"well, i was under the impression this was for not-so-big spaces but to me it looks just like a normal sized microwave. had to dismantle part of my desk so that i could put it there (my room is my every room). just tried sensor frozen pizza setting and that was horrible (didn't really have high hopes in the first place but was hoping to be surprised). i will adjust my rating as time goes by if it starts to impress me but i have a feeling i would have been better off getting a truly compact microwave even if it was only 900W...live and learn...at least you hope you do."
"I use the microwave regularly for meal preparation but I find that one needs to be very careful. Whereas I used to use a 1 minute setting for a poached egg using a GE microwave, in the Toshiba set for 1 minute the egg exploded. Now I use two sequential 30 second settings. With vegetables one needs to be careful not to let them dry out at settings that used to work for the GE microwave. The wattage output of the Toshiba is about the same as for the GE but the behavior is quite different."
"Good unit overall, seems well built.  But soon after starting to use it, microwave power sometimes cycles on and off like defrosting.  Usually works properly.  When made sure it was set at 100% power and still had problem, called Toshiba customer service for help.  Very poor help, hard to understand agent.  Was told must take video of it not working and did not seem to understand I have no way of knowing when it is going to fail, tried to get to fail when on phone with agent and worked properly.  Overall good product but very poor customer service."
"To bake, you need to enter everything twice or include the unknown preheat time in the first pass.  The same applies to air fry.  You can extend the time by 30 seconds by pushing the button but otherwise have no control.About one minute per twist of the knob."
"We bought the microwave, air fryer combo thing to replace an old microwave and an old air fryer to save countertop space.  The Toshiba functions okay.  It wasn't as good at its task as either of the appliances it replace.  But, hey, it saved 3 square feet of countertop space so the trade-off was worth it.However, the rotary control knob felt flaky when it was new.  It felt simultaneously fragile and rattle-y.  12 months into service, the microwave would sometimes turn on if I lightly tap the side of the unit.  Other times, I have to press the control knob with strong conviction before it would comply with what I need it to do.What finally broke that dam was that the microwave would turn on mysteriously at random time.  You know, like Poltergeist.  I would hear it running at 2 AM in the morning and sure it'd be happily burning electrons and contributing to global warming.  We thought about performing an exorcism.  We also thought about renting it out to occult investigators.  But at the end, it has its destiny in the electronics recycling bin."
"This microwave started acting up after a little over 3 years of owning it.  To be fair, it has gotten daily use as there are 9 of us in our household.  When we opened the door to take the food out it would start running again.  So we unplugged it for a day and tried again.  It seemed to solve the problem.  A few days later it stopped working all together until we knocked it on top, then started working again.  This microwave is clearly on its way out.  The manufacture only guarantees a year warranty, so we are out of luck.  I would NOT recommend buying this microwave if you want one that lasts."
"Feels flimsy. If I didn’t already throw my old one out, I probably would’ve returned it. My old one was 1250 watts, this is 1150, I didn’t think there would be a big difference, but there is."
Excessively / Unnecessarily loud beep tone when pressing keypad as well as the beeps at end of cycle. This becomes noticeable after the first few times using the microwave - and then very annoying after a day or two of occasional use. The only option is to shut off the sound completely. But when using microwave with sound completely off you need to pay attention to the screen to make sure you're depressing the keypad enough. This would be a great microwave if the beeps were quieter without having to completely silence them.
"The product is attractive and fits (mostly) in the same space as the unit being replaced.  Just to be clear, my old unit did everything I wanted it to do until it died.  So, I was looking for something simple and easy to use, like my previous unit, which had a  ""beverage"" button to warm up your coffee, hot chocolate, milk, tea or whatever hot drink you liked.  It also had a ""reheat"" button which thoroughly warmed up a plate of leftovers.  These are the two functions I need in a microwave.This new unit was apparantly designed for people who do not own or use a traditional stove, nor prepare food from scratch.  So it is engineered to cook frozen pizza (ugh!) or frozen veggies or frozen entrees or bake potatoes or rice! (how can that happen?).  This means simple ordinary functions like 'heat up my coffee"" required 5 (FIVE) keystrokes!  That immediately puts my elderly mother in the position of being unable to heat up her own coffee.And the manual says to reheat a plate of food, I need to inform the unit how much the food weighs!  Are you kidding me?  That's actually on a preprogrammed button, so it only takes 3 keystrokes plus entering the weight.I'm keeping the unit only because of the hassle of returning it.  It does do a fine job of heating my coffee once I input the FIVE keystrokes.I recommend this unit if you want to cook a five course, mostly frozen food, meal.  And you have no problem with programming it.  If you want simple and easy, look for something else."
"The microwave has generally pleasant aesthetics; however, given that it's not yet even a year old, I would not expect the turntable motor to be going bad already, but it is. The grinding noise is awful. A new motor is about $50. This may be a fluke situation, but I wanted to share."
"Updated 20 Dec 2023:Well, here I am 90 days out from the purchase and about 6 weeks ago, it appears the venting fan no longer works, all steam remains and accumulates and since was not paying attention initially - accumulated significant'y under the rotating tray! (Wife asked,""what's up with all this smoke/steam?!, water!).So, the 30 day window to return is gone - yet may yet ""Chat"" just to fully document to them.So, I try the Warranty service and wade through TWO seperate sights to then be told there's a ""special"" division that handles THESE units. Hmmm, okay... Instead of doing a ""warm handoff"" considering all the work I just did - I do, as they could, FORWARD the entire mail to the Email they provide.I then get back an email of ""questions"" (some bot response with an individuals name with a big thank you and let us know....!). So, ALL was in the email, but answer again and then take a photo of the serial number tag (no one told me where it was btw!!).I notice the email added ""numbers"", so ""support@.... turned into ""support+nnnnnnnnn@..."" and I had forgotten to attach the serial number phone pic so resend all and to specifically ""support@..."" AND the other too with the yet ANOTHER incident number.Next day (time difference with CHINA I am used to - my mornings are the best time to engage them it seems) - I get an email (yesterday) - ""we have one more question for you"" embedded in a link - RATE OUR SUPPORT SERVICE for this... ""like"", ""don't like"" or similar words. My response was - rater what? You have not done anything. So another day goes by and NO RESPONSE.So, I now have a Microwave just barely 90 days old, barely used since is 700 watts and used for only specific things, and? Wow - I can't afford to buy stuff like this here if there's NO WAY TO RETURN, REPLACE, REPAIR, REFUND IT!!. Wow.I said to them too - with how this is going - I look forward to reviewing how this goes - so, here this is to date.I will contact Amazon likely - since they may intercede, etc., or not, but letting them know directly and specifically and with ALL the messages in their system - they do review this stuff (I had one prior bad experience I got resolved by involving them directly within it all). So, can't fault Amazon in this, but if this is how this goes - and can't rely on what's sold here, then?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I purchase for the Brand since have had many items that just seem to do well for me.This is a disappointment functionally for two reasons -1) IT SLIDES all over the counter. Why would ANY OEM build something that will live on a formica counter top with SLICK, unstable supports? I just don't get it.2) Tiny thin, writing on Black, not back lighted - Labeling. Until this product I never needed to turn the big light on in the Kitchen AND put on my glasses. Now I do.The noise put me off a bit when first started up - startled me.All of my other Microwaves, ever, had a fan noise and more of a higher pitch, light hum to it. This one is to me, 3x's as loud, with a low, very textured buzz (not a hum a buzz, buzzing - heavy running sound).It's not the least expensive, not the most costly and since I find price is not always, or even usually an indicator of ""good/not-good"" - I went with brand and reviews.I did read the, or see the reviews that state the same as I say now - NOW I understand - but just didn't ""get it"" until today - wow - what to do.Otherwise, the controls are somewhat intuitive.The times to heat are about the same or the same as on my 1200 watt unit or the prior 900 watt unit. I felt that there was no need to use that much wattage to heat water, or warm food, etc.I was anticipating the inside dimensions being ""tight"", but remain functional for what I experience with other units. So, what I mean, as e.g., is like - I'd love to heat 3 slices of Pizza same time one place as with the room or power with the 1200 watt unit. However, I often wind up doing two or even one slice in order to over all just heat the slice versus getting very ""spotty"" hot/cold not evenly warmed. Slight overlaps of slices never works and actually have burned things when got jammed/not rotate. So, the smaller footprint would seems as a non-issue, or better this way. HOWEVER, as the Manual says, allow for THREE INCHES all around this unit when using, placing it. So, it may not ""functionally"" be a small a footprint as you imagine if don't have that for air/heat which you need to take *seriously!So, anyway, it's a microwave. The door looks safe, will remain safe I hope, not sag, loosen up, etc., ""leak"" as is the warning concerning the - Door. However again, the Non-back lit Control Labels, small font/type and thin/light/hard to see AND that now I have to figure a way to keep it from SLIDING ALL OVER my counter top - SO DANGEROUS even for ""Adults"" - WOW. I looked in the box for some anti-slide thing not installed - none. I mean - where - is a Microwave EVER INSTALLED that is on a NON-SMOOTH, easy to clean, sanitize surface - ""sliddy""? Where - Black+Decker?In my opinion, that miss the mark for what I would otherwise, as first use rate would rate otherwise, 4 or even 5 stars. Then the Buzzing when running thing - is likely something that could be addressed. As with many things I see today now usually has to do with lowering the cost of manufacturing. I deal with mechanical audio and ""hear"" what they've done versus could do to quiet it down substantially.So, I hope that assists someone. Additionally, all in can say if Sliding is an issue, Small Control Labels, and Noise is an issue - take those Reviews to heart to consider - those are issues and wish I did. Yes, I could return it and may - we'll see. Who's to say what the others may be like - so... how much time to spend on this. Returns, especially with something this size are not easy for me to ""get to a shipper"" - so, consider all that is my advice and experience."
"Bought for a small office. Its just very slow to cook at 700 watts. Everyone assumes a microwave if quick, this thing is very slow for most lunch food reheating, don't even consider cooking from frozen unless you want to wait forever and have people complaining at you. We are an office of 25 right now, we have been an office of 50, its terrible for that."
You get what you pay for.  The turn table is always coming off. A bag of pop corn is too big to turn on turn table.  Nice auto features.  Next time zi will go larger.  The capacity of my old Sharp had a larger for the same size unit.
"We have a small counter space for a microwave so it's hard to find a decent one. I researched a lot and thought this one was ""it."" Well, it will work OK, but my main problem is the beeping is ANNOYING and you CANNOT stop it by opening the door! And it beeps WAY too many times! The other thing I don't love (although not a deal breaker) is that it doesn't beep to remind you something was left in the microwave. We temporarily were using a cheap Walmart one (was bought for college use). I actually liked that one's features BETTER! This one looks nicer with the stainless steal trim. I'm trying to adjust to it, but you can't even cover the noise since it appears to come from inside the microwave. It does slide easily as others stated. We have a small block at the back on the button side which usually keeps it in place. But it is worse than the cheapy one for sliding (will be getting rubber grips/pads to help). Decent price, decent microwave. Does basics we need it for (I do like the 30 second start button and quick start minute ones). Just not loving beeping (the worse offense!), lack of reminder, and sliding."
"This microwave has an automatic door lock, for safety purposes, that also poses a great challenge for a senior citizen.  We can’t figure out how to prevent the door from automatically locking. Otherwise, it might be a good choice for someone."
"This microwave heats food ok. I like it because it is small and light weight to fit on my shelf in the kitchen. I got rid of the countertop microwave I had before after remodeling my kitchen..The problem I have with this microwave is the rotating glass plate constantly comes off the grooves and I have to keep putting it back on track. The other issue is the condensation buildup is ridiculous. Water sits inside the bottom of the microwave and leaks onto the front face and door. The condensation is now causing severe rust on the face and inside the microwave. Now I have to look for another small push button microwave. If you purchase, you have to wipe and dry condensation immediately or it will chip paint on inside microwave and rust."
I don't like how this locks and thought it would unlock on it's own once done cooking but it does not. Not that big of a deal but have to hit unlock button before I can open
Works fine but very strange average plate doesn't fit in easily.I have to turn a little to get it in.Never had this issue with any others I have owned.
"I wanted a smaller microwave to sit on my counter and wouldn't take up too much space. This one does that. But I've gone from a 1200 watt to a 700 watt machine, and if I'd thought it would have made that much difference, I wouldn't have made the purchase. I really only warm or reheat food items. Even reheating takes significantly more time. I won't make a purchase like this again.An aside, it has a popcorn button. It didn't even inflate the popcorn bag. I had to add 2 minutes after using the popcorn button."
"Arrived damaged, not too much damage to justify the work to return, so not happy."
This is a nice size for small spots and moderate use.  Probably not a good choice for high usage.  Some of the touch surface buttons are not working well after less than a year.  Does a really good job on everything but if you micro a lot may not be the best choice.
"This is a good small microwave that is easy to use. However, the 700 power is requiring some adjustment from me since I previously had a 1200 Microwave. That having been noted, this microwave requires a lot of minutes to get things hot but it works well with the previously noted caveat."
"When I cook my oatmeal for breakfast the interior is dripping wet. Or when I put a bag of peas in to steam, the interior was dripping wet. That is not safe. I cannot use my 10"" high Pampered Chef microwave cooker because it touches the ceiling of the microwave. I wish I had not bought this. I bought it because of the Black & Decker name and reputation. The beeping is annoying. One beep is sufficient."
"There is one concern, a few of the numbers look like they have a bubble underneath them. My wife said once you push those a few times they probably will stay down like the others."
"I bought a used one that said it looked like new. However, the actual product that was delivered had a few small defects. Buyers should keep this in mind when purchasing used goods."
"This microwave was light weight which was great when I had to take it from the box and put it on the shelf, but not so great when you push the button to open and entire microwave shifts. But the bigger  issue is the beep/horrible sound when food is ready. If you don't stop it before time ends it makes these ridiculous long horrible beeps over and over even after you open and close door several times and attempt to hit cancel. Until it is done you also can't put something else in it because no buttons work. I have overheated things because I put too much time on so I have time to stop it before it ends.It seems to cook fine. But honestly regretting that I didn't return it and pick something else."
"I bought mine 2/2023 and started to have electrical problem 8/2024 (electric sparks everytime i use it) and there is a burnt on the inside where the electric panel cover is. I had plenty of microwaves in the past and they all lasted longer than 1.5 years, at least for how much it costs."
Good little microwave for our efficiency but it did not last.
"I bought a used/open box item so I didn't expect it to be perfect.  the description of the unit says no scratches and that it comes in the original box.  What I received has a good sized dent in the left rear section and did not come in it's original packaging.  It does work, however, and looks good from the front, so I think I will keep the unit.  I didn't find anything similarly priced at the local big box stores, and I don't want to wait another three days for a replacement.  just a warning to others who purchase this."
When you push the door button it doesn’t open unless you pull the door at the same time.
It does what we bought it for.
This feels more flimsy than the previous model - which itself only lasted 3 years.  It is the only nuker that I have found to exactly fit the microwave shelf over my regular oven.  BUT  I am having trouble registering it with B&D.  They say my model number doesn't exist!!  Is Amazon selling fake Black&Decker?  Or is B&D registration process broken?  Hope I can get someone to help.
Door opener has rough bumps on it. I cut my finger. So now I have to press on side to open. Very inconvenient!
It seems every time I slide anything into the microwave it dislodges the turntable and it's a pain to fix.  It's enough of a issue that I have thought about replacing it.  Otherwise microwave does what is supposed to.  I have learned to increase the power or time over what I use for the microwaves because it's pretty weak but it clearly says what the wattage is.
"This microwave isn't great.  It looks nice and is small if that's what you need, but past that not so great.  The buttons do not register with a touch, they need a hard press (both my wife and I so it's not just me).  Since the microwave is so light, it then slides on our shelf.  Even opening and closing the door makes the microwave move around.  It is also woefully underpowered.  I know it says 900 watts, but there is no was.  Our old microwave heated my neti pot water in 22 seconds, this one takes 35 seconds.  We are returning it even though we got it on sale for just $65."
"The microwave is great. Customer service for Amazon and Black & Decker…not so much. Bought as a gift.  It was missing a part. When I contacted Amazon Product Support they told me to return and get a replacement. I said it was a tiny piece.  Not worth returning it. Then I contacted Black and Decker only to be pushed around and then they found the part # and told me I have to call another place to “order” it and pay for it. I asked why do I have to pay for it when it was missing!!  Needless to say it was a sucky ordeal and I ordered the replacement from, where else? AMAZON 😫🤦🏼‍♀️ it was cheaper than what Black & Decker wanted."

"Update: a couple of days after submitting this review, I researched multiple microwave brands so I could replace it. Apparently excess moisture and eventual rust is a common problem with most 700 watt microwave brands. There were also a lot of negative comments about the exterior of the microwave being hot to the touch (which is why I replaced my old microwave with this Black and Decker one), smoking, and various other problems. So now I find myself ordering another one of these - better the devil you know, right? This time around I'll try to remember to use covers for what I'm heating whenever possible, and I'll make sure I immediately dry off the condensation after each use. Fingers crossed that rebuying this model isn't a colossal mistake.I bought this microwave in 2021 to put in a small cubbyhole in my kitchen, and my choices were very limited due to the size restrictions. I mistakenly thought Black and Decker would be a good quality, long-lasting microwave. Shortly after the 2 year extended warranty I bought on this product expired, I noticed a dark spot along the back seam where the top joins the back panel. I tried several different things to remove the spot before I realized the area was rough and that apparently some of the finish came off. Today I noticed a little area that looked darker at the bottom of that panel. It wasn't as dark as the one at the top, but it also wouldn't clean off. Then I noticed a few dark spots at the top of the bottom edge piece behind the door. I tried cleaning it with a damp paper towel and an approximately 2"" x 1/2"" chunk of the finish peeled completely off. Most microwaves I've owned have lasted more than 7 years before they had to be replaced, and none had the actual finish peel off."
past Kitchen Aid microwave died so we quickly decided on this one It works fine but less features from the last one some of them I miss It’s fine
"The power button doesn't work. So basically I have to heat everything at full power.Otherwise it seems to be a good mcrowave,"
"thought I would be getting a good unit, with the ""Black and Decker"" name.However, I am truly disappointed. While the unit looks great, looks are deceiving. The door sticks, constantly and it is noisy, more so the normal with a microwave. I am not pleased and will not recommend this model."
The push button for the door is giving me problems and I've only had it for a month.
This microwave lasted a month shy of 4 years.  It was used maybe 4 or 5 times a week for usually 5 min. or less.  Not sure if this good for a product made by today’s standards.  I have a microwave at work that was made in 1997 and it is still used 3-4 times a day with no issues.
Pushing the button to open the door moves the microwave every time. I wish it had a handle.
"This microwave functions well enough,  but after a couple of years the paint inside began to bubble and chip off."
"First off, the microwave was much smaller than I anticipated even though I measured my older microwave. The defrost takes forever, and the instructions are difficult to follow. What should take seconds to defrost takes at least a minute or two. The glass plate does not fit into The plastic piece in order for it to spin. Overall, this has been the worst microwave I’ve ever  owned."
Not great to be honest. Wish I would’ve listened to other reviews. The steam and moisture that builds up is insane. Not even 6 months in and it makes a really weird noise when heating up. DO NOT RECOMMEND
"I am reviewing the 700W model so perhaps the larger models do not have these issues, but these are the problems I have encountered:- Requires too much pressure to operate the keypad and to open the door. Since the unit is very light weight, it slides all over whenever you apply enough pressure to operate it unless you use your other hand to stabilize it. Might have to invest in a heat resistant/non-slip pad to go under the unit- argh!- I use my microwave timer as a general kitchen timer - a LOT. This one can be confusing to set. You have to set the 2 digit minutes, then the 2 digit seconds, and you need to enter leading zeroes. For example, if you want 5 minutes, when entering the minutes you have to enter 05. If you forget and just enter 5 you will get a time of 50 minutes. Hopefully I will get used to this, but for now I too often forget and wind up timing 50 minutes. Sigh.- Heats quite slowly, although this does not shock me - maybe that's what to expect from only 700 watts.  But it is disappointing. Heating a cup of water for tea took 1 1/2 minutes in my old 1100 watt microwave. Takes 2 min (at minimum) in this one. For me this is a trade-off - wanted to recoup counter space in a very small kitchen so opted for small size rather than performance. I do like the size and overall appearance. Plus, the interior size is fine for my needs, hence the 2 stars rather than one."
"I had high hopes for this since black and decker is a usually good brand, but this microwave heats sooo unevenly. Like if I microwave a tortilla (just as example lol) for like 20 seconds,  one bite would still be as cold as when it went in and the next would burn my mouth. So annoying!!"
"I've owned Black and Decker Products before so I hoped thos would be a good find. I was wrong. This is the loudest microwave I have ever owned. It sounds like its going to explode. The turn table struggled and jerks its way around. Popcorn is nearly all kernels at 2:15 and burned at 2:30 with half the bag still unpopped.  Trying to reheat leftovers, faster in my airfryer. Its getting so loud we've stopped using it for fear its going to burst into flames."
"All in all, if I had not had a better microwave for over ten years, I might think this unit was better. I didn't realize 900 watts was so poor. I would have bought a higher wattage. When you push the button to open it, the unit slips backwards (you have to brace it), the button is not easy to push, and is noisy. I don't care for this unit, but for 900 watts, it can be all right until I can buy another more suitable microwave. The price was ok, so maybe I should not complain. It has nice features and it's easy to use in that respect. Because of the low wattage, it takes a lot longer to heat things up, which I am getting used to. Also, being lightweight, it was easy to lift. This unit would be good for someone who has never had a better unit, or who cannot afford something nicer. I consider this a good unit for possibly a dorm room, or for something that will not be permanent."
"After using a few times it ran very hot. The glass turn table was hot to the touch with nothing on it. If you used unit for  five minutes twice, back to back it would shutdown, turning off all power. After 10 minutes or so it would come back on. The clock time would need to be reset. The same issue again. I did like the unit, good size and features. It also matches my stove. I returned for a replacement to Amazon in under 30 days.Fortunately I noticed it was overheating before it damaged my brand new counter top in a completely  redone kitchen. Replacing the counter would be thousands of dollars. Didn't see anything in manual about possible overheating and any concern about counter you put it on. My learned lesson is always test out  a microwave very closely before putting it on the counter"
I seem to get defective item if I don't buy from the store. This microwave makes a loud grinding sound from the spin plate while cooking.It still works so I use it. But next time I will use the store.
"I purchased this unit August 2021 and it has already crapped out.  It randomly started making a spark-like, crackling noise when I went to heat something up one day.  I unplugged it and tried again a few days later and it worked fine until it did it again about 2 weeks later but this time it was louder and more concerning.  It sounded like the unit would either explode or at the least catch fire.  Since I have children in my home, I decided to err on the side of caution, so I unplugged it and refuse to use it again.  It was great while it lasted but I would not recommend it."
"Still getting used to. Much smaller than my last one.  Still not sure if I like it.  Having trouble with several features. Not able to change the PL, (power  level). Don’t like the door. Door lock is tight; I need 2 hands to open it,  B/C i’st small enough to slide all over the counter.Maybe good enough for Recreational Vechical- no space for it to move around!Lp"
Would be a nice product but the button that  opens the door is in a small space. It’s hard to fit your finger/ thumb in the slot in order to push it and also hard to push. Really annoying.
Turntable does not stay put.
This is a basic microwave. It produces excessive moisture. Despite wiping it dry after each use it has rusted along all the inside seams and corners. If you attempt to use the preset  potato or popcorn setting- which are high heat- it will overheat the white interior coating and it forms bubbles...which will peel off.I filed a claim with Black and Decker/ Midea within the 1 year warrantly period. It was denied because neither problem was deemed a manufacturing defect. Will never purchase another product from any of the Midea companies again! Neither should anyone.
"Missing rubber foot on bottom.  The screw threads are there for it to screw onto, but no rubber bumper foot. Had to buy my own rubber bumper so screw wouldn't scratch countertop. And, if the rubber foot was there, that would be 3 total.  Why not 4, one in each corner? And the bumpers are so small they are ineffective.  Microwave slides back when you push on keypad. Have to push on keypad too hard to enter anything.  And, the picture does not match the product.  The picture depicts white letters on a black background  Nope, letters are off white, harder to see than white letters would be to see  Must be some artsy fartsy moron working at Black and Decker.  Human factors engineer would make it white letters on black background or black letters on white background. Probably not sending it back unless stops cooking. I'll also be fixing my old GE microwave that had no problem for 20 years."
"The microwave came dented and the only option is to return it.  There is no doubt the dent was there when it was put in the box as there is no dent or tear in the box. I am unable to do this myself as an elderly woman. I am a Prime Member and thought there might possibly be another option, an adjustment maybe, but no. I am disappointed. (This purchase is also the second one in a couple of weeks that was defective when it was sold and shipped to me.) The microwave it replaces is dead. I had to impose on a neighbor to help with the switchover. This one is supposedly higher wattage, but you can't prove it by me."
"I bought this microwave recently, and 5 months later it doesn't work anymore.  Very disappointing!"
"The support ring which the glass plate sits on to rotate is so thin & flimsy, it broke within 4 months!Had to glue it twice  the unit itself is small enough to place a dinner plate, so no heavy anything was placed on it! It’s just simply..a bad purchase."
This is my replacement as the first time around it was not handled with care and came with a huge dent. The second time it was shipped fine but after a couple uses I realize it doesn't heat evenly. It has a hot center point. Burns food easily if heated for long.
This product arrived with dents on the outside box.
Only 2 years old. Not used extensively. Just stopped working. Got it to work again for a few months. Was using it yesterday and it caught fire.
The glass tray will easily move away from the center pivot which causes the food to sit in one spot rather than rotating for even heating/cooking.
"We got this after having an LG that was a bit larger. We were looking forward to getting a smaller microwave to leave us more counter space. Also the LG buttons were REALLY hard to read in low light, but other than that, no complaints. The grass is always greener.We looked at several smaller models and picked this one after reading reviews and ratings. I won't buy it again.It might work in a dorm for heating hot pockets or something like that, but not as a household piece for regular use.Our issues with it:• It doesn't heat consistently. Sometimes it'll make things super got. Sometimes the same size thing on the same setting will have cold spots. It's just inconsistent...which is annoying AF when you heat the same thing repeatedly. The old microwave I automatically set the same way each time. This one's a crap shoot.• You can't heat and have a timer going at the same time. Sounds stupid, but the LG was great on this score. We could use the kitchen timer for one thing and heat something else at the same time, no problem. With this, it's one or the other.• Buttons - still not easier to read (though easier than the LG. My visions decent - but it's like the people who make microwaves have never looked at ADA regulations. I'd certainly never get this for anyone without good vision.• The little plastic thing under the glass plate is too small a diameter. This should normally be as close to the size of the base of the plate as possible. This one is really small, so you need to make sure you center whatever you put in it or it can get knocked out of whack easily.I'm going back to LG next time - even if I have to rewrite the damn numbers with a paint pen.ADDENDUM - It's now just under two years later. The button that opens and closes the door is starting to crap out already. I don't know what I was expecting for under $90, but I sure as hell won't buy this thing again."
The microwave was a Christmas present. It was delivered on December 18th. Now 4 months later in April it malfunction. It was returned to Amazon for a credit.
"This microwave leaves a puddle of water that takes multiple many paper towels to sop up, in the bottom under the turntable. Rust started to firm within weeks. Paint started chipping up within months. And now they won't help me with another microwave because I waited too long to complain. The company has told me it's a 'health hazard' at this point, but refuses to do anything towards the fact that I wasted a hundred dollars buying an absolute piece of junk. It's a shame I desperately needed the use of a microwave and didn't have the time to let them know in the beginning that it would puddle up and started to rust, it wasn't until a huge piece of paint lifted up that I was more than furious enough to contact them. So even though this problem started immediately upon using the microwave and happened within months... I was a little over the 'warranty time' and they just don't care that I can't afford to buy another one. This huge company can't help a single mother that doesn't want to continue to use their 'health hazard' - their words with a hundred dollars towards a new purchase ... Disgusting. Do NOT BUY Black&Decker. They don't care about the customers or if they sell garbage that can be detrimental to your health."
The microwave is clean & looks great but it didn’t come with a plate on the inside
It worked fine at first.  It slowly lost power & I slowly had to add cooking time.  Now after adding one minute to a 5 minute dinner I still have frozen food in the middle.  This is the second microwave from Amazon that has done this.  The other one lasted a little longer & I thought this brand might work out - nope!
"Nice microwave but after a few uses the back started melting, had to send it back"
"Design flaw is that the microwave makes a loud 5-beep noise when its cycle is finished, regardless of whether or not you open the door.  No stopping this noise to let your family sleep.Otherwise it's great."
Won’t pop a reg bag of popcorn
"I bought this microwave in July 2022. After 2 years of use, the paint started bubbling, and now is chipping and peeling on the inside of the microwave. I get it, it's been being used for 2 years now. However 2 years of use or not, no normal use of a microwave should cause the interior paint to bubble, chip, or peel. This becomes a contamination issue, putting your food at risk. No abnormal cleaning chemicals were used on it, or anything that would have caused this. I have to purchase a new microwave now, even though this one technically still works, because this is not safe to use."
"I like the size of this microwave, however was disappointed with mechanism in opening the door. Also the turntable often needs to be checked, easily goes off track, noisy when operating."
I will not purchase this again.
It's okay for how much we use it. It's small and dosen't take up room on the counter. The only issue I have is not all the amount of time buttons work.
"The turntable base ring was broken.  Not surprising since it was on the bottom and the microwave was sitting on top of it.  But we had an old one we could use, and so we tried the microwave.  It runs more loudly than any microwave I’ve had.  And when we closed the door on it, it set off our alarm system because it was so loud that it sounded like a break-in.  I’m disappointed.  We have lots of Black and Decker products that are great.  We thought this one would be as well.  We’re returning it."
I got it on sale and the rattling exterior and broken roller wheel remind me of it on the daily. Features are standard so if not for the flaws it would be a 3.
"It’s a nice little unit but the keyboard takes some getting used to. It works just fine after you figure out the quirks. However, there is one big problem. The turn table will not stay in place. Almost every time I use the microwave I find myself having to stop the microwave, remove the food, and fiddling around to get the turntable carriage back in place and then to get the glass. Then I must carefully set the glass tray set in place without knocking the turntable out of its track. You have to start over again. That usually takes enough tries to make me a little frustrated."
"I needed a smaller microwave to fit into a limited space in my kitchen. This one was fairly priced and works as well as any other microwave in my opinion. I like the simple button layout on the front of it and the various options for quick selection for various food items.What I don't like is the smell of burning plastic when I use it. At first I thought I had accidentally left part of the plastic covering on the inside of the microwave or something but I don't think I did as I've looked all over the inside several times just to be sure. I'm hoping the smell will go away after several more uses. But I have to say, I've never had a microwave that smelled like that during operation. Had I known this, I don't think I would have bought it. I don't think it is defective, but they should do something to address the smell."
"My last one was a lower wattage by a couple hundred,  so I wanted something more powerful although the old one serviced me well...  Having limited space was an issue,  so there isn't as many to choose from when that happens. So I went with this one. Good looking,  stainless and black and the smaller size with ample controls is a definite plus. I've owned this now for a couple months and would recommend this. By the way... its very,  very quiet. I've read in other reviews some have taken issue with the loudness of their machines. So,  if quiet operation,  smallness of size,  ample controls are what you're looking for,  I think you've found your new machine..."
This product broke down after just two years. The turntable and microwave runs when the door is open. We have to replace it as the warrantee is no longer good.
"I have never had so many issues with a microwave!  It's 2024; it can't be that hard!  First, the Glass Tray kept sliding, despite being properly aligned on the Support Wheel Ring---which also kept dislodging!Next, I have NEVER seen this before (I'm 65) but after a month of use, there are LARGE WATER DROPLETS that continuously hang from underneath the Glass Tray!Most annoyingly, you can't just press any button to start cooking.  If you want to cook something for JUST A MERE 7 MINUTES, you have to go through a FOUR-STEP PROCESS!?!?!?!Oh, I guess MORE annoying is with my old microwave, I could heat up a frozen pot pie in 4-5 minutes.  With THIS machine, it comes out HALF FROZEN!!!  I pushed it to 6 minutes---and there is STILL a small section of ice on the bottom!!  Hence I had to look up the manual on how to get it to heat for 7 minutes.Maybe you will have better luck..."
Bought this for my 97 yr old mother who has somewhat impaired vision.  The turntable is small and a bit wobbly on the spindle.  That paired with the vision issues meant that the turntable kept coming off the spindle and she couldn't get it back on properly.
"Not sure if other reviews noted this, but the interior of this microwave is too small to hold a regular size dinner plate. I did not realize that when I purchased it, but will likely keep it regardless since my space is small and it is otherwise a good fit. Have only used it a few times and it seems to work well."
"My old 100 watt  microwave reheated yesterdays coffee in one minute this one takes 90 seconds. The door opening button isnt solid and the doors sounds “tinny” when you shut it. It is ok for what I use it for, baked potatoes,veggies and reheating coffee."
"I don’t understand the number of positive reviews. Here is my honest reflection after having had this microwave for 3 months. I talk about the following below: (1) low power, (2) lingering smell, and (3) useless turntable.(1) Low Power. When I say low, I mean it can’t heat one cup of room temperature water in a mug. We had a much better built in microwave in our previous house and needed to buy a new one since our new house didn’t have one built in. We got this one for the small foot print. Unfortunately, it takes us more than twice the amount of time to heat foods and beverages as compared to our last one.(2) Lingering Smell. If you heat anything in there with any type of scent, be prepared to either leave the door open (and therefor the light on) overnight for the smell to dissipate or live with eating or drinking the scent of whatever was in there prior. If you heat fish, forget about using it for another day. I’ve used it to heat salmon one night and opened it up to heat a cold cup of coffee mid morning the next day only to be met by the most foul scent that can only come from old fish odor. Btw, i clean my microwave daily and it’s spotless so it’s not from food splatters.(3) the turntable is a piece of glass that sits on top of a loose plastic ring with three wheel and the whole thing slides ALL OVER THE PLACE. There are three grooves at the bottom of the glass turntable that is supposed to catch the center turning mechanism in the microwave. However, that will only happen if you precariously balance it in such a way that doesn’t slide around on the wheeled ring thing AND is perfectly situated in mismatched grooves. A hair off and the whole thing slides around again.I wish I had the time and energy to send this back when I still have the chance. Do yourself a favor and pass."
The good: it’s compactThe bad: it’s light weight so it moves around. It also doesn’t do a good job of heating things up. It takes like 3.5 minutes to heat up liquids.
"I make it a point to not direct rage, disappointment, or petty insults at kitchen appliances. It's not productive, nor is it a positive for my mental health and wellbeing. Disclaimers aside, this microwave pisses me off more than college football referees. Oh, sure, it heats stuff...I have no beef with that, but it does one single thing that sets me off. It's. the. turntable. Why does the glass turntable constantly jump off track and refuse to turn? It seems that every time I choose to use this annoying little countertop failure, I have to reseat the turntable. I've only had it for a year, but I'm ready to donate it to some microwaveless group...perhaps a devil worshipping clan, thus avoiding any guilt feelings."
"Bought this because of the weight, I am FM not strong with some health problems. Wished I got a different one that was almost the same weight. Size is what I expected. Easy to use. Big problem is that the glass turntable keeps popping off. Even weight on plate, plate not heavy, not interfering with it turning. Still pops off. Works with small item that is in the middle of turntable. Went to defrost chicken cutlets and had to do one at a time.  Those reasons why I put one star on easy to use and 3 stars of overall rating."
"Beautiful appliance,  but when I took the foam and plastic packaging off, there was deep scratches on the top surface.  Not something you'd expect from a brand new product.I need it so I won't send it back, but I am disappointed."
The product looks much bigger in pictures.  I received a large box but when removing the microwave it was much smaller than I expected or wanted.
"Was looking to replace a Toshiba microwave, I tried this as it fit the specs & that model did not agree with my apartment (shorted out). However this thing is really loud. Microwaves hum, it's normal, but this one was on a whole new level. Returned. I ended up with a Chefman that is somewhat better."
It cooks a little slow but it's a small microwave.  It buzzes and rattles alot when cooking.
"This microwave would probably work well if you are worried about tripping a breaker but for normal, household use, buy a different model. 700W is not very powerful. For instance, It took over 8 min to heat up a package of vegetables that steam in a bag (it normally takes 4 min in the larger ones)That being said, it is compact and easy to use. It is clearly marked 700W. If you’re retired (like me) and have extra time to wait for something to heat up, this microwave may be ok for you. If you’re like my wife/kids and impatient, habitually late or in a hurry, you’ll need something with a lot more power (like 1200W)."
Heating times are rounded to the minute
Bought for my son’s small kitchen space when my husband had to go live with him and cook for him after he lost the use of his right arm & hand and left arm in an accident and had so many other additional injuries that time to spend on cooking would be in short supply. It was the right size to fit in that small counter space but they had difficulty getting things to cook to hot enough to eat in a reasonable amount of time. So it didn’t really help as much as we were hoping. Now that my son only needs the bone grafts to heal in his arm abd then physical therapy and is otherwise functioning mostly on his own except driving he’s still not finding the microwave very practical.
The microwave works great but the turntable doesn't like to stay in place
"Arrived dented, like so many others have complained about here. The packaging on this is not suitable for Amazon's/USPS's package handling. Probably the weakest foam and the thinnest cardboard.However, it fit perfectly into the hole I needed it to in my cupboards, and the dent is not visible while it's in the hole, so I guess its... fine.It's features are exactly what I expect out of a microwave. Nothing fancy. Push button to open is a little stiff but fine. It's just fine."
"it glitches out on me and I have to unplug it for a couple minutes to ""reset"""
Well built but takes too much pressure to open.
"We purchased a Black & Decker microwave EM720CB7. It very soon started sparking, emitting smoke and frying the interior lining. We called B&D not so much to complain but to warn them. Instead, the company took a defensive posture stating my wife did not clean it, or for not placing the rotating plate while heating or cooking with metal in the oven. None are true. We punched in ‘Black and Decker microwave fires, sparks, smoking  and interior damage.’ The number of complaints and photos were numerous, similar and plentiful. For B&D to be more concerned with blaming  the consumer was amazing. For what?  Avoiding a class action? Keeping our money? I am talking no response other than to blame my wife. If B&D corporate management saw this.and other complaints with photos, heads would surely roll. I no longer trust the black & Decker name and assure you our microwave was replaced at our cost and. certainly not under the Black&Decker name- Jay Albert’s -Kingston, NH"
"The unit will heat up food. However, if you reduce the power on any level, it really doesn’t do a whole lot of anything. For instance, if you cook something on regular power for two minutes, it’ll be blazing hot. However, if you reduce it to half heat over four minutes, it’ll still be cold. I’ve tried to see if experiment even reducing it to maybe seven or eight power level. So I’m saying with my unit is that if you leave it all in all the time you’re gonna be happy. Anything else and you’ll be sadly disappointed  And take five times as long to get the same result. If you don’t go full power all the time."
Insanely low power. Took 9 minutes to defrost a small bowl of berries. FML.
"The BLACK+DECKER EM720CB7 Digital Microwave Oven is a great option for small spaces. It's compact and fits easily on a countertop or in a cabinet. The digital display is easy to read and use, and the design is sleek and modern.However, I have noticed that the heating time is quite slow. It takes longer than expected to heat up even simple items like soup or leftovers. While this may not be a huge issue for some, it can be frustrating if you're in a hurry or have limited time. Overall, if you're looking for a microwave that is small and convenient, this is a good option. But if you prioritize speed and efficiency, you may want to consider other models."
"This is an inexpensive and compact microwave that is super-easy to use, and it does exactly what you want a microwave for - it heats food and drinks efficiently. The cooking time and quality is on par with any smaller microwave, no complaints there.For the price, it's not bad, but there is one caveat - it retains FAR too much moisture, the vent fans just don't work, so it fills with moisture and must be wiped and cleaned after every use.It shouldn't accumulate such a high level of moisture with every use. Just cooking a potato will cover the entire interior with water. As long as it's wiped, it should be good, but I have a feeling the moisture builds up in areas that are inaccessible to cleaning.I had a similar model that was obviously made by the same company, although it was an Amazon-branded product, and it corroded and rusted out after a few years. I did not attentively wipe that one after every use. This one may last longer because I am more meticulous about it. The instructions say you should make sure you have proper clearance on the sides so it can vent properly, but it doesn't even if it has lots of room.When reviewing a product, it's unfair not to take the price into consideration. This one is inexpensive, so I take that into account. It is also very easy to use and it cooks well. That said, all they have to do to make this unit far more reliable and long-lasting is to fix the venting system."
"The driver or someone dropped it or it was smashed because the panel on the door was busted and a dent is visible on the back of it. Fortunately, for me  it does work and I can manage with a loose door  panel"
I don't think I would recommend this micro-wave. I like the unit as it fits my limited shelf space exactly. Controls are good quality and intuitive. Stainless steel front trim is easy to clean. (This is not a stainless-steel unit. Only the front trim is SS.) Unit will have to be secured as pulling the door open almost pulls it off the shelf. Difficult to view dark-colored interior even with light on. Although other varieties of this model have brighter interiors. I have a can of white microwave spray paint and plan on painting the interior.Rotating plate does not sit down on drive post good enough and is easily dislodged when adding or taking out cooking containers. Always center your coffee or beverages for stability.
"700 watt, 0.7 cuft. Farberware microwave oven.This unit replaced an Insignia of the same size/dimensions. I could have replaced that unit with the exact same microwave oven (and $20 less expensive) but didn't because it only lasted 2 1/2 years when the power cord caught fire behind the metal back plate.So...... I decided on this Farberware unit thinking it would live up to it's reputation/name recognition. How wrong I was:1) After 4-5 uses, a few minutes each, the oven started making intermittent crunchy noises. Not inspiring confidence!2) Whoever designed this thing needs to go back to school: the interior is soooo tiny with ""nooks and crannies"", ""bumps and lumps"" everywhere that won't allow me to put anything but a coffee cup, a very small bowl or at most, a dinner plate in it.3) The touch pad feels very ""flat"" and is not very responsive. I have to put my fingers ""just so"" for it to respond. My prediction is that it won't take long before it quits altogether. Also not inspiring confidence!Remember my Insignia?.............it would fit my Tupperware Microwave Pressure Cooker. Not this one, it doesn't even fit through the door!!!!I never cook in my microwave but would like to be able to fit a halfway decent size bowl, casserole, or my pressure cooker in it!All this makes this oven completely useless in a average houshold, a household that doesn't demand that much of it's microwave. AND.....my $170.- TW Pressure Cooker is now obsolete.And, of course, return date elapsed TODAY.In short: very disappointed, never again!!!"
"I purchased this microwave about 3 years ago. Love the compact size and it works well. But earlier this year the paint inside the microwave started peeling. First it was the sides, then the top, and now the bottom. Not sure what’s going on. Is it still safe to use?"
Packaged arrived with damage.  You could tell inside it was repacked a couple of times.  Probably returned prior.  The unit functions properly but the door is already a tiny bit loose on first usage.  The unit is inexpensive but I feel you are purchasing an item of lower quality.
Looks great but does not have a silence turnoff
"This is a super small microwave. A regular size dinner plate takes up the whole turn table and I’m always knocking the plate into the side of the microwave when I go to put it in because it’s such a tight squeeze. It is super low power, only 700 watts, and there’s no way to increase it, so food takes longer to heat up. It also doesn’t accommodate a bag of popcorn - it’s so small the popcorn bag won’t turn in the microwave, so it doesn’t pop properly. And it’s so low power it takes almost 3 minutes to pop a bag (and it’s still not fully popped because the bag didn’t turn). I like that it doesn’t take up much space on my counter, but I wish I had gotten something bigger because it’s just annoying. Also the beep when the food is done is super loud and high pitched, and it keeps going even after you’ve opened the door. I’m always racing to open it before the time runs out because I don’t want to wake up my neighbors and the sound freaks out my dogs."
"I cannot tell you how much I loathe the weak, unbalanced, unremovable carousel feature of this stupid microwave. It’s flimsy, and if the user does not center the weight exactly, it becomes unbalanced and won’t work. While this is not a difficult task with a dinner plate, it’s well nigh impossible to slide in a heavy casserole dish without unbalancing the whole thing. And there’s no way to remove the whole contraption and just use the microwave without it, as the floor of the microwave is not smooth. I hate this. Every time I cook, I have to fight the $&*# tray and flimsy wheels beneath it. Plus, it’s a useless feature anyway; I cooked in a microwave without a carousel feature for 35 years; turning and stirring halfway through cooking worked fine. But it seems impossible to find a microwave without an easily breakable tray now.The other problem with this microwave is that it’s poorly ventilated. Even heating something for one minute leaves the whole inside of the appliance dripping with moisture. I’ve never seen another microwave leave this bad. It has to be cleaned with every use, not just weekly or with food splatters. I hate that."
"Only one thing prevented me from giving this nuking machine a five star rating. It has metal feet which cause it to slide every time you open the door or push a button! Not too swift if you have a Formica or Granite counter top or any smooth surface for your kitchen counters! There are a couple of cures for this brain fade on the part of the engineering team that designed it. [1] Place the machine on a rubber dish mat or [2] Order ""Slipstick GorillaPads CB147 Non Slip Furniture Pads/Gripper Feet (Set of 16) Self Adhesive Rubber Floor Protectors, 1 inch Round"" from Amazon or go to a hardware store or discount home center and get some self-stick anti-slide rubber pads around an inch to an inch and a half, cut them in half and make a semi-circle hole in the middle to go around the small feet on the unit and stick them on. Depending on the thickness of the pad, you may have to apply a second one on top the first. Outside of that, it does a great job or microwaving your food and it easy to use if you read the instruction book first. One more thing, it's not the greatest of instruction manuals. Know that you have to enter the clock time during your initial setup by entering four digits for time. For example 1:15 should be entered as 0115. They don't tell you that!  While entering the cooking time, entering the left zero isn't necessary. Farberware are you listening? You can't put feet that slide on a smooth surface on a microwave!"
Very big! Works well. I think description said dorm or apartment size. I don’t think so.
"We ordered since the size, specs and look were good for us but when we turned it on we were shocked by the noise level. It is very loud so we replaced for another with the same specs that is much quieter"
"While the product seems to work reasonably well so far. Its noisier and takes much longer to heat things than previous microwaves I have used of similar wattage. Even when set to full power the power pauses something I have only encountered before when using Less than Full power in a microwave.The product arrived not in a manufacturers box or packaging and simply arrived with packing materials stuffed into an Amazon shipping box. Other signs that this was a USED rather than a brand new product included that the original packaging was stuffed inside the microwave rather than around it for protection. Also the ""protective film"" mentioned in the instruction manual as needing to be removed Before first use was already removed when I took the product out of the shipping box.Amazon customer service didn't seem to grasp the issue when I stated it in text and said I would receive a call from someone (The call never came) When I did finally speak to someone on the phone they said that I could return the product but that they couldn't do anything else. Even though they didn't ship me a New microwave which is what I shopped for and was looking to buy. If I had wanted a used one I would have gone to a thrift store, salvation army etc.I am not at all happy about paying a New price for a Used item."
"Got one of these for my Mom back in December. Nine months later, she called me up to say it was sparking when she tried to zap some popcorn. For comparison, I had a cheap RCA microwave last 5 years before it decided to fry itself; replaced that with a Toshiba that's been good for 2 years now.They don't make microwaves like they used to anymore..."
"Let me apologize. I know those of you living within a mile of me keep hearing six long BEEPS from time to time and have no idea where the sound is coming from. No, it's not a delivery truck backing up in my driveway. I admit it. It's the microwave we bought to fill in until the replacement arrives (theoretically) on Friday. No, there is no ""Mute"" option. If I had to keep this for more than a week, I would open it up, find the speaker, and trim its... toenails.We will be looking for a home for it once the replacement is installed but it would be fine for a dorm room. It's only 700 watts, so not nearly as powerful as our old 1100-watt GE. This means you have to double the cooking time. The Popcorn setting for 3 Oz packages is about 30 seconds too short. It also isn't vented so when I open it up after having cooked my breakfast sausage, I have to deal with a cloud of smoke.Another caveat. It won't hold a normal-sized dinner plate. That's okay, 'cause I'm supposed to eat off smaller plates to conform to my diet."
"Well, haven't used this yet so I can't say anything bad or good about it's performance, BUT, when you read the specs and order a product based on that, it's not a good feeling to find out that the power advertised is not accurate. I really want to send it back as a statement, but too much trouble. I hope it performs as advertised.  Three stars because I have no clue."
"I still have this microwave, but it’s not reliable.  It has not worked properly more than once, and I will have to return it, though that is a pain.  My son broke the box down and threw it away, so I’ll have to find something to return it in.  The last time it malfunctioned, the turntable was running while the time said 0.00. We could not stop it except by unplugging it.  It finally stopped running, and returned to functioning as it should. So it scares me.  Is there a short in the control pad? When I looked up the reviews 62% gave it 5 stars, but some of the lower ratings were disturbing.  My suggestion is to try another brand. I hope Amazon will credit my card instead of giving me a store credit."
I loved everything ab this product except it comes w a LARGE BRIGHT YELLOW stick that I could get off & it’s an eye sore so I had to return it
"Nice size microwave, but extremely loud buzzing for first 10 seconds.idk if that's normal or ?????...seems to work well besides that."
"This small microwave is pretty much okay, but for me it is too small and too under powered. Too small --> it can't handle a normal size dinner plate. Under powered --> it is rated at 700 W, but it seems to require more time than I expect to heat whatever ... soup, leftovers, you name it.The bottom line it that you can find small microwaves here on Amazon which are nearly the same size, but have a bit more capacity and are rated at 900 W. I subsequently found a microwave here on Amazon which was a tad bigger (but still met my size constraint of a max 11 inch height), could accommodate a normal size dinner plate and is rated at 900 W. The 700 W and 900 W microwaves mostly all fall in the same price range.If the slightly larger size of a 900 W unit isn't ea deal breaker for you, my suggestion is to go with one of those."
"Not sure why but there’s always water condensed on the inside of this microwave. I have made sure that all the film from packaging was removed. Wondering if anyone else is having this same issue. It works just fine, but this is the only issue I’m having with it.Edit: inside is now starting to rust in the creases of the corners, even with wiping dry after every use."
Bought for my son to take to college and he had to wipe it out after every use because of moisture. The towel is saturated with water.
"The microwave works very goog but the door latch opening button is awful. The pressure it takes to release the door closures is so much that you need to hold the microwave from moving back when trying to open the door, that should be a red flag upon testing. My elderly mother can't open it. I am using it and I hate the door. I had to buy a rubber mat to put under it to try to keep it from moving but still does if I don't hold it with my left hand. I recommend passing this purchase for another brand that has a much easier button or door handle. I would have returned it if I still had the boxes but my mother had thrown them."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The top of it has scratches bran new out the box and the foot is dented in so it rock back and forth this is horrible
"The first thing I noticed was that it was slow.  As I am 78 years old I am a little slow myself but this thing is slowing down even faster than I am.  It is also noisy.  Not the usual fan sounds, which are about normal, but it has clunking and rattling sounds also,  kind of like a old car on a bumpy road.  I expect any day the door is going to pop open and it will upchuck all its guts on the kitchen floor.  In the meantime I loiter around the microwave  for a full minute to get a luke warm cup of coffee.  I wouldn't buy another one.  On the other hand it might grind its way into eternity and annoy me to eternity.UPDATE AFTER ABOUT A YEAR.  It has quit clanking which is kind of unnerving as I had come to believe it was supposed to do that.  I could walk into another room and be reassured it was slowly getting the job done and it was kind of a reminder when it quit clanking the cooking job was done.  Now I silently loiter around the microwave in the morning and after a minute my day old coffee has warmed up to a full 1.8 degrees above room temperature.  Ah, bliss."
"A little loud and didn’t come with the glass plate, I had to use my old one."
"This microwave is black, rhe keypad is black and the buttons are very hard for us ""Oldtimers"" to read. We will donate this one and get a white one that we can better see to operate. Funny thing is that most microwaves are black and not easy to use."
"For those who are wondering like I was, (because the product specs don’t list the internal depth for some reason) the inner space for the 0.7 cu ft model measures about 12” deep and fits our standard dinner plates just fine.Works okay so far (low wattage requires longer cooking times but I don’t mind that). But the biggest downside by far is the buttons and end signal are insanely loud and cannot be muted or adjusted. We have a newborn so this is a huge drawback. Saw the child lock function and thought it would also do the very basic function of muting like most microwaves do, but not this one. It could wake the dang neighbors it’s so loud."
Probably owned 10 microwaves in my lifetime this is the worst magnetron ever
"It clearly states in the description that it is 1100 watts, but inside the door it says 1000 watts"
"On the plus side, it is affordable, light, and easy to set up. On the negative side, compared to larger models, it takes longer to heat; the buttons are harder to push; it is so light that pushing the buttons sometimes causes it to slide on the counter; and the heating chamber is small.For short term or occasional use, it is fine. It would be a good choice for a dorm room, o weekend  getaway place, or temporary use until a larger model can be purchased. But as a permanent choice for day in/day out use, I sure miss my larger, built-in microwave that this one has temporary replaced."
"It works—warms food. My last microwave was the same brand, but its keypad died after 3 years, a COMMON occurrence with this brand. This one, however, is very loud compared to my last one. Since I bought it primarily for its quiet operation, I’m not overly impressed. Will probably NOT purchase this brand next time."
"Heats up food, but doesn't vent at all."
"plate keeps jumping out of place right in middle of cycle.  plate does go into place nor stay there well.  It works fine, for countertop.  Would not buy again,  sorry."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Quite nearly impossible to contact Faberware. I didn't realize they were such junk producers or so impossible to work with. More like work around. I have tried three ways to contact them but can never do it. They do not have any item selection on their website for Microwave issues. And so it has come to the one star rating and online complaint. Should be a zero rating possibility or even negative.I did return the first one which had a broken carousel plate. The second one the whole carousel that turns in the center clicks and hangs and so it slops everything over - slop slop slop click click click. Don't buy Faberware.Video attached. It took two months to start that noise that you hear in video. I use just for heating coffee so I lived with it. But it's getting worse. Now it's loud enough to wake the wife in the AM.This same goes for Englewood and Meyer Marketing. They are all in one the scam of not honoring the warrantry. They keep forwarding you to someone else, over and over.  Four times now, and counting..."
"This thing makes a very loud electrical hum when using, it is a deep hum that you can hear and almost feel elsewhere in the house.  Also, you have to press time button in order to type numbers in the keypad.  This is different than the others I have had, for example if you close the door and press ""9"" nothing happens, you have to press ""time cook"" then you can enter the time you would like."
I was expecting a larger size unit.  My fault of course.  It works but I'm not that happy with it.
It doesn't heat items well. The rotating wheel is not fixed. The plate needs constant adjusting to keep it in the oven.
"I would like to turn the sound off but it wouldn't,  apart from the sound I think it is good"
Oven works well.  The only problem is dislay is dim and so is light inside oven.
"Most important to me is the fact that I can't remove the turning mechanism in the middle so I can cook something without it turning.  If my container is too large to turn, I want to be able to remove the ""turner"".I also feel that the middle turner could be designed better because at times the plate comes apart from the turner and the turning wheels move off the path.I also wish there was a way to reduce the bell that rings when the time is up.  Way too loud!It doesn't cook as hot as my previous 700 watt microwave."
"I like this microwave. it fits in my tiny amount of counter space, which is nice. it is very quiet when on, it just takes forever and a half to heat anything up.last night i had to put my soup in for 6 minutes to get it to cook. seems excessive, if i wanted to waste 6 minutes every time i cooked something i'd have stayed with the airfryer lol."
It looks nice and clean and fits in spaces you can normally fit a 700W microwave. However it has a really poor choice of programming. You cannot use the kitchen timer the same time you use the oven. This is incredibly inconvenient and I;ve never see an oven that doesn't allow for that. I would not recommend purchasing this oven if you intend to use the timer on a frequent basis.
"This is about as small a microwave as you can imagine.  If you are looking to heat up anything larger than a slice of pizza, this probably isn't the right fit for you.  That said, it's pretty good if you're just looking for something small for your office."
The microwave works well but the plate that goes inside was missing on arrival. I ordered an open item so I did not expect it to be perfect but I wouldn’t expect for parts to be missing. That should definitely be disclosed to potential buyers. I’d recommend only buying if purchasing brand new.
"This microwave is inconsistent.  It will either over heat or underheat your food seemingly at random.  Do not ever try to defrost meat in this microwave.  First glance this looks like a nice microwave.  The first few times I used it it seemed very powerful.  Well then I tried to defrost some ground beef, I converted the Lbs to Oz as is required to ""defrost by weight"" .  It made a beep halfway through the defrosting process and kept going.  So I stopped it and fliped the meat over as is standard for most microwaves.  When microwave beeped 5 times(annoying) to indicate it was done I pulled the ground beef out to discover almost all of the beef had been cooked.  I have never had that happen on any of the 50+ microwaves I have used.  So a pound and a half of ground beef in the garage.  Then I tried to defrost some chicken breasts and did the conversation to Oz from lbs and then cut back several oz again flipping when it beeped.  Pulled chicken out to see it was also mostly cooked, so a pound and a half of chicken breast in the garbage.  Tried ground beef again and reduced the oz by a 1/2 pound and fliped the meat seven or eight times while defrosting.  I pulled the beef out early and parts of it were hot and some frozen, so I quickly started mixing the meat with my hands so it wouldn't continue to cook to some success as I didn't have to throw all of the beef away this time. This microwave also offers a ""defrost by time"" function, there is no chart, instructions, explanations, exaples or even a guideline in the manual to use this feature, other than that it will defrost for the time you set it to.  Not how long ""x"" might take to defrost.  So tonight I tried that as well, total failure.I called customer service for direction before trying to defrost beef this evening, they had no clue.  They did very kindly do an internet search on how to defrost meat in the microwave and told me suggestions from some cooking websites not affiliated with this microwave in any way.  As I stated before the results were ineatable.So I asked friends and family if I was the only person who uses the microwave to defrost meat, especially during the work week.  Well I am certainly not alone in that category, even though we all agreed it's better to defrost in the fridge if you know the night before what you will be cooking.  Well since I can't plan what my family will want to eat for dinner several nights before. I am thinking this microwave will need to be returned and replaced with a brand that actually works, much less considers what someone may be defrosting and providing their customers with some sort of explanation as to how to successfully accomplish it."
I liked this microwave in the beginning I bought it April 10th it was delivered April 12th to my work  And as of July 15th it quit working. It no longer would heat defrost or anything it would just  Run with no function.  I got this microwave to use for my residents at my job. it's too late for me to get a replacement or a refund so I'm out almost a $100 And I had to get a different 12 replace it.
Small and cheap. Good for a dorm.
"I was excited to have a smaller unit for the space I have but, the way you have to open it is awkward. That is my only real gripe. Other than that it does its job but, I would return it if I could. But I waited too long which is totally my fault."
"Does not heat well, and am unable to return it"
"I chose this because I really needed a small, white microwave to replace my old one. It is only 700 watts so I have to adjust my cooking times. I wish it had a reminder beep when I don’t remove things (usually just boiling water for tea) on time."
"This product off gasses a horrible, chemical smell after using.  I hoped it would get better but it hasn’t.  I missed the return window and went and got another microwave from Target that was better with no issues (Black and Decker)."
I wanted to get something small for my counter space and this is it Much less power therefore takes longer. It was inexpensive and does what I need but is nothing special. It's okay for me to warm leftovers and coffee.
"The microwave does its job, but it arrived dented. Amazon gave me a discount for the defects but the materials feel kinda cheap and not durable. It’s also a little loud. For the price, I guess it’s a decent microwave."
I’ve noticed other people having this issue as well. Lower watts = guessing time. Easy to use and small which is great however it traps in so much moisture and leaks into my countertop. The bottom part is warped as well.
"It works fine. The issue is that there is no front glass protecting the panel of small holes that is in front of the outside glass panel. So, when the food explodes, the particles go through the small holes onto the inside of the front glass, which you cannot clean. So, I anticipate that after awhile, the glass will be come so dirty with old food particles that I will get disgusted and have to throw away the microwave. Very disappointed in the design."
"It's only 700wts.!!!! Noisy.Cant delete lock.Glass falls off turntable. This had to be an old,discontinued model. Read BEFORE any purchase"
Does not heat fast
"I ordered this Microwave specifically because the item listing was 1100 Watts.  However, upon receiving my order the box and Instruction manual shows this model is only 1000 Watts.  Sigh ....."
Hard to open and rather loud
The microwave literally just stopped working and showing zeros across the screen. Isn’t working in outlets where other things work fine. Disappointing that a microwave didn’t even make it a couple of years or one.
Not very powerful only use for heating up coffee or very small items does not even fit a dinner plate… but perfect for quick little warm ups
"It has a huge dent in the back and this is NOT stainless steel and it even checked every picture closely and it shows stainless steel sides(?)(?) It didn't want black or I would have chosen it. This is all black except for strips around the front!!!I was Sold on it because I got to pick stainless steel. Haven't used it yet, was cleaning it up, but it looks used and its not stainless steel so that should be very clear!! I feel like instead of returning it, if I keep it, i should get a discount. I was so excited waiting for it and im very disappointed by the dent which eventually wull start to rust now, and the fact it's black with not even stainless steel, just the silver color strips along the front."
This microwave was inexpwnsive but lasted less than a year before smelling like the insides were burning ... machine burning and i am not willing to have a house fire over it ....
It's good but it's not 1100 watt it's only 1000 Watt so eat h what you buy on here
Not very well made the glass platter does not sit right in the groves and dislodged easy
"I did not like anything about it.  It's way too small and can barely fit a dinner plate in it.  I wanted a veery large Microwave, like the old ones was.  Not a compact one.  I used it to heat food, popcorn and heating other things."
I’ve been living in my place for 5 years and I have never had ROACHES. When I first got this microwave I saw a few here and there and I thought maybe a guest brought them. But as time progressed I saw them more and more. And ALWAYS by this microwave. Whenever you cook from it it always smells like something I can’t describe. I’ve been watching it cook and EVERY TIME I see little baby ones come out. I’m very upset so I don’t recommend buying appliances from anywhere they allow returns. This is disgusting.
"We were happy enough with our microwave for a while. I don't like the dark interior. But a couple of times it just made really loud noise as it was cooking. It would do it for a few days, then quit making the noise, but kept working. Now, exactly 14 months after we got it  (it has a limited 1 yr. manufacturer's warranty) it just quit cooking. The light comes on, but it won't work. I think it should have lasted longer than this.  Farberware FMWO13AHTBKE Professional FMO13AHTBKE 1.3 Cubic Foot 1000-Watt Microwave Oven, Stainless Steel        UPDATE - IT STARTED WORKING AGAIN! We had to have done something wrong ourselves, because the next day I just tried it and it worked fine. Maybe someone forgot to clear the cook time or something simple like that. And it hasn't made any more weird noises either. So I am upgrading it to a 4 star. I hope nobody passed up buying it because of my review! It had to be our error! So sorry Farberware!3/25/2020 less than 3 years after purchase. Microwave just stopped working again. No idea why.  Several days ago the turntable started continuing to revolve after opening the door. But the oven was clearly not still cooking, so we continued to use it. Today it just stopped heating entirely. Light and clock are still working. Timer works. But no heat. Google says a microwave should last 10-12 years for normal household use. I'll try a different brand this time."
"My previous microwave had the same .7 Cu. Ft.  This one is taller, however, so the length and width is smaller.  A standard size PYREX casserole dish barely fits in there and taking it out is impossible without burning your fingers.  It won't even pop a regular size bag of popcorn.  As the bag expands, it catches on the sides and won't spin.  Burns the popcorn every time.  There is no anti-skid treatment on the bottom, so as you try to push the button to open the door, it slides across the counter.  You have to hold the microwave in place with one hand and open the door with the other.  The worst thing is that there is poor exhaust of the moisture that builds up, causing it to condense and rain down on the interior. You can't leave the door open to dry out because the light stays on, and you can only wipe the inside, but not get into the ""gut's where it will rust.  I'm sure this product is going to rust and fail way before my cheaper, but way better previous microwave."
"Not overly impressed, the first thing I noticed is the light is very dim inside the microwave. Second of all just to heat up the littlest thing takes over 4 minutes. What used to take me 2 minutes to warm up something now takes four in this microwave."
"After 4 months, most of the buttons don't work, incuding the ""Stop/Reset"" -- which is really annoying. Only the 1 minute, 5 minute, 7 minute and 30 second buttons work. Also, not as big of a deal, two of the dashes on the LED time display stopped working.So, it was great, until now. And it still works for now. But how long?"
"I ordered this microwave when my previous microwave gave out after 6 years of use. This microwave was cheap but when I received it, I realized why. It was my mistake not to double check that it would be big enough, but the power in this thing sucks. I have it set to the highest power setting there is for this model, and it still takes at least double the amount of time to cook something like a Hot Pocket.If you are a college student and just need a small microwave for your dorm room, this would be fine, but for a family who uses a microwave often, this is too small and not nearly powerful enough."
"I bought this in mid-October of 2020. Needed a new microwave after it's predecessor passed on to the Great Beyond, unexpectedly. It's now mid-December of 2021. I wake up and go to warm some water for morning tea, and I find our dear microwave unplugged. I called the spousal unit to ask what happened. According to  him, he was making coffee in the coffee-maker (totally different appliance), when the microwave decided of its own accord, to start up with nothing inside. It apparently wanted some attention, as no amount of pushing the stop button would shut it down. Spousal unit was able to open the door, and it stopped. However, it started up again when the door was shut. Spousal unit then unplugged the microwave, so as not to have the possibility of me waking up to the soothing, dulcet tones of the smoke alarm. I love my spousal unit, always thinking of me. I do not, however, love this microwave. So unless you want to support the Rise of the Machines, you would do well to continue your search for a microwave companion. As always, your mileage may vary."
"2 weeks shy of 2 years of owning it the microwave started on its own about 11:30pm (we heard the sound, but thought it was from those living in our basement apartment) and kept running until it was discovered about 12:45am. Unplugging it, replugging it, repeatedly pressing the stop button, and other buttons did not keep it from running continuously. We've reached out to Farberware and are waiting for a reply. Our Whirlpool Microwave lasted over 20 years. This one should last longer than 1.9 years!Otherwise, we loved the size, power, function and look of it. Hope Farberware will make it right!Update:  Farberware Customer Service would not make it right. They gave us a code to use for a 30% off from a different website, nostagliaproducts.com, which has nothing like we wanted or need to replace this stainless steel unit, only retro brightly colored items. They said they could do nothing for us through Farberware. We will need to purchase another whole new one and will be sad not to be able to recommend this unit."
"I bought this in December of 2020, and it has had problems since the beginning.  It does not vent properly so it gets all steamy inside.  This made it hold onto odors,  and actually ate off the finish on the top interior portion of the microwave.  Just bought a new (different) one today because I hate it."
Product worked for 5 days then stopped. I called the number to return it. I was sent the return slip. I had someone return it. I told the rep I am handy capped in a wheel chair. I just had an Amazon truck pull up ring my bell and then leave. I have no idea what they wanted. By the time I got in my wheelchair got to the intercom they were gone. I went to my door and yelled out hello. the driver sat in the truck for a few minutes and left. No call nothing. The microwave was returned to a store.  This is the way handy capped elderly are treated? How sad
Advertised as an 1100 watt but it’s only 1000 watts
Works well. No issues.  But it is LOUD
"One year, five months after purchase it began to arc. Now it is just more landfill. Waste of money.While it worked, it was fine: basic microwave. Small, low power, which is what I ordered."
"At first sight/use this was a great product.  After about three months it began making a grinding/clunking noise from the back.  I tried calling Farberware but it is not possible to talk with a person.  I wrote to them via their website.  I received a prompt, canned, response.  ""We've received your message...""  It said that for warranty issues I should expect follow up within 3-5 business days.  After 8 business days I wrote them back.  That was two business days ago.  Still nothing.If you're listening Farberware, please do something!UPDATE:  It has now been more than 13 weeks since I submitted my request for support.  I sent a new email pointing this out and requesting a response.  That was a week ago.  Still nothing."
"Microwaves have small differences in this price range. When you use one the only part you touch is the door. This one's door feels cheap and makes a tinny sound. I paid a bit more for the make, hoping it would be a bit better. It wasn't. Now I've learned to try them in a store."
No reminder chime for items left in the microwave.  Interior LED and display clock to dim.
At 700w it’s 400 fewer than an 1100 watter but 100 more than a six hundy. It’s a handy little thing but you better have a calculator to convert time. Most meals and such are rated for higher wattage. Just convert and you’re good.
"When you enter a description in the initial Amazon search box, looking for a specific item like a microwave oven. It is completely useless to enter a description of dimensions like height, width, depth or power rating.the description of the size, shape and power rate of the replacement microwave that I required were completely ignored. I tried several times, to enter the description of the under the cabinet mounted replacement unit that I required. However, I ended up with an oversized countertop unit. I should have gone to Wal Mart instead."
"My trusted, very old microwave just stopped heating on me one night.  Well, I am useless in the kitchen without one, so I had to hop right to it and throw an order for a microwave on my outgoing requests to Amazon.  I chose this one based on the name, the wattage, I burn up things if I have one of those 1100 watt things, and how little it cost.  I did read the reviews nominally, but had pretty much had made up my mind based on that bottom line!  It is definitely sufficient.  It somewhat looks like I bought one at a garage sale, not because it is beat up but because it doesn't have a lot of the newer features.  One of the major complaints of the reviewers was that it moved when it was opened or running; I do not have that problem.  I have it stuck in a small enough corner that I don't think it dare move!  However the other major complaint that it was quite noisy is one with which I will have to agree.  The spot in my kitchen where the microwave is literally steps from my living room, yet when I go in to check on something cooking in it, I cannot hear the news on the TV over the noise of this microwave.  Yes, I've grown used to it; when the price is right it's amazing what you can grow used to!!  😂"
"Purchased this device to work in my camping trailer, as it was advertized as having a 700W power required. This is not true!It requires over 1000 Watts and cycles on and off, even with the power setting at level 5 so the average is lower but the requirement over taxed my inverter making it unusable in my camper!Don't be fooled by this clame of 700w power requirement. The webpage needs to be fixed!Don't buy it if you want to use it on batteries, or in an RV unless your inverter has a 1500w rating!"
There is nothing i dislike about this microwave besides it makes some pretty weird sounds. We had to replace our old microwave bc it started catching fire on the inside and made some sketch sounds. The new one is making the same sketch sounds along with some other weird sounds. We have had a few microwaves over the years and have never had this issue besides when it is at the end of its life. We have only had this one for about a month or so. We are going to keep it anyway bc it works as it should but are concerned with how long it will last. Will you try to remember to update if anything changes.
Again the dimensions were totally wrong and not as described! I would have sent it back if I weren’t desperate for a microwave! It’s too big for a very small counter that’s why I was really hoping the dimensions were right! But there not! 😡
"I mean, u get what u paid for 🤷 We needed it and didn't have a whole lot of money to spend on one right now so .."
"I believe this is a good microwave, however the one I had sent to my friend would overheat and turn off. She couldn't use it for 5+ minutes each time it turned itself off.I gave 3 stars..because of her experience, I think this one had a flaw, but I think not all will experience same problem."
"This was, I thought, exactly what I needed.  I didn't even think to check the wattage.  I'm used to 1000 watts or more, what most homes have these days.  This one is not that.  Takes longer to cook anything, the door is really tight, you have to hold the unit to open the door.  The whole thing moves when you push the buttons.  I guess if this was your first microwave, it would be OK, but I'm used to a lot more for my money.  This will get us through until we can replace our built-in, but that's about it."
"The OSTER that I had for YEARS finally died. I ordered a 'Kenmore' & the operational panel would need a Scientist Ph.D. to continually operate! No 'set it & forget it' with that one (not even the CLOCK!) Next one;I continually poured over the Farberware description which stressed it was SMALL & compact (Not! Same size as my Oster!) Since it stressed small-compact, it was not my idea of small! Operational: same 'involved usage"" just for the CLOCK as with the Kenmore! Set it & then, shortly, you need to re-set it AGAIN! As I compare the Kenmore & Farberware, I 'sense' it is the SAME product, just with different Brand names attached! I am elderly & had scrutinized the product illustrations & description but am experiencing 'something was lost in the translation'! Oh well, I guess my next purchase needs to be a kitchen CLOCK!"
"The microwave works great, however it is advertised as a 1100 watt microwave, whicn it's is only 1000.Not putting it at 1 stars because it does work great and looks nice, but it gets 3 stars for the false advertising."
"This microwave was the perfect size for our small apartment, and with such high reviews we were convinced it would work. However it takes 2-3x longer to hear items, and the glass is consistently coming off of the stand/rotator causing the food to burn on one side, during heating. It is easy to clean and a nice size, but I wouldn't recommend this microwave to anyone, unless it is your last option."
Don't expect this to heat anything quickly with the low power rating.  It's cheap and small and you pay for that with lots more of your time waiting for it to do the job.
Loved it until it stopped working after 7 months. Wasn’t cheap either. We hardly use it. One day I was heating up soup and I smelled something electrical burning so I unplugged it and tried it on another plug awhile later and it won’t turn on. This is junk and they should be ashamed as a company. This could have burnt my house down had I not unplugged it.
"I needed a new microwave as my old one was on its last legs.  The price was good on this model and the right size to fit on a shelf over my kitchen counter.  I am not sure why, but I have lots of condensation build up inside the microwave and have to mop up that water almost every day.  Also the revolving glass plate that the food sits on keeps coming off of the place where it attaches to and I struggle to get it back in place.  The wheeled plastic ring that the plate sits on keeps slipping out of place as well.  I have no idea why this is happening, but I am so annoyed, I am thinking of getting rid of this and buying another brand.  It really is a nuisance."
1. It slides all over the damn place2. It retains every odor and smells horrible no matter how I clean it or what I clean it with3. Everything you put in it for any amount of time steams/smokes even when it’s not getting hotThere are plenty of budget friendly microwaves. Bought a black and decker one at target for $55 and it’s way better.
"Purchased in Aug, 2022, I chose this one primarily for the size. But something is wrong with this thing. Sometimes. The 80/20 rule applies here. 80% of the time, it's fine. 20% of the time, it will randomly start rotating very slowly causing uneven cooking - once causing burn holes in a microwave-safe paper plate. Sometimes, it appears to be cooking but a frozen item comes out still rock solid and ice cold - no change. And then the POSSESSION happened (according to my dog). That 2-second beep at the end of the cycle that tells you time is up - has suddenly turned into 2-minutes of off/on beeping (20 sec on, 3 off, 20 on, 1 off, etc). It won't stop. I have to unplug it and re-plug it back in to make it stop. Not since the great smoke alarm attack of 2020 has my dog been so afraid of the kitchen. This thing has to go now."
"EDIT (9 month update): I am pretty sure the oven heating element is broken or defective. It will not reach 425F no matter how long I have it turned on. Turntable just rotates indefinitely and it never reaches 425F despite having it on preheat for over an hour! Bad news if you want your food to be piping hot and crispy! So much soggy, undercooked, cold, and wasted food has come out of this terrible excuse of a toaster oven. Changing my rating from two stars to one star.I can't say that I really recommend this combo convection/microwave. It does the job as a microwave, however, I bought this because I really wanted something to use as an oven for baking. Unfortunately I have found that the convection oven does not perform like it should. Despite being a *convection* oven, I usually have to cook things longer than recommended with recipes that call for conventional ovens. For example, I had to cook a meatloaf twice as long as the recipe called for and at a higher temperature to get it to the recommended temperature of 160F. Breads are often doughy and undercooked as well.I have my doubts that the oven temperature presets are even accurate but I do not have an oven thermometer to compare it with.Pros:- It is *okay* for baking things like frozen goods when you cook according to the conventional oven directions (go on the longer side, but don't expect it to turn out very crispy. I've had pizza rolls turn out cold regardless.)- It works as a microwave. It does its job in that respect. No complaints about that. But is it worth the price as just a microwave? I don't think so.Cons:- Incredibly unpredictable and often mediocre baking results when actually cooking something. Expect to spend more time cooking than planned and/or raising the temperature. At least in my experience. I know that these are not issues with the recipes - I have tried a few beloved recipes that I had made in other ovens before only for them to be ruined by the issues with this toaster oven.- Oven settings are only in certain increments on the keypad. You cannot enter a custom number for the oven temperature, so if your recipe calls for something specific like 420F you will have to bake at 425F instead.- No 450F oven setting (or anything higher than 425F on bake).- Annoying beeps when you open the microwave. The beeps are just dreadful to my ears. No way to turn it off.Note: I haven't used the air fryer function due to other reviewers' concerns about it being a fire hazard.Would I say it is worth the price? No. Do I plan on keeping it? Until I get something better I suppose."
"The functions (microwave, air fry, broil, I even really like the combination option) themselves work, but I can’t give anything over 3 stars because of how annoying it is. No way to turn off the beeps and it beeps at you for just about everything. Set Broil for 20 seconds? It will beep at you to turn the tray after 10 seconds. Leave the food in the tray after the cycle is done for just a short period of time? No worries!! It will constantly remind you even though all you’re doing is walking to the microwave too slowly for its liking.If anyone knows how to turn these interruptions off, or the beeps off, it would be a 5 star product. But until then, I would not recommend it over its competitors."
"I've attached a picture of the control panel for this microwave oven. You wouldn’t know it, but it is plugged in. What you're looking at is the far right side, where the control panel icons and labels are located. These are what you need to see to operate this microwave. The icons and especially the labels are so dim that they are nearly impossible to see.  Surely this is not what the manufacturer intended? I hoped the icons and labels would light up as soon as I plugged in the machine. They do not. There is no difference, no change in appearance in the control panel whether the machine is plugged in or not.Given that the oven did not come with an instruction manual, it is hard to know if this is a problem that can be addressed with some simple instructions by the user. So I called Amazon and tried to get them to help me with the problem. The best they could do was refer me to the manufacturer or process a return. I did find a manual for a similar machine online. It talked about a power button. So I put my face right up against the control panel (NOT RECOMMENDED!!!) where I could look at all the dim labels and icons. No power button there!So frustrating! I really wanted this oven because it had a convection oven as well as microwave. But the thing is absolutely useless to me if I can’t see the control panel to be able to operate the thing! Today I tried to get in touch with the GE Customer Support. I thought I would start with the chat. But immediately saw ""Chat Unavailable."" At 11:30 am? So I tried calling. I've been on hold quite a while. Finally asked for a call back and supposedly won't lose my place in line. We shall see. So then they called me. They could not help me because they needed the serial number as well as the model number. Well, I had already put the microwave back in the box, because I was pretty certain I would need to return it. I wasn't going to lift the heavy thing just for the serial number when the model number should suffice. I tried to tell the agent the problem I was having, and when I started to give the agent the model number, she hung up on me. She didn't even say goodbye. She just hung up. GE I DON'T NEED TO BUY ANYMORE OF YOUR PRODUCTS. I WILL DEFINITELY BE RETURNING THIS PRODUCT!Another issue, probably related to the electronics of the control panel. The top LED clock turned on briefly after the microwave was plugged in, then went off and a ""PF"" appeared. I found out that meant ""Power Failure."" I hope Amazon understands that there is something wrong with this oven and hope it gets returned to the manufacturer rather than resold to another customer."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Beeps for End, beeps when you open it and things are hot, doesn't stop beeping after you hit cancel/stop!WTF?!  This was after trying the convection with a timer, and yes it was still hot.  My expectation was that hitting the stop with shut it up, but it didn't.  Just after this video of me being unsuccessful at shutting it up, I had to literally pull the plug to get it to stop beeping.  Even if it was just stopping the timer, canceling and stopping should stop everything.While there are instructions to disable the child lock in the manual, there is nothing that will mute it or turn the beep volume down.  Searching other GE microwaves, there was a ""beeper volume"" on the control panel, but not this one.A separate issue is the exterior temperature when using the convection.  The manual says don't place anything on the top of it when in use, which you need to follow.  The top was very warm, but the side was hot to the touch.I'm giving this a week to see if it's a proper replacement for the old microwave and the separate air fryer, but it's not looking good.  As just a microwave, it's great.  Operation is incredibly quiet . . . . until it's done, then you can't shut it up."
"Like stainless steel interior, microwave his quite a few features Which should have not focused on  As so far big disappointment to my husband the air-fry and boiler do not work  As just for a Basic microwave for the price and the size as we have microwave built in shelf  Our microwave when we remodeled the whole kitchen late 90’s our microwave was 1.3cubic Amana  Now microwaves it’s hard to find stainless interior one for our shelf.  Like the power with this Ge micro the appearance is nice except for the touchscreen can not see at night unless turn on all kitchen lights.  I have been looking for new microwave for three years stainless interior finally decided to purchase this one got tired of looking."
"I purchased this microwave in August 2024. I am writing this review in November 2024. The microwave is no longer working. It suddenly stopped and trips the breaker anytime it’s turned on. It’s definitely a faulty unit and not our electrical as we have checked this out. GE customer service will only issue a “rebate certificate”. This means I have to comeout of pocket for another GE microwave, wait until they send me the rebate certificate in the mail, and then submit for the rebate and wait up to 8 weeks to receive my credit back for the microwave. This seems like a lot of extra steps to get a replacement that is less than 3 months old in my opinion.As for the microwave it self I LOVED it…all 2.5 months that it actually worked…🙃"
"We only used the microwave, which is great.The control panel is dark numbers and words on a darker surface.  We have to keep a flashlight nearby so we can read the fine print.The company should supply a plastic stick panel with white letters so it can be easily read.  The clock is bright. That's good.And the baking pan has the non-stick coating.  I would like an option for a regular pan."
"Received microwave/oven/fryer early in the morning and spent the day familiarizing myself with it by putting it through its paces. As advertised, it's solidly built and exceptionally quiet. It also microwaves, air-fries, and convection bakes very well.An in-depth manual didn't come with mine so I downloaded one from GE's website and printed it out. The manual is generic in nature. That is to say, it describes features, functions and how-to-do-its that may or may not pertain to this particular modelNow for the bad news. It is a potential fire hazard. Air frying mode requires you use the taller of two racks. That places anything you cook very close to the heating elements. Anything containing fat like beef, pork, chicken, bacon, etc. is going to pop and sizzle. That pop can easily spatter on the overhead air-fry heating elements. When it does the spatter bursts into flame for a second or two until it burns off. In my opinion this could easily escalate into a full blown kitchen fire if whatever being air-fried continued to spatter on the heating elements for several minutes.Also be aware this unit exhausts very hot air through a vent located near the bottom left side of the appliance when in convection oven or air-fry mode. I originally put the unit on top of my refrigerator but quickly moved it to a countertop when I touched the refrigerator surface near the exhaust vent. The top of the refrigerator was almost too hot to touch!I read a few customer reviews that claimed their oven caught fire in the upper compartment where the air-fry heating elements are located. I suspect they were air-frying fatty meat or something coated with oil that continually spattered on the overhead heating elements. That in turn resulted in the unit catching fire.Summing up, my recommendation is to only use the air-fry option with things like frozen French fries, thinly sliced vegetables, etc.. But cook all meats or anything coated with oil in Convection Oven mode with the shorter rack. Otherwise you definitely run the risk of the unit catching fire."
Some numbers on the display are disappearing- this started at about 6 months of use. We like it otherwise but not hopeful it will last since we’re having the display problem. It’s almost a year old now.
Two complaints1: You CANNOT read the control panel.2: They don’t enclose a physical printed manual.
Very difficult to use. LIghts on the panel never worked. And now when I use it I see flashes. So I'm done with it.
"This microwave generally works as expected, but after 3-4 minutes of use the bottom of inner frame gets insanely hot.  It does flash ""hot"" on the display panel, but I would not want children any where near the thing."
It’s great at doing what a microwave does but it would be so helpful to include a cookbook for even basic recipes for air fry and convection oven use. The pre-set buttons are okay but show me how to make cookies please!
"The pictures of these two models look exactly the same. I got (I think) a steal of a deal for it, ordering on Thanksgivng day, but the question is whether Amazon is trying to renege on return of it if something about it is defective. I've only used it to mcrowave a couple times, and so far, I like it, except for a few things. The print on the control panel, is charcoal gray on a black backgound, making it exceedingly hard to read the controls. That's nasty! Also, it came with only a 6 page booklet (covering mostly safety cautions, cleaning, and troubleshooting), plus a one page insert regarding the air frying function. I had to go online to find the 48 page .pdf user manual. Even with that, I could find no explanation of the difference between combi1 and combi2, and for which foods each is preferable. I have had to print out certain charts in the user manual in order to have even the faintest clues as to things like the various air fry presets, when to use the tall rack vs the short rack, what microwave power setting are appropriate for different tasks. For example it says the power 1 setting is good for softening butter, but doesn't suggest how long is recommended per stick.In the .pdf manual's chart entitled ""select the best method of cooking,"" the entries in the chart are either NR, 1, or 2. I assume NR means not to use that function for a particular food, but what do 1 or 2 mean. I would assume it doesn't mean minutes, for that would mean nothing ever gets cooked by any method for mre than 2 minutes, including any of the foods cooked by convection baking. So does 1 mean ""this is the preferred method"" and 2 mean ""this method usually does not work out as well for this particular food""? Just what do those ones and twos in the chart mean?! Given these complaints, I am giving this oven 3 stars. I may upgrade or downgrade my rating as I use this oven more."
The microwave works well enough but that's all it does. Zap leftovers. I never received the instructions to use the other features it was suppose to have. I was really looking forward to using the convection oven feature but without instructions I've purchased an overpriced counter top microwave.
"Initially, this was a great combo unit. It did everything I wanted and it worked well. Then, one day, it became sentient and decided that it would determinebhow long to cook all my food even when I explicity hit the ""time cook"" and entered an exact time. The microwave changed the power level and cook times even though I set those prior to hitting the start button (out of the box, this worked just fine).  One time, I lost track of the time, mistakenly believing that 5 minutes is actually 5 minutes.  The microwave cooked that food for much longer and I was stucked with an absolutely charred dinner.  I reached out to the company who were of absolutely no help whatsoever. Their answers were ""unplug it,  wait a minute or 2, plug it in and try again.""  Other than that, I was told to buy a new microwave from them. GE used to make good stuff.  Now it's enabling the machine uprising and demanding we buy their newest model rather than addressing known issues. Ill get a new microwave,  but will never be a GE again!"
I replaced the dented Toshiba microwave we recently got with this GE microwave.  Our only concern was DENTED from the back but packaging looked okay.  Since I applied a WARRANTY I am not interested as of yet to have it replaced if the running is okay.  Just wondering why there’s always a dent!!!
The controls are a little confusing and the air fryer function doesn’t work well. But it’s a nice small powerful microwave.
"We have a 100-year-old house, and who knows when it was wired for electricity, but in any case whenever we plugged in this microwave it flashed PF as in power failure. Apparently we just couldn't give it enough voltage."
"Used to a Ninja air fryer, so this is a disappointment.  Doesn’t make my sweet potato fries crisp enough.  Other items you have to turn over. What a bother!"
"I ordered one, it stopped working so it was replaced. This one seems to be nosier and it’s rusting on the inside all over. Would not recommend. I’m going to try again to return this one."
No manual in box and they want $5 to get it. The air fryer does not do a good job and it does not toast bread.  Big disappointment.
"The microwave had a lot of clear smoke and a lot of write smoke, with burning smell for the microwave function longer than 3 minutes. I checked and cleaned it again. The problems existed. I reported. The first repairman came and did nothing. He told me it’s not fixable, not repairable. That’s on 06/17/24.Then I still tried to fix again, with Google and YouTube to find out what the problems caused such effects. Then I checked the GE warranty and it’s still under warranty and could be replaced. I called GE again and GE sent another guy. The guy said no issue and left. Now I did my microwave cooking two potatoes, using preset method. My potatoes was about 8.5 oz, but after 2-minutes I started to see a lot of clear smoke, with a little bit dark smoke. I immediately stopped it. I opened the door and started it again. I felt the temperature in the kitchen rising up again with a lot of clear smoke. I was standing in front of the microwave and I felt the heat from the microwave rising up and the pressure from the microwave rising… there’s still 4 minutes cooking time on the screen. I just stopped it.I reported it to GE for replacement. GE refused. It’s terrible manipulation and terrible management. I read many customers reviews and when they reported to their manufacturers, and they immediately replaced their products, without sending other repairmen again, with solving the problems.Case closed,$200 wasted, a terrible experience."
"Bought this microwave 6 months ago, thinking it could be good as a combination microwave and oven. The air frying feature was a bonus.I've rarely use the convection feature, maybe once a month on average. While it does work, the ear shattering beep when opening the door while hot is enough to discourage it from being used more often.A few days ago, while using the microwave quick start mode (by hitting the 1 key to have it quickly go for 1 minute), the unit ramped up like normal, light and fan and magnetron all come on, and a split second later the whole thing dies. The display, lights, whole nine yards. Nothing gets it to come back on except disconnecting it from power and re-connecting it.This only happens when you hit the 1 key, quick 2 works fine, so we figure annoying but not critical, and go on with our day.Fast forward to today. I go to use the airfry mode again, and it starts *pouring* out white smoke, the kind you get from electrical fires. I quickly unplug it and investigate, there is no visible fire (lucky) but the thing is unsafe! I've seen other reviews showing similar issues.After 6 months of owning it, this microwave has completely killed itself. It's a fire hazard and I cannot recommend anyone getting it"
"Look at the picture of the buttons. See how bright and easy to read they are? The buttons on the actual product are nothing like this. They are a dull grey color with so little contrast with the black background that they are impossible to read in anything but direct, bright light. It's ridiculous. I bought this microwave because the one I owned previously was also a GE. The old one had much better contrast. I never had a problem reading the buttons. I'm not sure what I will do, now- put stickers on the buttons? memorize the entire control panel? Too late to return this, so I'll have to either give it away and get something else or find a way to adapt to what is just a stupid design decision."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this microwave convection oven combo for my truck.  While it does a decent job when it works, it's lacking when it does not.  I'm not sure what is going on with the rotating plate but it doesn't seem to be holding up at all.  In the video, you can see it is going back and forth about ½ inch.This is extremely bothersome because instead of set it and let it cook, depending on what it is i need to watch it.  It has burnt one side while not doing jack to the other side.The heating element is at the top rear, the rotating plate makes sure that everything greetings some time in the heat.I hope GE responds but if they don't,  i plan to call them directly and update the review with the fix they provide me."
"Didn't outperform my 12 year old Microwave-Convection from Kenmore (Elite).  Kind of ironic but my older unit was better in most ways (except it has no air fryer function which didn't work well anyway).1. My old unit had a knob which when rotated increased or decreased time, temp, selection options, etc.  Pressing it selected choices made.  Handy and quickly.2.  Old unit had a handle for opening, as opposed  to push-button which was difficult to use.  This surprised me but I really preferred the handle for opening.3.  Old unit had fewer controls but verbal option on the display that could be selected via handy knob.  For example, to select the defrost, you selected the type of item you were defrosting (e.g., meat, fish, etc.), and how much it weighed and pressed the knob.  It did all the calculations!4.  Old units display  was much easier to read-- with the new unit I need my glasses and flash light.How many ways can I say that the older unit was beautifully designed and the new unit was not (you actually needed to download the user manual to have the numeric codes to cook many things!).Unfortunately, the old unit is no longer made so I replaced one part (the tray ring) and we'll see how many more years I get out of it.  It will be a sad day when I must throw it out."
"I like that it's relatively quiet when running & that it has a very nice air fry feature.What I dislike is that it has multiple beepers that go off when it finishes cooking & I can't disable them.The beeper goes off that it's finished cooking. You press clear, then open the door. ANOTHER BEEPER GOES OFF while the screen flashes HOT over & over.Listen guys.  I put something in the microwave to make it hot.I know the food is hot.Stop warning me that the food is hot.Even when I use the air fryer, I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE HOT.I WANTED IT TO BE HOT.THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT THIS APPLIANCE WHOSE ONLY FUNCTION IS TO MAKE THINGS HOT."
"Bought 12/11/23, stopped working 5/13/24.  While this product worked, it was really good.  A couple of things on this product, instructions that came with the product were not complete, had to figure it out on my own.They suggest you use the high shelf when cooking but if you do, you can’t see if your over cooking your food or not.  The last day it worked, I was using the microwave portion, it turned on for a split second then everything went black.  Everything else still working expect this appliance.  So sad, just 5 months of use, now garbage."
"The microwave has great cooking options. Thus far I have only used it for microwave cooking. It looks great, is very silent and I like that I can look at the food through the window in the door.One huge con:  I should have read the reviews more closely. As with others, I HATE that the control panel is not backlit. A bright light in the room is necessary to see it. The letters are also not readable without lots of light. I put a piece of tape over the 30 second cook option so I could feel what to push!!I would probably return it but it’s too much of a hassle and I like everything else about it!!"
"Pros: feature-rich with its broil and air-fry modes - nice to consolidate multiple appliances!  Also, compared to our previous 10-year old Panasonic, the microwave function is whisper-quiet.Cons: Some very basic features are missing - No backlighting on buttons, nor is there a way to silence the beeping. Reading GE’s responses, they seem to consider this unimportant. THEY ARE WRONG.Also, there are two schools of thought about the user interface. Panasonic seems to favor the numeric keyboard to dial in a time; GE requires you to press a function like “cook time” first; otherwise, pressing a 9 will start a 9-min cook automatically. So, just be warned- it takes a little time to reprogram your brain so instead of pressing “90”, you press “add 30 seconds” three times. Not a deal-breaker once you’ve had your first coffee!"
"Works great as a microwave, but this thing does not air fry"
Great microwave but every time I attempt to use the air fryer option it smokes badly and I’ve even had flames be careful with this one!
"This is great for air frying, but the oven is terrible!  It either burns or does not bake through.  Also, the microwave burns popcorn unless the popcorn is placed on the side of the turntable.  I do NOT recommend this product for the money!"
"It is M excellent product except, there was no manual inside the box. I am having to figure it out on my own."
"This has proved itself as a microwave and in its other features as well, such as broiler and air fryer.  The controls are mostly easy to understand, but sometimes the manual is needed.  Works great!  The only downside is that the plastic overlay on the buttons wears very fast.  Yet, the reviews warned of this.  I pretend it is wearing like fine leather!  ; )  Definitely recommended!One thing I might change is the three-legged stand.  It falls over way too easy!  Very usable, yet one has to be very careful in placing it down so it does not want to fall over...UPDATE:Cooking elements died after 15 months.I originally went with this product because of high reviews, looking only for a microwave. But, still, disappointed!Have a back toaster oven.It worked okay~ the microwave still works~ but I do not like the shedding/pealing plastic covering of the controls or that it is made in China and that the American company is owned by a Chinese one.  Really, just need a dial.We need to bring jobs back to the United States and raise wages.  Buying from China is shooting oneself in the foot..."
"The microwave itself is good, but arrived dented at the top and the back of it was broken. It still works but it would have been nice to receive an item that wasn't mistreated during shipping. Looks like it was dropped and kicked more than once."
"Purchased March of 2024, routinely wiped down the outside and inside, had to adjust every cook time for food as the microwave runs very hot and will overcook, it’s so heavy, and after only seven months of use it now smells like burning plastic; I don’t care for it enough to buy parts and attempt to fix, so now I’ll need to get a new microwave."
"Edit: Giving it a 1-Star because the migraine-inducing alarm was enough to keep me from using it. Maybe it wont be so bad for others, but it was just the right tone for me. Ended up returning it.Maybe I'm being harsh, or maybe I just don't like this particular device.First off: The only time I can get the Air Fryer setting to somewhat have crispiness on items, is to crank the temp all the way up and to burn things slightly. (This is while using the 'Crispy Pan' and the rack and everything like the PDF says.)Second: That PDF I mentioned? The Manual that's supposed to be better than the couple of pages that they slipped into the box? Still lacking tons of important information. I never thought looking at an instruction manual would leave me with more questions.This is my first convection+air fryer that I've ever had - so maybe the company is supposing I have had one before..? Or they prefer everyone to turn to the internet beyond them for information. I don't know.Third: Did you know that this has an absolutely migraine-inducing alarm if you open the door while it thinks the temperature inside is hot? I don't know if this is supposed to be some kind of kid-alarm or what, but my cookware shouldn't give me migraines. You can shut it off by hitting the ""Cancel"" button, but if you are turning food in the middle of a program - hitting Cancel also clears your program. And you get to set it all up again.I am starting to get used to hovering my finger over the Cancel button when I go to open the door any time I cook something.Setting my extreme frustrations aside, I haven't had it arch on me yet, and food is cooking. I still prefer my old air fryer though. I wouldn't buy this as an Air Fryer. Everything else seems to be working okay so far. It cooks quickly, so that's nice.But I really wonder if I would've been better off buying a different device and sending this one back."
"I had previously owned a small GE microwave that lasted a very long time and loved the size and features and durability.  When the time came to replace it I found this unit which was pretty much the same except with added features.  So I purchased it.  Well, it works fine but I literally have to pick up a flashlight and point it at the touchscreen in order to read the commands in order to run it.  This is RIDICULOUS.  I have undercabinet task lighting that is very bright but because the angle of this unit sticks out just past the edge of the cabinet the light beam just misses the screen and I cannot read it.  Unless I have all my overhead lights on I cannot read this unit.  So if someone wants to pop a microwave bag of popcorn in this or to warm up some water for tea or another hot beverage you need to go in with a miner's cap.  Most annoying thing to do with an appliance like this."
"When we first purchased this microwave, we were so excited because it was SO QUIET!  We didn't really use the air fryer, just used the basic microwave.  Today, it died.... just stopped working.  I'm sorry I didn't get the 3 year extended warranty.  It's generally a good microwave, but I expected this appliance to last longer."
"I purchased this 3-in-1 microwave, air fryer, and convection oven in August 2022, and it has been nothing short of a disappointment. Let me break down the issues:1.  Temperature Woes: The oven failed miserably at maintaining the correct temperature. It consistently ran 150 degrees too low, rendering it useless for baking bread or pizza. As a microwave, it performed adequately, but that’s hardly a selling point.2.  Air Fryer Fail: The air fryer function was lackluster. My previous air fryer cooked the same foods in half the time. This one left me waiting and hungry.3.  Flimsy Design: The real kicker? The door button broke exactly one month after the warranty expired. I had my favorite soup bowl trapped inside! Upon disassembling the unit, I discovered a flimsy plastic pivot piece in the door mechanism. Why not use sturdy metal? My soup shouldn’t be held hostage by poor design choices.4.  Fire Hazard: Recently, the oven started shutting off randomly, flashing a “PF” code (power failure). After ruling out my outlet, I opened it up again. To my horror, I found severely burnt wires. Yes, it had caught fire without anyone noticing. I’ve attached a photo of the charred part—see for yourself.Verdict: Do Not Buy! Save yourself the frustration, potential fires, and soup-related emergencies. Invest in a more reliable appliance, like a used blow dryer."
Why do I feel more microwave radiation than in any microwave I have ever used?
Needs some instructions.  I have no idea how to use this item.  Can't find recipes on line.  Big failure by GE!
"We used this as a microwave 4-5 times without incident, which is why I gave it an extra star. We used the air fryer one time (with frozen french fries) and it worked fine. We tried the air fryer a second time with breaded chicken and the food literally caught on fire. I opened the door and flames where everywhere in the unit. Shut the door immediately and eventually the fire went out while I was try to get the fire extinguisher to work. The air fryer rack puts food VERY CLOSE To the top heating element and I am assuming that that this how the fire started. We are able to return the item, but posting this as a warning to others. We are lucky nothing caught fire when I opened the door - not noticing that the contents were on fire in there! Luckily was able to shut the door and contain the flames but could've been so much worse. I will not order another unit like this ever again."
"Good microwave, solid air fryer functionality while it lasted. Have used the microwave function constantly for months without issue. Used the air fryer function occasionally for about 5 months until one day it started putting out acrid-smelling smoke. I was skeptical of combining all the electronics of a microwave with a 400+ degree oven, now looks like I'll end up buying a dedicated air fryer anyway."
If you're looking for a microwave I'm sure this does a good job - but for air frying? Horrible.I've gone through several air fryers since they've been impossible to keep clean so I thought a microwave combo would be the 'ticket' since you can put cleaning cloths in a microwave to keep it clean.I got this unit and tried air frying boneless skinless breast at the suggested settings and 1) the pans used are horrible especially if you want to have two items with different seasonings on them - you can't keep them separate from mixing with each other 2) it took as long as using my stove to get them cooked to temperature and 3) the distance between the rack you put inside and the top of the microwave means you can't put anything of any height in it to air fry.So this immediately went back.By chance I bought a new air fryer and this one is by FAR the best I've ever purchased since it cooks fast AND you can clean it!
The control panel does not light up. It is very hard to read the controls. Would not purchase it again
my wife will not use it. went back to her old one
Stopped heating up food no matter what setting I use and my return window is closed so now I’m stuck with a product that’s non refundable and no warranty.
Worst microwave for making Popcorn. Air fryer is no better than using an oven. I regret buying this item.
This microwave is tasked to perform many tasks but doesn’t do any very good at any of them.  Total failure as an Air Fryer.  Metal pan leaves air fried foods soggy.  Microwave is not intuitive and blended with a Multi function that both uses convection and microwave.  To set time for microwave there is an extra step to Select Time instead of just pressing the numbers.  Oven feature works but you have to select one of the two metal racks to cook on.  My toaster oven is easier to use. Not happy but I threw away the box so I guess I’m stuck with it.
"Why am I not happy with this product?When we moved into our new apartment, it didn’t have a built in microwave…hooded vent instead over the stove.We already had an air fryer, a large one at that, and used it daily ln making most of our meals.  We didn’t have enough room for both a large air fryer and even just a small microwave.  They would’ve taken up the valuable space i\\on both sides if the corner.First of all, it’s small inside.  Pure stainless steel inside, which might be nice.  But I’m legally blind and having all DD blinds me even more so,  you definitely cannot read all the button, been my husband with perfect vision says so.After having this for a few months, I finally figured out how to work the air fryer!  Yay!  I was able to cook like I did with my old big one, but in smaller quantities.  Nope, it didn’t work out that way.  Anything I made in s the instructions state…what a hoot, it doesn’t work that way either!e likkacthe AF…using AF directions on the packages…everything came out uncooked and very cold.  I followed the directions using the rI’m stuck with a product I hate, being on a fixed income.  It’s only being used for the microwave.Well, it looks like I’ll be saving my money and see if there is a LARGER compacity air fryer/ microwave combo, even if I have to spend twice the money for one, as this one definitely not worth it."
"Called GE and they are supposed to help us, so not feeling as bad, would like to get another one because I LOVED it"
"I would give it a 5 except for the beep. It is so loud. Everything online says how to lower beep on GE microwaves...not this one. A bad way to cut corners for something that most have, and cant be costly to include."
I purchased this because it was supposed to be an air fryer as well and no matter what I cook in it it never turns out properly. It doesn't seem to have the proper circulation for an air fryer to work
The option for the microwave never heated up. The air fryer and conventional oven worked great but had to return the item unfortunately.
"I have had this unit for less than 30 days.First off, no manual was a pain.Second, even with the manual, it's sort of complicated.  I have yet to use the air fryer successfully.  Unless you push the correct buttons quickly, it reverts to microwave function.  I mainly use it for microwave fortunately.  Hopefully I get the hang of airfryer one day.Thirdly I went to use it today and the inside light would not work.  I took the llittle cover off inside but found no bulb.  Nothing in the manual about light. Customer service, GE, transferred me three diff numbers.  What I was finally told was that I would have to return to vendor and the return date would be determined by vendor policy.  GE would replace it, but I would have to buy another one and then apply for a certificate showing I bought a new one.  The GE rep said all small appliances have that policy.  There was no place I could take for a repair at their expense.I'm old and it would entail lots of work to get this returned.  I can't even lift it.Since there is  no backlight on the key pad, a flashlight is necessary anyway.  I guess I'll also use the flashlight to look inside the unit."
"Had all good intentions of using all the features but reverted back to just warming things up. Too difficult to use . Some of the cooking instructions  are counter intuitive, ie air fry using a pan ?? GE really needs to add a back light to the key pad!!!"
"Updated review. At least on our oven, the convection mode does not work.  Following the max time for cookies, cake and brownies, the product remains raw.  The microwave and air fryer mode seem to be okay."
"Money wastedIt takes to long, double the time of my previous air fryer.The $33.00 singler Air fryer from Macy's was a lot better. Shame my wife throw away same day whe got de GE 3-1Convencional oven too slow.Microwave same as others.Only one thing good is very quiet."
TLDR - Had this since March 2024 - Microwave is defective now in November. Power supply issues internally caused it to always show PF ('power failure') on the screen.Worked great for regular functions until it was completely unusable.Enjoyed the air fryer until the power just fluked on and off.There's no hope for it.GE service was quick to let me repurchase and give a credit for the unit but it'll take 6-8 weeks to get the money... Still no 2 stars here because they won't pay interest on the 2 months.... hahaNew model might be better... Will update
"Unable to use the convention feature as described in manual. When setting the preheat up its fine.  But after it warms to desired temperature it beeps, but the door will not open.  Have to remove all the preheat part and even then...it will not allow the time to be set.  Following directions from the manual.  Even had my husband try it, with the same results.  We are not able to set the time but can set temperature.  The reason I bought this was mainly for the convention and I am terribly disappointed.  I purchased the child lock technology one due to the other option to purchase says OLD.  This is one of the hardest units to open.  Very unhappy with this purchase."
"The instructions that come with this microwave are a joke. The QUICKSTART  doesn't tell you much. There is a downloadable manual that's a bit more informative but not by a hell of a lot. I finally got it to work by sheer accident. It  does work pretty good. I have a much older version of this oven that worked flawlessly for years 12 I think. It didn't have the air fray stuff on it like this one does. I suppose that's the reason for the control snafu on it Who Knows? I sure don't. I don't know if I'd recommend this thing or not? It's ease of operation is anything but. Who needs this crap? Why not just write up a good, easy to understand instruction manual with it instead of one that's written by engineers?"
"The air fry feature didn’t work well, leaving food soggy instead of crispy. It also takes longer to cook than expected, and the controls are confusing to navigate."
Didn’t toast up as I thought it would like an oven. And now the open and close door just broke. So it lasted under 2yrs?
"So as the title suggests, this is a decent microwave, if an expensive one. Every other function it advertises is subpar at best. It takes way too long too bake. Everything but microwaving takes almost twice as long.  I had really hoped I could replace both my microwave and my ""every other function except microwave"" cooker with just this one appliance because I have a very small kitchen. But, I prepare and cook most of my meals. So I'm disappointed to say the least. I guess it could work in a dorm foricrowave dinners or an RV for vacation where you wouldn't be cooking much to begin with. Beyond that, don't waste your money."
The control panel does not light up.  Makes it difficult to see and use particularly in low lighted room.  Would not recommend
Absolutely horrible. I wouldn’t call it a User Guide at all.
The microwave and air fryer work as expected but the convection does not.  If you wrap something in tin foil or use a glass dish it will not cook.  It runs but the food does not heat up.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I've had this microwave for less than a year and on the regular microwave setting, it's been catching my food on fire -- even in as little as 10 secs. I've decreased the power level and still the same thing. I've contacted GE and am hoping they can fix it or replace it."
"I needed a microwave (1 star) and wanted another air fryer too. I knew it was too small (-1 star) to do anything worth using the convection feature for. (-1 star)This seemed perfect, but...The air fryer is pretty lousy. (-2 stars)Things just don't get crispy. It's either soggy or has burnt tips.I put a room temperature brioche bun at 400° for 2 mins, which at this setting my other air fryer toasts beautifully with frozen bread. It was still the same room temp. I tried to crisp burnt ends from a Costco pack and it didn't do anything.After realizing I couldn't do anything unless it was at 425° (Max), I still got soggy egg rolls after 10 mins (Directions called for 375° for 8 mins)THAT NOISE!Oh the 'Hot' alert is bad enough, but it just seems like there should be a volume control.IT IS SO LOUD my ears ring.I only kept using it so much to experiment and figure out how to make it work, because I didn't want to have to return it. I even bought air fryer specific items to try out.I can get a bigger microwave for less money. It is going back."
Would not recommend this combo unit!
"I have mixed feelings about this microwave.  The microwave functions fine for microwave cooking.  However I found that the convection, broil, and air-fry all are lacking.  They are all much slower than using other appliances.  I am also concerned that there appears to be no way to clean the splatters from the broil feature off the roof of the microwave.  The manual only talks about cleaning the walls and the floor --- no mention of how to clean the roof.My other complaint is the manual is terrible.  Hard to understand and does not have any recipe suggestions or examples.  I have always found my other GE appliance manuals to be very helpful and well done.  GE should be ashamed of this manual especially because I know they can do better.If you are buying this for the convection, broil, or air fry feature you might look elsewhere."
"It works fine, but all the buttons are not lit up so they all look gray.  I literally have to put on glasses to see the buttons"
"This oven is all right for the price- nothing to write home about. The first thing that struck me is that it feels cheap and won't last near as long as my last oven. The air fryer works, but it takes far longer than most instructions indicate, especially if you're looking for crispy (as in french fries or tater tots). When I follow instructions on French Fires I get nothing but soggy potatoes. It takes 2 to 3 times as long as they indicate (and yes, I have it set at the right temperature).  The microwave part works as expected. It's just that the thing feels cheap. Whenever I close the door I expect something to break! I hope not!!!"
Learned the hard way that the cardboard piece located on the inside right panel should not be removed! The only option is to have a technician come and replace (for more than the cost of the appliance!).
For all its features the longevity isn’t good. Wouldn’t recommend for the money
My item was not working the entire time we tried turning it on and we tried everything and we couldn’t get it to work. It was unusual and unusable.
"Bought Used-Very Good. Was not in good shape at all. Big dent under (I needed to adjust to make it level) and damaged inside. I replaced the 3 little wheels inside (they were Oval instead of round) and iside was all dented. The reason is because the person that packaged the microwave put the glass inside the microwave instead of the place it should go in the protective foam. Maybe I should have return the microwave but I decided to keep and fix.....it's the second one I ordered, first one was new and received also damaged.... Carrier is doing a very bad job (Fedex).Microwave is great so far....I hope you will have better luck than me with transport"
"I got an email from GE asking me to review my purchase. It was mainly positive, except for my mention of not getting much instruction on the features. I didn't even post some of my concerns, but I will do so here: condensation builds up when you use it and I worry it will cause rusting, it takes much longer to cook things than any microwave I've ever owned, the buttons don't light up, so you can't see the writing in the buttins very well, the light inside the microwave is very dim, making it hard to see the food you are cooking."
The item doesn’t come with a manual. Otherwise it works well
"I got this to use while my stove/oven was out of commission and air fryer was packed for my move, it's getting me by, but it's not the air-fryer i was hoping for, their ""crispy pan"" is solid, preventing air from circulating around the food so it's much WETTER than a normal air-fry and i haven't gotten anything to brown or crisp up at all, even experimenting without that pan (baked goods). (yes, I could broil it, but I shouldn't have to!)It also occasionally gets stuck at the ""done!"" beep after non-microwave functions, and won't stop no matter what I press, until i pull the plug. taking a star off for that.But it's doing all things right now, if not necessarily WELL, and the price is similar to a decent regular microwave, so i'll be keeping it...and relegate it back to regular microwave, when i get my regular stove and air fryer set up!  woohoo!"
Air fryer and convection is off by about 75 or 100 degrees F.  I returned one and this second one is the same.  I follow the usage instructions exactly and the cooking instructions for the food exactly and I end up having to cook items for TWICE as long or longer.  Everything else is perfect.  I would NOT buy again.
"It seems to work good. I would use more of the features except there as no feature use guide with it. Also, without lights behind the panel, the controls are virtually not visible unless you bend over and get right in front of the panel. Even then, I have to use a flashlight."
"Buttons are hard to read, should bigger or lighted."
"My old microwave need replacing and I thought this combination  model would be great.  The microwave does work.  However, the lack of instructions on the remaining functions has me regretting  this purchase.  I downloaded and printed the booklet (not included) but find very little actual  usable information..  The so called ""presets""  are not for what I want to make.  No basic,simple recipes.  Complicated  sequence of pushing buttons (that you cannot see without a flashlight!)I have had many GE appliances and have to say this is the first I find lacking."
"This makes them very hard to see, especially in dim light. I also just discovered that the bottom row of buttons don't work. Undfortunately, it is past return date or I definitely would."
the item worked well for 6 months but then the air fryer component caught fire. So don’t leave the room when it is on. Luckily we were there and caught it before any damage to the kitchen was done. I would not recommend buying a microwave with an air fryer component as it’s too risky.
"I’m not sure if I just got a defective product or what, but this microwave lasted exactly 2 years, which is ridiculous for an appliance that should be lasting four times longer than that. The microwave went completely dead. Wouldn’t heat up or turn anymore out of nowhere. Buy something better for your money!"
Buttons are very hard to read.  I have to keep a small light next to the machine.  Especially bad as daylight wanes.
We have had problems with the door and the open button since we got it. Now we can not open the door at all with the button. We hardly use the microwave and now that it is still new but was purchased a few months ago what do we do?
"I bought this for the air frying feature. The airfryer I bought at Walmart works 1000 times better than this microwave. It takes me half the time to air fry something on my countertop airfryer than this microwave. It also broke today, I bought it in March 2024. I bought the extra protection plan but I have to now go through the manufacture to come service it? Instead of a replacement! That is so weird to me! Why buy a protection plan of you have to have the manufacturer come and service it like a car? Its an absolute scam!"
"Works fine as a microwave. It really needs both lighting for the buttons and an instruction book, so I don't have to keep looking up how to cook something without going first to the website manual. When I put chicken on the top rack it started burning before the timer quit. It burns most things I put on the tray on the shorter rack when I use the  degree settings such as baking a slice of pizza or muffins so I have to keep checking it instead of waiting for the timer to complete. I hoped it would also worked to toast bread but apparently it doesn't."
Read above
"It takes forever to cook evenly, and the air fryer function barely works. The overall performance is poor, and it's not worth the space it takes up."
"I dislike the fact that I got no full user's manual with the oven. Only got a quick guide and it directs you to get it online or call an 800 number for a printed copy. When I called the number, I was told there are no printed copies of user's manuals available. I think if you purchase an item that has so many different functions, that a full manual print out should arrive in the package."
Picked this all in one cooking machine to hopefully downsize to one.  Microwave part works well besides alot of condensation when cooking kids mac and cheese bowls.  The broiler works ok as well as the convection oven part.  Our old toaster oven workes better but still decided not to keep it and accept it would take a little longer to cook with this unit.  The air fryer part is a huge disappointment.  Our old air fryer works so much better that we kept it and don't use that function on the microwave combo.  Great concept but unfortunately does not compare to stand alone counterparts.
The chime is highly annoying especially in an apartment. Everything else is similar to other review as it doesn't crisp that great but the chime.....The CHIME!!!
"Bought this in November of last year and now it went from 3 in 1 to just a 1 in 1.  The microwave oven part still works but the air fryer and convection oven part has failed.  it looks like the heating element for the the air fryer and convection oven just went out.  going to see if their warranty service holds up.super disappointing - my family and extended families all used GE appliances and those things just worked and lasted a long time.  I guess the brand just isn't what it used to be.  I'll see if their customer service is what it used to be, if not, brand loyalty goes out the door."
"Listen, I'm not the kind of person to write angry product reviews. I try to be an informed consumer, I research products before buying them, and I try not to assign blame where it isn't deserved. But my experience with this microwave was ridiculous.Setup of the microwave out of the box was painless, pop the rotating tray inside, plug it in, you're good to go. The sensor heating worked well, operation was reasonably quiet, no complaints! ...for four days. On day five when attempting to defrost some hamburger, the microwave stopped working 30 seconds into a cycle and the display said ""H97."" A quick look in the user manual said of this error simply: Contact Panasonic Support. And here my troubles began.Panasonic's support website is labyrinthine, and does not list a support phone number. The first point of contact I could find was a live support chat. Clicking on the support chat link gave me a DNS error saying that the server could not be reached. I eventually figured out that the support chat line is only operated from Monday to Friday during Eastern Seaboard business hours, and outside of those hours they just... turn off the web server? Keep in mind that this is an international consumer electronics giant.Attempt #2 was when I found a separate page on the Panasonic website for making a service/repair request. Emailing the repair request email generated an automated email saying that I would get a reply within 48 hours. 48 hours later, I received an email telling me to call their support phone number, the one that was not listed anywhere on their website. But whatevs, I passed their first temple guard and now I had the magic number. I called the number, an automated voice told me that I could expect  a 30 minute wait before hearing a human voice, and that I might be charged a $9.95 service fee just for calling them(!?). Ok, I'll fight that battle when I get there. I follow through a nesting doll of ""Press 1 for X, Press 2 for Y,"" until I get to a menu for ""Consumer Microwaves that display an H97 error."" Jackpot! I Press 1. The automated response is, ""Visit the service request webpage to submit a repair request ticket. Have a nice day.""Listen, I'm not a luddite who is scared of phone robots. I know they serve a useful function by funneling calls to the appropriate channels of large corporations with millions of customers. But this particular phone robot made me want to travel back in time to 1995 and kill Dr. Myles Dyson before he can invent Skynet.I return to the computer the next day and try the support chat once more, making sure that I'm doing it during ""banker's hours."" The website does work this time, and I'm connected with what I'm fairly convinced was a human being. After asking the basic support questions, ""model number, when did you buy it, did you try turning it off and on again,"" I was given this stupendous piece of advice. By a paid human employee. Of the Panasonic Corporation, formerly Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd., established 1918.""I suggest you just return it to Amazon for a refund and buy another one.""Listen, I believe in science. I feel I know enough about electronics manufacturing to understand that sometimes, every once in a while, an appliance or device can be shipped with a defect, a bad inverter or a weak fuse. I know that my experience with Panasonic microwaves is not going to be a universal experience. Someone else's Panasonic microwave might last for twenty years without a lick of trouble. But know that if you ever do experience a problem with your Panasonic microwave, and if you attempt to seek support from the Panasonic Corporation, you will be drawn into a Kafkaesque customer service nightmare that will make you want to brick yourself up in the wall of a Catholic Church and become an anchorite.I did return it to Amazon. I did receive a refund. I'm not buying another one."
"This review is for the NN-SN67KS.  I was on the fence based on some of the reviews, but had to see for myself whether or not such a highly rated microwave was worth the trade-offs, price premium, and risk of failures.  Was the inverter technology so life changing that I could put up with some of the negative points others brought up?  Were the concerns even real?  Here’s what I found.2.4GHz wifi interference:  I was a bit skeptical, thinking there must have been something unique about the situations of reviewers that reported loss of wi-fi signal while this microwave was operating.  Well, sure enough, while the microwave was running, here are some things I noticed. 1) my wireless IP security camera lost signal; 2) the video streaming to my google Chromecast got pixelated then paused and buffered; and 3) our wireless baby monitor (not network connected) lost signal.  To be clear, these devices mentioned were all wirelessly connected via 2.4GHz.  All devices that were connected via 5GHz (phone, iPad, etc.) were not affected at all.  I can see this not being an issue at all If you only use fairly new devices and phones.Clock button:  A couple users complained of having to set/re-enter the time every time they accidentally pressed the ‘clock’ button.  Apparently, it was too easy to accidental hit the ‘clock’ button since it was right next to the ‘0’.  This is a non-issue.  If you accidentally hit the ‘clock’ button, you don’t have to re-enter the time.  Just press ‘stop/reset’ button.  This will cancel it and the time will show up again.Beep:  It’s all perspective, but in my opinion, this had the least obtrusive and lowest volume “done cooking” beeps of all the microwaves I've ever heard.  5 short beeps.  (long beeps always sound like they’re yelling at me).  Note that opening the door will not stop the beeping.  If you really wanted to, you can turn off all beeping sounds coming from this microwave, but you can only access this option when you first plug it in (or you can unplug and re-plug it in).  Without pressing any other buttons first, press the ‘start’ button twice to access the option.  Then the ‘timer’ button will allow you to cycle between on and off.  Pg 11 of the manual covers this.  Note that this will turn off all beeps including button presses.Light:  In my opinion, it is on the dim side.  The light itself is decently bright, but the problem is that it doesn’t cast a wide beam and there are defined shadowed sections where the light doesn’t hit.  And while the dark grey interior gives it a modern look, it doesn’t reflect light like the more common white interiors, which makes matters worse.  Not a deal breaker alone, but something that I had to get used to.Keypad buttons:  - I found that this unit require noticeably harder keypad button presses.  Coming from a unit with a more responsive keypad, it was a slight annoyance to have to pay attention to whether the keypress registered and whether I needed to shift my finger slightly or press harder.Other thoughts:-  Of all the microwaves I’ve owned, this required the lightest touch to close the door.  It follows that it also had the quietest latching sound.  Overall, the mechanical build quality is top notch.- No one button start.  Even the ‘Quick 30s’ button requires you to press the ‘start’ button.  This was a big negative for me having come from a microwave that had one button start for 30sec as well as 1-6 minute cook times.  But I knew this going in and thought it might be a small price to pay to have the inverter experience.-  No flat plug.  I used a 1ft flat plug “extension” cord since I needed it to sit against the wall with an outlet behind it.  I posted a pic of the space behind the microwave.  There are plastic standoffs that space the microwave a bit from the wall, but there’s zero chance the included straight plug will fit.-  Another thing I noticed is that porcelain dinner plates and plastic splatter covers got much hotter (with the same temperature food) than with my previous microwave.  I suspect this is related to the inverter technology.  The thermal images in their marketing product pictures also seem to show a higher temperature mug, so probably not just my imagination.After 3 weeks of wanting to love it, ultimately, I ended up returning the unit.  The little compromises just added up to be too much to put up with.  After having to give up one button start, the additional trade offs of 1) the wifi interference, 2) keypad effort and 3) needing oven mitts to remove hot plates (a little exaggeration, but I certainly considered it on many occasions) was just a little too much.  Who knows, maybe if I heated more frozen foods that tend to have cold spots (rather than just reheating refrigerated leftovers), perhaps the inverter technology would have been more life changing.  Or maybe I'm missing the fact that it's all about the sensor cooking (which I didn't use) instead of the inverter technology.  For whatever reason, people seem to love this microwave (Panasonics are also highest rated by Consumer Reports).  But for me, it was just ok.  In the end, this unit just made me realize what a major convenience it was to have one button start (specifically 1-6 minute).  Anyway, good luck with your decision.  I hope this review was helpful."
"If the oven is in use for a few minutes, it's fine, but any longer and the top heats up. I replaced it thinking that it was just an issue with the one I have. The replacement oven was the same, yet when asking the question to other users regarding the overheating of the top, they mentioned that it just got warm. Yes, it does get warm, but if you're cooking for an extended period of time, it does get quite hot.The child lock feature is a nuisance, and every time the power goes out, you have to deactivate the lock again along with setting up the clock etc. If you, by chance, accidently hit the start button twice, the oven locks up. You have to unplug the oven and go through all the setting up procedures, including the deactivating of that annoying child lock feature.Other than the issues mentioned, the oven works well, but it's a far cry from the quality and features of my previous Braville oven. Love to have purchased another Braville, but couldn't afford to, so I went with this less expensive Panasonic. I'll most like get two years out of the Panasonic where I got close to ten years with the Braville. In the long run the Braville is the cheaper option, but when funds are short, you have to go with what you can afford at the time, but I know from past experience with appliances, the cheaper model turns out to be the more expensive choice in the long run as you have to replace them more often. So, my advice, for what it's worth. If you can afford a better oven, then go for it."
"I bought this to replace a panasonic I had for over decade.  I would give the earlier one I had five stars and I wanted a similar sized panasonic.  I decided to pay a little more money for the inverter model.  The new one is definitely not as good as the old one I had.- The touch buttons are not as easy to use, especially if your fingers are wet- There isn't a one touch quick start (which some may consider a good thing...)- The heating capacity is slightly lower even though they are rated the same power. So it takes longer to heat- The interior light is a higher temperature white than in any other kitchen appliance I've used. It is quite annoying on the eye.- I've also discovered that I didnt need the inverter since I rarely use the low power mode. But that's on me,Other than that, it seems to work well and has a sleeker appearance than my previous one."
"Purchased this microwave to replace one that was 6 years old and suddenly stopped working. The first few months this one was great, but the door became increasingly difficult to close. That was a minor annoyance that we could live with. After a few more months, we would enter the time and touch start and nothing would happen. We'd have to touch ""reset"", reenter the time and start. Another minor annoyance, but we could live with that, too. More recently, when we entered the time and touched start, it would simply begin to count down, but not heat anything. To work around this, we had to unplug the microwave, wait a minute, replug, and start over. This is a greater inconvenience, because not only did it take more time, but the clock needs to be reset each time. This scenario was happening more and more often until today. Today, I had to unplug and plug multiple times, each time allowing it to remain unplugged for a longer and longer period of time and it still wouldn't work. Finally, after letting it sit unplugged for about 10 minutes, I plugged it back in and tried one more time and it did work. This is beyond an annoyance, it's unacceptable, so I'm having to replace a microwave that we've had for just under 18 months."
"I normally don't do too many reviews but if you're like me and you scour the review section for purchases like this, then I feel I should report back on a few weird issues with this microwave. I bought this to replace my favorite microwave of all time, which isn't manufactured anymore, so I had high hopes it would be sort of as good as the one I had. I plan to get rid of this when I can and find a different one.To me, this microwave feels cheaply made. It arrived in pristine condition, the box was strong and intact, no damage at all, looked good setting it up but it felt lighter than our previous one.It doesn't heat evenly. Even with taking care to prep left-overs, not heating things in blocks but stirring the food from time to time. There are weird cold spots right next to a burning hot spot. Baked potatoes have uncooked sections.The push latch to open the door takes a few tries. It's not broken, it's just cheap?The 30-second button can only be used once, meaning, you can't add an additional 30 seconds to whatever your heating. You have to either let the 30 seconds run down, or hit stop and hit 30 seconds again.It's loud. I hadn't realized how quiet our other one was until we got this one. But I can hear it running 2 rooms away, and even upstairs.It makes our kitchen lights flicker for a second, not all the time, but once in a while when I turn it on, the ceiling light flickers. That's prob something related to our electrical wiring, but nothing has ever done that before, and we use professional electricians to code, so don't know.It disrupts bluetooth signal. This is a BIG deal to me. Devices near the microwave when it's running will glitch out. I wear my airpods a lot, and they glitch and go in and out when i'm standing near the microwave (when it's running). My husband uses different earbuds, and his buds completely lose connection. You can bet I researched this bc it's freaky to walk in front of it and your buds make a loud record-scratch noise. Apparently, microwaves and bluetooth use the same frequency and interference can be a common thing - not a good thing - but not unheard of. It's evidence of a leak - and that makes me feel WEIRD. It's probably fine healthwise, but it's a strange feeling to have to stand away from the microwave because it's leaking. I know there's a certain FDA allowance for that - but still.The door is oddly not opening all the way. I can push it all the way open, but it's an extra nudge past where it normally wants to stop halfway open. Again, doesn't feel broken, or misaligned or unseated somehow. Just cheap.I don't think we got a lemon and I don't think it's broken. But buyer beware on this one."
"Overall it works fine but we missed two features available in the old Sharp carousel replaced by this Panasonic microwave:1. Continuous ready alertThe old Sharp carousel beeps when cooking is over and continue beeping until the food is taken out from the appliance. The Panasonic only beeps once when the cooking is over, which sometimes is easy to miss (e.g. went to check the laundry).2. Express cookThe old Sharp carousel had this time saving feature where one just presses a number and cooking starts right way. No need to press anything else not even the start button. For example, just press 2 to start cooking right away for 2 minutes.With this Panasonic microwave, one has to press 2, 0, 0 and then start button."
"Controls are overly complicated , safety lock feature is very frustrating as is the lack of a key pad that allows user to set heating time .You have choices of 30 seconds, 1 minute and 10 minute reheat only . If you want to heat something for 4 minutes & 30 seconds you have to do 5 separate steps to get there plus pushing start , clear and unlock ."
"I just purchased this model to replace my older Panasonic. The ""open' large button on the lower right (to open the oven ) is not solid. It moves back and forth a bit to either side, so can anyone tell me if this particular one is defective? If so I need to return it immediately. My older inverter was solid on the oven frame. Cant speak to a human at Panasonic and the AI help on website is no help about this. Thanks!"
It is an inexpensive appliance that works while....while it works.  Almost four years later we're looking for a new one.  They just don't make them the way they used to.
"I only had the microwave for a month and its working fine so far, but there are two main issues: dim light and door lock feature. I can deal with the dim light, but the door lock is just too much of annoyance. Every time after microwave use, the lock door (zero button) would need to be pressed first and the door opening button. This is extremely annoying as I'm used to just hitting the door button and opening and keep doing it by habit to only get frustrated. The unfortunate thing is that there is no way to suppress it.I see this as useless design figure that brings no value at all.Also, the grey writings on the buttons are difficult to see for older folks like myself."
Had microwave less than a year and the auto lock started to fail. I have to open and slam door for the lock to operate. Sometimes more than once.
Only had unit about a month but I wish I had returned it. It is the noisiest appliance I've ever owned.It has performed as well as expected so I have no complaints in that area. But it has taken a little while to realize just how noisy the fan/ventilation system is. We literally can hardly hear each other speaking while the unit is running. I wanted to return it but the wife doesn't want to be without a microwave for a few days.I recommend you evaluate the noise level yourself and decide whether you want it for the long term.
"Good quality, but we bought the wrong model.  The control panel does not facilitate ease of use."
"Bought this solely for the mute function. But to heat something for, say, 3 minutes, you have no choice but to hit 3-0-0-start. Every single time. Silly me, I thought microwaves were about quick and convenient. Who's gonna tell Panasonic??*Probably* retuning it."
"Here is the chronology of my experience with three different models of panasonic microwaves, including this model.I had a circa 2007 version of today's panasonic NN-SN966S-1.6cu (sorry, I don't remember if the model number was the same in 2007) which ran  absolutely fine till October, 2014. I had to recycle it since it rusted from inside, otherwise no technical issues. I was pretty happy with that product and so went for panasonic again.In October 2014, I got a NN-SA661S-1.2cu from WalMart at $110. This one failed in August 2015  with error code H98 (i.e failure in Magnetron circuit). Luckily, it was under the 1-year limited warranty so the Magnetron was replaced by panasonic service center with free labor & parts.  In July 2017, it failed again with error code H98. Since it is no longer under warranty, so I dumped it this time.Next, I wanted to buy a better one which would last longer, and I landed up in NN-SN686S. It looked a bit premium than the earlier model, so I wanted to give a shot at panasonic again. We got this one from amazon at $141 in August 2017. After 14 months, it failed last week (20th October 2018) with error code H98. Our usage is pretty light (not used for cooking but only for warming foods) and we maintained it well, so didn't expect it to fail so soon. I called up Panasonic customer care to check if they would cover the repair, because Magnetron is under 5 year warranty (but labor is limited to 1 year). The automated voice assistant said that it will charge $10 for any out-of-warranty products. I was fine with that too, but panasonic customer care never landed me to a human.  I tried with panasonic support live chat, which does not work at all. Basically don't expect any customer support from panasonic. So, I called up the panasonic service center which is now located 20 miles away. They said Magnetron is covered but labor will be $65 and they accept carry-in for repairs only Mon-Wed. I haven't decided yet if I would take this route....Neverthless, it seems none of the recent panasonic models run longer than 12-15 months. There is definitely a durability issue of the magnetrons. So, if you want to buy a panasonic microwave, consider it as 1 year investment (i.e the warranty period of panasonic).Here is  an update. The panasonic service center charged $25 to diagnose the issue. The inverter is burnt out completely. The inverter is not covered by warranty and the price to replace it is additional  is $162. The total cost $162 + $25 = 187 is more than the price of the microwave. The inverted burnt out which is not covered by warranty. So I dumped it. Will never buy Panasonic in my lifetime."
"Used very good description included a statement of no scratches.  Scratch and dent are front and center on this unit, right above the Panasonic logo on the door.Microwave performance is excellent.  Replaced a Panasonic which lasted over 15 years of daily use.Disappointed in advertising by Amazon,  a lesson in overpaying for an item that should have been sold at a greater discount."
"One might think that anything made by Panasonic would be dependable and reliable. Not the case for me with this microwave unit. My previous microwave worked well for years and was intuitive and simple to operate. I returned this one because it failed both tests. It worked well for a week or two but then began failing to come on when I followed the same procedure I had used since it arrived. If I monkeyed around with buttons I could sometimes get it to work but not always, and I never did figure out what the right combination of buttons did the trick. Perhaps the microwave is defective, but it is possible I failed to understand the process I suppose, but I doubt it.  Also; my eyes are not real great so I had a lot of trouble reading the gray labels on the black background of the control panel. I see a lot of device using this same design and someone needs to inform the manufacturers about the problem this creates, especially for older adults like me.  Oh... that someone is ME I guess. Are you listening designers???"
"Initially I was really looking forward to a new microwave as my other one bit the dust.  Hubby said to “get a Panasonic”.  This one looked perfect, until I tried to use it.  With extra buttons to press, it quickly became a nuisance plus the buttons are hard to press!  If I don’t pressed them hard enough it won’t work, but when I do the microwave moves on the counter!  Like another reviewer, there are too many choices which just makes the “add 30 seconds” easier, but sometimes I just want a reheat and not a high heat.Today makes me worry about its safety.  I microwaved a frozen meal that I do quite often for just 4 minutes on high (and I could even add another minute if needed).  When I removed it, the carrots were Burned half black!!  (I should have taken a picture of the whole dinner but just picked out the burned carrots then later went back and took a photo.)  And it smelled burned!  What a bummer!  My official return date was 3 weeks ago and I didn’t purchase any warranty other than the one it came with.  If this issue had happened sooner, I could have gotten it taken care of.  Not sure if I should use it again, but I need it everyday!My husband and I are seniors and it looks like I’ll be buying another one soon.  Bottom line, even if it didn’t quit working properly I still would not recommend it due to the buttons so hard to press."
"I have a cutout in my kitchen that perfectly fit my broken microwave.  Unfortunately, I didn't have too many options because of that fact.  Consumer Reports say that Panasonic was one of the better microwaves out there so that is why I looked for the brand.  Sadly, the dimensions are very misleading and inside the microwave is a small capacity.  The sound when in use is not too loud and that is the same for the alarm when setting the timer.  You won't hear the timer in another room.  I reviewed the instructions and the power level needs to be reset every time depending on the food.  Also, I thought it wouldn't bother me but setting the heating time is really a pain.  You have to press too many buttons to set the time you want.  The button to open the door requires no pressure on a couple occasions, I thought it was broken.  I am pretty sure that the door close button will be the first to go.  I didn't return it because I use the microwave for reheating only and it is not a major appliance for my kitchen.  It is an OK microwave and I am on the fence if I would ever recommend this brand/model.The dimensions for the exterior of the unit are 20 1/8 inch wide, 13 3/4 inch deep, and 12 inches from feet to the top.  There product description has 2 other dimensions noted, not the same as the product I received."
"First, it's a microwave and it makes our food hot.1) It's LOUD. Our last microwave (GE) was half as noisy. There is no secret if someone is using this one.2) The ""Quick 30"" button still needs you to hit start after hitting it. The last microwave was a one button push - it was was truly a quick 30 seconds.3) When you hit ""1"" or ""2"" (3,4, etc.) the last microwave would automatically accept the time as 1 minute, 2 minutes, etc. This microwave you must enter 100, or 200, etc. I just don't like all the extra button pushing with this model.I'm not trying to sound like a lazy bum who doesn't like to push buttons, but I don't! It's a microwave and it should be super simple. (Or more simple than it is.) Not to mention how loud it is.  Now that I think about it, it might get returned..."
"My use of a microwave oven is mostly for defrosting frozen food.  Fast and evenness in heating are the most important and the main criteria for selecting when buying this microwave.  I don't understand why the Panasonic microwave would be advertised as if power and evenness in heating is the most important feature of the product.  As it turned out, it is the opposite in actual use.  When defrosting frozen raw meat before cooking, it invariably gets a corner or the bottom cooked whereas other parts are still hard frozen.I did a test.  Break a raw egg in a bowl, add some water and whisk, to make a thin jelly.  The result is, no matter what, I simply could not get an evenly cooked egg jelly.  I thought the power level was too high, so set it low and stretched the time of heating, but the result is always overcooked on the edge around but the center is still liquid and never congeal.The same with heating, say, a refrigerated (i.e., not frozen) bowl of stew.  After heating, the bowl is so hot it burns my hand and I have to use a towel to take it out.  But when eating, the center is found to be still cold.Therefore sensor cooking and evenness of heating is not true as advertised.  Before this one I used a cheap microwave but evenness of heating was better than this Panasonic.  The solution is to defrost for a shorter time and do not open the door but leave the meat inside for some time to let the remaining heat inside the oven to gradually spread to the entire piece of meat (but this is not fast).  Or get the meat half defrosted in the microwave, then take the meat out and put it in warm water.  Or when defrosting fish, do not use microwave at all but warm water only.  These solutions are true of all brands of microwave I have used.  So Panasonic, weaker in even heating, please do not advertise sensor cooking and even heating."
"We have purchased several Panasonic microwaves over the years and have been most pleased. This new one is fine except that working the control buttons is quite a challenge. You cannot go from one setting to another without hitting reset. In addition, the setting buttons are not very responsive to touch. For this reason we have been dissatisfied."
"You must be able to comfortably see the control panel to make it usable and functional.I was anxious to try the inverter features, but had to drive 40 miles to a UPS store to return it.I ordered the 1.6 to replace it and was just informed that it's also too dark and difficult to read. This SHOULD be an easy fix by the manufacturer. Another 40 mile trip ahead. Not happy!"
"Update 12/1/2023: Had a discussion with Panasonic today after now also getting a H97 error code when I decided to try the unit again after a ""reboot"".  Not surprisingly, they couldn't/wouldn't support the failed unit and even told me that the 5 year warranty on parts would ONLY be honored if they found the magnetron was defective.  Since there is no way to know without spending money and time on getting the unit to a repair center and the labor of troubleshooting what is wrong only to likely find out it could be something else, I give up.  Buyer beware, it's a shame since when it works it worked well!Original review 11/30/2023:We had a kitchen remodel with a new cabinet dedicated to the size of this particular model microwave (depth in particular).  It worked well and looked nice, but today (2 years almost to the day of first use) the magnetron must have failed because it stopped heating completely.  Went through the manufacturer troubleshooting instructions and even a few other checks of my own but it just won't heat anymore and the unit stops ""cooking"" before the timer finishes even though the unit is still on (oven light and fan work just fine for instance).  It's out of labor warranty but is still within parts warranty but who can spend the time to drive 60 miles away to the nearest service center to probably wait weeks/months for the repair and still pay the labor charge for an appliance that is used several times a day!?  So because of the fit in my cabinet I have little choice but to buy the same unit over again and hope for better reliability this time around!  Maybe Panasonic has done some updates in the past couple years."
Powerful but bit noisy. Buttons could be easier and more consistent to operate. Funny how you have to push stop/reset after cooking cycle has ended before you can enter new cooking cycle
You have to push the number keys very hard to get the microwave to work. It moves from front to back when you push the keys because you have to press so hard. It does not heat as quickly as the older Panasonic I had.  I am tempted to get the old one from the carport and keep using it.  I believe this was a used product even though it was labeled as new when it was ordered. I plan to return it.Bernice
"Apparently, you cannot use both the timer and the oven at the same time - terrible design flaw  The oven is also quite noisy, and the light inside is aimed in a very odd fashion so that it blinds you when looking into the oven.  The number pad also requires too much force to operate.  The only reason I purchased this oven is because the 17"" depth was a requirement."
"I ordered this product to replace my NN-SU686S Panasonic microwave, because I had cracked the front glass.  I was perfectly happy with that microwave.So, I started the hunt and read all reviews and tried to make the best choice and select something the same, if not better than my NN-SU686S.  Listed below are the things I am unhappy with:* Interior light is too dim to light up the interior.* Interior is gray, which makes it all the more dark.  (I really prefer a white interior.)* Led display - This is a COUNTER height microwave, but when standing in front of it and viewing the LED display, the characters at the top of the screen are cut off.  I have to lean down and get my head more level with the display to see the tops of the numbers.* Button to open the door is loosey goosey* It runs rather loudly* Even though my previous microwave was 1100 watts and this is 1200 watts, this new microwave takes longer to heat the same items* When an item completes heating (time runs out), when I check the item and close the door and press the keys to add more time, it will not allow me to do this.  Instead, I have to actually press ""clear"" to enter the new time, even though the previous cycle was successfully completed.  Extra key strokes...many times a day...really adds up.I do like that the sides are silver and the front design is attractive.  Also, it has a smaller exterior but the same interior size as my old microwave, which is great.I wanted to return it the first day...but I have decided to try and get used to it.  The reason for the review is so that the Panasonic peeps might pay attention to these serious flaws.  Next time...I will make sure I watch for these problems before buying."
"The microwave is cheaply made, especially the door which is very light and has to be pushed hard to close.  Sometimes when I start it the countdown starts but the fan and microwave don’t come on. Would not buy again."
I purchased for our small office. It was purchased on Dec. 1 2023. It now trips the breaker on every outlet I plug it into. Now I have to buy a new on. Riduculous.
Keyboard is not lit and difficult to see. Activation is difficult and I have to use my finger nuclke to activate the button. Pressing it hard enough to activate the switch moves the end and it constantly needs to be repositioned.
I bought this almost 4 years ago and not long after the digital numbers went. I could live with that although I do see other reviews stating the same issue - they should fix the issue.Tonight it almost caught on fire. As you can see in the picture it burned a hole straight through the metal place in the side of the microwave and there is some kind of rust or something on the door. Thank goodness I was right there and not one of kids who wouldn’t have gotten to it in time .Panasonic you need to do better. I have never had a microwave not only underperform this bad but also almost have an electrical fire in the appliance itself.Don’t  take a chance on this microwave. There are plenty of other brands to choose from
"I bought this microwave from Panasonic since October 5, last year, but never submit any review yet. When I got this problem, I put an empty container and ran microwave for only 1 min. for sanitize purpose. HONESTLY, IT'S ONE MINUTE EXACTLY, NO FOOD AT ALL! A sticker of cook instruction at the bottom burned, and caused damaging at door which made from plastic material. At that time I was shocked how did it happen ? Because I'm doing like this with other microwave such as SHARP, GE, etc. They never cause issue like this.After I got this issue from defected material, I tried to contact Panasonic's support at website. It only told me to bring microwave to some service centers of Panasonic. I picked one of them, dropped my microwave for repairing at A-1 TV about June 27, 2023. Then, I was waiting until today (Aug 8, 2023), I was calling to ask about my repair process. He said ""Panasonic is thinking it was caused from food burn which is not covered in warranty. This issue never happen before"" I'm so frustrated with this conclusion from Panasonic. Even it is the first time of issue, everything can be possibly happened though.I think Panasonic doesn't want to accept about defective material on their product, and try to blame to customer's fault. It's easier to save money in their pocket without customer care, isn't it? Panasonic isn't worried about customer's satisfaction, or even after-sale services. They just want to SELL SELL SELL, and TAKING MONEY, after that CLOSE THEIR DOOR. That's it.I'm not sure whether this model is flagship product line, or not. I think it's pretty high tier of Panasonic's microwave line. Because I paid $249.95. When I bought it, I expected high-end microwave to be fulfilled until the end. However it's damaged not even in one year. DISAPPOINTED A LOT. I won't buy any product from Panasonic in US again"
I bought this expecting that for the price I would get at least 5 years out of it. I got about half of that and then I got a sparking fire when heating something in a glass bowl.
"First impressions are not great.  We'll be keeping it because my girl wants to keep it, so hopefully over time this microwave oven will grow on me.1. Cannot interrupt 'done' beeping -  Why does this alert need to keep going after the door is opened?  It does not, but due to bad/lazy programming, here we are (sometimes you want to use the microwave QUIETLY)2.  No Backlit buttons - I thought maybe two hundred dollars would be enough to have backlit buttons, but no.  Instead we get a machine designed in 1993 by engineers sitting in bright fluorescent rooms, unable or unwilling to comprehend that people don't always want or need all those lights on.  Get ready to turn on those lights!3. Terrible control panel color contrast - the color scheme here is best described as ""silver on chrome"", which may sound ridiculous, and that's because it is.  Very difficult to see even in daylight hours.  Basic UI design dictates an acceptable level of color contrast for text but these principles were cast aside in the name of aesthetics.4. Loud - louder than the old one.  I did not subtract stars for this because personally I don't really care, but be aware.So all in all, not a great first impression.  Will update after regular use with my thoughts."
Very Loud
"I like the size and the way the microwave & inverter combination heats the food evenly (except potatoes).On the not-so-good side, this device is loud and it will not fully cook a potato."
"First, it is not a powerful microwave. It works fine, but it heats the dishes hotter than the food.I have been microwaving my bowls for years with other microwaves. They are glazed ceramic. Every time I put these in defrost they bleed some weird brown goo that I never saw before this microwave...I can't imagine this is a good thing... They do it every time. It's really gross. Yeah, I can use other bowls, but why do I have to change all my dishes for a microwave?? Makes me reconsider using a microwave at all at this point..."
my first Panasonic just died after 10 years of trouble free operations.  this one took me and my daughter over 3 hours to figure on to turn it on and then we had tried so many variations of pushing buttons it got confusing. I am 78 years old with a heart condition. I bought this based on my previous model which was the same as this. this one you can not push 45 and start like on the old one in order to heat something up quickly and it is frustrating to have to remember to unlock the door so it will open. the manual gives no practical help plus no support number to call. you need to be a patience person to figure this one out.
"So, apparently, when reheating leftover food, there are 3 different categories and power levels that should be used.Use P10 (HIGH) when reheating liquids.*Use P7 (MED-HIGH) for MOST FOODS.Use P6 (MEDIUM) for dense foods.For defrosting, use P3 (MED-LOW).*If the power level is not adjusted per these categories, the food will cook unevenly.*If these categories exist, then which category does the “Sensor Reheat” button use? The only options for Sensor Reheat is “More time”, “Less time”, or “Normal time”. So, power levels and food type doesn’t matter when using the “Sensor Reheat” function. It don’t matter if you’re reheating liquid, most food, or dense food.*This is why the food heats unevenly. This requires too much thinking in order to get it right.What about foods that include both liquid and meat? What exactly does MOST FOODS mean? I finally understand why the sensor reheat function never worked after having 3 Panasonic Inverter Microwaves. I am finally done."
"This microwave was not packaged properly. The parts were just thrown inside the microwave,  the inside of the microwave had food in it, the packing cellophane was gone and the cord was loose."
"I bought this for my mom, and it's a perfectly adequate microwave. She likes the sleek front, with no handle. However, it is NOISY!!"
"The flat touchscreen is a silvery color with really small ( for a microwave ) numbers in an off-white color. They were very difficult for my husband and I to see and when the sun was shining through the window  absolutely impossible. Some instructions were ridiculous-- "" push the button 7 times for 70 percent etc"" -- i did figure out to just push 7, but still. I never did figure out how to make the child lock stay off -- we don't need it and it and it was a pain. It did cook well the few times we used it but just a pain to deal with And then when we returned it Amazon put our refund money on an Amazon gift card, not back into our account we had used to pay for it!  So I can't use that money to get a different one elsewhere! Not pleased at all."
"Have only had it a few days, so haven't used extensively for food prep. Not a simple process, and the instruction booklet is lacking in basic information.  After using, can't open the door unless the 0 is pressed first!  It will suffice."
"The microwave runs okay.  What I dislike, and dislike so much I returned it, and gave it 1 star, is that the controls buttons are hard to use.  1. The control buttons are printed in light gray on a medium gray background.  I was unable to read the controls buttons without using a flashlight. That alone makes it annoying to use.  2. the ""Quick 30"" button on most microwaves will turn on the microwave and run it for 30 seconds.  On this panasonic, ""quick 30""  puts in 30 seconds of time for you, but It does not run the microwave.  You have to push start after pressing ""quick 30"".  3. The ""more"" and ""less"" buttons on most microwaves will add or remove say 10 seconds to the current run time. But on the panasonic, ""More"" and ""less"" don't do anything."
This listing and the photos of the product are deceptive. The model we received from this listing has an unlock control on the 0 button. What this means is after you've cooked something you can't just open the door you have to press 0 before you open the door. It took a while to figure out why the door wasn't opening. But I don't want to have to go through a child lock process every single time I put something in the microwave. Recommendation is to find a different model. There is zero documentation about this stupid unlock requirement just to open the door.
"I never write reviews but I don’t want anyone to waste money on this like I did. My husband bought this for me for Christmas and it’s already stopped working. That’s less than five months and we don’t use it excessively or anything like that. It gets used maybe 3 times a week for normal things (steaming veggies, heating leftovers, etc) It already stopped working on me once at the 3 month mark and after viewing various troubleshooting tips and websites, I was able to get it to work. It worked for another month then today quit working completely. I don’t recommend wasting your money on this at all!!I wanted to add that it was still under warranty so I reached out to the company and that was another issue in itself. First off, they had told me that they only had one facility in Texas that handled the repairs of their smaller appliances. I was fine with that, so they shipped me an empty box so that I could ship the product back to them. The address that they were having me ship it to however was in Florida and I ended up having to call them again to verify that it was going to the right place because I was told there was only one facility in Texas. I was informed it had been moved to Florida. I sent the product back in the middle of May. I never received any type of confirmation or anything from them that they even received it. Months went by with no word from them. I didn’t even know if it had made it to the right place. We eventually just broke down and bought a $50 Hamilton Beach microwave because we weren’t sure when ours would be back or if it even would be coming back. One day in November I came home to a big package and it was the microwave. I plugged it in to make sure it actually was fixed and then stuck out in storage because at that point we already had the other microwave and it was working great. I just wanted add a warning to people about my experience with the warranty process. I will never not another product from this company. It’s just been a bad experience all around."
"This microwave worked well for a few months. Then, something inside it started smoking and filled the kitchen with the smell of fried electronics. We were past our Amazon return window but well within the one-year warranty. Unfortunately, if you live within 50 miles of a service center - and we are almost an hour's drive from the closest one - you must drive it there in person. You can only mail it in if you are farther than 50 miles from a Panasonic service location, and then, they want you to have the original box. I don't usually leave negative reviews, but I wanted to share my experience, especially because Panasonic used to be a trusted name. In this microwave, they  have created a product that works well enough early on to generate positive reviews but will not last even a year - and protected themselves with an  unrealistic warranty that makes repair unusable."
"I have had it for 11 days now (arrived 3/31/20).  Old microwave pooped out during the shelter in place orders, so I ordered this microwave online.  Arrived and had a pretty dim display and on about day 3 the display went almost black to barely visible when looking at the display at just the right angle.  Making do with the microwave for now, and hope to have it serviced when possible.  Other than the display, it works.  Tempted to just open it up and solder that lose connection, but don't want to void the warranty.  Disappointed that connection was so poorly done that I assume it shook lose during shipping.Update:  Went to Panasonic website to look up servicer in my area and link for searching for that is broken.  Emailed customer service since I was contacting in the afternoon on Pacific time and they were on east coast time and closed.  Email answered by bot since it was obvious a person didn't read because it just sent me a general reply containing the broken link that I referenced as broken in my email.  About to call customer service but 6/25/20 the display comes on out of the blue fully bright.  This is definitely making me question the wiring in the display.  I imagine the display will hold out just until the warranty will be up."
"I replaced my 10 year old Sharp Carousel 1100 watt when it started making noise and heating unevenly with this Panasonic. Needing at least 1100 watts I was happy to find this unit as it was one of the few 1100-1200 watt compact countertop units in a 12 x 20 x 15 size available. After reading the manual and placing the new microwave, I couldn't wait to try it. I have these whole grain  Kodiak muffins that cook in one minute in their own cup. After adding water and stirring, I put it in the microwave and set it at full power for 1 minute. I was immediately assaulted by a noise that sounded like a screaming tornado in a wind tunnel. This can't be right, but I left the muffin in for the allotted minute. When removed I noticed it was still liquid in the center and the cup was very hot on the bottom & cool on the top. I made these all the time in my old 1100 watt Sharp and they always tasted and came out great. I let the cup sit to hopefully continue baking, but it never happened. The muffin stayed raw in the center and the cooked part tasted awful. At 1200 watts, this microwave should have outperformed my 1100 watt Sharp, but it didn't. It may be defective, I don't know. The wind noise was so loud I left the kitchen thinking it might blow up. It actually sounded and acted like the Sharp I was replacing due to suddenly acquired noise and failure to heat properly.  Before giving up and sending it back, I'll try calling Panasonic and see what they can do. I have had Panasonic's before and this unit was recommended by several sources. It's nice looking , has insufficient lighting, but mostly , I just wish it worked."
"Bought this microwave in September 2023. In June 2024 the interior light went out. There is no visible way to replace it; Panasonic says do not attempt to replace it yourself because there is no safe consumer access. A second issue: It is loud when it runs and, additionally, makes a very loud humming noise.  It had worked well for reheating other than these issues. We will need to replace it. Would not purchase it again."
"This microwave heats food super fast... except in the middle of the platter.  And I don't mean it leaves the center of a big chunk of lasagne cold, I mean something flat like a slice of pizza ends up cold in the middle.  I have NEVER seen a microwave that fails to heat the middle of a slice of pizza before.For frozen dinners that require stirring in the middle of the cooking time, this almost always means you have to break up a big chunk of frozen food in the middle of the dish in order to stir it.  MUCH larger than in other microwaves I've used.The user interface is like something from the 90s.  To put it on half power you have to press the power button 6 times.  So, for example, to reheat a couple slices of pizza at half power for 4 minutes requires 10 button presses.  My last microwave (from 2004!) took 3.And if you accidentally put the time in before you set the power level you have to reset and start over.The ""Sensor Cook"" feature forces you to look up (or memorize) the correct ""recipe"" in the Sensor Cook Chart so you can enter its number.  This means I have to keep the manual (or a printout of the chart) on top of the microwave as a reference.  Really seems like we could come up with a better interface in 2019.It also lacks a ""beverage"" setting or recipe.So, all in all, it's not a TERRIBLE microwave, but if you want even heating or sensor cooking without needing a reference chart, I would look elsewhere.  If I had bought this at Costco I would return it, but having bought it here, it's not QUITE bad enough for me to package it back up to ship it back."
"We have had this unit 2 months. There's no bell or alarm after the timer finishes, which is quite annoying.  Another annoyance: the timer cannot be run while the unit is cooking, although our old microwave did both simultaneously.  I then have to use my phone's timer!  Even worse is that the power button has to be pushed numerous times to go from power 10 down to whatever you want and THEN you enter the time in power set function, then push start.  Nowhere is the power level displayed so you can know the power selected is what you intended.  It should be: hit the power button, punch a number between 1 & 10, then enter the time on the key pad, then start.  The power should be displayed along with the time remaining.  Oh, and the key pad is not backlit either, so in dimmed light you'll need a flashlight to see the faint numbers/words against dark background!  Plus, this microwave runs hot and all your cook times need to be adjusted!  I really HATE this design, but it's unfortunately past the 30 days to return it or I would.  Like most other consumers today, we are fed up with steadily decreasing quality and steadily increasing prices, on everything, over the past 30+ years.  This is another example of cutting quality to increase profits.  It's more than aggravating; it is disgusting."
"I've been using this model for a little over 6 months now, and have to say I'm not loving it. I had a 10-year-old KitchenAid over-stove model that worked better than this.The three areas that are not working for me are:1) Uneven heating, and heating the container, but not the food - Every time I use this, the plate or dish holding the food gets blazing hot, but the food is just warm. Sometimes the dish is so hot I can't even take it out of the oven, and the food is just barely warm. These are just standard ceramic dishes.2) Uneven defrosting. My old KitchenAid did an amazing job of defrosting everything. With this model, if I'm defrosting a chicken breast, the inside will still be frozen, and the edges are completely cooked.3) Lastly, the construction quality is not what I would expect for a $200+ microwave oven. The lever you push to open the microwave door is cheap plastic and squeaks loudly every time I open the oven door. I imagine eventually it will just give out and break.Again, overall, not really pleased with this purchase. I'll probably end up giving it to one of my kids and try another KitchenAid model."
"I purchased this microwave in July 2021 (so about six months ago) and it works fine. A few things I've noticed though....first, it seems to really heat up whatever vessel the food is in, like SCALDING hot, but yet the food will stay cold. I don't recall ever having this issue with other microwaves, so I feel like I need to reheat things longer and stop/stir along the way. Maybe that's the inverter technology at work. Second, and I never realized it would annoy me, but there is no auto-start option. Every microwave I've had over the years, if you hit 1-4 it would automatically turn on for 1-4 minutes. It's a little convenience that I miss. Finally, and this is the big one, the plastic over the keypad is already bubbling in a couple places (on the 0 and Start buttons). At first I thought it was dirt, but nope. Overall I think I could've gotten a less expensive microwave that would've done the job just as well."
"I would not buy this machine again. The turntable is the loudest I've ever experienced & can be a little jerky at times. We replaced an older Panasonic that we loved and paid 1/2 the price for. This one is definitely cheaper quality construction, but that's the way of the world these days. The ""Sensor Reheat"" which we used constantly on the old one is just absolutely horrible on this new machine. Basically unusable. However, the power level is easier to maneuver, so we have changed to that as a kind of manual reheat option. Just get the 100-120 dollar machine & go with that over paying so much for this one. You don't always get what you pay for."
"We purchased this microwave after reading Wirecutter's review and recommendation. It's awful. We've had it less than two years, and after a few months the plastic coating started to peel off the front of the buttons. A few months ago, the power seems to nearly fail when heating an item, only to power back up later in the time of heating. Panasonic might make some other good products, but this is not one of them."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The microwave worked just fine but I've had it less than a year and rust has developed on the inside front door. Not good.
"If you want a powerful microwave that boils and melts, then this is exactly what you're looking for, because that is what this does well. However, in our household we like to reheat foods for young children and adults, cook frozen vegetables in steaming bags, and get head-starts on dinner preparations. Doing those basic tasks with this microwave requires one to press a gazillion buttons to adjust the power down to 8 or 7, then set the cook time, then hit start.The most attractive feature to us was the so-called ""Genius Sensor"" that could supposedly detect food temperatures and reheat foods ""perfectly"". This never worked, not once. It boiled soup so that it took 10 minutes to cool to an eating temperature, it dried-out meats so that they were gross, and it never made anything faster. We followed the instructions about covering and poking vent holes and all of that, and it never accomplished its advertised function.When the first of these was shipped to us, it was an automatic fail, because the door would not open. Called Amazon, they were helpful, and they shipped a new one to us. When the second arrived and was set-up, it was a disappointment from the start. It is loud, and the interior LED light was weird—bright when you looked at it, but all of the food was dimly lit. Now both have been returned and the refund process is started. We ultimately moved to a Toshiba 4-in-1 and we are instantaneously happy with that. The described features of this Panasonic make it seem like an exact match for what we need to do in our house, but the execution was poor, and the results were unsatisfactory."
"Interior paint started to crack.  I purchased this June 2023.  Microwave works great, but the paint should NOT be cracking.  It is going to be a pain in the you know where to get the issue resolved.  I expected that this paint cracking is either crappy materials or I just got a lemon.  Either way, it would be nice if Amazon would exchange another one for me since it isn't even a year old.  We shall see.  Would I buy this again?  Nah."
The microwave worked fine until it didn't. Worked just long enough to make it past the support window.
"We have this unit on a microwave shelf in our kitchen.  The display is so dark that my husband can't read it at all and I have a very hard time with it.  The ""inverter"" feature for defrosting seems to be pretty much a nothing burger.  It defrosts about the same as my previous microwave.  I don't like the way it does the presets.  If your choice is #10 on their list, you have to hit the button 10 times... and if you go over, you have to start again.  My last unit, I just plugged in the number for the preset I wanted.  All in all, I'm not in love with this unit, but it does the job of microwaving, so......."
"1 - Must push the power button to scroll through down through 10 power levels - no single power button and then enter the cooking level.  If you want power level 3 you have to push the power button 7 times.2 - No single button start for 1 minute heat. Must push the 30 second button 2 times and then push start.3 - The sensor reheat that is supposed to detect moisture only works with plastic wrap. If you try to cover a soup bowl with a plate, the food over heats and spills out of the bowl.4 - Once heating cycle is completed, the microwave beeps 5 times. The beeping does not stop when you open the door AND if you do not open the door it does not beep again to alert you the cycle is complete and food is in the microwave.5 - Keypad buttons are not very sensitive. Sometimes they need to be pushed more than once to register request.6 - Once a cycle is over, if you want to immediately start a new cycle, must push stop before selecting new power program. If you don't push stop, it does not register the new program.Wish I had kept the box because I would definitely return it."
"After a little more than three years of service, it just stopped working. Everything looks normal but when you press start nothing happens."
"Purchased this June 9, 2023 and it died today, June 11, 2024.  I have never had a microwave stop working, even after multiple years of use.  To last 1 year must be really saying something about what utter garbage it is.  I see other reviews stating Panasonic microwaves are notorious for only lasting 12-14 months, lesson learned.During 12 months of use, the power always seemed weak causing the interior light to dim while operating it, the door seal on the bottom dragged on the counter and the dumbest thing is you can’t use the timer separately while heating something.  Every other microwave I’ve ever had I was able to heat something for a certain set time and also set the timer for something else, like on the stove etc. Not this one, you can’t operate it if you’re using the timer feature.  The whole unit feels cheap and the door is loud when you close it.  I also don’t like that it doesn’t continually alert you when it’s done like other microwaves."
"I’ve had this microwave for 14 months. About a month or so ago I noticed these little black flecks inside when I used it and after a while it became evident that the door was the source. Somehow the inside door managed to rust and now if used, it blows plastic and rust onto your food. Until this happened it worked amazing."
"So, first the good news. It ""nukes"", it's relatively powerful for its size, and it has a good amount of interior space considering its compact footprint. That being said, the buttons, logic, and programming functionality are a design fiasco. Does one really need 5 loud beeps after each cycle - all the beeps are always loud and can't be turned off. It'd be nice if the beeps would cancel when I open the door so I don't wake the rest of the household when heating breakfast at 5 a.m. How about some backlighting for the barely legible buttons? There's no indication of power level short of pushing and holding the power level selector for 2s - that could have been easily integrated into the display. Why does it require one to hit reset before adding 10s/1m/10m? Seems like a lot of arbitrary non-customizable programming design decisions made by some circuit board programmer that had his/her idea of how a microwave should operate."
"Beware of the More/Less feature.  It does not do what it was intended, at least in my opinion.  I replaced a Kenmore microwave and it allowed the user to add more seconds if you think the item is not hot/cooked enough.  With this microwave, I found out from Panasonic support that the More/Less feature only works with the Sensor Reheat/Sensor Cooking feature, not when you manually put in the minutes.  Additionally, the More/Less feature works PRIOR to hitting the Start button, not while you are cooking/reheating something (which I find to be more logical).  I also found out that when I hit the Sensor Reheat, then Support told me to hit the More or Less button, you only see an up or down arrow in the Display, it does not tell you that it is for an extra 10 seconds or less 10 seconds.  This feature is not intuitive at all.  Thus, the three-star rating.  If I knew this was how it worked, I might have opted for a different model, but More/Less feature to me meant that if you are in the process of heating/cooking something and the timer has already started, you could add more or less time.  This is not the case with their feature."
"We purchased this microwave in April 2021. We had an older model of the same that still worked but after 8 yrs decided to upgrade. A few weeks ago it stopped working and displayed the error code H98, which we learned means ""primary failure in the magnetron or inverter circuitry"". This must be repaired at a Panasonic repair place. BUT try to get Panasonic to respond to ANY inquiries or reply to an open case. My issue was the two authorized repair places in my area were closed. So they had to ""escalate"" my case. You can't get through by phone, your only option is via chat. 4 weeks later, 3 chats later, still no response from the escalation team. I just keep getting told I will hear back in 48 business hours. IT'S BEEN WEEKS!!! And our microwave is still inoperational. VERY disappointed this microwave didn't even last a year but more disappointing and frustrating is the complete lack of Panasonic customer service. ZERO customer service!! I finally contacted Amazon and even though the return window has closed, they refunded 90% of the cost I paid for the microwave and we purchased a new one. A Toshiba microwave and so far workds great! We will never purchase anything from Panasonic AGAIN!"
"I really like the way it worked, until it didn't. Only had it for 4 months before it didn't work. An error code of H98 came up. I looked up what the code meant, it means if ""Fried"" and less expensive to buy a new one than to have it repaired. Too bad, I really liked the way it heated food food evenly and without a mess of exploding food or bubbling over. Will not buy again. Gave it one star.UPDATE: Since we couldn't return the microwave to Amazon we didn't know what to do with it. After one month of it not working I went directly to the Panasonic website and did a live chat with someone who was very helpful. We went through a long reset with many steps, but it worked. I went from giving this microwave one star to three stars now that it's working again. If it continues to work, I will come back again to increase the stars. But the machine has to prove itself to longevity first.Update: After a year and a half of resetting, sometimes 5-8 times before it would work again, it finally just wouldn’t work anymore. We tried to replace the magnetron (2 times) the inverter board that came broken. Spent around $200.00 trying to fix it and we still don’t have a working microwave. One star is all I can give this microwave, hopefully other buyers have had better luck with theirs."
"Its hit or miss with slow cooking.  Sometimes you set to a low power level and it cooks at full power.  And the low setting process is not intuitive or well explained on screen.  Also, half the time after you remove a finished item from the microwave and go on to the next item, it wont accept new time settings, until you press Stop to reset it.  Also hit or miss.  Im fairly tall, and i have to stand back to see the buttons.  It would help if they were backlit, and the surface area of what is accepted as a push on any button is quite small.  You have to hit the mark within the graphic button exactly on target.  Lots of times I've pressed and pressed, crouched and pressed, and then realized i was pressing correctly, but i needed to hit the stop button first.  Not a bad machine, but annoying, and thank goodness i have another one that will reliably work on low settings without worry."
"I'm giving it two stars because, frankly, it heats food very, very well, and is easy to use.  BUT IT WILL KILL YOUR WIFI.I've had many microwaves in my life and unlike many others, I do not believe that they give you cancer or that wind turbines cause migraines.  But this microwave, undoubtedly, killed my wifi for *months* before I figured it out.  It didn't just interrupt it while it was running, it would overwhelm devices so badly they'd freeze or drop off the network entirely and wait to be rebooted.  Consistently it fried my router over and over to the point that I would have to hard-boot it to get it back to life.  I even replaced the router thinking that IT had the problem.Look, it makes great food.  The defrosting is ok, not great, always more powerful than I needed.  Reheat works awesome.  But I like my fritter with a side of Facebook, Italian with a side of Instagram, and my pizza rolls with a side of porn.  This setup does not support that in any way, shape, or form.So if you are the tech guru in your family and do not want to enter into a two-month-long argument with your spouse that always starts out like, ""Why is the INTERNET out, Todd?""  ""I don't KNOW, Margo!"", I would 100% recommend against this particular appliance.  For your sake, and everyone else."
Controls hard to figure out. Doesn't heat a bowl of soup when it should. Generally do not like. Will return and order a traditional microwave.
"THIS IS A REVIEW UPDATEOverall, this microwave was OK, at best. There were annoying things about it while we owned it. The loud beeping at the end of each cycle, the fact that the power levels never actually seemed to be effective (always seemed to be 100%), and the incessant collection of pools of moisture under the turntable all combined to lower our satisfaction. But the one thing that made the biggest difference was the rusting on the interior. Rust developed along the bottom of the window on the inside and started developing on the floor inside the cooking area. Not exactly a great feature. Time to go to a different brand.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Hopefully we don't experience any of the problems a couple of others list here because we really like this microwave. The price was fairly good, but the features make up the difference. First of all, this isn't a complicated machine, which it shouldn't be. It's simplicity is one of it's best features. The only improvement I could recommend so far would be adding the ability to eliminate the final beeps as an option. Maybe Panasonic changed the cook light because there isn't any issue seeing what is inside when it's running. The opening and closing of the door is smooth and fairly quiet (unlike some I've experienced). The power is more than adequate, and though you couldn't exactly fit a turkey inside it, the inside is of decent size. Overall, this microwave is a good, midsize choice for a fairly good price (perhaps a bit overpriced)."
"I replaced my old 1300 watt Panasonic microwave oven with this one.  I use a silicone popcorn popper with quality popcorn.  My old Panasonic popped corn vigorously and when popping slowed, you knew it was time to stop the microwave to prevent burning.  This new Panasonic pops sporadically, never giving any clue as to when it is finishing up  -- resulting in either too many unpopped kernels, or burnt popcorn.  Very disappointed in Panasonic."
"This microwave replaced a well-used, much-appreciated Panasonic model that finally gave out. It cooks well and we like its smallish size and that the beeping can be eliminated, but I find myself aggravated with the controls every day, for a few reasons: Most important, the buttons are touch-sensitive rather than mechanical, and one or more have be pressed more than once to register a ""press"" nearly every time I use it. Others in the family also have this problem. Oddly, sometime it seems you have to press the reset button to get the controls to work, even when the previous cooking cycle was completed. Finally, the buttons are not backlit and the light colored labels don't stand out well against the dark background, so the controls can be difficult to see well if the lighting isn't bright.I seriously find these everyday aggravating annoying enough that I regret buying this microwave, which we are considering replacing and donating to a good cause. It's a shame that the product design folks at Panasonic ruined what is otherwise a great product with these aggravating controls."
"This microwave lasted us a year and a half before a spring in the door failed (see attached picture) resulting in the door no longer being closeable. At this price point the manufacturer should not be cheaping out on critical to function parts, and the door design should be redundant to avoid single points of failure. I'm hopeful that I'll be able to repair it with a new spring, but that shouldn't be necessary at this price point after a year and a half of service."
Microwave works great only complaint is that when received the glass turn table had a crack and chip on edge.
"I wanted to love this microwave. •Sleek flat front design. •Elegant, monochromatic panel.  •Updated, even-cooking feature. •The auto warm/done feature sounds very nice, but does require extra effort to manually program the unit and to carefully cover the food with a fitted and vented lid or plastic wrap.  •It heats the food fast. •It’s roomy enough for my full size dinner plates and big bowls. >PROBLEMATIC: •The large plug, and short, super stiff cord protrude too much from the wall, a problem since my outlet is not behind the unit. >THE DEAL BEAKERS: There is no quick-touch, 1-5 minute, cooking feature. •The “30 second“ button is not a one-touch, but also requires the start button. •The “30 second” button can be repeatedly pressed to reach up to 5 minutes, but beeps...e v e r y...s i n g l e (10 annoying times) press of the button. •Unit continues beeping (FIVE loud-in-your-ear times) when finished, even after you open the door. •There is not a no-sound feature. >CONCLUSION: Sad to report that for the simple, reheating and super non-fussy manner, in which we use a MW, this is not for us."
"Fit and finish are good, it works fine. I replaced it because its old predecessor was interfering with my WiFi network- this is something that happens and that hasn't been a problem with this unit. However, comments about difficulty reading the legends on the keypad are correct, unless you're looking straight-on with good light it's really tough to see what the buttons say. Also, its auto-reheat is not as good as the unit I had before. Sometimes food is insufficiently heated, sometimes too little."
"For starters the unit has a 'quick 30s' button that doesn't start the microwave. You have to press 'quick 30' then press start.The 'technology' they talk about didn't work any better than any other microwave I've had. I will say that for the first month or so it did seem to be working really well. But after the first couple months of use, it’s just like a normal microwave at this point."
Had samsung for long time.  Tried to switch to Panasonic based on Google reviews.  Google is wrong. Samsung is better
"The first week the door opening pad fell off. No reason, no kids, just pushed it to open to remove a cup of coffee and it fell off. Figured we deal with it. Following month, the light went out. Just gone. Can’t see a darned thing! Now it’s emitting weird electrical burning odors, making crackling sounds and sometimes the intensity of the heat is like the fires of hell! 45 seconds boiled the (cold) cup of coffee over all over the plate.  I’ve tried calling Amazon for support. Nothing. Got a number from Amazon for product support. No longer in service. Called Amazon back and they said it was not returnable, (figures,) and I informed them I wasn’t trying to return, just needed support. Once again was given a bad number. I found a number through PISSED Consumer,and at 2:10 the recording said that customer support was closed. I may eventually reach someone to help, but this has been absurd! This is a safety risk and I can’t get any help from anyone and I am very unhappy and frustrated! So unless you’re ready to become as frustrated as I am, choose a different brand!!!"
This would be a great Microwave except for the fact that it smells like something is on fire when it runs. I am afraid to leave it plugged in when we leave the house. We are seniors and use it to mostly heat up liquid and defrost items when needed. I had a microwave for almost 20 years before we bought this one. Hasn't been but 6 months since we purchased this one on Amazon.
Really loud fan but cheap and works good
"This wave always acted weird and its been getting worse.  First it didnt put a light on when you opened it just when you were cooking but now 3 years later it does come on when the door is open.  The we noticed that after you cook and want to put it back in for more time, you always had to push stop, get a long beep, and then it would let you use it again.  And now if you try to lower the power it will run your entered time, but when its done it wont shut off, it will instead give you a double beep, reset the time to when you entered, and keep going another cycle on full blast.This is the third Nordicware rice cooker its melted, and the most sever.  Luckily, each time it has done something dumb we caught it before the food, or bowl, has caught fire.  This last rice cooker was bad enough to smoke the whole house up.This was also the last straw, it will be coming to the range with me the next time i go and its going be ventilated with extreme predjudice."
This product worked okay for awhile but just recently it burn marks showed up on the door and two days ago when we went to use it.  It started sizzling and then started smoking.  Trying to get a hold of Parasonic has been a pain since it is less than 1 year old the product coverage we bought through Amazon won't work since there a warranty.  The warranty requires I bring it to a shop which is 30 minutes away and I've tried to call but always get the we are closed message.
"I am not very happy with this Panasonic Microwave Oven NN-SN686S .I don't really use it for more than thawing frozen foods, reheating foods, popping bagged popcorn and zapping potatoes. So far that has been good. I'm unhappy with other things. The viewing screen on the door is way too short. You just can't see if your liquids are boiling or not. The inside light is not bright enough and it is located toward the front behind a perforated metaal screen but too close to the non perforated section and that blocks a lot of the light from the back of the compartment. When you remove a large bowl (or whatever) from the carousel, and you drag a liottle bit of the weight across the carousel plate table, it will come off it's wheeled locator track and you have to fiddle around with them to properly re-align them. My biggest complaint is that the control panel does not light up. I am a night owl and have to turn on the kitchen lights to read the panel. Sorry I can't comment on the rest of the cooking operations."
"When I received the microwave,  I noticed that it was not steady, it rocks a little....something was off at the bottom, I did not send it back because at the time,  I needed it."
"I admit I can sound like Abraham Simpson from time to time, ranting about the good old days when appliances lasted practically forever and were repairable when they weren't, but this time it's justtified.  I grudgingly began the online shopping process for a new microwave after the 10 year old unit (a hand me down from my grandparents that replaced my prior 15 year old unit) finally quit, and as is often the case, nearly every unit whose reviews I checked (not just this brand, but also Sharp and others) all reported a high number of D.O.A. units or premature failures.  Well, with trepidation I ordered this touchpad unit which arrived promptly and well packed, and I was initially thrilled with its special features like sensor reheat, as I cautiously placed it into service.  Something told me I should ""save the box"".  Sure enough, after four delightful uses, most with sensor reheat, and certainly less then ten minutes cook time, the unit failed utterly with an ""H98"" error code (bad Magnetron/Inverter circuit), and won't recover.  So after just a few days, it is back in the (original, saved) shipping box, and lugging it to UPS for a return.  Dagnabbit they just don't make 'em like they used to."
"I received a defective product, it’s not working at all, I haven’t been able to use it, I just recently open the box and plugged it in, but doesn’t turn on.  I’m very disappointed.  I need to return it or exchange it for a working one."
This arrived with no glass plate for the turntable. This means that the microwave is inoperable.  Ordered a replacement on Amazon.  Amazon did give me a discount on the item with no problem. I do not believe that this was an Amazon issue but a Panasonic issue.
"While our old Samsung served us well for 15 years, the need for anew MW was eminent. we chose this because the Panasonic product is rated well and we liked the design.However the functions are quite bothersome. WTH is ""Inverter"" got to do with defrosting, they sure do not explain very well in the manual.  The over-kill options are more bothersome as well. Too many separate functions that make simply heating items a bit like flying a 747. The buttons are much more pressure demanding than our old SamsungFinally, the display screen is quite enigmatic, more questions than explanations. Overall, it heats, but so does less function gifted units that are easier to operate.After only 2 years, it is broken. A loud rattle from within the case is not very comforting and will probably cost more to fix than dispose of and get another. This time maybe Samsung."
"The microwave works well, fits well on the counter, and is nice and quiet compared to my old model. There is one feature that REALLY annoys me, the keyboard is not illuminated at all, not even a small backlight. The keyboard is even hard to read in a lighted room -- the numbers are a grayish color on a black background and blend in together. The clock shines brightly. I often go into the kitchen when it is very dimly lit or dark to heat up an item and push the wrong buttons! It's very frustrating -- I end up opening the microwave and using the interior light to shed some light on the keyboard, or turn on the kitchen light which irritates me more each time I have to do it! It may seem like a minor inconvenience to some, but it feels like a major flaw to me. It's too much trouble to send it back, or I definitely would!  Disappointed!"
"It's a microwave and it works. It took awhile to get used to the new controls vs my old much simpler one, but it seems overly complicated. I guess because it can do a lot of things? It beeps a lot, I wish there was a setting somewhere that I could make it beep less or not at all when you push the buttons. I always feel bad when I am using the microwave if someone in the house is sleeping. It's also pretty loud while in use. The door seems to get stuck on something when I open it, so it only opens halfway easily. You can open it more if you needed, but not sure if this is intended or some defect. Also it is pretty ugly and shows all fingerprints. It works for me, but I would never pick this one to buy again."
"After reading the reviews and doing my research, I bought this microwave.  While it works fairly well, I was really surprised by how very loud it is.  Everyone in the area comments about the noise level.  Two other, more minor issues-- The dark, shiny door shows every single fingerprint and immediately looks grubby (I'm coaxing my kids to only touch the top of the door.) and the door swings fully open when not latched closed, exposing the 2 large door hooks that easily get caught on sleeves/clothing.  I usually like to leave the microwave door open for a few minutes to dry out remaining steam/moisture before closing.  The legs are not adjustable so I may try shimming the 2 front legs a tiny bit higher so the door will stay resting against the oven. Disappointed because I really thought I'd done my research, but maybe it's best to actually see a product in person in a store before buying it. Not sure I made a good choice."
After buying this supposedly highly rated microwave it was such a disappointment. Uneven heating. Can’t use timer while warming something. Died after 2 years. My previous microwave was a kenmore. Worked perfectly for 23 years.  Not impressed with Panasonic
"I agree with others that the buttons are too hard to press on this model, and I also think that the light is pretty dim, though that bothers me less. My main problem is that after I cook something, the keypad becomes unresponsive. I have to press Reset to get it to work again. I can't find any information on this being normal operation in the manual, so I guess I got a defective unit. Back it goes, and I'll probably get a different model because the high keypad pressure you need to use for this thing is actually pretty annoying. A big disappointment -- I trusted in Panasonic quality."
"I really like the inverter defrost and the fact that you can actually dial back the power level rather than just the duty cycle on this type of microwave. The finish is nice and it runs fairly quietly. The sensor cooking actually works fairly well and the sensor reheat is decent for one-touch leftovers.That said, I have had two issues with this microwave in the short time I have owned it. First, the number pad/buttons are a kind of plastic/rubber printed film that will scratch/ripple/deform if you brush it with a fingernail. The number 2 and the start button have basically begun scratching off after only a few months of use. Second, somewhat careless removal of a coffee mug from the carousel took a large chip out of the edge of the glass. I have owned several microwaves and never have I seen such fragile glass used for the carousel. Thankfully it broke cleanly and didn't crack the rest of it and still works fine."
"Just received this microwave oven, placed it on my kitchen top surface, and it wobbled placed it on two other leveled surfaces just to be safe, and it still wobbled, and you can't a gust the bottom levelers in anyway, may be returning. and when it comes to heating thing, one would be better off getting a 1000 w or higher Microwave. if it wasn't so big of a box to deal with I, would return it, instead I'm given it away and will purchase one another."
I gave this to my friend as Christmas gift for his office and it works fine. It heats up foods evenly and efficiently. And it is quite quick to heat up any foods. It’s simple to use and good for one person meals
"Look it’s quiet, it’s cheap and it’s… fine-looking I guess. I suppose you get what you pay for, though the bar for that seems to drop more every year.This microwave just does not heat efficiently. I have bought a cheap S******g 1000W microwave for under $100 before and it was GREAT. The 30-second reheat got everything except pure liquids to the right temperature. This one however, just about hits lukewarm in 30 secs and everything else is 1+ minutes. A 12 oz bowl of soup took 3 whole minutes to reheat today. So I guess pay less, wait more is the norm with this one and normally I’d just adjust my expectations. But this also heats UNEVENLY. It has VERY hot and VERY cold parts when reheating things like chicken. Boiling potatoes (usually great within 8-9 minutes in a standard microwave) needs 14 minutes because until 5 minutes, the water doesnt even boil.Anyway, if you can afford it, get a microwave with higher wattage and that’s not Toshiba because I dont trust this brand anymore. If you want to keep it cheap like me, adjust your expectations and this will be fine."
"It's a great looking microwave and does the job, however, this thing is quite ""noisy"". It rattles and hums like the plate is loose (even though it's not). Aside from that...ya, it's a pretty cheap microwave."
"The Microwave is nice, easy to use, however, I would like a repeat alarm that there is something still in the unit.  Would have been better!"
"We've been super happy with this microwave, but it's no longer heating properly and it's only 3 years old. It should last longer than that! Has anyone else had problems with longevity?"
"Just got this replacement microwave today and haven't used it yet.Bought a Toshiba to replace a Black&Decker when all the paint (powder coating)came off the inside walls after only a year-and-a-half (mfg. Jan 2023).  I figured Black & Decker powder coating was all pretty much the same, model to model, so I moved to a different brand.  Chipping paint is one thing, but not in my food!"
"It was purchased to replace a larger & more powerful General Electric microwave that was 22 years old.This Toshiba microwave is somewhat of a disappointment for several reasons.It is rated at 900 watts and replaced one that was rated at 1100 watts.However; this one requires more than twice the amount of time to heat the same amount & density food items & has excessive condensation build up. In fact, this one has more condensation build up than any other microwave oven that I have owned or even used ! I do see more than normal reviews that states premature failures. I would think that the excessive water ( condensation ) would have a lot to do with the electrical component & electronic failures that customers are experiencing !!This microwave only has approx. 7 & 5/16 inch clearance height between the turn table and top, so larger casserole dishes & taller mugs / glasses will not fit."
I had a high-end Toshiba microwave that I loved for many years. I purchased this to replace it and have noticed a decline in quality. It does everything you expect but the unit is not built solid. It will vibrate and buzz sometimes which is annoying.
"I purchased this microwave for the first time in 2019 and it went great for several years until the glass in the front shattered completely for no reason that I could figure out ( in 2023).  However I got several good years out of it, so I ordered the same model through Amazon because it was the perfect size & looks sleek. The replacement model I received shorted out after 3 minutes using the microwave (I learned this is a safety feature) and once the unit cooled down, it would turn on again. I figured this was unlucky and one bad model. Sent it back.Ordered this AGAIN and the SAME THING happened. It overheated, the microwave turned off and stopped working until it cooled down. The top was so hot you could burn yourself if you left your hand on it.I figured maybe I had a bad outlet, moved the 30lb thing around to try 2 other outlets. Happened every time.Now you might be like ""it's your outlet/apartment, the problem is you."" Could be, but I borrowed an outlet tester and my outlets are reading normal. And maybe it's a voltage vs. my apartment thing, an area I'm not familiar with.I wanted to write this as a warning for any who wanted this heads up, and to record in case anyone else ran into this. Good luck!"
"Nice product but can't set timer and then use oven during that time.  Also, when pressing numbers, the oven starts right away, which can be a useful feature."
"We had the larger size of the Toshiba model for years. So to save countertop space, I thought we should get the smaller version. I regret my decision though because this one is noisier when running. You could only hear the other one running when you were in the kitchen. But this one you can hear from the hallway by the bedrooms. Also it's only 900 watts instead of 1100 watts of the full size Toshiba. I knew this when I got it but I didn't realize it would make that much of a difference in heating times. Now instead of just hitting the 1 minute button to heat my cup of water for tea, it takes 1 minute and 30 seconds. I didn't think it would take that much longer but it does. Everything takes an extra 30 - 60 seconds for the small items. And to cook a potato it takes about 2-3 more minutes. The other difference between the large and the small model is that the color of the interior looking through the vents is white and visible on the smaller model. On the full size model looking through the vents the  color is dark and blends in so it's not noticeable. It still works though it's just noisier and takes longer. And for the minimum saving on the dimensions, I'd recommend the full size 1100 watt Toshiba."
"This microwave performed well under light use (around 30 minutes a week) for just over a year--a couple of weeks longer than the warranty. Turned it on and it worked fine but when we went to reheat our coffee again, there was nothing. The unit was warm to the touch, but not hot, and there was no damage to the cord or outlet. It just stopped.I contacted Toshiba and was led down a brief rabbit hole of troublshooting, photographing and submitting of details which ended up taking about an hour of my time. This was not a problem. I told the service rep that the unit was a couple of weeks past its warranty but figured that it was so close that a fair consideration might be made and I was led to believe by the person I spoke with that it would likely be so.A few days went by and I got an update saying that the warranty claim was under review and that, once approved, a reimbursement check would be sent to me. Vague (sort of) language which was pretty leading that caused me to believe that we were moving in the right direction. Then today I got another message telling me that the claim had been denied.I don't have a problem with the denial. Not at all. But what I have a problem with is the interim message suggesting that my claim would be honored. Like, why even bother to send the interim message? Why mention the sending of a check until that's a relevant point?This behavior by companies seems to be the new normal as I have been the recipient of such things many times over the past year from a claim on my homeowners' insurance, to a selling issue on a major reselling site, to a number of other situations. And my point is that companies need to stop appearing as they're accomodating until the confirmation of their ability or willingness to accomodate has been finalized. It's tedious and exhausting, and does nothing to build brand loyalty. As a result of this I will likely never buy another Toshiba product because one, they just don't last, and two, because their response was wholly lacking a reasonable professionalism one should expect from such a company.Buy this if you wish. It was great while it worked but it probably didn't last more than 30 hours before it went kaput."
This microwave has no power at all
Exterior gets very hot while cooking. Do not set things on top of the microwave while it is cooking that might be damaged from the heat.  Interior smaller than I expected.  Will hold up to quart jar.
I decided to replace a microwave oven that I have had for over 20 years.  I selected one that would fit under my cupboard.  I should have paid more attention to details.  It feels so small.  There is no way to open it except to pull the door. I do like the automatic 30 second button.  The platter does not SPIN  easily to remove a dish when it finishes cooking on the back side.
"I realized the kitchen timer cannot be used while heating food in the oven!! I’ve grown accustomed to using those features regularly & thought they were standard. Wrong!Once the timer is engaged – that’s all it can be used for! Why would anyone need a big box kitchen timer?! It’s mind boggling that a microwave would be designed this way. smhI initially chose Toshiba because of the “sound off” option, but other brands offer this too & along with the features previously mentioned. Plus I wanted a white or all stainless enclosure."
"I really liked this microwave but I've had it 2 years and it just died. So I am shopping for another one. I'm disappointed because it was decent while it lasted, I guess I just expected it to last longer."
"The microwave was defective and it was like pulling teeth to get a refund from Toshiba.  They asked me for my receipt from Amazon, I sent them one and I received a phone call stating it didn't say it was new or used.  I told them ""Use your common sense, I wouldn't ever buy a used product unless I bought it at a yard sale.  What does a new unit cost?  And, you can see by my receipt it's the same price as a new one plus taxes.""  Duh!  Then I received an email stating they wanted Proof of Purchase.  Isn't my receipt Proof of Purchase?  Never again will I buy any Toshiba product.  Amazon refunded me my money and took out a re-stocking fee of $20 which I wasn't informed of and going to inform them of the fact they didn't inform me.  I swear, today's customer service is so uniformitable and knit picky that it's very important for us to start asking questions about every single item we buy if we don't want to pay a re-stocking fee for a defective product.  How are you going to restock it?  It doesn't work!  What?  Throw it in your trash bin is re-stocking these days?  Give me a freaking break already!"
ThE Amazon box was okay.The  Toshiba box the bottom was lose
"cooking, but it is not as convenient as I would like"
"The unit was purchased 5/21 so just 3 years old. Think it is going to need replacement soon. For example today I reheated 4 slices of pizza  for 1 1/2 min. and after adding the extra 1/2 minute button the unit buzzed till it showed 1.09 min. left to heat.  Variations of that is what is happening. I use it daily, one adult but figure it should last longer than 3 years. FYI  Will use till it dies."
"Worked great until after the 30 day return limit, then started not heating thoroughly per food item directions on occasion. Must put in needed power level for each use; we used to be able to press 1 and it would automatically heat on high for one minute. Now it’s less than high about half the time."
"I bought this little nuke in June of'22, now here it is November 1st of 2024, and it officially dead. It lasted just shy of 2 1/2 years. I bought it because of the name brand, and it is a nice looking unit, and I have to toss this still nice looking unit out because it stopped working. When I was in the market for a smaller microwave I researched all of the wrong things about a microwave oven,it seems a great many of them are built in the same place in china. Now my little Toshiba is going to be recycled and I will purchase another cheap little microwave that was more than likely built in the same place. So my EM925A5A-BS is history. I think I know what the BS part of this model number means now. I guess I'll purchase another cheap microwave and not feel as bad about the longevity of it when I have to replace it within a few years. But hey, Toshiba, consumers will read this and still buy your product, so just my 2 cents worth."
"It is sad to think that we pay for a new product and expect it to arrive in “new” condition only to find damage that was clearly visible. This was packaged and sent out anyway ….it does make a person wonder what else might be not up to standards?There was no damage to the outside packaging, so this had to happen before shipping. This was needed for a college kid going off to college. It functioned properly. There was not really time to get a replacement  before move in date, so we were forced t9 keep it. I just wanted everyone to know that the quality control may be questionable and you might not get a unit that does not have damage.I am unhappy about paying full price for something that clearly should not have been shipped!"
"Pros: No sound feature.Cons: inconsistent heating after 2 years of use.When we first got this microwave, I loved being able to turn off the beeping so that we could use the microwave while the kids slept or napped. I still enjoy this feature. However, after about 2 years, food/ beverage wasn't cooking right  I usually reheat entrees for 3.5 minutes at half power. Sometimes the food is overheated, sometimes not cooked, and sometimes still perfect. The same for the beverage setting. Sometimes the water is scalding and over times tepid. This microwave won't last as long as it should."
"The microwave is nice looking, compact and works well.I still struggle to remember that I have to hit timed heating before setting the time, as my last three microwaves started with that function automatically.  I also have to adjust the recommended times, as they usually assume 1000W.But, it came with a large dent on the side that matched damage to the product box.  The Prime, outer box was not damaged.  So, I guess that means it got damaged when shipped to Amazon, and some that works for Amazon decided to send it to me with clear evidence of damage.  I had planned to return it. Unfortunately, I took too long trying to decide  about getting a higher powered product, and I missed the return time window."
"We recently redid our countertops and our 1.1 cu ft, 1100 Watts, Toshiba no longer could fit under the cabinet.  Seeing this model was a Toshiba and we liked it, we ordered one.  It came - plugged it in ....well, nothing happened - didn't heat anything.  Tried a few more times and still didn't work.  The last time we tried, the top got really hot and the lights popped out and the machine stopped.  So, sent it back....problem is we liked it and thought this was a fluke, so we ordered the same model a second time.  Got that one about 10 days ago and it worked .....until it didn't - tonight it stopped heating.  Thankfully, the top didn't get hot and the lights didn't burn out.  Will be sending it back on Monday as it's packed and ready to go to UPS.If I could rate this a ZERO, I would.  Going to a local store and buying one.  I won't be buying any Toshiba products until they get their act together.  So buyer beware."
Had to put a non slip pad under one leg to make even. Lights flicker inside when opening door. Very quiet and nice other than issues stated
It worked well and then broke after 5 years of heavy use. (The light broke maybe at the 4 year mark).
"First of all, I have kept my microwave immaculately clean with plenty of ventilation space on all sides. If there is steam buildup on the interior, I wipe it down before closing the oven. Interior is like new. My microwave will be 4 years old in July 2023. Within the first few months the interior light first flickered crazily, then dimmed almost to completely out, but there must be a small bulb inside the casing as you can see a dim glow through the vent holes on the inside wall of the oven - no big deal. Now after reading other reviews, this is the apparent start of it's death. Heating times need to be increased as the oven ages - not a problem. Within the past few months, after heating for a period, usually in excess of one minute, it shuts down for a short period of time, then beeps and resets. Unplugging does not reset. You must wait until it is ready to work again and it will alert you when it turns back on beeping. Down time is based on how long it had been heating before shutting down. Sometimes it can't decide if it wants to be off or on and will play games by beeping, then stop, then start beeping again, and stop, until it decides whether it wants to be on or off. Annoying if you have just heated your coffee for a minute and now want to thaw out a muffin. You will have to reheat the coffee if it allows you to.  It was like a sulking child, now it's like an evil one. It starts, beeps after two seconds, stops. Starts, stops, then suddenly restarts. Time must be reset each time. All of the automatic cooking buttons (pizza, popcorn, potato, etc.) run 1 minute then end (unless it decides to stop before one minute). Don't leave it alone - it may be dangerous. I have had bad luck with microwaves in all price ranges, so now I just buy a cheap one and hope for the best, but it won't be a Toshiba."
"This was a great microwave. We had it for 2 years. It of nowhere, it started arcing and caught on fire. There was a plastic plate in it and a hot dog. I took both out, and it still arced. It should have lasted a lot longer than 2 years."
Purchased this in November 2020 and it started having problems earlier this year and burnt out completely a month ago.
"Opened the box, looked great, fit perfectly on my counter space. Plugged it in, put a mug of water inside to make coffee. Hit the “2 minute” button. Immediately noticed it was substantially louder than my previous microwave but nothing I couldn’t live with. After 2 minutes, I removed the mug and noticed that the mug wasn’t even a little warm which I thought was odd. I decided to retry at 3 minutes just to be sure. At this point, I noticed an unusual and unpleasant smell coming from the unit (think electrical fire) which was very alarming. I also noticed that the outside of the unit was noticeably warm to the touch. I removed the mug and again, still cold. Needless to say, I’m not going to risk a kitchen fire. Returned it immediately for a refund. JUNK.WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN!!!!"
"I made a mistake. I had a GE I used every day for 28? 30? years. It served me very well and I attributed its long life to good mfg. and the handle. It had a squeeze to open handle that was gentle, quiet and unjarring. I would hear other people slam the doors on their MWs and would wince thinking it couldn't be good for the machine. Squeezing the handle allowed for gentle, silent opening and closing on mine. I bought this one because it had an identical-looking handle and I mistakenly thought it, too, would allow for quiet closing. Nope. You have to jerk to open and bang to close. It's a bit more powerful than my old one, but smaller and lighter weight. The buttons are almost too small for a fingertip and I am unable to read the tiny print without getting really close. Does it heat food? Yes. Will it last 28 to 30 years of daily use. We'll see..."
"Bought this Jan 2021 and in May 2024 while heating up food in glass container the microwave started ""zapping"" and sparking like I had used metal or foil inside, which of course wasn't the case. Shut it off immediately and unplugged the unit. What a shame, it had great potential"
After waiting forever for this microwave the top has a huge dent on the top….
"After only mild usage (1-2x per week), the interior lamp starting flickering on usage.  It starts fine, then flickers during operation, then eventually goes dark.  Comes back to life next time you go to use it, and repeats the whole process.  Customer support is non-existent.  This is one of those cheap appliances you buy that might work a couple of years before you throw into a landfill and go pay for a new one all over again.  Great for profitability, I’m sure."
"The product was great for about a year. Then it started popping. I thought maybe food got on that little disperser plate or whatever it's called, but no. Thought maybe that plate was loose. No. Checked plug and wire and moved it to a different outlet. Still did it. Thought if I was super-gentle opening & closing the door it'd be ok. No. When it went from popping and sparking to a constant, loud buzz I just decided to order a cheapie from wally-world. I will say this lasted a year, it looks nice, and the light never went out for me like a lot of reviewers said. Just started scaring me and my cats half to death, and I can't figure out what's wrong. That panel has to be damaged, but I'm not seeing it. I even checked to make sure something I'd put in there hadn't picked up foil or something off the counter. Nope - all clear."
It looks nice and the led light is bright inside. A few issues I have with it. You can not just hit a time and then go like a normal microwave. You have to actually hit “ time cook” first and then type your selected time. If you just start hitting numbers it will just start off at the number of minutes. So if you hit “1 and then 2” as if you were going to cook for one minute and twenty seconds it just comes on and cooks for two minutes. Also the stop button is on the bottom right hand corner and the start is on the bottom left. That is backwards from any microwave I have ever owned. Seems insignificant but it’s annoying. Also after around a months use I could start to feel a bad spot in the plastic covering  of the buttons in the “start” button of course it is probably the most used button. Now it has spread and there are multiple places were the plastic is coming up. Very disappointing with a unit that has been used maybe three months. My old microwave was still working but just heating unevenly and nothing like that had happened and it was probably 20 years old.*edit*  I picked at the bubbled up part and it is in fact a sticker. But there were no clear edges to indicate it should be peeled off. But the keypad issue is no longer one once the film was removed. Although I feel a little dumb for not doing that earlier. It should have a tab or a lip so it’s easy to see it should be removed imo.
"Received item damaged.The top has a dent.The box was filthy, and came upside down in another box"
"Toshiba EM925A5A-BS Microwave Oven:Two Year Update:=============The turntable no longer functions.  This device will be discarded and replaced by a different brand.First the light bulb quit, and now the platter rotator.  This is the shortest lived microwave oven I have ever owned.I will never buy another Toshiba product - ever!  Not anything at all.==========================================================================================The most disappointing characteristic of this oven has been the lower than average heating ability.  My previous two microwave ovens were in the 1100 to 1200 watt power range.  This oven is only 900 watts and that does make a noticeable difference in the amount of time and the power setting needed for typical heating and cooking.After about seven months of use, the interior light began flashing wildly.  When it first began, it was really alarming as I thought it was arcing.Over time, it became more and more erratic.  Now, the light only rarely blinks in very short bursts.To get that repaired, I would have to carry it to a repair facility, have not microwave oven to use for 3 to 7+ days, and then have to carry up stairs again. That is unacceptable.The door has a sensible design with an open handle that can be easily grabbed with either a person's right or left hand.Also, there is no mechanism or push button to break, which did happen with my last oven.The smaller physical size, compared to typical 1.0 or 1.1 cubic feet ovens, is a welcome difference.The ""ready"" beeper sounds five (5) times when heating ends.  Three times is sufficient, four times is a bit annoying, five times is just obnoxious.The beeping does not stop if you press the ""STOP"" button.Fortunately, it is fairly easy to turn the sound 'Off'.Overall, the oven is not very loud and sound level is not objectionable.My Delivery Experience:The delivery of this item was timely enough, but it was not delivered to my apartment door.There was no delivery attempt notice left at my apartment door.It was delivered instead to the rental management office.The original manufacturers shipping box which has 'punch in' handles, was put into another larger box.The outer box did not have any 'punch in' handles and was more difficult to carry.I am 70+ years old and I had to carry the unwieldy heavy box up two flights of stairs!The delivery person was likely less than half my age.  I was certainly not happy."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Worked great until a month ago when it started making noises from the plate base.It still cooks, but is very noisy when weight is added to the plate.I hope it's still safe to use (?)"
"We picked this up for our cabin - because we are limited on wattage, we went with a smaller unit.  It works well, and it's really nice looking.  However there are a few items I really don't like about it.First, the start and stop button are in horrible positions - they are backwards - and the start button should always be the different color.  I keep hitting Stop because of its position and color.  Drives me nuts.Second, the default on microwaves should be a timed cook - I should just be able to hit a few numbers and the Start button.  But on this one, I have to hit the Timed cook button first.  Otherwise the number buttons are used for ""1 touch cook"" which I hate with a passion.Third, its a bit loud for its size, but I can live with that.This is really a 4-star item, but because I hate the 1-touch-cook buttons so bad, it loses another star.PROS- Decent price- Really good lookingCONS- Button placement, button design and UX- A bit on the loud side"
After 5 months the turntable is making a popping sound like popcorn. Other than that it's been good. Cheap microwave. Wouldn't buy again.
Every couple years I have to buy a new one because the paint insideblister and falls off.  don't know why but it seems to happen on allmicrowaves I use. Very discouraging !
I gave this to my daughter and bought a different one. I would have returned it if it wasn't such a big item. Realize the watts. It didn't heat up very fast. Took forever compared to our last one. Also it was smaller than I realized. The size was the same as my old one but it ended up being  much smaller.We bought it for the silent mode but I would have gone with a different Brand.
"Overall it does what it's suppose to do, it's a decent microwave. I dislike the rotation wheel circle under the plate, the plate passes it on rotation and keeps making a clanking sound. The interior light is a daylight bulb, I hate it lol. They have no place in my home.. There is a very strong burnt plastic smell on your first couple of uses,i hope it stops soon. There's probably better options unless this is on sale and the price is right."
"For the most part this microwave works. It heats the food. However, we are perplexed as to why 1. We are unable to press the stop button while the microwave is on. 2. Can't add time while it's on. Too cumbersome to bother to return.  Kept it."
I bought this to replace a Walmart cheap Hamilton Beach which lasted about 2 and half years. So I thought I would get a better one that would last longer. But I think this unit may be a returned item that they put back on the shelf and resold.I got this one and I first noticed a strange sound coming from the turn table motor sometimes. So I immediately bought a warranty policy to cover it. That sound has gone away for the most part but it has started to take longer to cook things. Items that took 2 minutes it now takes 2 minutes and 20 seconds. At what point does it become an issue? So I’ll let them know and put them on notice. We’ll see how Amazon handles this and I’ll let you know. So far they have been really good about taking care of issues.i buy just about everything from these amazon so i would expect them to take care of it
Serious sparking and flames seen from inverter area when it  finally died. Unit was much louder than the new Farberware we replaced it with.  Other than that it was very functional while it worked.
"I had and old microwave. No comparison with this one.  It is  not bad but the quality has not comparison. Hard to open, noisy to close.  It is very powerful,  so at the beginning experiment with the time needed to defrost or warm something.  Assembly is quite cheap. Overall not a bad microwave that serves my purpose defrost and/or worm up food."
After three years the door switch is failing so the microwave motor and lights run whenever the door is open.  Very disappointing!
I purchased this April 2022. Works great but I starting noticing rusting forming along the interior back seam after about a year. The rusting continues to progress. Never had standing water or any known reasons for this rusting. Never an issue with any previous microwave ovens.
"I like the microwave but..,.. it is falling apart on the surface.  The trim is coming off. Pretty disappointing!"
I’ve had this microwave just over two years and it’s already ready to blow up ☹️  Before that it worked great
"I bought this microwave in 2020 based on the reviews, despite some negative ones, as the positive feedback seemed to outweigh the bad. In the beginning, like most things, it worked wonderfully. However, after nearly five years, I’ve started having problems. The rotation feature stopped working, and the microwave seems to have a mind of its own—sometimes it turns on by itself when no one is in the room. Even though the rotation doesn’t work, I can still use it, but closing the door has become a real hassle. When I set the time, I have to prop something against the door to keep it shut, otherwise, the microwave stops, and even that doesn't always help. If I were an expert in fixing microwaves, maybe it wouldn’t be such an issue, but for the $97 I paid, I’m just trying to make it last as long as possible."
"I loved this microwave for the time I had it, but it only lasted 2 years, then it started arcing with anything you put in it."
The only thing I don’t like is that the glass turntable does not stay in place.
"This counter microwave didn’t last one year. Lots of random sparking, and finally smoke. Fire hazard!"
I've had this microwave for three years now and it's rusting inside.  Is that considered normal wear and tear?  Disappointed in Toshiba.  Called and they said rusting is uncommon and the unit is out of warranty.Beware
"Decent microwave but piece of junk to program cooking times, temps, etc. Would not buy another."
"Handle was dented, sticks out like a sore thumb"
This is one of the weirdest microwaves to.operate.  I thought that it avedcould be placed under the counter but it is more suited for inside the cabinet.  Disappointing
"Wish I'd got another Panasonic, Dooh! It's nice, don't get me wrong.  It has cooked/warmed everything I have needed it for.  But the keypad is not illuminated and very hard to see in anything but full lighting.  The short cut buttons are almost a complete mystery?  As are most other features on this thing.  Looks like the typical engineering department had to much influence on the instruction manual writing.  It is a good 2nd place to the equivalent Panasonic in my opinion. Or try to be different and give it a try like me. Err?"
"It was nice while it lasted, 3 1/2 years, which I guess is good these days. But today it died, dramatically. There was a bang and then flames they didn’t last, but the inside of the microwave is a mess. And now I need to find a new one."
"We bought the first one had Wobbly legs, called support and was told the legs were not adjustable.  Return and opted to have the microwave.  The second one, same thing."
"Purchased in 2020, caught fire while heating veggies in a Pyrex glass dish (no metal) in April of 2024.  Been calling support for a week now seeing if they will do anything.I’d be disappointed if the microwave just dies or didn’t work so well in just 3-4 years from purchase.  Catching fire with no warning is a bit of a bigger deal; especially followed by mediocre customer service at best (assuming they actually repair/replace eventually).  Will wait and see before I decide if I’m blacklisting Toshiba as a brand for our household."
"While this microwave suited my new apartment's needs, it has an annoying ability to cause almost anything I heat up (not overheating) to splash up or burst. I think that the microwave is not as unform as it could be. Some areas are super hot, others cold. Would not buy another one."
"We had this microwave for almost 2 years. Unfortunately, it started setting fire every time we turned it on. Kind of like it would do if it had foil in it, but it did not have anything in it at all, and it would still do it. We are having to throw it out now because it is very dangerous. It looks to us like one of the actual parts to the microwave has been burned through, and possibly exposing metal. It even started toWe had this microwave for almost 2 years.

We are having to throw it out now because it is very dangerous. It looks to us like one of the actual parts to the microwave has been burnt through, and possibly exposing metal. It even started to burn The wall behind it. Aso note: This microwave seemed powerful when we first got it, but after less than a year it was harder to get things to heat up. What used to take one minute, would now take 3 to 4 minutes. It definitely lost power over time."
It not what I expected it’s kind of noice but I will continue using it and see what happens if not I returned it
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            At first I really liked how quiet this microwave was, but a few days ago it started making noises and today it was so clunky and audible that I filmed it. A few hours later it started sparking when my husband used it. Unfortunately I'm a week past my return window, but I'm so pissed this thing only lasted 5 weeks! Definitely not worth it."
"Please, provide the specifics as far as damages that comes with the merchandise"
"First, I wouldn't trade this throwback to the 70's for three times its price. I find it absurd and not a little obscene to charge consumers for silence. The scenario of working- or poor people getting the noisiest, beeping-est, microwave, because that's all they can afford, having their sleep disturbed in close quarters, is SOO offensive. It's like paying more for foods with less sodium.For as much as I LOVE this microwave for the d*mn silence, I'm writing a review after a month-and-a-half ownership to warn people that the turntable is extremely unstable. This is the matter of bewilderment, because the turntable isn't lightweight. It goes off track so easily, and I worry that if I don't keep a very close eye on it while it begins heating whatever's inside, the turntable might remain stable.I would buy this again, no question, but for people disabled with motor-related disabilities, and definitely for households with children allowed to use the microwave, I'm writing this review to call your attention to this deficit. It is a deficit. I have a loud, 5-beep, cheap, 700-watt Hamilton Beach microwave whose turntable goes off-track only if I pull it. I have never owned a microwave where the turntable is as easily dislodged as it is with this Toshiba.So buy it, but beware."
"It's OK. Not recommended for homes with children. Here is why not: When you put a cup of water in the oven, once the water is heated and ready to be removed from the oven, the handle of the cup will almost always be facing backwards, towards the back of the oven. Very dangerous to remove a cup of hot water from this oven for children. Quite exasperating, actually. Esp when we know that it would be very easy to always have a cup handle be facing frontwards in the end, with proper engineering. So this is why I only give it three stars. Oh, and the rotating glass platter, it works, but it is wobbly. Another danger for things like bowls and cups full of hot liquid! Oh, and the number buttons do not work that well. The numbers are large enough, but you cant just hit the number. Only the high part of the number buttons will respond. (!) Go figure!One more thing: It takes two hands to open the door of this oven. The door closes so tight, (this may actually be a good thing), that you need one hand to hold back the microwave, and the other hand to yank open the door. (No, I am not making this stuff up.) Other than this, its not a bad little oven for adults (only)."
We’ve loved this microwave but less than a year into having it the bottom of the microwave paint has started chipping off. We’ve been very good about cleaning it and I don’t see any reason why this would be happening so soon after we bought it. Once the metals start showing it is more likely to have issues with radiation in the food and that’s scary so I’ll be having to buy a whole new microwave less than a year later.Also the 7/8/9 numbers never worked but that wasn’t a huge deal cause we worked around it.
I just got this Microwave May 4th an it not working can I get a replacement
"It's quiet, that's a big plus.  But I hate that I can't use the cooking mode and the minute timer at the same time as I did on my LG. It's one or the other, period.  Plus even after you open the door, the timer keeps beeping for its requisite 5 times. I tried turning the sound off, but found myself not realizing the cooking cycle had stopped - inconvenient. Also, I have to be careful because the glass cooking platform comes off the track really easily - not good!  But as I said in the headline, for the price it's pretty good. Bottom line, it gets the job done.12 Jan 2019 - Just adding a P.S.  I would not buy this again. In addition to what I said in my first review above, I have found that, for no reason that I've been able to find, the steam stays inside the microwave and no matter what I do, I have to wipe it out before using it to heat a second item. It's not that the vents are covered or have insufficient space - they aren't and they do! I guess it just comes under ""you get what you pay for"".  Will start looking for a Panasonic or another brand that I know to be dependable."
"I have had this for 6 months now and i am very disappointed!The glass plate doesn't sit well , it feels it goes in waves, loud sounds when rotates.The door glass broke instantly when i hit it with a cup of coffee that i wanted to warm up.It wasn’t a hard it , but the glass broke in small pieces.It doesn't heat/warm up evenly at all.The plate glass is very unbalanced.Would not recommend!"
"This is a nice looking Microwave. Operates great, cooks well. I really liked it, then, after having it 14 months or so, the LED light started flickering after being on a few minutes. This is annoying, as I normally also leave the door to the microwave cracked open a bit after microwaving something, to let the smell, humidity, whatever out of the microwave.I search online, and read the bulb is not replaceable. Also, iIread that many other people have this issue. Warranty is only 1 year, so, Toshiba will not cover this.It's a shame. This is a nice microwave, but, that LED bulb does not just flicker, it flickers fast, like a strobe light, and from what I have read, this will just get worse.Also, while searching for solutions, I read in the reviews for the 1.2 Cu. Ft. model for this Toshiba microwave, that models manufactured from October 2018 no longer use an LED bulb, and Toshiba replaced it with an incandescent bulb. Sure enough, the product listing for the 1.2 Cu. Ft model no longer lists it as having an LED bulb.I suggest, if you are thinking about keeping this microwave anymore than a year, do not buy this model. The 1.2 Cu. Ft model is not much larger, and it has a more reliable bulb.A flickering bulb may not sound like much of a big deal, but, it's only been a few days here, and it's already a bit annoying and distracting. Do not buy this model, buy the 1.2 Cu. Ft. model, and before putting it to use, make sure it is not old stock that has the LED bulb."
"I've had this flimsily-made microwave oven since last January.Within the last couple of months I observed that the light would randomly flicker, which was not a big deal for me. But today I found that the non-metallic off-white rectangle near the light grid appears to have suffered an electrical arc - a black, burned out area.UPDATE: 10/30/2019After quite a bit of ridiculous customer service processes (including RESUBMITTING a longer vid re: the flickering light, as if they didn't already know about a light-flickering problem - as in MANY other reviews - Toshiba (Midea), finally  sent a refund. Absolutely ridiculous customer ""service"". Now I need to purchase a boat because I already own an anchor.Apparently, there's more than just a light flickering activity going on, and that scares me, since microwave ovens are very high voltage.I've found two things: 1. There are many negative reviews about the same problems with this and another Toshiba microwave - I should have read the negative reviews before purchasing this unit.2. I checked out other microwave brands to see their reviews (especially the negative ones), and many of them have identical verbiage ""Dear friend..."" in their rubber-stamped corporate response, only the customer service number is different, which leads me to believe that several brands are manufactured by the same company - check it out.I called Toshiba, and they had me email to them an image of my Amazon invoice, an image of the electrical arc burn, and a video of the flickering light. I am awaiting further communication from them, and I'll update my review as things occur. I asked for a refund, since so many reviewers were unhappy with their replacement ovens."
"Was very happy with the microwave initially! A little small, probably perfect for an apartment but the price was great. Just disappointed that it only lasted 3 months! One day it just stopped heating up our food. I can’t return it so I have to spend more money on a new one. 👎🏽"
"Purchased September 2020, and needed replacing within 2 years. Worked well with no complaints for a while, but now the inside of the door is rusted and the microwave turns on by itself at random if left plugged in."
"The box that the microwave was delivered in was damaged, and my packages were delivered to my front door even though I  Specifically specified for them to be delivered to my back door. Luckily my microwave was not damaged."
"Picked one of these up after my less than a year old Kenmore decided to die with the rest of Sears.  Was an Amazon Choice product, and the price was cheap, so i snagged it, and curbed the other one. In the six months i've had it, i can honestly say.It's decent enough.Not great, it's only 900 watts, so you'll have to adjust cook times since basically everything is designed for 1200wkeypads and timer work fine, but  so far the plastic on the control buttons has started to de laminate very quickly.  It's not the plastic that everything ships with, it's literally the keypad separating layers.  The LED lighting went all wonky and stopped working a month or two ago.The turntable is neat, but really likes to pop off the spinner and jam up at random intervals,If you need a microwave for your dorm room or a rec room, this is fine. It gets the job done with minor hassles, little complaints here and there. But if you're using this regularly with a group of people, it shows it's wear remarkably quickly. It still works fine, mind you, but there are better options available."
"My company has the same microwave so I decided to buy one for myself. It ran fine for month or so, but then became pretty loud all of a sudden. Unfortunately, I missed the return window."
"I purchased this microwave for the bar we built in our basement We don't use the bar often but I wanted a microwave down there to heat up stuff and make popcorn.  I unpackaged it, set it on the counter and plugged it in.  It came right on so I was happy with it.  I unplugged it and it's been on the counter ever since, along with the other items (blender, coffee maker - all which are unplugged until used) Fast forward to today - the first time I'm actually going to use it as I have guests coming to hang out at our bar.  I plug it in.  Nothing.  I search all over to see if there's a reset or a power button.  Nothing.  I test the outlet - everything else works in it.  I watch the video Amazon provided, no help because there is no on button.  I'm beyond the 90 days for support because who would think a BRAND NEW product wouldn't work the first time you use it.  I also can't get a refund or return it so I wasted my money.  I can't give this less than one star and would give it zero stars if I could."
"I have a Toshiba laptop from 2012 that has been running for over ten years, no problems, great audio (HarmonKardon) etc., so I thought a Toshiba microwave would be great too. And it did run, from October 2020 to June 2023, then it unexpectedly operated with a weird buzzing noise, and no longer would heat. I'm guessing a Capacitor relating to the ""Cyclotron"" went out. Loved the fact that it had a handle, had well-laid out controls. 90% of the time I would run iot for only 2 or 3 minutes at a time (to heat coffee or water or to mnelt the cheese on some hot dogs and buns etc.) My old Cuisinart microwave was well over 10 years old when it began to spark because the interior was rusting out, but at least it was still working. This Toshiba model just decided to quit, no rust or other apparent problems. Not too bad for about $100, but still only 2.8 years of use lol"
"This microwave was Amazon‘s choice. I bought it and after two months, the function panels shorted out and it started smelling chemicals. I asked for a replacement through Toshiba and they told me they didn’t give replacements that if I would follow their guidelines, they would look into it and refund the money. Such a nasty experience. Will never buy another Toshiba product."
"I replaced my previous microwave due to the endless beeping sounds with each use.The Toshiba silent mode works well.  I immediately activated it and have no complaints. Once the sound is off it stays off.My complaint is the door closing cannot be done without making a loud noise. Even with care, closing makes too much noise. Attempting to Close the door slowly creeks like a rusty hinge and still loudly slams. The microwave is a cheaply made metal box and it amplifies the sound of closing. The handle is just a push/pull, with no lift to release."
"I loved it until it until this happened. I've never moved it except just enough to keep it clean under and around it. I clean the interior whenever it gets food on it. I don't understand why it broke so soon. Acoule of weeks ago, the interior light started flickering and I could feel this strange sensation. Thought it was the flickering light. Then shortly after the light went out  and I could still feel that weird sensation. So I checked it today and it's leaking radiation. Read the warranty. Wish I had bought an extended. Seems microwave manufacturers have tons of arbitration clauses, disclaimers and limits, just in case something like this happens.  I have been feeling a bit strange since this started happening. Hope it clears up. If it doesn't, I'll see the doctor and update this post.  I honestly was hooked on this brand and still don't want to believe it, but it's true. I was looking to replace it, because of the light, with a Panasonic with the child and extra safety features. Now I'm not sure if I want one at all."
Very loud compared to the 2001 unit it replaced. Not impressed at all
"I've owned this product for about 4 years. It's digital clock has always run fast, gaining about a minute every month or so.During the time that I've owned it, it has worked reliably with infrequent use. I typically use it maybe once every week or two. I did use the kitchen timer feature daily.About a month ago, the machine started having problems.  Without it having been touched or used, the machine would issue a constant and ongoing ""BEEEEEP!"". It fixed itself after being unplugged and plugged back in. It did this about 3 times since. Then, yesterday, it barely heated/melted some butter and the machine seemed to smoke.So, the machine worked well with infrequent use for about 4 years, but now no longer seems safe.According to a websearch, a typical microwave should last 7-8 years with proper and regular use.This means my machine failed at around halfway thru a typical lifespan."
Microwave turntable spins and light turns on when door is opened.  The microwave underwent normal use.  Very disappointed with the lack of quality and durability of the product.
"The microwave is a workhorse. Easy enough to clean, works reliably for 3 1/2 years, and then the light started blinking.Initially it only blink a little bit when it runs, then it started blinking more and more, eventually it becomes a strobe light when microwave is running and stay off when it is done cooking.As they use LED bulb, lightbulb is not something you can find easily find. LED bulb are supposed to last longer, but not in this case.I had to remove the bulb, and is now on a task to look for another microwave.Do not expect this microwave to serve a long time - it has part that will break and you can't find replacement of"
Too much condensation inside after cooking. Top got pretty hot after cooking for a long time.
Low quality microwave that didn’t last more than a couple of years. Really disappointed with the quality… I expect more from Toshiba. It’s now trashed. The electronics started sparking…
"If you’re going to purchase this microwave, don’t ever walk away and let it run. Fortunately I was standing nearby when my microwave lit on fire after just 1 minute of heating something. It happened the first week I owned it, but I wrote it off to “maybe it was the container” (it wasn’t).I went on to use it for another year and a half or so, but then it started on fire again 2 days ago - an actual fire inside, this time there was what looked like smoke coming from the ceiling of the unit. Yes, I had to try it again to be sure, and again, fire (unit was clean inside).I’m surprised they’re still selling this, but please, if you do purchase it — please don’t ever walk away while it’s running. I was standing nearby each time or it could have set my entire house on fire."
"I would give zero stars because this was unusable and very dangerous. The microwave was taken out of the box, plugged in, and tested with a microwave safe glass bowl with water in it. The power cord jiggled at the point where it enters the microwave and felt insecure. Upon pressing start on the control panel, I noticed that there are no power settings. You cannot change the power, it's just start and stop. This is a poor design choice that I wouldn't think someone would have to look out for in the list of  features since this has been a standard feature for decades.Upon this initial use of microwaving a bowl of water, the control panel flashed, buzzed, and sparks were flying from the electrical components of the interior of the microwave. There was smell of hot plastic and I unplugged the microwave. I plugged it back in and the same thing occured and had to quickly unplug it. I was never able to test this product because within seconds of trying it, it almost caught on fire. I've never experienced this with any kind of electronic device. The quality control would seemingly be terrible since this did not work at all out of the box. It appears to be made of low quality components and even if it worked correctly, the cost is way too high in my opinion for such a simple microwave. The crisper feature appears to be a heating element on the top of the interior of the microwave. I was unable to test this feature as the microwave was unsafe to use. Even if this microwave worked, I wouldn't recommend it because of it's lack of power control and the low quality construction and components. A return and refund has been requested."
"This microwave seemed to be everything I wanted, but I'm disappointed that I cannot alter the power level of the microwave.  It looks nice, and it works well on full microwave power.  I have not used it for crisping yet.  The direction booklet does not provide information on how to use the crisping element for anything other than the presets.  Overall, I'm disappointed with this microwave."
"On day one I  bought this microwave , to replace a dead Panasonic, it did a fine job of warming up my tea. The second day it started to get a bit  louder on the tea warmup.  2 weeks later it sounded like Airwolf taking off and that was enough.  So, I sent it back for a replacement  and they decide to return me a totally different Chefman Microwave that was even cheaper than this one. I sent that back for a full refund and bought a pricier  Sharp microwave which is quite a bit quieter.  My advice any kind of funny noise ....send it back right away."
"It works fine. It’s a microwave, not much to say about that. But calling this a “stainless steel” microwave is super misleading. Only the faceplate is faux stainless steel, all other sides are black. So unless you are looking at it directly face on, you’re going to see black. Looking at it from above? It’s a black microwave. Looking at it from the side? It’s a black microwave. Getting a mostly black microwave with a cheap faux stainless finish on only the faceplate was super disappointing."
The noise is a bit louder than desired. The interior space is large and the exterior is nice looking. The beep is loud and does not stop even when you open the door. The buttons are poor quality and takes some getting used to for the right pressure for them to work. I would not purchase this if you value sound quality and button ease.
Love that I could turn off the very loud beeper.  The countertop microwave itself runs loud too.
False advertising. Doesn’t crisp at all.
When first plugged in it tripped the breaker. Then eco mode would not work. Push button 8 for 3 seconds and says off but lights dont go off.I can live with it because big item to return. Just hoping there arent other issues with the oven. Hasnt tripped breaker since.
"Upon receiving the glass table, ring and drive shaft were loose and rattling around inside. Why they were not broken I have no idea. When this thing operates it emits a lot of vibration noise. The control system is also nowhere near as intuitive/smart as more expensive name brands. So it earns a three as it is inexpensive yet works, so far. I got no operators manual either so I have a guessing game ahead of me."
"I have had this micowave for a month now. Really wanted to like it, but the things I dislike are important features that this microwave just doesn't have.1.  The beep alert sound is way too low.  Even in the quietest setting you can barely hear it and I have extemely sensitive hearing.2. You can NOT adjust the power.  I've never had a microwave where you could not do this.  I've searched to see if I was missing something, a step, on how to accomplish this and it is just not there. Very disappointing as there are items that require 50% power and you can't get that with this microwave.3. The kitchen timer is crap!!!!! Another feature I use many times a day.  You can set it, but it will shut off to whatever the clock time is.  Example:  If I set the timer for 5 minutes and it is 2:02 in the afternoon, the timer shuts off at 2:02.  If I set the timer for 10 minutes, and the time is 4:15 pm, the timer shuts off at 4:15!  I've unplugged, try resetting, and get the same result every time!  If my husband had not thrown out the packing from the box, (I kept the box) this thing would have been returned within the return period.4.  The clock is weird.  Do not like that it shows a 0 in front of the numbers like military time when the time is not in the double digits.A complete waste of money for our family.  The only positive thing I can say, is the interior is attractive and easy to clean."
I bought this microwave over the summer. I haven't used it that much. I have noticed that it is very loud  once it comes on. I hear a loud humming noise. It sounds like a microwave back in the early 90's. It also is blowing fuses in the kitchen (every time it's used). I don't use it anymore  (due to this problem).
"Woks as well as any microwave I've had in the past, its just loud when running"
"I mean,, it works just fine. Looks fine. It's just that it makes so much noise when it's on that it's annoying.  Sounds cheap rattling."
The crisp option really does not work. You might get the top of something crisp but almost burnt. Makes the underside soggy. Better off to buy microwave and airfryer and save money. Bought to save space and 2 appliances in one. wasted money. Microwave works and heats quickly. It is quiet.Save your self money buy an air fryer and microwave seperately.
I do not like the spectacle that seems to be lodged in the door window… it cannot be removed unless you take the window apart…too frustrated as I never got to use it once out the box!!!!
"This item is big, bulky and loud yet it does not heat a cup of coffee in 30 seconds- you need to put it for 1 minute. Very disappointed"
"It looks nice seems to work ok but the noise is lowed when it's running, hope it holds up??"
The noise. Was advertised as quiet. Is not! Noisiest one I have ever owned.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I replaced a microwave with this one and the interior light blew.I’m disappointed that this occurred and hope it is not indicative of the assembled appliance.Amazon c service did not listen and did not give me any information about how to get a replacement light bulb.Calling the manufacturer tmr.Follow up to this original review received the replacement and that is the video shown.At this point, I just asked for a refund as I have had to bring these up and down the apt stairs where I love and still do not have a functioning microwave.Disappointed in item and Amazon Customer Service"
"It is very small compared to what I was used to. The popcorn button doesn't do enough time to pop a whole bag.. Haven't tried the ""crisp"" function yet"
"I had it for just under 6 months, then one day I turned it on and it sounded ""funny"" and it blew a few fuse in my home. Now Amazon wants a ""restocking fee"" in order for me to return it. F Bezos."
"The microwave does a decent job of heating food and beverages. However, it’s very loud."
I have had this microwave for 4-5 months.  Absolute garbage!  Do not buy!  The one I replaced that was 17 year old worked better than this one.
"This microwave oven is much louder than the one it replaced. It also uses over 1800 watts rather than the specified 1000 watts. The only things going for it, in my opinion, are the ability to mute beeps and the push button to open the door."
Worked for only a month than it stopped heating the food. had to return it.
Ales a lot of noise. Bought 6 months ago. It sparking
"This is second MICROWAVE i hsve tried.  First one was 4-combination microwave, air fryer, Broiler, baker. Should have known better. It was just too complicated and everything turned out the same. This one is weird, but I’m going to keep it rather than go through the hassle of returning it. There is no way to adjust the power i.e. 50% , 80%  Etc. chkices are specific items: melt, defrost, chicken, pizza, but they all seem to be the same power. There is a MICRO/ CRISP which i have only tried once .  Saw no results.Would not  uy againTried to get input from Customer Sevice but was. Told I would have to wait five or seven days to talk to a Customer support agent. That means it would be past the 30 day limit for returning items to Amazon. Lacking any help from customer service. I am going to return the microwave and buy one in person at one of the local retailers, definitely do not recommend this product to anyone"
It works good but when using it is noisy ! The space for the start is already peeling off.  It's heavy but heats up good and cooks a sweet potato fast.
"Main problem: The glass plate did not fit into the support so it didn't spin properly. It spun at a different speed than it should have so heated my food unevenly.Problem 2: One of the feet was too short so it rocked back and forthProblem 3: Even after using it for 7 days, it still had a chemical smell. Perhaps this would have dissipated after some time"
"Not very happy with this microwave it makes very weird noises. It takes forever to cook bacon and does not cook potatoes very well. about the only thing it’s good for is reheating leftovers or cooking TV dinners.  I have spoke with the manufacturer I would have returned it, but I was beyond the date to send it back"
"This microwave came with no instructions of any kind, it didn’t heat food evenly and was extremely noisy, save your money"
"A response will always be a late. One has to constantly use a microwave to warm food up, but the fact that it came with no instruction manual...really? I can't even press ""half"" numbers for seconds-damn shame..."
This is a large heavy package and having to return because the door will not open.  Even contacted customer support and the product is faulty.
"Bought September 28, 2023. The rotating mechanism that turns the plate all of the sudden started making a loud sound and was turning slowly. The bad thing is that it works properly and sometimes it doesn’t. Haven’t heard anything from the manufacturer yet. Wouldn’t recommend this brand."
"Got this microwave to do two things:  pop popcorn and cook bacon.  When I put two pieces of bacon in the microwave for three minutes, it nearly started a fire.  As the photo shows, a portion of the bacon was literally vaporized.  It was like the magnetron was focused on one spot and put the full energy of the unit into a 1 inch square.  Any longer and it would have caught fire.  And yes, the turntable was rotating.  I tried it twice more with similar outcomes.Thanks to Amazon for having such a great return policy.  This thing is going back ASAP!"
"Worked ok, but big, and quite loud operation."
"It's loud, runs loudly and the auto settings make no sense"
Micro features- no complaints. Crisper feature is fairly useless. We’ve only had it for 2 months and already had issues of the unit not working or responding to anything. Ran diagnostics and nothing fixed it for the troubleshooting methods so if I could replace with a basic microwave I would.
Nothing more to say
This microwave doesn’t work. It only worked for 32 days. Now it will not heat up food.
"The glass plate is now making a racket inside the microwave, no idea why, only 3 months old and I may have to return it."
The clock part of this microwave does not work but not worth the hassle of returning it .
stopped working after 2 months
too much clearance required.  states 10 inches!
It made soggy but with some crispy edges frozen pizza.  Just a basic microwave
I like the crisping feature I just wish it had come with everything it was supposed to.
"The squeaking is crazy, sounds like it’s going to explode. Also, it takes a lot longer to heat up"
We are 2 senior adults. Exactly 32 days after purchase we had to use a knife to open up door. Couldn't return it-- so we threw it out. Bought a different brand.Heard something rattle inside and latch would not work .
The crispy function on microwave don't work I've use it more than once on pizza and chicken and it didn't work it didn't warm my food or kept it crispy at all! I'm thinking about returning it I'm not happy with this oven!
This microwave is  defective it keeps throwing the breaker. I reached out for help and none was given I am just stuck with a defective microwave shame on this company for not standing by their product
"It’s extremely loud first starting off then about 15 seconds of running it quiets a little. Scary part is when it firsts starts it has a grinding noise, like loose parts grinding together and it goes away also."
"6 minutes, fine. 2 TV dinners at 6 minuteseach, and one of you will not get dinner...over and over we've tried. Just overheats and shuts down completely. Comes back to life hours later, once nobody cares ro try."
This microwave works good but is loud.. Update: Don't waste your money. Takes twice as long to heat anything.  More noise now than when I first reviewed.
"I use this BRAND NEW product very rarely.  Six times out of ten, it causes a circuit to trip.  Not recommended."
"Unfortunately, I didn't save the box. It is so not user friendly."
I've never purchased a microwave and thought oh wow I need to return this immediately. Not only are multiples of these being delivered damaged by UPS. My box was dented. And the top doesn't quite match up to the door. But it operated but it's loud. It does heat up really fast I've only used it a few times but I'm going to return it because this should not be over $50 let alone $100. I shouldn't have to put a heavy pan on it to keep it from rattling.
The unit kept tripping house breaker no matter where we plugged it. On last uses started making a horrible noise.
Received the box with a hole on the side. The box was taped with plastic wrapping so i had to open ir and find out the Oven is completely damaged.  I had to put it back and carry it to UPS to return this item. It should have never been shipped to me in the first place!!!
Extremely unhappy.  Stopped heating and no workable support available.
"Since the first week we had it, this microwave periodically surges and trips our circuit breaker.  (Regardless of where we plug it in and it being the only appliance on that breaker).  We contacted customer support which lead us to the manufacturer.  They wanted a video of the problem, which is difficult to provide because it happens unpredictably.  After finally submitting  a claim with the manufacturer, we have still heard NOTHING in reply.  This unit is a waste of money, not to mention dangerous."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It was fine at first, but as soon as the return window closed it started making this really loud whining sound as if two whales were mating. Very disappointing. Do not buy this microwave"
Microwave had loud buzzing and ticking sound during operation.  Returned it.
I just got this yesterday. Plug it in and hit start button. Surge the pop. My son said it blew the fuse. he went and turned it back on. He uses it.. I am afraid it will blow a fuse or worse yet.. start a fire... is it safe to use or should I send it back?
"Stopped working after 4 months!! Piece of junk. My other microwave before this one, different brand, lasted me 6 years. Now this microwave is in the garbage. Please buy something else! Wish I could give negative stars"
"First, it came without the user guide and you can't find one easily online.  Second, the release button would not allow the door to open.  Third, tried contacting Chefman's support and got an automated response that it will be 5-7 business to get a response.  So we are unable to use it and will have to return it.  Disappointed as we really wanted it to work and waited extra days living without a microwave to receive this model:-("
Worked fine till it didn’t work at all just under 4 months
"Annoying sound ,too loud"
"Had this product for 2 months. It won’t heat food, customer service is piss poor, and the troubleshooting is wack. Do not buy"
Microwave delivered today. Plugged it in and ran 3 cycles to test it. Extremely loud ! Need to return
The box it came in was damaged and the microwave itself had dents and scratches
Worst microwave ever.  Not only is it noisy but It is constantly tripping the circuits.  I have it plugged into the same circuit as my old one so I Know its not the circuit.  I can't even have a light on when I use this thing.
"low quality plus when you press to function, the bottom is scratch, i'm stick i could'nt returned the mictowavelowed noise when you close the door."
I should have gotten a microwave oven without the crisper
The defrost setting doesn't work.  Cooks too hot.  The crisp function takes forever .  Skip.
Worked twice. Nothing after that. Tried calling the company. Nothing! Don't buy!!
Doesn't heat properly it takes forever for good to get hot poor quality Things that would beat upIn my previous microwave takes three times longer
It shuts off during cooking pops breaker thru it in the garbage
I would NOT recommend this to anyone. It worked for 24 hours and then just stopped working and wont turn on.
This microwave does not work well at all. You must cook longer than stated and I cannot get the crisper to work. Should have bought a cheaper one.
"Returning- set off fire alarm @ 4 minutes- knocked tv and remote out twice, turntable so hot I couldnt touch it-"
Sounds like popcorn is popping when operating.  Have only had 3 months.
There's no light inside! Doesn't complete even a five minute set time.
"Be aware that this microwave doesn’t have the option to choose to reduce the power. For example, 10 minutes @ 50% power. Or 10 minutes @30% power. I use this option often and was so disappointed that this unit lacked that option that I returned it to Walmart and bought a microwave for half the price that DOES give that option."
"Have had this microwave, for 4 months, and carousel grumbles.All I do with it is reheating coffee"
You can only use once if any moisture is involved then it won't work for at least an hour would not recommend it to anyone
I really liked this microwave. We've had it since June didn't have any problems with it until a few days ago. I started smelling a burning plastic/electric smell opened up the back of it to see if there was any visable problems and found a fried wire.
The power level cannot be changed on this microwave.  Most frozen meals have some portion of the cooking time to be at 50%.  Why would anyone make a microwave where the power could not be changed?  Grossly disappointed with the product!
"I got this as a gift, it's a nice quality microwave,  but it's extremely noisy when it's cooking something."
The microwave would never power on (tried multiple outlets).  Had to box it back up and ship it back.  6 weeks later I got a partial refund and I’m out $43.
doesn't function as well as the one I originally had
Updateafter 2 months using it now is so loud and sounds broken insideDO NOT BUYquality constructioneasy to useeasy to cleaneven heatingi would recommend
I have had this for just under 2 months and you could smell something burning and it started smoking. Does not work. NOT A HAPPY CAMPER.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The description said slight scratches to the front and it came totally trashed, but it does work so this is my review. It works, but it’s ugly."
"Okay, fryer not really satisfactory and it is large so wouldn't buy it twice but missed the return window."
Disappointed in this. Photo of item on Amazon shows bright white lettering on the panel.Item does not exhibit such as expected.My former microwave of near 25 years was more readable.
"Very easy to use only thing I don’t like is the product is very lightweight, I set it on top of the shelf in the kitchen so there is no wall on the back to support. Every time when open the door or close the door the microwave will very easy move so is not so balanced. Thank you"
"I'm very disappointed with this microwave oven. While it looks very attractive on my counter, it doesn't heat well. I bought it for heating my cup of coffee in the morning and cooking frozen tv dinners. I find using the recommended time, leaves them lukewarm. Terrible. Instead of 6 or 7 minutes, I. Have to leave it cook to 11 to 12. Even then, it heats unevenly. I also feel heat escape from door while cooking! I didn't keep the box, otherwise I'd return it!"
"It is a perfect size and is so quiet. The mute option is great when I just don’t want to hear the beeps. The down side is I was not aware that it had to have a 12” clearance from top of microwave to the bottom of cabinet above. Who has that much room between countertop and bottom of cabinets? It also  needs minimum 3” on back and left side and the right side must be open.  I had to end up putting it next to my sink away from cabinets. Looks really out of place but with these restrictions there was no other place to put it.  These placement restrictions need to be given BEFORE purchasing, in order to know if a person has a place for it.  12” is a lot of space above."
It’s a low cost microwave for making popcorn in the game room.
The oven this one replaced was over 25 years old and much heavier. Just opening and closing the door slides this unit. All works well though. Well satisfied with the operation. I bought a thin rubber mat to put under this oven to stop it from sliding. Good price.
"I never right review but I have to now. I bought this microwave a while ago because I got a good price on it but I did not use it until I moved  a week ago. This micro is very quiet and very slow but this is not the problem but I have square dinner plate and seems like it's hitting the inside of it. Inside this machine so small, so you have to watch out what do you put inside. Unfortunately I can't return it now. But this thing comes with ""Amazon's choice""! Should be a warning on it instead!! Just for small plates and covers!"
"poor design-when you open the door it almost pulls the microwave off the counter.I measured my space and bought accordingly, but the instructions say you need three-inch space on each side(That is 6 more inches) and one-foot extra space on top.  You need a large space to put this."
"The descriptive photos of this microwave show an appliance with a push-button opening mechanism. The actual microwave has a handle, that also is not visible in the photos on the box. I needed the push-button for the space where I intended to use this, so must return. BE AWARE OF THE HANDLE THAT JUTS OUT."
Works great but the turn table won’t stay in place. I would choose a different microwave if I had it to do over.
The microwave works fine but every time I go to turn it on I have to hit a rough spot with my finger and I think it's dirt and it's actually a defect in the display.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This ""was"" a good deal. The size was perfect as well as the features. But (see video), it clearly had some misfiring somewhere.I considered returning and replacing, but this was not offered. Only return.Ok, I'll buy again, but price went up $15.Bummer"
If something is to be warmed up for 2 minutes put some extra time on it because it is not very powerful. Good enough for sure and gets the job done with a little extra help.
Cute little microwave.  Fits a dinner plate but not larger bowls.  Not very powerful... In My old microwave it took 1min30 for a cup of coffee but this one takes 2 minutes to get the same heat
"Way smaller than I’d thought it’d be. Guess I need to pay attention! Heats food goodNo complaints other than size but again, my fault!"
"Not a powerful microwave at all. I’ve been using it for a few months and I am bummed the return period is over. You have to put double, sometimes triple the time that you would need to put in any other microwave."
"The damn glass plate always comes off the little carousel gear, it's maddening.I regret buying this"
Great for reheating a cup of tea.  It’s so light that it moves around a bit too much.
"This microwave is clunky, feels like the latch is going to snap every time you open it. The description is also inaccurate, it doesn’t come with a button to open, it’s a handle that runs along the front of the microwave nothing like it is pictured."
"It is small like we wanted, but it does not have power the old microwave had. Decided to check watts. Yep it uses 1050 watts not what is advertised!"
This microwave seems cheaply made. It sounds clanky when running and the words on the button panel have already started to come off.  I wouldn't buy this product again.
Not user friendly. Couldn’t figure out how to set clock. Don’t recommend and won’t but again
"I initially contacted chefman directly, and the customer service representative, Carmen, really did not want to give a refund for this faulty item. She obfuscated at every turn. I decided to take my chances with Amazon. They said they will pick up and replace item . Hoping for the best."
"I had the microwave for 2 weeks, Really liked it.Interior light burnt out. Had to return for refund.Metal microwave feet slips, when you push the microwave door open.Door swings open quickly.Microwave is light weight.Will try a different brand microwave."
"Waste of money.  I'd return it if that wouldn't be so much trouble.  I've followed the instructions carefully, step by step when possible, but that's not usually possible, because if the first step gets no results, then you can't do the second step.  For just one example, the instructions sometimes say that you won't need to press the Start button, but then nothing happens until and unless you do press the Start button.  Never again will I buy a major item from a brand I don't know.  I'll try to use this for about a year and then buy a better brand."
"I hate everything about this microwave. It is so cheap. It doesn't sit level so it rocks back and forth. Our old microwave and the one at my job heats up way faster than this one. I have to put a cup of room temperature water inside for 3 minutes to get it hot enough. I cooked a bag of steam fresh broccoli and it was still cold after 5 minutes. It is really loud but thank goodness you can silence it by holding the 8 button. It's still really loud when you shut the door. You have to hit a time cook button to put the time you want. It is too small, a Mason jar is too tall. I'm so disappointed but my boyfriend had already threw away the box."
"This is a great little countertop microwave. Functionally it's perfect. However, right out the box the top of the unit had a gouge in it and a dent. The box was not damaged in transit, so more than likely it was a return item, reboxed, and re-sold. Not worth the hassle to return, i can cover the blemishes with a nice piece of cloth...but maybe the quality control people look things over before re-boxing it and sending if off hoping you dont see it back again."
"Worked great at first, less than 8 months total use it will no longer heat."
This mircrowave did not work from the moment I got it. The packaged was damaged and I am very unsatisfied
"I ordered this in April 2024, by end of May it started making a popping and sparking sound as if it was going out. Contacted Chefman Support and sent them several videos and they said “their manager has this same unit and it’s working as it should”. A microwave should NOT be EMPTY making a popping and sparking sound. I have removed the plate, cleaned it, unplugged it and it’s still making the sound. $100 down the drain bc the noise is getting louder and worse..I’ve had older microwaves that don’t sound this way. Not pleased with this product or Chefman Support. I won’t be buying their product again."
"I have no idea why this microwave has such great reviews. This is the worst microwave I’ve ever used. The table doesn’t turn, the plate doesn’t fit and it is small. Can’t even pop popcorn. I’m warning - do not buy!"
"This product malfunctioned,  The minute I plugged it up,it started running and nothing made it stop"
"Heating element quit working November 26, almost two months to the day after purchase."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Extremely disappointed with this microwave! The door malfunction is a major issue - it doesn't close properly and requires force to shut, then fails to open after pressing the button. The quality is astonishingly cheap and unreliable.I strongly advise against purchasing this microwave. Instead, consider shopping at reputable retailers like Costco, Walmart, or Sam's Club for a better value and performance. This product is a clear example of 'you get what you pay for.' Avoid the frustration and invest in a quality appliance."
Save your money and don’t buy this horrible microwave. It barely heats up food & accumulates horrible smells & mold very easily! Never had a microwave that accumulates smell and mold before
I guess I felt mislead on the size and for that the price was high
"This item is not as big as I expected.  The plate that comes with it does not sit properly where it is supposed to go every time someone put something in or takes something out the microwave the plate moves from where it is supposed to sit.  Don't really like it, might have to return this"
Really weak takes forever to warm up leftovers which is what I generally bought it for. It doesn't heat properly even though I bought the biggest size.
"I took it out of the box and the microwave door wouldn’t open. Hadn’t even used it yet. Needed to return it but missed the return window.  So, to the curb it goes. What a waste."
Food doesn't get hot thè casing gets so hot it burns your hands I'm a loyal customer and this is what I get if I hadn't tore the box up I would send it back I can't even give it away it's  a fire hazard the way the casing gets hot you will burn your hands just by touching it I will go to target and purchase a microwave that works properly shame on you amazon a loyal customer treated like yesterday trash. I don't recommend to buy a chefman at all.
"I just received this microwave today, it had no protective film on it which leads me to believe it is one sent back. Popped a bag of popcorn in it and it took 3.5 minutes leaving half the popcorn unpopped but the outside of the microwave was so hot you could cook an egg on top of it. The metal casing around the outside is so thin. Worst microwave I have ever purchased. This microwave is only good for short warmups. Disappointed"
"It worked fine for 30 seconds usage but the first time I set it for 5 minutes after only 2 minutes it stopped. I thought it was a fuse but they were fine. then I checked my coffee maker that was plugged into same outlet and it worked fine. I also noticed the top of microwave was ""super"" hot. I unplugged it for 1/2 hour and it didn't work. Also says free returns, but only option was USPS drop off Store and it cost me almost $18 to return it. I contacted Amazon and they refunded me the shipping cost, thankfully. DEFINATELY DO NOT BUY"
"It slides around when opening and closing the door, it beeps 5 times when finished (once would be sufficient) and the glass tray is a big hassle to get lined up with the grooves it sits on!I bought this one because of the size to fit in a designated shelf for a microwave and I am happy with the size and appearance but that is all and would pay more to get better functionality."
"After a few months of owning this microwave it has developed a really unpleasant smell, it smells like urine and everyone at home says the same thing. The smell is there when you open the door."
It lasted only two months before the rotating plate broke and the microwave started giving off sparks. Not usable
It was not advertised as a compact.
"We purchased this microwave because it had decent reviews. It worked fine for the first 3 weeks. I like that you can silence the buttons. It heated food well. I liked the features. Unfortunately it started arcing randomly while in use. We don't have metal on any of our plates, etc. That was a bit scary. We immediately started a return on it. I wish it had worked out."
Doesn't heat food properly.  I think the delivery driver dropped it. The buttons are hard to see cause someone thought it would be a good idea to make them black like the rest of the microwave. I'm very disappointed.
The control panel fell out as soon as I opened the box.
The microwave came with dent and the box was bent in different areas.
It takes 6 minutes or more to heat something up. I wish I could get my money back the microwave was not worth the money not a good product.
A child's toy the easy bake oven is higher quality and works better than this junk of a micro wave just received..It's tin and most features do not work..It does not set even and the noise is extremely loud with lots of bumps and knock sounds..I have never received anything so bad as this I have bought online.Can t return it because the box got trashed.I will just throw it away and eat the cost.
"I've only had this microwave for a few months, it started giving me power and then it stopped working, when I try to turn it on it doesn't work, and it makes a terrible noise. I need my money back."
After using the microwave once- it stopped working and Amazon is not willing to do anything to resolve the issue and referred me to the manufacturer. Good waste of $100-
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This was my second one The first one was dropped and dented. They replaced it with this one and this one sounds like there's a loose piece that's click clacking as it turns. Not quiet at all. Refund please!
This product doesn't hold up with cooking. I was cooking in it and it just quit working. I unplugged it and waited and now it won't heat up my food at all.
Nothing worked on this!  We followed instructions and tried many times.  Oh well - at least othersgot a working one
Too small to even pop popcorn……
I don't even think I had it 6 months and it's making noise already
Cheap product
"Does not reheat well, smaller than expected. So light it moves when u open the door. I should have sent it back"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                This 700 watt microwave draws 1225 watts when running as witnessed in the video.  Rated input power is1050 Watts according to the label.
Microwaved something for 2 mins and the glass shattered in 3 only 2 months after buying
Does not heat right!  Returning this junk.
"I bought this microwave elsewhere, and I will never purchase another Chefman product ever again. Less than three months after purchasing it, it blew the wires connecting all of my countertop outlets and two outlets in the adjoining room. It is definitely the microwave because it tripped a surge protector when I moved it. Unfortunately, I didn’t keep my proof of purchase and screwed myself on the warranty."
Soo my mom brought this microwave and we tried to use it yesterday and it was not working and it only lighted up nothing else so we reached out to costumer service today and they have the worst technical support.
"This seems like a standard microwave, but with a lot of different settings, which is convenient.  I got the .9 cu. Ft. one, and it accommodates the size of my regular dinner plates, so I was pleased about that.The cons:The reason I’m deducting one of the stars is because the print (on the microwave) of the numbers and settings is MUCH too small.  I need to put my reading glasses on to make sure I’m pressing the correct button.  That might not be a problem for everyone though.The reason I’m deducting a second star is because when I try to pull open the door by the handle, the microwave slides across the counter with it, so I need both hands to open it.  I’m not pleased about that."
"We needed a small microwave to go on top of the refrigerator and for this small space it is perfect, and the controls are great, albeit there are TOO MANY pre-programmed choices, cluttering the keyboard. Quick start, power level and defrost are all that are necessary! The worst part of this unit is the failure to design a track that keeps the wheels centered as the tray spins. Slight misalignment while setting down a bowl inside (especially when it's placed overhead as in our case, but this would also be a problem on the counter, because it's very slippery inside), and the tray doesn't spin, it just bumps up and down as the spinner goes around, so the food doesn't uniformly heat. We live with it, but if it fails I will buy another brand that doesn't have this problem."
"I found this product to be too expensive for the quality. I bought the white one as it was cheapest and it didn't really matter as its just for the shop, the door was literally turning yellow right out of the box lolol.  I do love that you can turn the annoying five beeps sound off. You can also turn off the display to save on the 1/100040 watts of energy it takes to light the display lol. This is a 700 watt microwave, for comparison most frozen dinners call for 1100 watts so make sure you add time or you'll food poison yourself lol. this is a SMALL microwave - a dinner plate will fit, barely. Coffe cups fit but it's kinda tight getting the cup in there. All in all, for what I needed for the shop it's perfect, if way overpriced. Great for dorms, wet bars, little apartments with continental kitchens - not really a product for your kitchen cooking tbh. Was unable to set the time on the display."
"This small simple microwave works just fine.  My complaint is the front control panel has a non-intuitive layout.  The specific issue is that the front door locks after ever power use. Once the machine beeps for heating cycle completion you must hit a separate control panel button to unlock the door.  That may be seen as a safety measure where children are around, but for me it is just another step.  Worse, that button is not clearly differentiated in color and is located amongst the array of pre-heat buttons for soup, popcorn, etc.  On the one hand, not a big deal. On the other hand, you cannot use muscle memory to open the door when cooking is done, you need to purposefully look at the control panel to find the ""unlock"" button.  Bad user interface."
"We needed a microwave until our kitchen remodel is completed. So I opted for an inexpensive one.  It is that, cheaply made.  However, for the price it will do the job until we have our new one installed.  It is small. The only real complaint I have is that the turn table won't turn after the food or drink is heated.  In order to grab the handle of a mug, you have to turn the microwave back on for 2-3 seconds to have the handle in place for an easy reach. My old microwave allowed you to turn the turntable by hand."
This product is mediocre. The door is flimsy and the automatic safety lock is a nuisance.. it does perform its  function though and will be adequate for the price.
"it's working fine, but after 3 months, little chips are appearing in the plastic coating on the inside walls. I do not see what we can do about it...the manufacturer wants us to mail it to them, at our expense, to see if they will refund it."
"Perfect fit for the area in which it was to be placed; though the cord was too short. Even so, I was going to keep it; however, the heating was inadequate. Normally, 1.45 min is enough to heat up my neck wrap; in this microwave, it took almost 3 min."
I chose this one so I could disable the annoying sound that would let me know that cooking was over. It heats food just fine. It has become increasingly difficult to open the door. The whole unit slides forward unless I brace it with my hand. And it is a bit too small for my microwave popcorn popper.
Much smaller oven than I expected it to be and the numbers on the panel are hard to read
takes 2 min to heat a cup of coffee
"It works fine for a $60 appliances.  However, they didn’t put rubber pads on all four corners, just on two.  When you open the door, the unit slides on the counter.  Weird decision but probably saved $.02 per unit."
Looks great and was exactly what I needed but the metal is dented upon arrival. Such a bummer!
"This attractive microwave brings back memories of times gone by with its retro design.  The only problem was the feet were wobbly, rendering the microwave unstable.  If not for the wobbly feet, I would give this microwave an outstanding review."
"It’s ok, nothing special.. I  mean, what’s to say.It’s very small. So don’t expect it to do much."
It’s cute and good for the price. You have to use small plates when using this though
Had this product for six months and the control panel buttons fell back behind the panel and we can no longer use the microwave so that’s the only issue I’ve had with his microwave other than it loved it!
"It’s fine. I bought it in a same-day emergency. Here’s why it gets two stars- It has this confounding feature that makes you push an unlock button before you open the door. WHY???! I have never opened a microwave door that doesn’t simply stop when you open the door. This second step is so stupid. Every time I unlock the door button to pull open the door, I think about it. How stupid it is. A microwave shouldn’t be taking up this much thought. I appreciated getting it in an emergency though, so that’s actually a thank you to Amazon and the workers who got that to me the day before Thanksgiving. So thank you."
"I was replacing another small microwave and I expected a larger microwave according to the dimensions given in the picture. However, when I got it it looked almost like a toy with how small it was, even if it was just 1 or 2"" smaller in multiple dimensions. The true outer dimensions are 16"" wide and 9"" tall by ~12"" deep. It's tiny looking and it doesn't fit most things other than bowls and mugs. It does work though and gets water hot quickly. The door is not opened by a button so you have to pull it open by force. The problem is, the feet are plastic and not non-slip, so the entire microwave slides around with the slightest pull. I had to put non-slip matting under it for it to stay relatively in place. Not the most conveniently made microwave nor true to size, but it does work. I will probably return this in a few days if it keeps on sliding around."
"i knew I was getting a small microwave, but I was a little disappointed with this.  The popcorn button never stays on long enough, and I always need to add time to it.  It has a weird ""Door Open"" button that you need to press, and its placement on the device is odd.  The rotating tray never seems to want to stay in place, but is nice that it removes with ease for cleaning."
"The rotation feature is key with many microwaves and this one had a heavy glass plate that somehow repeatedly comes off of the rotator. The wheels are clean and move easily, yet rotating is still a problem. Its also smaller on the inside than other tiny microwaves that I've had, so standard size popcorn bags need constant assistance to rotate and ""cook"" evenly without burning.Basically, this microwave is best for very small sized dishes like Lean Cuisine meals and foods that don't need rotation. I'm buying a bigger microwave today and donating this one to a graduating senior on her way to college."
"I am a reasonably intelligent person and have had several Microwave ovens over the years.  But honest to god I do not get the dials and buttons on this oven.  The same dial is for power and cooking time. Not intuitive at all for me.  I do not know what button is being referred to by chart inside the door,  E.g Button 1 Popcorn  press 1 to 3 times.  There is no ""button 1"".  The dial goes from A1 to A9 and you have to press start twice.  A9 will cook for 3 minutes.  I do not understand the function of this dial and how it relates to the chart. Also the amount of cooking time varies. A4 cooks for 4 minutes, A1 for 1 m 30 s.  Basically, I do not use a microwave to actually cook things.  Mostly for reheating, or heating a frozen dinner.  And yes, I can do that. Also I have noticed that if I press something--not sure what, the glass tray keeps spinning.  No noise from microwave at all.  This is not the rotation that brings the dish back to how you put it in.  As far as I was aware,  it had finished.  I did not even know the tray was still spinning until much later.  What is that about?  Thankfully no fires.  It sits evenly and looks cute and I love the minty color..  However I can't help but wish I would have purchased a different one with buttons and dials that made sense to me."
"Looks nice and stylish, but low quality"
"I'm pleased with the size and color, which fit perfectly into my limited kitchen space. However, I’ve noticed that it tends to retain odors quite strongly. While it performs its basic function well, the lingering smells are a bit of a drawback."
"I got mine in 2019, after five years the flange on the bottom of the door has rusted out completely. The turntable spindle has similarly rusted out. All the electronics work and it microwaves good though, so for the money I am not gonna be super hard on it. Just wish the metal and plating was of higher quality.I'm gonna buy another one because it's a cheap appliance and I have zero expectation that a more expensive one is going to be more durable. End stage capitalism at its finest."
Cheap. Doesn't heat well.
Usually have to do 3 minutes to warm up a plate of rice and vegetables. By that time the rice is hard and dry. It does the job but takes longer
Love the look and easy to use
From the pictures of Amazon it was hard to tell how big or how small this microwave is. As you can see from the photo it's a lot smaller than I thought it was. My other microwave with fit big enough that I only had a few inches of counter as you can see from the photo this microwave is half the size of that. I haven't tried the features and stuff yet because I thought it was already programmed and right now me and my family can't get it to work yet.
Bought this in 2020. Inside paint started peeling off today exposing metal. Time for a new one.
"My biggest problem is the rotating tray falls off the track. It doesn't matter how many times I try to line it up right, it falls off before it rotates even once. It's a cute little microwave though, doesn't take up much counter space. It is less powerful than I expected but that's my bad for not looking at the wattage. Works fine, just needs extra time to cook everything."
Super loud when starting up
"I have had this only 3 years and have to replace it. The sensor malfunctioned and does not totally turn off!! When I open the door to place an item inside to cook it automatically starts by itself cooking and rotating!! A fire hazard!!I unplugged it numerous times and left it unplugged for hours and then for 2 days and still not working properly. I also hit the stop button numerous times before setting cook time in hopes it would help. Nope not work.  So throwing away. Too dangerous to keep. It should last longer than 3 years with casual use.And yes it does rust also as other users have said. I had water run out of mine at different times and it was not from the interior, but from the bottom where holes are to cool it. Scary on that thought also and not safe!! I started leaving the door cracked over night to help with any built up moisture issues.Love the size and way it cooks. Not noisey and easy to use and clean.  However with the short life and running by itself and moisture issues I can not recommend it. : ( Potential fire hazard and shock hazard. I hope they update it and address the problems."
"Biggest design flaw? The manufacturer designed this machine TOO light. So light, that you can't open the door without moving the entire microwave an inch or two. Then ya gotta move it back. And do it again when you open the door in 30 seconds or a minute or two. How ridiculous. Why in god's name would someone design an appliance like this? And why in god's name are 22K people so OK with this? Expect better, peeps."
"I was replacing my 0.7 cu. ft. 700W microwave (RIP) with this one.  What a pleasant surprise.  It weighs half as much as the old one (which I had to lug to the Goodwill) and is more compact overall (dimensions-wise).  Yet it has the exact same inside dimensions and power.  It does everything I used to be able to do with my old microwave, and has additional handy features.  I tried out my usual plates, etc., inside, and everything I usually use fits, easily.  I like the option for timed- or weight-based defrost, and the instant 30 second mode is great!  It's attractive, too.  (I got it in black.)  Unless this thing croaks within a year or two, it'll be my best microwave ever!  Highly recommended.  An excellent buy on Amazon at only $65.One minor complaint:  The labels on the buttons for the most important functions are impossible to read unless there's very good lighting.  That's an inconvenience in low light, such as when heating up a late night snack.  The only way around this is to use the instant 30 second button at the lower right corner of the controls.Another minor issue:  The control  buttons have to be pressed very hard.  I use a thumb, whereas with my old mu-wave, I could use a gentle touch with any finger.  And since it's so light, when you press those buttons hard enough for them to work, sometimes the entire right side of the microwave (the side where the buttons are located) slides backwards! I've had to learn to hold onto the thing when I push the buttons.  Or re-adjust the position of the microwave if I forget."
Why so heavy!? It’s so small but a block of lead. Not a fan. Not worth the money.
I wouldn't recomend getting a microwave with less than 1000w.  This is 700 and it takes for ever to heat op your food. good for a college dorm room
"I hope the company responds because I was very surprised by my experience. We got the microwave and everything seemed great. Our first time using it we were able to get the food inside and turn it on to heat it up. Once it finished cooked we tried getting the food out and the door WOULD NOT OPEN!!! I have videos of us struggling, TWO PEOPLE trying to get one microwave door open. It’s gotta be a glitch in the product because normally it has good reviews. About 10 minutes after trying to get the door open, we were randomly able to pop it open. We did nothing different than how we were normally trying to open it. Not sure what happened here. We were pulling so hard to open this microwave that we may have broke it. Hoping I can get a refund. I’m going to try and return it. I’d be happy to get another version of the same microwave. Ours had to be a fluke in the manufacturing. It was CRAZY HARD to get the door open. Not trying to be funny. Our microwave no longer works after 1 use."
I loved this microwave and thought it was so cute. 1.5 years later and it died on me! I wish appliances lasted like they used to 🙄
My old Samsung had smaller stats but more room inside. It says in these directions you must use the tray and it shouldn't be restricted. A bag of popcorn hits the sides and it stops the plate from turning. I also miss the button that opens the door. You have to pull the handle. Call me lazy but the button is nice.  I'll have to buy a bigger one although it'll take up room. I love popcorn and I stand there watching the bag not turn afraid of fire.  I did open the door and shake or turn the bag. There was lot of unpopped corn but the popping had stopped.
"We loved the look of the microwave, but after two weeks we couldn’t get past the difficult-to-use interface. In my opinion, the knob SHOULD be used to set the cooking duration, but its default was selecting cooking modes. To set the time, you had to press several buttons first, and the function names displayed on the screen are far from descriptive. We spent far too much time looking back at the manual to see what everything meant."
"Received with a faulty part, does not rotate, heats up well but not uniformely."
"More for a first time microwave in a small aparment, but when you need something quick and cheap it does the job. The buttons took a while to get use to compared to the last one, its faster and easier, but I have it in my head to press more buttons than I need to. Ours makes a rattle when it runs and had to prop something under the button panel to make it stop. It's fine and don't hold that against the product and probably more to shipping."
"Microwave looks good but is weaker than anticipated, also only goes in 30 second increments. The buttons and settings are confusing even with the manual. It’s quiet overall and spacious."
"Very disappointed with a falsely advertised warranty.My product arrived damaged, but the box was perfectly fine. We were in the middle of a move so I had not opened this in the return window. It was dented from the side and the inside jutted out and prevented proper latching with the door. Amazon said I should follow up with comfee since it was under warranty. They went back and forth over several emails and calls and made it seem like they would exchange the product for a non damaged model. However, after a week of back and forth I was informed it was ""not damaged"" and I wouldn't be receiving further assistance. They then never followed uo again. Amazon luckily provided me a partial refund outside of the return period so it wasn't a complete loss."
"I am cheap and resourceful. I am almost 4 months removed from being homeless. (So you know I didn't expect a microwave Guy Fierri would be proud of). When I outfitted my apartment with necessities, I bought this Comfee 700w Microwave (black).This is either my first l, or one of my first reviews ever written. I am super low maintenance and don't like to complain, but holy ****... this microwave is terrible.I'm actually mind-blown this thing has 22,000+ reviews and 4.4 stars. I've had many 700w microwaves before and understand they are slow. This microwave needs 5 minutes to fully cook a crushed up package of Ramen Noodles. I have yet to figure out how to properly cook Oatmeal. After much trial and error with cooking times, I completely gave up on the microwave and went back to stovetop. I can put 8 ounces of water in this for a minute and my sink will produce hotter water than a minute in the microwave (my sink is trash too so don't be impressed by its temperature haha). Might need 2 minutes for a decent cup of Tea.It's also tiny. I have yet to put anything ""bigger"" inside, but I did have to heat 4 slices of pizza in two iterations. The plate is 10 inches in diameter and the distance between the plate and the ceiling is 6.5 inches.So, conclusion. Don't buy this microwave. I'm not sure you even have to ""spend more money"". Budget microwaves work just fine. However, this one does not. Mine is sitting waiting to get given away. I feel robbed of 80 bucks and I'm gonna go spend 80 more on a new microwave from a different budget brand."
I'm not sure if all small microwaves are not as powerful but this one just doesn't heat up as well as my last microwave did. I have to heat things longer in this one. I also have to tip my plate to the side to put it in because the front is not wide enough which I don't like
"I had this for four years. It worked. I liked that you could turn the sound off by pressing down on the ""8"".Then last week the interior paint started falling off in slabs. The microwave still worked, but it was dropping paint in my food.I read online that you can repaint the inside with special microwave paint, but that didn't sound like my kind of project, so I hauled it out to the curb, put a note on it explaining problem and solution, and after an hour two guys came along in a pickup and loaded it in the back.Farewell, Comfee Microwave. You served me well, but I think I'll buy a different brand this time. Not sure how much microwave paint I ate."
"Got this for my make shift quarantine space just to warm up cans of soup, cups of noodles, pop popcorn and reminisce about freshman dorm life. Plan on cooking things like Cup of Noodles for longer than the directions say. It is super quiet, I will give it that. The only complaint that I have so far is when it comes to popcorn. The built in time is only 1 min 30 secs and that’s fine if you only want really hot unpopped kernels. So that was bag one in the trash. Try two: I figured pop it longer so I went for three minutes and did the “listen for it to pop 2-3 seconds apart”. Bag almost caught on fire and still wasn’t popped more than halfway. The microwave isn’t large enough for a normal Pop Secret microwave bag. Once the bag gets as big as the microwave will allow it stops spinning. It doesn’t allow for the bag to expand enough for the popcorn to get the heat they need to move around and pop. But once it has expanded it will no longer spin causing the bag to scorch. A small single serving bag might work but what’s the fun of you can’t share with your suite mates I mean family. It’s fine just don’t plan on eating popcorn if you purchase this."
"Only lasted the most two years, the danger was the inside paint starting chipping, the more u used the MW, the more the paint chipped, could cause food poisoning"
"LIKES:  You can turn off the beep-beep alarm, which is really loud. It has a small footprint. It's not stainless steel -- whoever thought stainless steel was a swell idea for kitchens cleary never ever cleaned one. A kitchen that is. The microwave comes in white, so not visually obtrusive.DISLIKES:  Not tall enough for my favorite mug. It has a cumbersome door pull. At one point, in the beginning, it made a strange grinding noise while in operation.OVERALL: This microwave oven lacks the options I've gotten used to in other microwaves. So, if you have any expectations based on performance of previous microwaves, let them go and you won't be disappointed in the COMFEE' Countertop Microwave Oven!"
"PROS: cute and nostalgic.  CONS: it stops working after 3 to 4 minutes of heating. The first time I used this microwave it went out & wouldn’t come back on. I was going to send it back but My hubby plugged it in, and it came on like nothing was wrong. I was left scratching my head.  I hauled it back in my studio & used it again. Of course, it went out again. I finally figured out that this piece of junk is just that. It heats for about three minutes, overheats itself, then the automatic shut off turns it off.  It does not come back on again until it’s sufficiently cooled (10-15 min).  when it shuts off the microwave it is super hot afterwards. After it’s cooled, it’ll turn back on like nothing happened. Long story short- if you plan on using your microwave more than three minutes at a time, this is not for you.  But If you’re like me and would sacrifice practicality in the name of cuteness, then by all means buy it. Just make damn sure that you get the warranty for it. It’s only like $15 for four years. That way you’re not stuck with a hunk of junk like me!!!!!!"
not nearly enough power - does not heat coffee in 30 seconds - takes over a minute.
"This microwave does not work, won’t even turn on. Sorry cancel return, plug in was not working. I will write a review after I use it"
Works to heat up food but it sweats a lot inside. Water dripping afterwards. Have to wipe up a lot of condensation from inside microwave and inside of door. Never had this issue with any other microwave I have had or used before this one.
I did not care for the style of it. I like a micro wave that you can’t push a button to open it. I wish I had bought one from the store so I could see what it looks like first.
"I didn't like the fact that I was under the impression it was a 1050 watt microwave, with in truth it's a 700 watt."
sounds like its working hard to spin the plate inside
"Love color,cooking so well,but it very very noisee,try 1 more day,but i think if noise like that i will return"
"If you are needing a microwave, this one 🤔 might be ok for looking at."
"First and last time buying. I bought a comfee microwave for my mother (65 years old), her microwave after more than 6 years stopped working. Comfee microwave I bought her stopped working properly after 3 weeks. Long story short I gave them a call for help instead not only did they expect for her to fix the problem herself but after I explained that she could not and to please replace the product or take it back they told me they couldn’t. I asked for a refund and to this day haven’t heard anything from them. Be careful buying!"
Does not hear well at all. Gotta keep putting it back
"I purchased this microwave oven because it was small and fit in a limited space.  The turntable never fit as it should and continued to come off the device that turns it.  Recently, I discovered that the interior coating had bubbled and metal was showing.  I don't know if this interior shields microwaves, but because I do not want to take any chances, I am going to bring it to my local waste facility.  I do not want to suffer microwave radiation."
"The microwave is very small which is nice for fitting on the counter.I just got my microwave today so I can't really give an accurate review of how well it works or how easy it is to clean but I wanted to share a review showing that the internal dimensions listed are off by quite a bit.I should have known based on the tray measurements that it's really basically ten inches deep and ten inches wide, but the height is the real issue...it is only six inches high, not 8.11"" high as listed.This is disappointing because I was trying to make sure my microwave popcorn popper would fit and it juuuust barely does NOT fit. Which is sad.Anyway to avoid this heartbreak for anyone else I'm sharing these photos to make the measurements more clear."
"I've had this microwave for 2 years without any issues. However, last week a bag of popcorn caught on fire within 30 seconds. I put it out quickly, throughly cleaned and inspected the microwave, and assumed it was an issue with the popcorn bag somehow. Until this week, when I started to heat up water in a glass dish and saw sparks flying. There was nothing that I was heating up that would cause that, and I finally realized that the popcorn bag probably wasn't the issue.It's out of warranty so I'm out of luck. I'm giving it 2 stars, one for each year it lasted me, but I wouldn't take the gamble with this fire hazard."
"To be fair, I never expected much from this microwave. It's very light, cheap & plastic-y. I had to add grip pads underneath to keep it from sliding around when I pull open the door (there's no latch button, you just have to pull on the handle).When it's running, it's louder than the average microwave. You have to take care not to slam the door too hard when closing. I did once, and it screwed up the door sensor for a while, but then it righted itself somehow and now I'm very gentle with it.The interface drives me nuts, I keep spinning the dial thinking it controls cook time... but no. Spinning the dial cycles through the pre-program options (popcorn, soup, ""meat""). To set cook time you have to first cycle to the desired power level, then select it, then choose cook time. Thankfully there IS a quick 30 second button - that's basically all I use now.But it is cute."
Too small. The pictures didn’t show the right seize.
"The product works fine.. for now. The package came in fine, however upon unboxing I found a large dent on the back of the microwave, makes me think that this may have been a returned or refurbished item… just be cautious purchasing. You could be paying full price for an item that is not new?UPDATEthis does have issues getting up to temp, I’m removing a star from my review due to this. I have to add 1-2 minutes to any standard time I’m trying to cook for. (And it’s already at max power)"
"Microwave is cute but description says Green, in the photos it looks blue, I took a chance hoping it would be close to my other mint green appliances, nope its blue, if youre color blind you might not notice"
Can't rate it since I really did not use it due to the product arricing dented. It looks nice enough and it is great for small kitchens. I am giving it 3 stars and 5 stars for small places.
"I really want to like this microwave, but unfortunately it keeps tripping our circuit breaker. I've heard cheaper products or faulty ones can drain more energy than necessary causing this to happen. Now we'll likely need to replace it. Get what you pay for..."
"Product came damaged.  Feet were ""crushed"" inward so it does not set level."
"Such a good looking microwave, but it does not cook very well. I only use it for frozen foods or reheating food and coffee, but I have to add extra cooking time no matter what I put in there. When reheating coffee, I could do it in :30 with my old microwave, but it takes :60 with this one. When cooking a frozen meal from Trader Joe's  or a Lean Cuisine, I have to add a full 1-2 minutes to the suggested cooking time on the package. Also, the controls are ridiculously convoluted (why so many steps??), but easy once you get the hang of it."
"This is the second one of these I have purchased that is going to the dump.  The microwave itself functions well and fit perfectly in a very restrictive (size-wise) spot in my pantry.  That being said, the paint has peeled on the second microwave - just like the first one.  It seems the rust/peeling paint issue starts at about a year out (right after the warranty is up).  With the first one, I gave it a pass.  The microwave is primarily used by my kids, who are less than tidy.  For the second one, I had them leave the door open to deal with accumulated moisture since I figured that was leading to the issues.  Same thing happened again.  I'm switching to a different company.  I have tried painting the interior, and it looks horrible.Update - Nothing like a replacement with a different microwave to cement (and even encourage me to downgrade to one star) my thoughts on this thing.  There is definitely a venting issue.  I thought it was user error, but even my daughter commented on how nice it was to make something in the microwave and not deal with it being ""moist"" due to the condensation.  There is a design issue with this microwave."
"Edit: It's only been six months, and it barely works anymore. All microwaves have hot and cold spots but this, despite the rotating plate, is pretty much 90% ice cold spot where food remains frozen no matter how long you heat it. One single point on the food will get boiling hot and explode. (And I know about the middle-of-the-rotating-plate is a cold spot theory, so I started offsetting food to one side or the other for the past 3 months, with no luck). I got a $40 microwave at Target and it lasted for 10 years. This one is about to go into the trash (by which I mean driving all the way to the hazardous waste recycling drop off) after six months. I really regret going for looks over functionality and durability. I do have a Comfee brand dishwasher that works great, so the brand seems very spotty on quality.This microwave looks cute and is a beautiful pale seafoam green. But it's very annoying to use because when you turn the dial, rather than show the cook time, it gives you all the presets. For someone who's always wanting to bake a potato or microwave popcorn I guess this is great. For me nine times out of ten I want to cook for a set amount of time at the normal maximum power. To do that you have to press ""power"", press ""start"" to let it know you want to cook at max power, THEN turn the dial to get the cook time. THEN press the start button again to start cooking. You get used to it but it's not efficient or intuitive. I'd say go for a less pretty, better designed microwave."
Takes literally 10 minutes for a medium bowl of frozen vegetables
This product takes entirely too long to warm up food even when the power level is all the way up to 10. It can take up to 5mins or longer to heat up left overs from the refrigerator. If I would’ve known that I’d spent the extra $20 to get a microwave from a well known brand. This microwave wasn’t even worth purchasing and being a disappointment since I purchased it.
"Not pleased with this microwave.  1) Its cheaply made, 2) the door handle takes so much force to pull it open that you will drag the entire microwave all the way across the counter without the door opening - the only way to open the door and keep the unit stationary is if you use two hands, 3) the information on Amazon states the size of the unit and how compact it is, then you look at the directions that come with the unit and then tell you all the open space you need in the back, on the top, and the two sides - I could get a much bigger microwave that requires less space than the amount of space this one needs"
"Very well-packed.  Read manual.  Placed on counter and plugged in.  Everything works, clock very easy to set.  Maybe a shade or two lighter than my lower cabinets 😂 but it looks like it was made for my kitchen.Update:  Purchased in April 2023.  One person household.  Case is beginning to crack.I use a microwave for shortcuts, melting butter, re-heating coffee, etc.  Some miner cooking, but just for me, not a large volume of food.  The inside is compact as you can see from the second photo.  Perfect for me."
"This works perfectly fine for my needs. The inside is just a bit smaller than I'd like. A standard size dinner plate barely fits. The plate touches the sides and prevents the inside turntable from turning. This causes the turntable to constantly get knocked off the guide upon which it sits. If it could be just an inch or 2 bigger on each side, it would be perfect."
"I had a Comfee microwave almost identical to this one for years. I reordered it when mine broke but apparently they changed the model slightly. You can no longer open the door if cooking, or at the end of cooking either! You either have to hit “stop” and then another small button that says “open door” or wait until it ends and then hit the “open door” button. The open door button is NOT a giant push button. It’s the same size as the numbers. It’s inconvenient. Supposedly you can disengage this child lock but when I do, none of the buttons work. One meal microwaved and I’m annoyed enough to return it. It shouldn’t be this difficult to open a door."
It takes a certain sense of humor to create a microwave with a popcorn setting that is too small to spin a bag of popcorn.
"The Comfee microwave was smaller than expected. Its outside measurements were essentially the same as what I planned for it to replace. The inside compartment was too small to use for much of anything other than to heat a cup of tea or coffee, however. Unfortunately, it couldn't accommodate a bag of microwave popcorn. The bag would just sit in place, as the bottom plate rotated, it would sit stationary. Result? Burned popcorn. I would not recommend."
"Good feature: You can set the 'completed' bell to 'silent mode'. Bad feature: There is no bar code or serial# anywhere on the back (where it's supposed to be - only a model#), neither on sides or bottom of the machine -- and without this number the warranty cannot be activated or fulfilled. So, as long as all functions are operational, all's good. Just don't expect to utilize the warranty in the event you get a lemon. (Buyer Beware)"
It’s not very powerful and it’s so small I can’t cook a bag of popcorn in it.
"Doesn’t warm the food well, if you have a quantity of food in a bowl that’s larger than one portion. It does not warm all the way through. It might warm the edges but the center and everything in between is cold."
Works good so far as a microwave oven but it is only useable for small single serving dishes. It is so light you need something from keeping it sliding around when you open/close the door. Price seems a little high for what you get. Keeping it until I can find something better.
"This is the worst microwave I have ever used in my life. It takes forever to heat things up and it doesn’t even get hot enough to make things splatter like a normal microwave would.There is a “popcorn” feature. Which, like most microwaves, is a setting to pop popcorn just by hitting the button. We eat popcorn all the time…. This was the main reason of my replacing my last microwave..  so when I put the popcorn bag in and hit the “popcorn” function, the bag *slowly* begins to enlarge, as it normally does. BUT the microwave is TOO SMALL to accommodate the inflating popcorn bag !  Which means it gets stuck mid-pop in the microwave and can’t spin anymore and therefore burns. This isn’t the only problem. If you just let it go…. Meaning but the popcorn button and let it finish, the popcorn isn’t even done popping. It’s less than halfway. So I hit it again and there isn’t a way to fix it so it will spin in the microwave and therefore burns.  What an absolute joke…. How does this microwave have good reviews ???  I don’t understand. It took 15 minutes to cook a microwaveable meal. A VERY SMALL dinner because anything else won’t fit.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!"
"First off it is a nice looking microwave. I got the light blue one. The controls differ from the simplicity of our previous one but still the steps are not too difficult to remember. My dad for example chooses to only use the 30 second increment function instead of figuring out how to set for a certain time amount. I was spooked when I got to the kitchen one night and saw the turn table going while the door was left ajar. Closed it, pushed the off button and brushed it off as hopefully a one time thing. Of course it wasn't. It's happened with the door left open and even when closed at least a handful of times in the short 4 months we've owned it. Needless to say I kind of miss old faithful now which we had for about a decade without incident. Probably going to attempt to replace this one soon because I feel it's unsafe with this issue. This small appliance was definitely not worth the money."
great for a corner; no add 30 second button and my turn table did not work; LOL.
"Do you love running the microwave over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again?Do you get sad that your hotpockets only take 2 minutes to cook?If you answered yes to either of these questions then this microwave is for you!  Let me start by listing the pros to this little machine!  Oh and when I say little I mean little.  When I opened the box I was like oh must be the wife ordered a microwave for my daughter's play kitchen, but then I saw the electric cord.  It was definitely smaller than I anticipated.  Picture ordering a microwave from wish.  I am pretty excited though because it fits nicely on top of my 2 slice toaster.  I kid I kid.  My toaster is a 4 sliceThis bad boy will heat your bag of steam vegetables in as little as 12 minutes!  For those keeping score at home thats twice as long!Honestly this microwave is one of the best purchases I have made in quite sometime.  Before this microwave my wife would spend hours and hours pushing my buttons.  Now she spends all her time constantly pushing the buttons on the microwave.  Just her in the kitchen reheating and reheating instead of hounding me about doing yard work.Enjoy your new microwave!"
I would have thought this product would be worth the price after seeing the reviews but the door does not open. I was not able to open the microwave door during my 1st use. Not only did the door not open but the microwave container comes off after every use which I find as a hazard. I do not recommend.
"I have had this microwave for a year and after just a few months, it started smelling terrible. I clean it regularly. It smells like mildew. I don’t cook anything strong in it either. I got it mainly for my toddler’s meals like chicken nuggets and veggies."
"This does what it needs to do; fit in a small space and be easy to use. However, the rotating glass turn table does not fit neatly into the hub gear that turns it. That means it slips out easily and needs to be realigned most time the microwave is used. Other microwaves I've used had better fitting components. My elderly mom has a difficult time figuring out this realignment process and its a bit annoying she need to contend with that flaw. Otherwise, this has been a good enough microwave."
Mine arrived dented and I don't want to return it.  It does heat.
"Maintenance on this involves keeping a towel on hand to wipe underneath the turntable on virtually every usage, as it generates water underneath the turntable, on the inside walls of the microwave, and on the inside of the door.  This is more work than any other microwave to keep it functional.The water is coming from UNDERNEATH the tray in the microwave; after 1 year the paint there is peeling and puffing, and when I touch it, water squirts out.  This is NOT normal in a microwave.  The ""planned obsolescence"" in this microwave is too short.  My last microwave lasted me ten years; this one it's becoming unsafe to use inside of just one year.On the positive side, the on/off sound works well.  It cooks well.  And it's easy to understand.  The con of having to wipe it out after every single use and the appliance paint inside it cracking underneath the tray, even when I use a microwave plate cover, makes it something that I would not ever buy again."
"I read the reviews and just laugh at the ones that say, TOO small, NOT powerful, too heavy, (for a countertop who cares) wrong color, etc.  What was this person thinking?  All those attributes were clearly in the description.  But I've bought one of these 3 times, every two years!  These RUST OUT in two years of ues!  EVERY TIME!  First along the front door on the bottom, then on the top.  Then with the rust they start sparking!  time to find another brand"
"I think the engineer who designed this device thought he was designing a crack-proof safe to keep people out, rather than a microwave oven for food.  Otherwise, why would you design something so ridiculously difficult to open?"
"The second time I opened door there was a puff of smoke, then a pop. I think the light exploded since there is no longer any light in the unit. It still works but no light. I would not buy this item it obviously has quality control issues."
Ready to plug it in and a dent is in the back. I don’t know if it was delivery or it was shipped like that plugged in and it works. Debating to send it back.
Smaller than expected. Also too noisy
"This is a good basic inexpensive microwave--nothing fancy.  I feel it is not as ""beefy"" as some, a little disappointing for the Farberware brand.  I specifically wanted a WHITE unit to match my other appliances, with dimensions that would fit my limited space.  My search only found this Farberware and a few GE brands in white.  After reading terrible reviews about the GE brands, I opted for this one.  Very disappointed to find it only has a white face - entire exterior body is the brushed chrome.  The web site shows a total white body.  Judging by the grey interior with a white door, I suspect all they did was put a door with a white face on the unit.when open, it looks funny with grey interior and white door.  The grey interior is easy to clean, however.  I have no small children around, so I followed the directions and disabled the child lock feature.  Once you disable it, you follow the same steps to reactivate it (not difficult) if you choose.  The unit works fine, is not as noisy as my old one, and meets my basic needs.  I do like that it stops beeping as soon as you open the door (my old one kept beeping til the 5 beeps were done). Overall, decent value for the money."
"I love the color. I got the red one, to replace a less powerful red one that had finally reached its end of service.  This one is nicer, bigger, more powerful, quieter, classier looking.  So far, we have not cooked very much but, right away, the Big Problem manifested itself.  It has a Child Safety Lock.  Here's news:  not everybody has a child.  I am 82 and do not even know anybody under 32.  I resent having to live the rest of my life with this machine, having to combat the Child Safety Lock every time I want to cook something. This is going to get old REAL FAST.  Oh, but you say, on pare 13 of the Instruction Manual, there are instructions to deactivate the lock ""If there are no children in the house.""  Then it supplies some simple instructions to press two buttons at once and then hold ""Door Open"" for 3 seconds, and ""within 30 seconds, the screen wil will display ""ULoc"".  Well, no,  it does not.  I have followed the instructions five times, and the screen always reverts to Loc.  But it cooks. I got rid of my old one, and I am just too aggravated to return this thing.  It will be perfectly adequate. It gets the job done.  I will get used to it."
"I was disappointed to find that the microwave was different from the image and description.  The microwave actually has a white button in the middle of the keypad that you have to press every time you open the door after cooking.  VERY annoying.  I wouldn't have bought it if I had known about that.  I don't like presets; i never use them.  I'd prefer to punch in my time and press start.  With this one however, you do have to press Time Cook before entering the time or it will start cooking the number of minutes of the number you pressed first.Other than that it's a good microwave.  It has plenty of room inside. It heats well and pretty evenly.  The noise isn't very loud like my old one was and you can see inside fine even with the gray interior.  I feel that it will be a satisfactory microwave for my needs."
"Beautiful shiny microwave. Sounds horrible. Sounds cheap, looks great! Sounds like it is gonna break or fall apart. Sounds junky. Does heat up food good but it sounds cheap and junky but looks expensive. Question for me would i buy again. No Thats my honest opinion. If the sound was alot better i would."
"We needed a new microwave after our old one died after many years of service. This Farberware model seemed to have the best combination of positive reviews and reasonable price. However, it stopped working after just 5 months of non-heavy use  (not abuse):  2 people in the house, used less than daily. Very disappointing; worked fine when it was working but didn’t work for long."
"Overall this is an attractive, simple to operate, convenient size, efficient countertop microwave oven that seems to work well (only had it 3 days), but, it is LOUD.  If you're bothered by loud noise this is not the microwave for you."
"The the picture they show is incorrect button display, these are the real functions."
"I never knew a microwave could be so noisy.Also, it alerts you when it’s done, but that’s it.Other microwaves alert every 5 mins or so until you take the food out.As a busy mom I NEED those reminders!!"
"I was warned by the reviews this oven was noisy.  I'm going to keep it because it works really well, however when operating it makes an annoying florescent, humming, frying sound.  I'm not cooking with it, or using it for long periods of time so I can tolerate the noise.  Plus it really easy to clean, the interior is gray, not white like most.  It's suppose to be stainless steel, however it's black with stainless steel trim.  Maybe they sent the wrong one.  For the price and performance (1000) watt, I can put up with the one negative."
"This Microwave is powerful, easy to clean and heats food evenly. No problems after a year."
The measurements given in the description fit my location perfectly. After unboxing and looking at manualit said you must have 12 inches of clearance overhead.  That means if you want it on your counter and it has overhead cabinets it probably will not work.  Had this been in the description it would have saved me having to return.
"Positively hate that the door does not fully open, it opens to 45 degrees.  The door issue makes it difficult to grab say a casserole because you basically can only get your right hand on it because if you try to use both hands the left one is right against open door and you can even bend elbow to remove your dish.  Extremely dangerous when pulling a hot dish out as its not easy to manuever.Really poor design having the open door stick straight out so you actually CANNOT stand straight in front to add or remove a dish, you have to go in at an angle from the right. sad cause the microwave is quite nice otherwise"
"Did I mention this microwave is loud? *There's no quiet mode so you're stuck with incessant beeping. And it does NOT stop when you open it or hit the button. *The light is useless. You cannot see inside while it's on. *After 2 yrs with this machine,  the plate has cracked and it rotates continuously even after you open the door. (I don't think that's supposed to happen.) *The coating inside has started to wear off in a few spots which is odd because I only use mild dish washing liquid to clean it. One time I did the ol' vinegar trick and it left permanent water spots in the coating. ***DO NOT STEAM VINEGAR IN THIS MICROWAVE*** *No matter what you do,  there is no quiet way to close the door. It sounds like you're angry slamming the microwave every single time.Otherwise,  it is pretty. I have the white/stainless steel version. It is THE nicest looking microwave on the market. I use defrost constantly and it works well. I don't use the other buttons really so I cannot comment on how useful is the pizza button. It microwaves just fine.I'd give this a higher rating if it wasn't so loud, the coating stayed on,  and the plate would stop rotating after I opened the door. Also, I didn't think I was supposed to buy a new one every 2 yrs😑So sad... it's so pretty"
"It works. Good heat. Like the +30 second start button feature. Arrived promptly. After 5 weeks, the internal food rotater makes a knocking noise the whole time the microwave is running. I'll have to replace it."
great product.Was damage it shipment but operates ok
"Too noisy. I have had several microwaves and this model is noisier than most. It is a little bigger than what I usually purchase, but I do not believe that would be causing the extra noise volume as my other microwaves sat in the same spot. I have placed 4 oven hot pads under the ""feet"" to help absorb the noise (one under each ""foot"" and it has helped considerably. However, this was disappointing and I needed it immediately and did not wish to go through the rig amoral of exchange.  I have used Faberware a long time ago (pots and pans) and never had any problems with it, but I think Faberware could have worked on lowering the volume while creating this model. I've had several other brands of microwaves that never had this problem."
The price was right on at time of purchase and we were so excited to get a great deal $88 on1000w micro but when we receive this microwave it was stuck in child lock and the door was not leveled and it would not disengage from child lock! Had to return it due to NO other resolution offered by supplier i.e. (a replacement) just credited back on an amazon gift card even though i asked for it to be returned to my amazon card. The new amount the next day to re-purchase the same item was $30+additional for the same product. We went elsewhere. Very disappointed in the customer service experience.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The fact that this was terribly broken when I got it, and the box it came in was undamaged tells you how poor quality this is. Pretty standard size and carousel. Buttons don't seem to be very responsive. Light on the inside is kinda dim. Overall I really expected better from this brand.I've got a replacement on order, so I'll update if the new one somehow happens to be great, but I'd say this one isn't worth the trouble."
Bought the 1000W but didn’t realize that this larger unit didn’t have a “re-heat” button. Should have bought the smaller space saver one that has the same set of options. Too heavy to return!
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is the gap on side of microwave where the light shows through. Loudest microwave I have ever heard.
"Beware that the pictures of the control panel shown are not correct.  There is a child lock feature that seems to have been recently added and is not shown.  There is no way to permanently eliminate this feature.  Even the picture in the user manual is not correct.  The manufacturer put a removable sticker on top of the microwave that discusses the lock.  The red color is very nice, runs quiet and all other features are OK.  The internal light is very weak."
"I've been using this for 3 months.  It does a decent job heating things up.  Has reasonable power.  Is its very compact, which was the main selling point for me.  If you have a small counter space and/or low overhead cabinets....  this is probably your best bet available for a cheap microwave. ONLY dislike is that it is LOUD. Very loud.  The loudest I've ever owned, and I've owned many over the years.  Don't buy if that is going to be a problem for you.  Now that I've lived with it for a few months, I wish I would have returned it.  I'll probably crack it open and see if I can mitigate it at some point.  it's either the fan, or some terrible vibration."
"Received the oven on time and in good condition.  The look and feel of it are very good and fits in with our kitchen appliances.  I gave this a three star rating for performance issues, but none are areas that are ""out of spec"" or considered returnable for non performance reasons per advertisement and user manual specs.  What we noticed are three areas of concern. First was noise when power cooking was on. When it starts up we hear a louder than last unit it replaced, transformer ""hum"" that gets even louder as when the microwave-tube inside turns on and off to heat the food.  Along with the metal enclosure of the unit that amplifies the inside transformer hum sound that it creates. Second, and at first we didn't think this was a big deal but turns out it is an inconvenience,  is the position of the cup, bowel, plate it stops at when the heating is done.  Our last unit 90 % of the time stopped it in the same direction you placed it in at startup.  This is so helpful if you are heating up coffee or soup or anything that has handles so you can grab it right up front opening the door.  I thought they all did that anyway but was wrong with this unit and is frustrating when retrieving your heated item as it many stop in the back end of the oven and you end up having to reach all the way in to remove it.  We also noticed the total power of 1000 watts should be better than our 900 watt old unit, but indeed it takes longer an average of 35% more time to heat up the same item.  Meaning more power to do the same job and I am sure that equals to more energy used that costs more to run the unit $$.  It is taking us some time to get use to it and we understand that.  We are not sure if we want to return it yet.  We are use to a much quieter unit having coffee in the morning at the table. We will contact the manufacture but I don't think they will do much for us as I said it may be performing per their spec.  We just don't know, and a microwave unit going back will cost almost half of the unit cost for shipping.  Go figure!  So it is a 3 star unit for us.  We have had very good luck with items from Amazon so not sure what we will do."
"For the first few weeks, this product seemed to work well.  Now, it does not heat properly.  I have contacted manufacturer customer service, and they have not responded to my concern.  I asked them for a replacement or a refund, but I haven't received any response.  I haven't contacted Amazon, as it is past the 30 days return window.  Very disappointed and dissatisfied."
"This microwave is poorly designed. The motor used to rotate the turntable during the heating process is extremely jerky…not smooth whatsoever. This causes the table to come off its track, leading to no rotation during heating and uneven cooking. 2 Stars manager it powers on and tells time…otherwise it’s frustrating. This product is a money grab. No way the manufacturer was proud of this product."
Love it except the color. I ordered red but looks maroon. I was disappointed because it doesn't match my kitchen decor.
"The door makes a loud noise when it closes, and the microwave makes a loud annoying sound when it’s warming up the food.Food needs more time to warm up compared to my previous microwave. I didn’t realize it was 1000 watt and not 1200 when I bought it :(It does look nice."
"Love the look and size. But it’s very noisy when running, never had a noisy microwave before."
Do not like the locking door
Works well but it’s loud
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is so obnoxious!  We have the same exact microwave at work that sounds normal. So.. I sent it back thinking it was defective or something.  Recieved this replacement and it's doing the same thing!  Reached out to the manufacturer with comparison videos and they said as long as it's not smoking or sparking you are good.  Hmm..The only difference aside from the noise between the two is the color?  So sad I really like the look of this one!  But if you have to leave the room to cook something its not worth it!
"We’ve had this microwave a couple weeks now and are overall happy with it. The only downside we have noticed to far is that it holds a lot of condensation after you heat up food. We have been combating it by leaving the door open for a few minutes after we heat something up. I’m sure if we didn’t notice it, it would lead to problem later on from holding in the moisture"
"I bought the microwave and we got it about 3 days later, which was a whole day sooner than expected. The microwave worked for about a week and then all the sudden it just stopped working, we don't cook or heat anything for more than like 5 mins so it was very odd for it to stop working. I'm giving it 3 stars because while it worked it worked well, but it DID stop working after all so i think 3 stars is fair. Maybe I just lucked out and got a dud lol"
"Bought this in June, 2024. It worked great with no problems until today, when it died. I unplugged it and plugged it back in - nothing. Reset the breaker, also moved it to an outlet I was sure worked - nothing. So I just ordered a GE, which I am hoping lasts longer than 5 months. So, I do not recommend this brand."
"Item arrived earlier than expected, set it up and saw a dent on front left side of door. This was a gift disappointed about the damage gonna be a big headache to return/replace ."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update: I purchased this microwave on March 28th 2017. It has been screeching, moaning, & grinding for 2 months with light use. Thankfully it has a 1 year manufacturers warranty. I contacted customer service on 10/2/17. The warranty & phone number is on the back of the microwaves instruction manual.I called 877-648-5973. I was asked for my name, address, phone number , date of purchase, where I purchased it from, what was wrong with the microwave, etc:  I was then asked for the information on the back of the microwave. Model number, serial number , manufacturer number , & FCC ID number. I took pictures of the labels on the back of the microwave before I called customer service. I provided all of the information that was requested from me. The customer service representative instructed me to send a copy of my receipt to ""customerservice@icallservices.com"". DO NOT send any information to the email address listed on the back of the instruction manual. Call them first.I was told that I would receive a call from them shortly before they send out a replacement microwave. The customer service representative said that this takes about 3 weeks. If you don't have your receipt you can either print out a copy from your Amazon account or take a picture of your Amazon receipt & attach it to an email.Unfortunately the return window for Amazon had passed by the time my microwave started making weird grinding & screeching noises. The 1 year warranty definitely came in handy.2nd Update: As of 1/20/18 I’m still waiting on a replacement microwave from Farberware under my 1 year warranty. I’ve made countless calls only to be told that SAMANTHA is the only supervisor. Samantha is the only person with the LIST of replacement microwave shipment dates.Samantha is always in a meeting, just left, or she won’t be arriving for another 30 minutes. When I call back Samantha is in a meeting. I will never buy another Farberware product. I think they’re giving me the run around until March when my warranty expires. I’m going to file a complaint with the BBB.If I knew then what I know now I would’ve never spent my hard earned money on a Farberware microwave.3rd Update: Today March 1st 2018 I finally received my replacement microwave (warranty) from Farberware. A total of 5 months after I requested a replacement under my warranty. It was delivered out of the blue by UPS at 6:45pm today. The microwave is brand new. I’ve included a side by side pic of the old & new (unboxed) microwave.I’m not excited. I’m already wondering what’s wrong with this one.4th Update: May 16th 2018. The new replacement microwave that I received on March 1st 2018 is making noises. I’ve included a video this time. I’m cooking a TV dinner. I’m sooooo done with Farberware.😅😂"
Worked fine but it stopped working after 2 years.
"As you can see from the advertised picture on the Amazon website, the opening claims to be 14.5 x 9.1 in. If you look at my pictures, the actual opening of the microwave I received is only 12.5 x 9 in. I'm lucky my rice cooker still fits. I'm moving in a week, so I can't afford to waste time returning this microwave and getting another one. The great price combined with the decent size is why I even chose this microwave. Everything else seems fine, it doesn't seem too loud, the controls are easy to use. That's why this microwave receives three stars from me."
its not as good as my last one my hamilton was little better with a brighter clock EXCEPT they went out in a year after 3 im trying this brand
"I love the red color and the ease of operation - HOWEVER --- I am REALLY tired of almost always having some defect in nearly every applicance these days!  Thank you for allowing china to cheapen US product consumption.  The microwave CLOCK IS DEFECTIVE.  I CAN RE-SET IT EVERY COUPLE OF HOURS AND IT MOVES AHEAD HOURS.  I HAVE JUST MOVED INTO A NEW HOME AND IF I DIDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TO DO, AND IF MY FRIEND HADN'T DESTROYED THE BOX IT CAME IN, I WOULD HAVE RETURNED FOR REPLACEMENT.  I AM JUST TIRED OF RETURNS FOR DEFECTS!!!  Also, beware when another applicance issuggested"" I went ahead and also ordered a toaster that was supposed to match color wise but DOES NOT."
"It works fine as a microwave, although certainly nothing extraordinary. It does have several annoying features such as the auto lock feature that is particularly annoying and I have never seen before.  All in all, I would have rather paid slightly more and gotten a better microwave."
"There is no way to mute the 5 loud annoying ""beeps"" at the end of every cycle and a ""beep"" of any button pressed. I tried all the online suggestions but none worked. Maybe the child lock replaced the mute function found on most other brands."
"I got this microwave last week and it came in perfect condition (no scratches, dents, chips, etc.) but when I tried to make popcorn it didn’t do anything… literally the popcorn sat in the microwave for two and a half minutes and it didn’t pop or nothing. I tried warming up tortillas and again nothing happened, the tortillas were just as cold as when I put them in. Am I doing something? Is there something that needs to be set up before I warm up food? I found this very odd because I can’t seem to find what the issue is. Very disappointed because I really needed a microwave and it’s a very nice looking microwave but I’ll be sending it back."
"This microwave worked fine in the beginning although I wished it had more power. It took 3 minutes to heat a cup of water.After 3 years  I began noticing smoke and the smell of burning wires, then it completely quit working.What a disappointment!"
"Everything works just fine, but it is loud!"
The fact that you have to push a button to unlock the door before you can open it is ridiculous. I almost tore the door off before I figured out how to open it.
Only had this microwave for a few months and it started making weird noises and over half of the buttons have stopped working but it’s a nice microwave other then that
"Powerful and fast. Noisey, creates and holds a lot of moisture. More than I have noticed in others over the past 50 years. In oven light is nice but prevents me from leaving the door open for the oven to dry out.I've waited several weeks in order to be fair."
While this microwave works as its supposed to it is very loud and makes a vibrating noise. So disappointed in this as it is a very irritating sound. The inside is also gray which makes it very hard to see to clean very well. Pretty disappointed in this microwave. the color is pretty however.
"I expected it to be powerful but it isn’t! In fact, my old 450 watt microwave is just as powerful as the new one I just bought.Also, the beautiful red color is not on all painted areas as expected.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MICROWAVE"
"TO BE FAIR AFTER 3 YEARS, STILL WORKING OK.  Yes, the comments on quality are correct, but for the price is fair, but should not be ""AMAZON CHOICE"" since other newer models with better build are available now for similar price.PLASTIC OVER BUTTONS  does wear off after a few months, but still function.For a ""cheap"", simple microwave it is acceptable. Chinese mass market (branded Farberware, imported by Edge Consumer Brands).CONS FIRST: Overall flimsy build. Door, metal, turntable ring, control panel all the basics. Would not expect to last very long with frequent use. Much louder than any others I've owned or used - but bearable. Light is so dim and with dark interior it does not allow user to see through front glass and barely see even when opened. Control panel is not back-lit, so need a bright area to see keys. Door latch is flimsy plastic;, so would not expect it to last very long (even has ""grease"" put on bottom of hooks to open smoother).  Also very short power cord so must be withing 30 inches of power outlet or add a good extension cord.PROS: Clean, attractive style, but only ""trim"" stainless strips. Average dimensions, so fits well on most counters. Interior is full 1.1 Cu. Ft. so fairly large plates and pots fit fine - but don't expect larger platters or tall items to fit.OVERALL: Average/acceptable basic microwave for light use and simple cooking functions. Be advised that light is useless, can not see through front window, very loud operation, flimsy door and overall build. But for an inexpensive unit is does the job. Time will tell for durability."
"First off I will say it is very pretty! Just as advertised. It’s also very spacious inside (huge) & very light.With that- it’s extremely loud. Like, it can’t be normal how loud it is when it’s heating up, can it? And it’s a little uneven on the counter, I had to put a place mat underneath."
"The microwave started making loud grinding sounds when you put anything on the turn table to use it.I had an old turn table glass plate and ring. I replaced the one it came with, with one I had from an old microwave, and it seems like the grinding sound has stopped. I guess we'll see what the future holds. The glass turn table that came with the microwave didn't seem like it fit the turn table knob."
"When the microwave is in use, the outer casing vibrates and and noise is quite irritating"
Good functional microwave but fairly noisy when operating.  Does the job.  Easy to use.  I guess the more expensive units are quieter.
"Defective.  Took three times to heat a cup of water using the Express Cook 30sec.  OK.  So it's defective.  Why couldn't Amazon simply make an exchange?  Had to research another hour or two to find the right one that would fit the space.  Then due to our own mistake of throwing away the box, had to come up with another box to ship it back.  Farberware suggested that Amazon could exchange it and we could use the new box to ship it back.  Makes sense.  At least three hours of time to figure this out.  Will see if the Toshiba is any better."
"I purchased this microwave in 2021 and within 3 years, the inside top was noted to have peeling paint and rust.  I had been ingesting paint and rust particles for sometime, before I noticed this.  Without getting into too much detail,  it reeked havoc on my body.  This never happened with my last microwave oven (not this brand) while cooking the same food products.  That one lasted 30 years before it just quit one day.I did like the oven but after realizing that it was the cause of some serious health issues, I cannot recommend it, nor would I buy this brand again."
I’m pleased with the compact size but my food is taking almost double the time it takes other microwaves to heat it up.VERY INCONVENIENTOther than that a decent microwave…I guess
"The microwave seemed fine and perfect for what we wanted. We have an old house from 1967 that was remodeled, but still had no space for an over-the-oven microwave. The size was not too big and not too small. It was easy to use, but after a month, the turntable stopped working. It began to stop turning in the middle of heating something. Then, it would start up again abruptly. This would cause the glass tray and whatever food was on it to jump and jerk around. Since we got this only a month ago, I sent an email in to the company today. We will see what their response is.UPDATEYou will never believe this. The company, after I gave them a copy of the proof that I purchased this product, told me they would send me another one...AFTER I send them a picture proving I had cut the cord from the defective unit! I have never heard of something so ridiculous in all my life! I told them that I don't believe it to be good customer service or good business practice to tell me that, on top of dealing with a defective microwave, I would have to pay to take it to the dump. I also told them that they were making the insulting assumption that I am attempting to cheat them out of a microwave. I realize there is no way to PROVE that my microwave is malfunctioning, but I told them I expected to ship it back to them (AFTER receiving the new one and at no expense to myself seeing as how it is their product that is defective and it is still very much under warranty) so that I would not be without the use of a microwave and not have to pay extra to take it to the dump. They have not since responded to my email! I contacted Amazon, even though it was after the 30 day return window, and they were gracious enough to work with me. I was also told that Farberware is no longer in business. The use of the name of their company was sold to different companies for different products. So a totally different company makes their blenders than makes their microwaves etc. I will update again if they ever respond."
Nice price. I've had it for 2 months and it's starting to make noises like it wants to die. The inner plate also rattles at times like it's not balanced. Other times it's fine. It works and that's what I needed it to do. Just afraid I will need another soon
It looks great and easy to use but in the last few days it started making noises. We’ve had it for only three months. It’s being returned as soon as we can get a box for it. Amazon was great to work with regarding this problem.
I have made a lot of purchases from Amazon. I've been pleased with most everything.This microwave is large and loud.
Arrived intact but after a few uses the glass turntable shattered. Not safe and had to pay $20 to purchase a replacement glass turntable.
I have had this microwave for 3 years. I am disappointed because the inside is peeling and rusting.
This microwave stopped working after 4 years.  Not too bad.  Was easy to use.  It seemed to heat  about the same as a 700 watt microwave .  Not a bad choice.  Nothing seems to last like appliances  made 20 years ago.
"The title says it all.A large power drain occurred, dimming the lights in the house.Followed by flames filling the microwave."
"I really like the color, red but not bright red. It cooks just fine. The noise level is crazy high. I noticed that if I push down on the box it is not as noisy so I put some heavy items on the top to try to keep the noise down. So, I like the looks but not the noise."
"This microwave worked great for about a month. Now, I can't defrost or use any special features. The only way it will run is if I press any button 1-6. It will cook for that number of minutes. I cannot program seconds. I had already tossed the box, so I had no way to return it. I thought this was a good brand. I'm sorely disappointed."
"The product worked great for 14 months, then suddenly it just stopped working. No damage, it didn't get hit or fall. The microwave turns on, spins, everything, but does not heat. So then I go to the farberware store online and cannot find anything on my product. I tried submitting a support request on their website and it said if you have a microwave oven you have to contact the 3rd party manufacturer who we just got paid for our name. I thought that since it is the brand farberware, it follows the brand's rules and warranties. It doesn't. I told them the situation and they said that it only had a 1 year limited warranty and that they can't help me. When I asked them about the warranty again they told me it doesn't follow the farberware warranty as it is not sold on farberware's website.TLDR: Microwave stopped working for absolutely no reason. 3rd party manufacturer not really a Farberware product, just has the farberware name. Doesn't follow same RMA/Warranty as farberware."
Black interior stops the tiny LED from distributing the light. It's very dark inside.I got the white exterior model. Nice looking but the bright white mesh of the window prevented mefrom from seeing if something was boiling over. I had to turn off the kitchen light and get a curtain to darken the kitchen so I could see inside.
"I bought this 9 months ago. Last month the inside light failed. This week the buzzer stopped working. So far the microwave works and the buttons and LED work. But I don't expect it to last.The warranty is ""lifetime."" However you have to pay to ship it to the company and wait 6-8 weeks for a replacement, which may not be honored ""depending on factors such as use of the product, where the product was purchased, or who you purchased the product from."" IMO, this warranty is a scam."
If you look in the description it says 14.5 by 9.1 for the inside opening as you can see by the photo it is incorrect.
"The first couple months with this went great, but then I started to notice some issues. Namely, the buttons are already getting more difficult to push and may not respond until you press repeatedly or really hard.The other issue (and what prompted my coming back to lower the stars on my review) is that lately the noise is glitchy and loud. It will random do one long nonstop tone instead of the usual signal. Sometimes it continues to beep nonstop until you open and close the door several times. The stop/clear button does nothing to stop it most of the time. I have not been able to find a way to turn the sound off so I have to cook my food and stop the microwave before the time is up, or unplug it. If you're annoyed by loud noises this might not be the one for you."
Has a loud sound that’s what i dont like other than that its like any other microwave. It heat up and works
"We ordered this when we bought a home.  The return window was only one month.  It stayed in the box a couple of weeks before we moved in and actually started using it.  Return window has closed and now it is making a loud noise and the plate jerks as it rotates, after only about a month of use.  We'll be spending money again to replace this soon I'm sure.  I cannot recommend this microwave to anyone!"
"It's loud and heats stuff quick. Don't fill to the line, stay just underneath or it'll be boiled over"
"The paint is peeling from the top. There is rust underneath the paint. I heated up a cup of milk only to find all sorts of dust floating on top. This is when I discovered the peeling paint and rust. I threw the milk out, but who knows how many times I didn't see this dust on other dishes I had heated up! I hope I don't get cancer from the paint flakes.I owned this microwave for less than 3 years and already had to deal with this.The warranty provides no contact info except a mailing address. Shipping a whole microwave at great expense and risking, hearing, ""You misused the product"" and not getting it fixed is scary."
First 2 weeks worked fine. Than it started making noise when I turn on( not every time). Also takes longer to get hot than when I first used.
Rattles like a tin can as it goes around. Almost returned it for this reason but it's working OK in spite of the disconcerting noise it makes while running.
"Well, first unit ordered arrived today. Plugged it in and seemed to come alive, Pushed 6 second timer and 3 seconds into the timing seemed to be burning up and then just died - no power nothing. so  was dead on arrival- Did not work at all..... Can't say impressed so far now have to wait till a replacement arrives another week. Hopefully replacement will at least do something??? Hope I am not ordering junk? Have to wonder though. Anyway normally would not give this another chance but will try one more.. I'll update as I receive the replacement. For the 3 seconds it did work was LOUD! Much more than the panasonic micro wave it replaced.  But have to say was a nice medium unit nice interior color  as I only use it to heat things up.  I do not cook with a microwave. Well, see how the replacement does??? I'll update as I try it.So far can't say right off impressed! We'll see? More Later 9-14-23 / 9-18 Ended up sending back replacement boxed new unopened . Had purchased another brand Lowes  that worked great for aa few dollars more. Not  Faberware. Bad experience right off -DOA not impressive - pass on this get a Toshiba . Or even better if you can afford a Panasonic ."
Yes it works but it is incredibly loud the beeping is like a sonic boom & you can’t turn it down
Didn't even last a year microwave blow out.
"I was disappointed that it only ""chimes"" right when it is done.  Most modern microwaves beep every minute after the finish to remind you that something is in there!"
"Works as advertised, compact and fits nicely into limited space,HOWEVER, the beeping alert is very loud and can’t be reduced nor disabled. It’s priced right so it might be something you can live with. I’ll try!"
"It’s nice and compact, and looks very stylish. But it takes longer to cook than I thought.  Otherwise, it’s fine."
I do not like that for the price it Does not work! it won’t heat anything at all! Died in the middle of cooking !! We’ve only had it for couple of days and only used only two times just to reheat. We were trying to replace this one with one we had for over 40 some years that went out. This oven is horrible! We dislike the lighting and the dark  interior. I gave it one star because it was a pretty color. I Didn’t like the keypad it wasn’t bold or big enough for easy viewing. Clock should have larger numbers for the size of the oven. Would have given it zero star if I could! I saw the bad reviews and should have passed this one by.
"This would have been a 5 star review, but the panel on the right, that’s meant to protect the internals is bizarre. It looks and feels like cardboard, so, naturally, I took it out thinking it was part of the packing. I ripped it (cause it’s basically cardboard) while taking it out. Now, I can’t find a replacement and my microwave is at risk. It still works fine, but from everything I’ve read, this will significantly decrease the lifespan of the microwave. Such an important piece should be made of different material. Maybe screwed down. Or at least have a warning. This is such a bad design choice it feels almost intentional."
"We all love Amazon right, well, this is how they make their money.  They advertise a microwave online for Prime Day.  Said microwave stops working.  Contact Amazon, and even though I have AMAZON's protection, they make me call the manufacturer.  Who is WALMART!  They say they cannot help and neither can Amazon.  If that isn't a commerical fpr brick and mortar I don't know what is."
"So....We received this microwave on May 25th and it is now July 1st and Amazon is sending a replacement.  Why?  I don't know where to start.  This microwave looked good, of course the light never worked so we guessed on when to stop items at first.  Then, we were able to tolerate the noise it made during the first ten seconds of operation, which sounded like a pan vibrating on a washer during the spin cycle.  But....the noise it started making on June 30th was not tolerable.  Imagine metal grating on metal.  I looked on the back to get the info for when I contacted Farberware and noticed it was manufactured in May, 2017.  Two years old??  I got online and saw my last date to return to Amazon was June 24th.  Okaaaay.  I called the number provided online which was not the number.  I called the correct number and was redirected to a free emergency medical alert necklace after answering that , yes, I'm over 50.  So I hung that call up, and re-dialed.  Of course now that number was 'not available' to my service area.  So I got in touch with ""Christian"" from Amazon, (very nice and helpful.)  Christian had a direct number to Farberware who told him that model was too old and they won't service it.  Christian is now sending me a new two year old microwave and I get to send this one back.  The moral of the story??  I don't have a clue!  Just don't buy this one!"
Works exactly as a microwave ought to. The only problem is the long and loud beeping when time runs out that does not stop when you open the door or hit cancel. There is also no way to lessen the volume or mute the signal.
I like the way the microwave looks. But unless you don’t mind digging in the back of the microwave to retrieve your food it’s ok.
"This is exactly what I wanted. Well designed front panel, speed options, and smaller than my last giant plus it works great. Would have given it 5 stars, but it is so loud the animals leave the room when it's on. It's louder than my garbage disposal when it starts up. Don't know if it's just the mechanical gear-drive for the rotating plate or what, but I leave the room (if I can) as well. Great unit, but not for people who want to talk while it's on. I'll get used to it eventually. Shipping and service (getting the unit in a timely manner) was very fast and efficient. 5 stars on that.2-month update: 3 stars max for this unit. Still loud, especially at start-up but continues to bump, clang, and thump as it works (noise comes from inside unit). My old unit heated a cold cup of coffee in a minute, this unit (200watt difference) takes 2.5 minutes! I am keeping my old unit and will try to fix it myself. Sure wish the new one worked better because I no longer need the size nor functions etc. of the old unit (my needs now are for melting butter and heating up coffee), love the size."
"as you can see from the photos,  the actual measurement is 8"" x 13"", but the photo  on the amazon ad says it's 9.1"" x 14 1/2"".  (actually the exact size of the one we're replacing)  It's also noisier than our old one. I wanted to return the microwave because it's smaller than expected, but my wife thought we could live with it rather than go through the hassle of returning  and ordering a different one."
"Looked at all the ratings and bought this Farberware microwave 1000 watts on Nov 28th. Worked well till about 2 weeks ago , heard banging inside but that went away. Then this week got arcing while trying to cook some apples... burned them black in several spots. Then worked ok for a day but when cooked item (no arcing) I opened the door and saw smoke coming from the magnetron side on the right. Figured I better call Amazon. I was lucky. It was within the return items extension to Jan 31st. No hassle. Thank you Amazon. So, I packed it up (lucky I still had the box.) They sent a UPS guy to front door the next day who slapped a tag on it and off it went back to Amazon. I put in a note that it was dangerous (arcing and smoke) and should not be resold. I received a refund the next day. So starting over to figure out another to get.  Not sure which way to go since this one had 27,000 positive reviews and was in the top 10 of microwaves. So a lemon?? Who knows. Starting over."
When I unpacked the microwave the door looked higher than the frame and there were 4 small dents on the door at the top.  I tried out the microwave. It successfully heated water but I could not see inside as the light was so dim. Our last microwaves always had a bright light so you could see what you are cooking. It is impossible to see with this one. The microwave lookes nice but the handle is very flimsy. The metal part on the handle bends as you hold it. Overall it was a mistake to buy this. Faberware is usually a good brand.  I am returning it.
"The nipples on the bottom of the glass plate do not match up to the identations on the turn table. Therefore, the microwave cannot and does not turn the plate. The unit is non operable. I've seen a lot of microwaves in my tume and never ever have I  seen anything like this. Simply put somebody mixed up the proper plate for that microwave unit. So I have the pleasure of returning it.  Sloppy,  Sloppy, Sloppy planning, purchasing,  operations and QC."
The handle broke off within two months and there’s two adults in our house so there wasn’t any chance of abuse I went ahead and fixed it myself by putting a bolt and apoxy  through it since it was completely shattered off inside cheap junk
So loud it sounds like maybe the magnetron is already going out (as in upon arrival). Needed for a temporary situation so it is not worth contacting the manufacturer over but I would suggest to look elsewhere if you need a good microwave that will last a long time. I am not hopeful that this one will hold up.
"For the past 15+ years, my Kenmore microwave has been serving me faithfully. The other day it stopped heating. After a brief minute of mourning, I went online to research new microwaves and realized that finding all the features I want in a new microwave was going to be impossible. So I narrowed down all the choices available and settled on this particular Farberware model. My three main concerns with buying a new microwave were heating/power, noise, and longevity. This is what I observed with the Farberware:--NOISE LEVEL: Very acceptable -- Compared to my trusty Kenmore, this microwave is noticeably quieter. On some microwaves (especially older ones) the humming noise of the magnetron is masked by the even-louder noise of the cooling fans. On this microwave, however, the fans are so quiet that the humming magnetron is about the only thing you can hear.POWER: Excellent... at first. My old Kenmore was also 1,100 watts, but I could tell it weakened to the equivalent of about 1,000 watts over time. I therefore expected the Farberware to outperform my old Kenmore in heating up an entree, and that's exactly what it did... for the first few months. Then the power level decreased. The Farberware is now operating at the same power level as my time-weakened Kenmore.LONGEVITY: Obviously I can't comment on that since I just bought the microwave, but if craps out within the next few years, I will update this review and adjust my rating accordingly.--POSITIVE REMARKS:The Express Cook feature is a very handy and suitable replacement for the ""Add Minute"" button on my old Kenmore, which is the button I used the most. I expect to use Express Cook a lot — one minute for my morning oatmeal, and four minutes for my frozen entrees.The lighting inside the microwave is very different from the incandescent bulb illuminating the white interior I'm used to, but it works surprisingly well. I wanted to dislike it, but I can't. There's something about the LED light and the dark gray interior that makes the food particularly easy to see while its cooking.The clock/timer display is just the right brightness. Some reviews complain about the display wigging out, but I've noticed those reviews also show an older blue LED display. Perhaps the green display is a new update that fixes those issues?--INDIFFERENT REMARKS:When the food is done, the microwave beeps five times. The beeping is only a tiny bit louder/more annoying than my old Kenmore.The door makes a clunk when you close it, but the clunk is only slightly louder than my old Kenmore. It doesn't bother me.I have no opinion on the griller function because I have no plans to use it.--NEGATIVE REMARKS:There's an inconvenience built into the Express Cook's design you may want to be aware of... buttons 7, 8, and 9, by default, are disabled. In order to enable those buttons, you'll first need to press the Time Cook button. So if you have pets and were hoping for a quick 7 or 8 seconds to warm up their food, you'll need to hit the START button to give the microwave 30 seconds and then manually shut the microwave off after 7 or 8 seconds. Not a deal breaker, but the engineers who disabled those numbers on the keypad clearly never owned a cat.When you microwave something for five minutes or longer, the magnetron shuts off 15 seconds before the timer ends. So for example, if you hit 5 for 5:00 of cooking, the microwave will cook your food for 4:45.The keypad would be easier to see in dimmer light if the printed legends were white instead of tan.A lot of steam builds up inside this microwave. My old Kenmore never did that, so I'm not sure if it's a bad thing or a good thing, but it can make the food harder to see.The keypad buttons are not as as soft as my old Kenmore. They require a slightly harder press with more pinpoint fingertip accuracy. Again, not a deal breaker, but I often find myself holding the right side of the microwave with my fingers and using my thumb to press the buttons to help prevent the microwave from sliding back on my countertop.When the microwave shuts off and the beeping starts, you can't stop the beeping by pressing the STOP button. In fact, all microwave functions are disabled until the beeping stops.If you use one of the preset buttons, like Popcorn, you can't add more time while the microwave is running. If corn is still popping when the microwave is about to shut off, you can't just press START to keep the microwave running. The best you can do is quickly hit STOP twice right around the 00:01 second mark and then hit START."
I like this.microwave EXCEPT.... I don't like the lock function it has and don't understand why it's necessary.  I'm someone who lives by themselves so I surely don't have to worry about a little person getting into my oven.  Also the size and colors of directional buttons are terrible.  Important features have small print and the colors of red and green on a black panel aren't easy to see.
"Overall, this microwave is pretty good. They even have 30 seconds quick heating button. However, there is an ONE BIG FLAW. I mean when I say BIG FLAW i mean the BIGGEST FLAW you will come across especially if your hobby is cooking for your family. lol...Seriously, I don't know whose idea it was, but I hope this is not a joke. We frequently use our microwave to THAW frozen raw food before cooking. In all our previous microwaves, DEFROST function can be found with usual setting options like being able to select weight of your item, but not with this supposedly expensive microwave. This microwave ONLY has 1lb DEFROST button and you can't choose how many pounds of food you want to defrost. Only one pound at a time. So, if you want to defrost 3 pounds of chicken thighs, tough! you have to keep clicking 1lb defrost function over and over again 3 times every time microwave is done defrosting which is about 10 minutes at a time. lol. Doing the thawing this way, you will start to cook the food or meat in my case. Why? Every time you start defrosting, microwave starts from the top at its highest setting and it doesn't know you've already defrosted your stuff before. I am disappointed. I will never ever buy Farberware microwave ever again. I thought for this microwave being expensive, standard defrost function would be available to use.I am not a happy camper."
"The microwave was too small for the area, i am returning the microwave in hope that you have one in the size of 24 inches wide and 13 inches high to replace the one you sent"
Basic unit. Got the job done while it lasted. Failed at the 12 month mark by letting out the smoke (electrical component failure). Will not be buying again.
This is definitely not what I expected.  The interior light is very dim.  The description says you can see very well inside when it is turned on.  You cannot!!!!!  It is very dim.  Also the display is not bright at all.  Very hard to read what you're pushing.  Not sure if I will keep or not.  I will try it out.  I just wish the lighting was  better.
"We had to replace a microwave in spring 2022.  Enough said, lol.  I needed a door with a handle, so options were pretty limited.  I liked this one, though.  The size is perfect, letting me fit a covered two-quart casserole or a dinner plate with a tall splash cover easily.  I LOVE having the 1-6 buttons be quick minute settings!  So home it came to us.Two years in, we think it's not heating too well.  We often struggle to get our fresh veggies cooked, and my oatmeal does not cook in the same amount of time (3.5 minutes) as it used to.  I've bumped up my cooking time to 4.5 minutes and some days, I have to add even more time.  I don't know how much longer we'll be able to manage, or if it's really on its way out, but I'm pretty discouraged to have a noticeable problem after less than 2 years.  For now we are treating it as a 700 Watt microwave, which is annoying, but we're not really anxious to shell out more for a new one until we absolutely have to.  Maybe we aren't the only ones noticing a problem, as the price has dropped $30 since we bought ours."
"I have loved this microwave until now. This is the 1st baked potato I've tried to make in it and it caught on fire.Everything else has been perfect about it. It cooks great. But burns potatos better. I'm going to try and see if Farberware will help me out since Amazon is all robotic and unhelpful.I'm hoping this is just a bad microwave and that if I get a replacement it'll be a lot better with potatos.I'll update on what's up!Edit: I got this microwave returned and a replacement sent out. And my first run was a baked potato for 5 minutes. No fire, no smoke, potato needed a bit longer than 5 minutes but it has survived!!!! I genuinely think that I got a busted microwave, and I think it was a one time thing.I have heard all over about this microwave specifically having fires/electricity problems with vegetables. I would continue to monitor closely with any vegetables as I am still not convinced that my new one is completely trustworthy.I am going to leave this post for now, I will update if another potato or vegetable fire occurs.But again, everything from reheating food to cooking Ramen or popcorn, this microwave is chill and cooks it great and I'm fairly happy with it for everything but potatos so far.I do want to keep this up as a warning to others tho.Beware the potato!"
"Just received this today, took it out of the sealed box and it has a dent in the door.  How can this happen?"
it’s a good microwave for the price
"This microwave has a cord protector on the back that extends the depth by ~3"".  The cord protector and cord come straight out the back which will prevent you from putting microwave flush to wall or even near flush.  That is all I can say about the microwave because it was returned."
"I bought this microwave back in July 2023 I've only had it for a little over a year, it started messing up recently when it wouldn't heat up. Now it stopped working all together. Do they not make quality appliances anymore? Do yourself a favor and don't buy this!!!!"
"WIthin several months of use I noticed that the microwave was intermittently cooking at 80% power when using the preset express cook functions. And then it would work perfectly for several days before malfunctioning again. So I contacted Farberware and they will send a new microwave only after I cut the cord to my current one, thereby leaving me with no working microwave for probably 7 - 10 days.  I then asked for a refund which was refused.  Similar to many electronic devices, unplugging and resetting the microwave seems to work, but only  temporarily. But overall I am displeased by both the quality of the device and the warranty terms/restrictions.UPDATE - I proceeded with the warranty replacement - sent the photo of the disabled microwave - reply the next day that it was out of stock and possibly available in 3-4 weeks.  Farberware did Not offer to send another model, but did offer a refund , BUT, not for the full amount that I paid!! (minus sales tax) When it worked properly, I was satisfied with the unit.  But it had a definite problem in maintaining the correct power level (which thankfully was evident within 2 months of use).  The customer service/warranty coverage is lacking , company centric, and overall poor.  UPDATE # 2  I received the replacement microwave and  4 weeks later it also started to randomly cook at 80 % power level.  This is a known defect for over 2 years and yet the manufacturer keeps selling them without fixing the problem. There is no financial incentive as long as we keep buying their defective, cheap, disposable microwaves."
"This is pretty lightweight, you can feel it and hear it when you close the door, not sure it's gonna be very sturdy for a long life. Product information on Amazon is deceptive, shows the width of the interior chamber at 15"", but it's only 13"". You can see it in the photo on the main product page. I wanted one with the same interior dimensions as my previous one, which was 15"". Now I have to either deal with it not being able to hold items that I was always able to heat or go through the hassle of repacking and returning it, then waiting for another one. Also not pleased with some elements of the control panel, not easy to see some of the essentials. The manual is written in sometimes baffling and odd grammar. Hard to understand instructions for several of the functions. LMK if you can fathom the instructions and restrictions on using the smart sensor function, not kidding. Being generous with the 3 stars."
"This is not actually a review because I didn’t use the product in order to review it properly. (I gave it a middle rating because I had to give something.)When I chose to buy this unit I noticed that there were *others* selling this item too. So I looked and saw that there were a couple of used units. The one I chose said that it was used but that there was only some damage on the exterior box. It was also $30 less expensive. It was also listed under “Amazon.com Services LLC”Of course I felt safe to buy this unit even though it was “used-very good”. I’ve purchased several things from Amazon services/warehouse and have never been disappointed. The first picture shows a dent in the side. It’s minor and won’t affect the use of the unit, kinda what I expected, and could live with. It was going to be tucked into a microwave hole in the wall type arrangement so it wouldn’t show anyway. But!! The control panel was flopping around! It does simply snap-in, which I was surprised to see, so I tried to snap it back in. It wouldn’t stay in, which the second picture shows.I’m fairly sure that it wasn’t damaged in shipping. The exterior of the box was hardly damaged at all. I’m not posting this review to dissuade anyone from buying from Amazon warehouse etc. I’m posting this so that you can add this to your knowledge and use this bit of information in making a future decision. This review also is aimed solely at a person considering buying a *used* item on Amazon, not a new one. I believe I will wind up buying this unit... new."
"Sensor reheat only has one setting and it heats most things to boiling. Otherwise it works great. It is attractive on counter top.Also every microwave should have a option to turn off the bell or at least turn it toLow, some people work night shifts."
"Microwave looks nice and modern but two glaring issues immediately right out of the box:- Feet that are cheap, visibly fragile and slippery. Why would they not use nonslip feet on something light that’s going to be yanked open several times a day?- Space wasting straight plug. Again, this thing is going to sit on a kitchen nook or counter. How could they not select a right angle plug? Most of its competitors include one.Those are silly mistakes that hint that this was never properly product tested by actual consumers. I will have to remedy those by having to buy rubber pads and a flat extension cord which is irritating and unanticipated additional cost."
it works fine. sometimes it makes a grinding noise. Doesnt exhaust the steam
Mine lasted 3 years and 3 months
"just like other reviews have said, microwave will switch itself from HIGH power to P8 power level 8 randomly and without warning!  I’ll be microwaving something on HIGH then will hear the magnetron go off and microwave will have switched itself to power level 8.  the only way to correct is to unplug microwave and plug back in again.ALSO, this microwave create hotspots in food (even with functioning turntable).. one spot will burn and even start smoking before the rest of the food is cooked… just like early microwaves in the 1970s!The only positive was that it looked good, before I threw it away after a few months, tired of dealing with its flaws."
Wanted an option for reheating beverages. Pictures I saw seemed to show it.  This one doesn't have that option or an easy way to reheat coffee for my elderly father.
Purchased specifically because it stated in description it would fit a 13 x 9 casserole dish. Once arrived the dish fits front to back but not side side so I had to return it.
"I bought this to replace one that blew up.  I wish I had gone a little smaller.  This one is really deep, so it takes up more space than the old one.  The buttons are really dark and hard to read.  You almost need a magnifying glass to read.  And it is very noisy when it runs.  One thing I do love is the lighting inside."
"I had originally purchased this exact same microwave three years ago and it gave me three good years of daily use before I started having problems with irregular power. Sometimes an item would fully cook and other times only partially. I don’t expect more than three years of life from a countertop appliance these days so I was fine with replacing this microwave with another of the same because I really liked the way it performed. My first replacement made very loud, clicking/grinding sounds as the turntable rotated. I chopped this up to a fluke, and returned it for another of the same microwave. My replacement does the same thing. It sounds like the gears that rotate the turntable are not making good contact and are grinding together. It is very loud and irregular. It is certainly not a sound that a correctly functioning microwave should make. I am returning my second unit and replacing it with another brand. Very disappointing because we truly liked our original unit."
"Good value for the money until we found out it has exactly ONE YEAR LIFE SPAN. The trouble shooting is ""plug it into another outlet"" nope still DeaD. It's perfect for what we needed but at this price it's better to go with something super cheap from Walmart instead. If I knew I would be paying $$$ for something to last EXACTLY A YEAR. And fail IMMEDIATELY after the return window. Well. I won't be doing as much business through Amazon anymore. At least Walmart gives you a year return window exactly and not cut you off two weeks short ( we didn't even receive the microwave on Sept 4th 2022 it was a few days after that .. )Guess it will go out on the street with a free sign. Maybe someone can use it for spare parts. Looks brand new. Is still very clean.  No power surges over night and it's just dead for no other reason than I think this is what it was designed to do.Thanks for being super expensive and then failing immediately after you didn't have to keep working. Glad we live in the disposal age where all our money means nothing.I have a special needs child and I often need to heat things up but I guess today we will have to use the actual oven and increase our energy bills. Awesome. Can't afford a new one so we are literally up the creak. Thought a good name brand like this would come with better support than ""did you try plugging it into another outlet?"" ."
"UPDATE June 2023: microwave doesn't heat evenly and takes a while for food to get hot. I microwaved a plate of pasta using a paper towel and it took over 3 minutes ro heat all the way through. My wife used a silicone cover when she heated her food and it took almost 5 full minutes. I'll keep it until I see a better make and model on sale.Nice microwave but definitely NOT worth $149 (+tax). I had to replace an old GE that I had for 7 years. I wasn't looking for anything super fancy. But, I saw that this has a ""sensor"" reheat that is supposed to reduce or eliminate all the steam that builds up and also keep your food from exploding and splattering. Well, it does neither (I do cover my food thankfully). There is more steam in this microwave than my old one. Overall, it's a decent microwave but I should have gotten the one that was $70 and not this crap for $149! If you just need or want a good microwave but not all the bells and whistles that you'll most likely never use, get a $69 one and not this. Totally NOT worth the price!!!"
Worked okay but power level started fading after 1.5 years.
"This product arrived on time and works as expected. It did arrive with a rather large dent in the side, not pretty! I planned on using it in a location where the damage would not be easily noticeable and the product does function properly. I would return it, but don't want to go through the hassle. I'm coming to the conclusion that it's much better to purchase certain items directly from a store where to can actually see what you are getting. With Amazon I'm finding many items missing parts or damaged and then needing to return the items or begin corresponding with the seller, which takes time and may cause delays."
"I purchased this microwave just before  moving to a new home that did not have a built-in microwave. When I received the box, I just put it with my other belongings to pack and move but did not open the box until I had arrived in my new home.  When I arrived at my new home, the box was in perfect condition, however when I opened it up the handle was broken off of the door of the microwave. Unfortunately I was beyond the window to return it but my son-in-law was able to reattach the handle using a strong epoxy and it is held up since then. Other than that I really like the microwave it works well and has nice features. The only other issue I've noticed is that the touchpad buttons seem a little bit small so I have to be very mindful of what one I am pressing."
"I really wanted to like this microwave.  But for two reasons, I didn't even get to the point where I tried cook anything in it.  First, I wanted a microwave that was at least as big on the inside as my current one.  In the photos, this microwave was listed to be 15w x 9h x 13d, but measured with a ruler, it was actually only 13w x 9h x 13d.  That's actually a bit smaller than my current one.  So, already, that's one thing against it.  I also wanted a microwave that didn't affect my 2.4 ghz wifi and this one did.  As soon as I turned it on, one of my router signals was knocked off...the same one that was knocked off by my current microwave that I wanted to replace.  My older smaller microwaves (which I've kept as spares) did not knock out that signal.  Another way that I tested was putting my cell phone in the microwave and closed the door and try to call it (cell signal is at almost the same frequency), and my phone rang.  This also happened with the microwave that's been knocking out my wifi, but my phone doesn't ring when it's inside my older smaller microwaves.  *sigh* very disappointed."
"The microwave works fine and it's nicely powered and spacious inside for a smaller unit.Operationally, it's a challenge. The door open by pulling it which mean the entire unit sometimes pulls forward towards the edge of the shelf!  ANNOYING..."
"Thought it would be smaller, 'advertised' as countertop...It's big...and loud........Will replace eventually"
"I don’t know if this was a fluke but we’ve had this since November 10th, don’t use it every day and today February it started smoking. Not impressed"
"I love how big it is, but it doesn't even heat very well, and i have to really press the buttons hard for awhile to get the microwave to turn on."
"I like quiet so 5 beeps at end of cycle is too many. Also my previous microwave beeped once every two minutes as a reminder, a function I liked. This one doesn't do that."
Seemd good for awhile; only had for a couple of months; sounds like the rotating plate is scraping...haven't figured out why.
Blow put in 2 years..didn't  last long at all 🫤
The cord was too short I wanted to put it on the shelf my previous one sat on it will not reach outlet.
"At first, this microwave worked great. Fantastic heating, super quiet. Then after a couple months it started making growling noises, which after some research, could very well be the carousel motor, and I noticed that it doesn’t vent condensation well, causing accumulation of pink (what I can only assume was mildew even though we use it every day) around the window.I contacted Farberware three separate times with no response. I will never purchase from this brand again."
"I purchased this microwave with an extended warranty, and after 19 months it is working fine. BUT the ring supporting the plate is DOA, it simply wore out. I purchased the recommended replacement from Amazon and as other reviewers have noted, the wheels are too large to accommodate the plate.There is no way to contact customer service for a replacement part which should be a simple fix. This has been a frustrating waste of time."
"The description and the pictures show stainless steel, but the one I received was black with only steel trim on the front. I boiled a bowl of water for 3 minutes and the top got VERY HOT!! The turntable piece is flimsy and doesn't seem like it would last long. Returning."
"This is a good microwave, with a poor user interface.  Having black ""buttons"" (for the controls) against a black background was a foolish mistake.  The face of the microwave requires good (exterior) illumination for easy use."
"Microwave arrived on time;  packaging intact with no discernible exterior damage noted when unpacked.  So far;  meets expectations.  However, noted a 2 inch wide dent/dimple on the inside of the microwave back wall.  Because it is not on the exterior,  speculate use of defective part  in the assembly and inadequate inspection process.  Hopefully,  the inside ""dent"" will not affect operation.  Also, the outside metal frame is not flush on the right top side;  resulting in a small gap.  (Again, poor assembly/inspection).  Oh,  as other buyers have pointed out; the LED light is not blue as advertised.  It is green."
The product looked very nice but it did not work from the day I got it I took it an opened it plugged it in and I tried to go through all the directions and it would not work the lights were on and it was operating from the time I got it
not as powerful as 1100 unit it replaced. have increase cook time to compensate for lack of power
"I bought this version ""Farberware Countertop Microwave 1100 Watts, 2.2 cu ft - Smart Sensor Microwave Oven With LED Lighting and Child Lock - Perfect for Apartments and Dorms - Easy Clean Black Interior, Stainless Steel"" on November 14, 2023.  It was shipped to a condo that I rent out and was delivered November 16, 2023.On March 21, 2024, the tenants reported that it had failed.  There was a short where the power cord enters the microwave, and it was too dangerous to leave in operation.Maybe a technician could have fixed it, but at what cost? And there's no telling if the short caused additional problems, so it might not even be repairable.  I ended up shipping the tenants a new microwave.  Needless to say, I bought a different brand.I would not recommend this microwave, or this brand in general, to anyone, and I intend to avoid them in the future."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Farberware and Toshiba microwave units are basically using the same faulty parts.After about 1 month with the Farberware unit, I am noticing that the moisture sensor will randomly engage, lowering the power level to 8. My food is then not fully cooked, creating the danger of eating undercoked or partially raw food.Over 1 year ago I had purchased a highly rated Toshiba model. The moisture sensor was intermittently activated, lowering the power setting, resulting in undercooked food. Finally the main board developed an intermittent short sometimes causing the unit to reset.I finally emailed Toshiba, but could not get a response for repair or replacement. :-(So, I decided, no more Toshiba products.I purchased this Farberware unit. When I received it, to my surprise, it looked quite familiar. After inspecting the unit, reading the manual, and taking some measurements, I determined that the Farberware unit is reusing 90% of the Toshiba parts! It is definitely reusing the main circuit board and firmware.If you own a recent Farberware or Toshiba microwave of this type, make sure your food is cooking fully."
"You have to make sure there is enough light in the room to see the controls on the front. The numbers should be brighter along with the cook time, defrost time and functions like that. Not real happy with it."
"when i received the box has a damage. what’s more disappointing is that when i opened the box, there was a huge dent on top!!!i ordered a 1.6cubic so, its big if you have a small space in your kitchen. condition wise, it’s working perfectly fine as of the moment. the plug has 3 prongs, so i recommend to use an adaptor if your socket has only 2 prongs.overall, the product is good. except for the dent, maybe because of the delivery but not sure."
"This microwave works well however I'm concerned about how loud it is, I don't think it should sound like it does I'm a little worried, I hope it doesn't end up breaking down because I need a good microwave"
"I bought this microwave to replace the older bulky one I already had. And this one was even bigger. Out of nowhere, it will power down completely, and then power up minutes later. Too much of a hassle to return."
"Where do I even start? I can't heat up anything without having it explode all over the inside of the microwave. Before you think this is a ""me"" problem, this thing goes nuclear within 5 seconds of starting, even on half power. I can hear the food popping. The heat distribution just sucks. It's ridiculous that I have to babysit my food.It also doesn't defrost anything but a pound of meat. There no way to set a defrost weight, I kid you not. In an ideal world the meat would defrost in the fridge, I know, but I am a forgetful person and it's absolutely ridiculous that I can't defrost two pounds of meat in my microwave. Or half a pound. Or anything other than one pound.The sensor reheat function overcooks the food to the point where it's inedible. There's no function to soften butter (first world problems), and in general it's incredibly limited in all of us functions compared to my last (cheaper) microwave.Tldr: buy something else."
"Makes an occasional odd noise which concerns me a bit. But the biggest concern is that I have this on a microwave cart with a granite top and if you open the door without putting your other hand on the microwave it'll slide around. I've never had a microwave that's done this. Of course the concern is that it'll slide right off the cart, at least as far as the cord will take it. Not comfortable with that at all and view it as a safety hazard.I'm also surprised that the instruction manual gives almost no information on the grill/combo feature other than how often to press the button to get the two functions.Other than the above it's okay. Fairly quiet (other than the occasional odd noises) and it heats the food. The exterior looks good. But I would absolutely not purchase this particular microwave again."
"After the second month in use it started making a knocking noise and then a loud whining noise. Amazon suggested I call Fareware as it was still under manufacture warranty, they were a joke!! She said it would take about two weeks for the paperwork to be processed and I needed to take pictures of the unit and send it to them. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR TAKING CARE OF THIS!!!!!! Amazon gave me a refund and I purchased a replacement (TOSHIBA) which works great!"
Heats very well but this unit is LOUD.  Much louder than all the other microwaves I have owned.
"I have absolutely no idea why, but every time I close the door on this microwave, I get a long beep followed by some sort of hard reset that clears the clock. This started happening about a month after I bought it.As a microwave, it works great. The controls are rather unintuitive though. Most of the functions are coded and I actually needed the manual to figure out how to use the auto defrost feature. You get DEF1 if you press it and DEF2 if you press it again. You'll need the manual to tell you what that even means and what to do next.It is easy to keep clean because it's dark grey inside, which is nice. I just wish it didn't reset every time I close the door."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Huge dent on the top. This could be from shipping.. I have no clue all I know is it is there & VERY noticeable! And the the round glass tray moves around a lot, almost like the round plastic circle don't go with the glass tray.. it is usable because I just popped popcorn successfully.. but the the middle spinner(turntable shaft) is MISSING so the glass plate does not spin while cooking. AANNDDD the coils on the top that heat up are visibly showing, literally missing the cover, so when the microwave gets usual splatter, there's zero ways to clean it without touching the literal heating coil, looks just like the inside of the big oven, RIDICULOUS!!! 🙀"
I'd like to know why I was charged 13900 over the price I see in the list?
"This is a solid, heavy, countertop model. Set-up is simple, and the instruction manual is clear. It's easy to use, not too loud, and when I open or close the door, the whole appliance doesn't skid across the counter the way my last microwave did. BUT...it cooks unevenly. Something homogeneous and simple, like spaghetti which was simply being reheated, was hot in some places, lukewarm in others, and even cool in a few spots. That negates all the good features of this machine. I'd rather have a noisy, skidding, complex microwave that delivers an evenly cooked meal. But it's too much trouble to pack this for a return, so I'll just have to add time to whatever I'm heating and hope for the best."
"Buyer bewareI can't return it because it is over 30 days.  Barely.It was working fine,  bought it July 11th. It's now not heating anything.  We've tried resetting,  I checked the power levels and no heat.  I can't get a refund or return it to Amazon.  Faberware is not responding so I'd look elsewhere as this is an expensive mistake I've made. Don't make the same mistake I did."
"Although this microwave lasted 2 years, it has always had serious issues. For instance, the power level would randomly and periodically switch from full power (Level 10) to Level 8 for no reason. If you weren't nearby to catch it, your food would end up under cooked. Also, this was the only microwave that we've owned that would trip a circuit breaker at least once a week due to a noticeable startup surge. If you browse the negative reviews many of these issues pop up in addition to the failure of the turntable motor. Bottom line: save yourself the trouble and steer clear of this product."
Came in has a dent in the top and the glass inside was smashed and the roller for the glass plate was broken and wheels were crushed i used the glass plate and rolls out of my old microwave but I don’t think if I get a new microwave it should be new not damaged I needed a microwave so I’m not returning it just wish it would’ve come in not damaged
Will not shut off after using.  Turntable will not stop rotating even with the door open.  Tried unplugging the microwave hoping it would reset itself.  It did not. Will not purchase again.
"It's smaller on the inside than I anticipated.  I was pretty sure it was the same dimensions as my last one. Who knows. Opening and shutting the door is crazy loud. The beeper is annoyingly loud and seems like it will never stop. It's not one long beep, it's a series of beeps. I saw some microwaves have a setting to adjust or turn off the beep. This one does not.  It works as intended, however, I must have missed the reviews on how loud and annoying these two things are because I would not have purchased it.  While it's running, it's quiet. I think when I move I will leave it here and get something else."
"*UPDATE 2* Microwave caught on fire when reheating a cup of coffee.  I would stay away from this device.*UPDATE* I was able to replace one of the 3 KW3A door switches and now the microwave seems to be working fine.  Easy enough and inexpensive fix, but make sure you look up videos on how to safely replace the switch.  You can get seriously hurt or worse if you touch the capacitor, even with the unit unplugged.This microwave worked pretty good for the first two years of owning it.  There were a few times when the microwave would just abruptly stop, but overall it was pretty good.  Today, the microwave decided to continue running when opening the door.  Not sure if just the fan and turntable are running or if it is still cooking when this happens.  Doesn't seem safe to use."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Where to begin...We purchased this microwave in April of 2020.  Conveniently, all of its issues began the day after the Amazon return window closed.  Currently, I am researching the manufacturer's warranty.  Basically, any time my wife and I microwave certain foods (seems to be vegetables) they burst into flames! You will hear a low electrical hum coming then BAM, your vegetables are a flaming inferno on the plate inside.  Occasionally when you close the door on the microwave, it'll make this loud continuous beep for about 20-30 seconds and then will not work until you unplug and reset it.  It's most recent issue is now when you put food in it to heat up for say 2 minutes and it turns on and runs the full 2 minutes, however the microwave motor never engaged and the food comes out as cold as it went in.This thing is full of electrical issues and I may just have a lemon, but I want this thing replaced by Farberware before it explodes.  Buyer beware!"
Got this microwave mid November 23. It has had very minimal use in the last 5 months. We typically use it to reheat beverages or warm up food from the fridge. Yesterday it completely stopped working. We’ve checked the circuit breaker and outlet. The problem is with the microwave. It would probably cost most for a technician to come over and fix it than to buy a new one. I’m generally open to watching YouTube for fix-it videos but apparently there is a capacitor in microwaves that can kill you even when the unit is off.Very disappointed!
"Upon plugging in and closing the door of the first unit we received, we found the turntable started and ran continuously.  Farberware Support instructed  us to return it to Amazon.  We received a replacement in 2 or 3 days.  We found the turntable rotates with several slight hesitations in each revolution but have elected to keep it.  We needed a compact, 1100 watt unit and, in terms of design, this is what we were seeking.  The characters and buttons on the control panel are rather small and I can visualize some seniors  having to don their reading glasses.  Otherwise, it's a microwave, but one whose reliability is a question mark."
I will be returning this microwave and purchase another one from Amazon
"Both NEW microwaves I bought were dented on the outside and inside, box was perfect though, so no one knows why they were danaged like this. Stinks, as it's a lot of work & I've been a week without one. Ugh"
"It looks great, but it vibrates and rattles! I didn't want to deal with boxing and returning so I thought Id attempt to 'tighten'. Well, the tool needed is not included, nor a tool typically found in ones toolbox. So, I couldnt go that route. Tried tightening every other screw I could find. Sounded better for a day or two. Then rattling again. Almost like it's gonna BLOW! Decided to try tightening from inside and the little silver plate inside cracked in half when I carefully released it from the holding notches/grooves. Needless to say, I've decided to break down, pack it up and try again. Thinking MAYBE I just got a loose one and another would be more sturdy. LOL...of course the 'Return Window' closed about a week ago! Stuck with a metal rattle I guess. Very frustrating"
"Had this microwave for exactly 6 months and 3 days. It started making a loud noise when heating then just stopped heating.  The turntable turns, the clock works, but the microwave doesn't heat.  Amazon will not take it back and Farberware isn't open on the weekends.  It's heavy and we're old.  I'm not happy with either Farberware or Amazon.FYI:  Farberware microwaves are NOT manufactured by Farberware, rather Edge.HOWEVER UPDATE:  Amazon came through.  When I could not reach EDGE, Amazon allowed me to return it.  Love you Amazon!"
The microwave doesn't work half the time. It doesn't heat up what you place inside. To get it to work I have to unplug the unit to I guess reset the damn thing.Unfortunately I can't send it back since it's 3 months old 😝. My last microwave lasted over 20 years!
"This microwave heats ate the very bottom, makes some great volcanos. Our old Panasonic was a much nicer microwave imo.Works fine otherwise but beware and be ready to take the tray to the sink often."
"Solid Microwave for the price. Takes alittle longer than usually to warm up food, got it for my office so it gets the job done, but I would recommend a stronger Microwave for a home, especially if it's going to be used alot."
"Container should 1000 W, wanted 1100 W."
"Don’t know what the average lifespan of these microwaves are – – this lasted four years until last night when I turned it on it started sparking inside. The digital number display also stopped working a few months ago. Was good appliance, easy to use, small footprint, pretty good power, not loud, but I will likely try another brand for this next purchase."
"I have contacted Amazon regarding this matter, and they have not addressed the matter of repairs or returning the item back."
"kinda cheap feeling but I was okay with that at first until now. Arrived mid March, now in June the light started flickering but it's outside of the return window. The door is very light and cheap, when you shut it it's very loud. also, the microwave is very loud as it runs. I miss my old microwave.. I should've shelled out mor eand gotten a Panasonic or a Sharp.. won't purchase this brand again. should've been a 60$ microwave for the quality.. Only real pluses are that it doesn't keep beeping when you open the door, it beeps to let you know and doesn't do annoying reminder beeps. Also, you can press the off/cancel button and turn the clock off which is nice. other than that, not worth it. Pay a little more for a better microwave.  The grill function is kinda useless. I tried toasting bread, took forever to even get slightly crispy. By that time it's easier to just through a slice in a buttered pan.. Oh well."
"Very well made (much better than the old RCA model it replaced). It heats well and evenly but the firmware in it has a few glitches requiring a firmware reset by the removal of power from the unit for 20 seconds or so. It happens so often I have now put the oven on a plug-in switch. These glitches often result in the buttons not working on the front panel and the alarm sounding continuously for 20 seconds or more when the door is opened.Also, the LED light inside isn't near bright enough. And the buttons for entering the cooking time and power are often very slow to respond, which is annoying. And, I really don't like the touch-type buttons. I much prefer buttons that provide tactile and/or audio feedback when touched.Either something is wrong with the oven I received or the company didn't adequately test the firmware in this model before approving the design for sale to the public."
The inside is grey! You can hardly see what is cooking inside or where to place the dish.
"Just had a MAJOR issue I self resolved that all owners of this product ""Will"" face  (04/26/2023 -1010am pacific). Micro will work (spin/make noise/light on after 5 minutes and still food was cold)but it will ""NOT"" re~heat/cook product ....I had to unplug microwave for 20 seconds and then plug it back in...Then it was reset then resolved....but...this is a product defect...Repeat..""This product should NEVER act/function this way EVER! Product delivered March 22nd ,2023!"
It's a microwave. It worked great until the rotating glass carousel stopped working. Now it works without a rotating glass tray.
"I didn't realize how small it was compared to my prior microwave. I thought having a grilling option would be good, but my family wouldn't even try it. I guess my only mistake was getting such a small microwave, but I will say it serves our purpose of defrosting and reheating food. I wish I would have chose a larger oven, because I have a bacon cooker that can fit into the oven but it will not rotate because the oven is too small! Oh well, I got what I ordered. It is great for small apartments or a single person."
"I have always loved Farberware products, however this purchase was such a disappointment to me.After 18 months it just stopped working. After checking circuit breakers and outlet it appears it just won’t power on. If you close the door it will flash the led lights but then it goes off again.I didn’t think a microwave would have a working span of 18 months.I would not recommend this microwave it only has a year warranty"
"The oven arrived 5 days after ordering.  Thanks Amazon!  Nice looking appliance.  However the instruction manual is awkward, almost incomprehensible.  Obviously written by someone with poor command of English.  Examples:  ""The reheat food can be covered with the lid.""  ""Reheat food is dinner plate.""  ""The sensor will sound twice when the steaming is emanated.""  I might give the microwave a higher rating if The instructions on how to operate it were clearer."
"Just about 10 months and it's about gone.  Not use heavily, only two people."
"It does everything well except the rotation timing is off. When I put in a cup of coffee handle sticking forward after one or two minutes the handle sticks backwards. Having a hard time getting it out without burning myself. My previous microwave did full rotations. So if you enter a cup off coffee handle sticking forward at the end of 30 seconds, one minute, two minutes, etc. when the microwave stops the handle is still sticking forward. Easy in an easy out."
I've only had this microwave oven for a couple months a d I just don't know...It seems to work great at times yet it sometimes seems like there is something wrong with with the oven...since day one. I reviewed microwave ovens for at least 6 months and chose this particular oven for many reasons. The majority of reviews said this microwave was very quiet but I have to disagree. Only time will tell how long it will last but I have my doubts.
"I had some simple microwave for years and did not know I can hate a microwave until we got this one in September'20... It heats food VERY unevenly with one side burning and other one remaining cold. Small amounts of food (e.g. cat food) burst all over the place in less than 10 seconds (it has been getting worse with time)I cannot adjust any settings (e.g. power, etc.) - and yes, I read the manual. The microwave is VERY LOUD (especially the door closure)... I wish I returned it in time."
"The Farberware microwave is OK for most basic uses.  Plenty of volume. OK appearance of machine. Instructions for use OK if rather skimpy.  The cooking levels sometime do not work, i.e. for frozen dinners do not cook the item thoroughly but instead leave food still cold in part of tray so that there is a need to add minutes to time.  Maybe I just didn't understand the instructions?  It would help if the selection button keypad was better lit, too dark when using in a dark kitchen."
"I really loved this microwave soo much! It's huge, the convenient door handle, the buttons never broke, and it heated really well. But sadly after only 1 year and 8 months it sparked and started smoking and smelled like it was burning. I have to say I'm pretty sure my mom didn't put anything that contained aluminum in it when it happened (it was a cupcake with a plastic/baking wrapper). I'm still on the fence if I want to repurchase cause my old microwave lasted so many years."
"The ""Quick"" buttons really do not work. How many people have just a ""Pound"" to defrost? If you have anything over or under a pound, you haver to use trial and error to figure the correct time and power setting to set. The same is true if it is beef, chicken, or fish. I could list a lot of other things that are useless, but my time is moiré valuable."
Poor reliably.  One year and it is now running when door opens.
"Meh...Findng the reheat buton and other important functions is an expedition into nowhere-- no instructions included. Miss the GE.Shouldn't have to be classified under""background in rocket science helpful"""
"I ordered this microwave at the start of November. It was supposed to arrive within 2 days. It was almost 3.5 weeks late, past the point of being able to request a refund. I did request the refund, and received said refund about a week ago. I was surprised it showed up. However, its box shows considerable signs of damage and mishandling. The Styrofoam on the inside was completely wrecked. I opened it up and set the microwave up. Put the clock time in. About 30 minutes later the inside light came on and stayed on. Then, the turntable started spinning. I unplugged it and looked online for help. Found none. Attempted to cook something in it anyway, but it won't start by button command. I'll be returning it, and am glad I already received a refund. It may as well be a paperweight. There's also a screw missing from one of the outer side panels, though I don't believe that's the cause of the microwave's faults."
Gave this microwave 2 stars because it’s very large and easy to use (even for my small kids) but it has now completely died after only 3 months of use.
"This microwave is a lot harder to operate than it should.  Not all of us have kids that are not looked after that requires a child lock.It should NOT be this hard to merely OPEN the dam thing.Also, this is the 2nd GE microwave that I have gone through in the past 3 weeks.Stay away, stay away!!!  This is ridiculous!!!!!the instructions that came with it don't tell you about the little button on the side.Ya, there's a friggen button on the side NOT found in ANY of the instructions.  Not even YouTube had this special little secret nugget of infoRidiculous"
"Purchased December 2019 as a Christmas gift for FIL. Microwave completely stopped functioning June 2024, and just to have someone diagnose the problem will cost over $100. FIL lives by himself and just recently retired so it has not seen a lot of use. As this is not the only review I've seen about this particular microwave's short service life, I would advise against purchasing."
"Very large microwave - like 50% bigger than a normal microwave. Was difficult to find a place on the counter where it wouldn’t look awkwardly large, but eventually worked a spot out.Aside from it’s very large size, the microwave seems to otherwise be a pretty standard functioning microwave. The popcorn button is pretty cool in that it automatically detects when the popcorn is done no matter what size popcorn you put in (I’ve tried standard popcorn bags and the snack size bags). My old microwave simply had you press the button multiple times until you selected the correct bag size.After about a week (3 or 4 uses in) the back of the microwave started making a loud rattling sound when the microwave is in use. Initially I tried pressing on the back of the microwave firmly to see if the rattling would subside, and it did. So I thought I’d just need to tighten the screws on the back (which didn’t appear to be loose at all), but before I ever got around to that (2 or 3 uses later) and I realized pressing on the back no longer makes a difference. I’ll be contacting the manufacturer for a warranty repair/replacement since I was stupid enough to throw the box away so I can’t return it. Usually I keep boxes for major purchases for at least a year, but I was in the middle of a move and couldn’t do with anymore clutter at the time.I’ll be back to update the review on the warranty service I receive. Wish me luck!"
Microwave box was delivered with a huge gash in the side which was covered with packing tape. Of course the microwave itself was damaged. Door looked like someone banged it with a hammer. Should have known….
"I was actually expecting this microwave to be as good as the one I bought 10 years ago.  When the door shuts it sounds like tin.  I still have the other one up, so compared 30 seconds on high with one cup of water in using identical coffee cups.  The NEW microwave, this one, which is supposed to be more powerful, came out tepid…luke warm at best.  My OLD microwave (same model at 1150 instead of 1250) was hot.  That just isn't right.  I'm going to keep it for awhile and see if it perks up and starts heating properly.  Otherwise, it is going back."
"The only reason I bought this unit is that it fits in my built-in cabinet setup, and I could reuse the trim assembly which would otherwise cost an arm and leg.I received the unit in about two weeks.  It took couple of hours to install it in the Kitchen cabinet.  When I turned on the unit, the inside light was not working and the fan was vibrating and sounding like a 747 on take off.  It took another hour to remove and repackage for return shipping.The replacement unit arrived in 10 days.  When I opened the box, I found the new unit housing was damaged and out of shape.  At least, this time I was lucky not to have installed it.  Repackaged and ready for return shipment.It appears like they are just shipping returned items.  Unless you want to waste your time, stay away."
"I was disappointed with the appliance when I started to use it.  Just wasn't as quiet as the machine we used for the past 30 years.  Otherwise it seemed to work fine.  Now the issues:1.

Very disappointed."
