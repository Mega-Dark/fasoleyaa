Good watch. Bought it to track my sleep & keep track of my heart rate. It won't track my sleep & I am not sure about the accuracy of the heart rate feature. It seems off also. Ok for the price.
The display is nothing as shown. √å had nothing but trouble working it.
"I got the watch to be my step counter and to track my walks. It over counts my steps and under counts the miles I walk which is frustrating. I'm not sure about all the other stuff that comes with it, more than I know what to do with or use. The sleep app is nice except having to wear it all the time.  If into all that it has is a good thing. üëç."
"This was advertised to calculate calories for all hours of the day. That‚Äôs false. It only counts active calories, which means you will never know what your 24 hour output is in order to calculate intake correctly. Useless."
"Title says it all!  I got what was supposed to be this watch back in 2023 and loved it, and just went into my past orders and clicked order again.  This time I ordered one in each size, they sent me both large sizes.  Neither watch was the same as the one that I reordered.  Tried to contact seller, NO reply!  Then I started a return and thru eye going to keep over half of what I paid for the two watches, the rest gets kept for a ""restocking fee"".  I refuse to allow them to resell these again and do that to someone else.I well throw them away before I do that. These watches are garbage are maybe worth $2.00 if that.  P.S.  They only hey a star because they make you add a star."
"I bought this watch to track my steps. I've always wanted a fitness watch, but didn't want to spend crazy money. I was excited when I found this one and figured I'd give it a try. I did everything needed to set the watch up and connect to my phone/app. Everything synced first try, but wouldn't stay connected. I had to reset the watch and start over again and the same thing happened. Now I can't get it to sync at all. The app doesn't even recognize the QR code. I also don't think it tracks your steps accurately. I'm very disappointed because now I think I'm just going to have to spend the money on one that actually works the way it says it does."
This was really good for a few weeks and then I stopped receiving notifications. Even after I reset the Bluetooth and reset the app still no notifications.
"I got this watch mid August.  I wanted a step counter and the watch was great for that.  I liked the associated app as well.  The sleep counter counts time spent in bed reading as ""sleep hours"" but that wasn't that important.  Then last week, during my yoga work out it keep turning on and asking if I wanted to pause the work out, and I'd tell it no.  When I was done, it said that I'd done a 15 min workout (it was an hour), burned no calories and had 84 bpm heart rate.  This is hot yoga, so very active.  And it no longer syncs the work outs to the app.  So yeah, a decent watch if you're willing to buy a new one ever 3 months."
"I didn't get the color I ordered and it's difficult to use. The instructions helped me pair the device to my phone, but stopped there. I've been playing with it and I just can't figure it out. It's comfortable, easy to put on/take off, nice wristband. Advertisers as sweat proof, but the instructions tell you to clean immediately after if sweat gets on it and to not put it on wet skin. Do not recommend. Waste of 15 bucks."
Nice watch but not what I expected with functions
Doesn't do everything I need it for
Thus doesn't take a charge. I have been charging for 8 hours plus and it is still at 12%.
"I bought this after I had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia and my doctor encouraged me to get one. After a couple weeks I noticed my wrist was starting to get a rash. The reason I am giving only 2 stars is because it is impossible to find a cloth band for it. I tried finding a braided band or something other than what it is, and I am having NO luck."
"I was able to log into the app one time and review the settings. Unfortunately after that I come to a screen that says I need to allow certain settings. It does not allow me to turn them on and then something has gone seriously wrong and shuts down. I have updated my apps. I have updated my phone. It is definitely not my Google pixel 7. It is the smartwatch app that is poor. I'm unable to make calls, unable to send messages or read them and unable to check the weather on my SmartWatch. It's great for heart rate and tracking your exercise, but that's it."
"The selection of exercises is low compared to other watchs of a similar price. The watch faces one can choose from are extremely limited. Abysmally so. The Privacy policy is a nightmare. They basically say that all information they collect (including your first and last name, email address, personal information) can and will be sold to Third Parties. How sick! Just disappointed in this watch expecially the watch faces' lack of variety."
Not a fan of watches so I didn't want to spent a tons. Good value for feature.
"I mostly use it to count steps, not sure how accurate it is, I don't really use any other features. You can chose different wallpapers which is nice."
"Super disappointed so far. Bought 2, different colors. They don't even use the same app (green uses veryfit and purple uses fitdock)  so we can't even directly compare. Seems ridiculous to have a common listing when it appears to be the same item and just a different color band...but apparently not. Also, it is NOT waterproof to 50m. You cannot even showet with it. Cold water only. Will pool test tomorrow but chances are the misleading add and two very different products from it will be returned."
I want a new watch sent out to me and I will send this one back when you send me a return label
"This WAS a great watch that tracked my heart rate, sleep, and paired easily with my iPhone. Until it died just outside of the return window. Now it no longer vibrates, tracks my heart rate, or sleep. But hey it still works for time and is sort of paired to my phone. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è At least it was cheap. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It‚Äôs not as good as i expected it to be, I didn‚Äôt think the watches would be different based on the colour. I got the black one and the wine colored one and they are so vastly different. This one cannot connect to your phone and as you see in the video the screen does not utilize the entire watch face which i don‚Äôt love. As of right now my complaints are superficial as I have yet to actively see how the watch works or how the battery works."
Love the color of band. Really easy to use. It isn't hard to find apps etc. It's frustrating though....I've worn it for 3-4 days and the glass is scratched.....I have a desk job.  Disappointed
I thought I‚Äôd be able to connect it to my walk fit app and it won‚Äôt.  I also added a picture on the face and it‚Äôs super blurry.
today i received the watch but the watch color is not as similar as advertised in amazon page. Received one is more unappealing and dull version of purple or lilac.
Some one knows how to change the time? I've tried going in settings but there is no way to find where I can reset the time.
I thaut it was gonna be a darker purple have not connected to my phone yet and it won't stay on 2024 date set it always goes to 2023 so the day of the week is always off
I might keep this only for its sleep monitoring. Otherwise it's a cheap piece of junk. It arrived 96% charged on a positive note.
Watch seemed to work at first but was not connecting to phone.Downloaded app via qr code provided and still had issues connecting to my phone (Samsung Galaxy).It has the data on the watch but is unable to transfer it to the phone or the fitness app.
"I enjoyed this watch quite a bit for exactly 8 weeks. Then the watchband broke off‚Ä¶ The pin busted and could not be repaired. I tried to glue it back and it lasted about 36 hours.Also, not all of the settings apply easily. I could not turn on or off ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù or ‚Äúlift to read.‚ÄùI know it was an expensive, but I thought it would last longer than eight weeks."
Limited on what it can do. Apparently has an Alexa app but isn't compatible. Can tell you someone is calling can't accept calls . Battery last throughout the day. The new watch o bought still is at 72 percent after 3 days. Same price too!
"Seemed to be good, especially for the price for what I needed. Unfortunately the watch app wouldn't let me change faces on the watch. The watch itself after me trying a reset, would no longer connect to the fit dock app. Disappointed and sending back."
"It won't let me change the year to 2024, I've tried multiple times and it defaults back to 2023, other than that it works for what I need it for"
It‚Äôs definitely a $16 step tracker. No real bells and whistles.  To clarify because the description was vague about the sports feature and I had typed in swimming tracker. This watch does not track swimming at all.
So it‚Äôs a cool watch but the only issue is everyday I have to reset the time and date. It‚Äôs annoying but outside that it does what‚Äôs needed.
"In the process of returning this watch. I‚Äôve owned for one week. Charged to 100%, and by 6pm the same day, it was down to 62%. I had to turn the wrist sense off to make it through the weekend.The pros: tons of watch faces to choose from. I do like how many settings you can get to from the watch (ones I had in the past were mostly controlled by the app). The band is also nice.If you‚Äôre okay with changing your watch everyday then maybe you‚Äôll like it. I‚Äôm not impressed."
"The watch looks great. That‚Äôs the best compliment I‚Äôll give it. Not sure what I was expecting based on the price but I have a few critical issues with this watch. Firstly, the step counter is definitely not as accurate as other step counter watches I‚Äôve had in the past (FitBit). Next, the strap loop does not stay in place for me during activity so I‚Äôm frequently slipping the band back under the loop to keep it in place. The most frustrating issue is that I have an iPhone 12 using iOS 18.0.1- and despite trying literally *every* single troubleshooting option I could find on google/tiktok/the GloryFit app/online forums, the ‚ÄúMessages‚Äù feature only alerts me re notifications I get from apps on my iPhone, *NOT* text messages. I can‚Äôt even read texts. Yes, I have SMS messenger enabled. There is apparently no way to reach out to the makers for actual product assistance. That royally sucks in my opinion, cheap or not. I get that it‚Äôs relatively inexpensive for a smartwatch, but still. If you‚Äôre reading this and you think I‚Äôm mistaken, PLEASE say so and I will keep trying to troubleshoot and revise my review.*revised 11/7/24 after customer support reached out with troubleshooting help, I am now able to view incoming text message notifications from my iPhone."
"Update: I purchased this October 11th today is Oct 29, now it‚Äôs no longer transferring my health data/steps to my phone.I got this because I wanted to be able to monitor my steps and BP. So it does the Job but it sucks at transferring data to my health app on iPhone or any other app for that matter. The battery power is really good. I charged the watch the day I received it and it‚Äôs been a week and the battery is at about 65%. That‚Äôs a big plus. However you do not receive messages on your watch and if a phone call comes through and that‚Äôs a big if‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ only the number pops up so you can‚Äôt tell whose calling so with that said only get this if you‚Äôre trying to count your steps. While it sucks at transferring all the data you can manually add the data on your health app. Biggest win is battery life."
"First this is a ""used like new"" watch I got discounted from Amazon. I assumed someone bought it opened it didn't like it and returned.  It arrived looking brand new. Now about this watch.  I bought this (blush pink) as a replacement for the same brand and version I bought in October of last year.  My original watch had gotten scratched. The only difference was the color from the last watch I ordered. I went to my previous orders, clicked buy again and selected the blush pink color.  Everything else should be the same.  Well it's not.  I was disappointed to find that they changed the app that is used with the watch. With this app, Inxfit, there are far fewer watch face options, 59 total,10 of them are X-Mas themed. They're super basic and they aren't nearly as nice. The Glory Fit has 100+ faces before I stopped counting, they're really cute and I could load a picture up easily too. I included a screen shot of some of the faces to compare.  The green version I previously ordered used the Gloryfit app which was ok but didn't give detailed sleep and fitness feedback like other fitness watches I've used.  With this new app, Inxfit, I can't change the grid layout like I could with the previous watch.  I trusted that it would be exactly the same so I threw the package away and now I can't return it.  The different app must come with a different operating system but this just sucks.  Waste of money. I included a side by side, the pink watch is obviously smaller with a shorter wrist band.  The fit of the watch is ok, the feel of the strap is fine. It isn't too heavy on wrist. Durable enough but I don't like how easily the previous watch scratched up but the functionality was really good especially at the price point. This version though? Connectivity is awful.  I keep trying to pair the watch and I've had to reset to factory settings 3 times already. Overall I feel I've wasted my money.  I liked the green one that got scratched, I loved being able to answer and talk right into my watch for calls. The app was pretty good. My favorite app for a fitness smart type watch came with the amazfit watch but that watch was more expensive. It could see texts and calls but didn't have a speaker to actually take a call.  Their app (Zepp) was excellent.  A Combo of the Zepp app detailed fitness and health feedback with the faces and call functions of Gloryfit works be awesome. If I find I like it more or they improve it I'll update my review. As it is I can't give the same hearty recommendation I would have for the green one.  A rubber face protector for the screen would be cool."
"***3 MONTH UPDATE***While I still like this watch I dropped the rating to 3 stars. It now pops off my wrist where the band connects to the watch daily. I'm not sure how but the glass is now permanently scratched as well. It works great but it needs to be a little more durable.I love this watch. It really exceeded my expectations. Fits well, great battery life, and nice screen/app options. My only dislike is that the band pops off the watch frequently with very little force. It pops off my wrist 2-3 times a week. Always at the most inopportune times."
"I purchased this watch primarily for the sleep tracking and for the ability to listen to Spotify on walks and working in the garden without having to carry my phone. For these reasons, I am dissatisfied.The sleep tracker may or may not be accurate. There are mornings I am extremely tired, and the watch indicates I received a great night sleep.... and vice verse. The jury is still out on that one.If you are looking for a device that will give you some space from your phone, this is not it. It's much like a key fob for your car in that it has to be in close proximity to your phone for the music to work.The pedometer is also not accurate. I have been awake for an hour and have put away my dishes, gotten things situated in the kitchen taken the dogs out, and other small tasks, and it is still displaying 0 steps.What I like about it:I can take phone calls from the watch.The background is customizable.It tells time.I guess you get what you pay for with this one."
"Very hard to program the correct way. Other than that it's okay.  I still can't get it programed to do blood pressure, but will keep trying."
"It's a good watch for it's value. Easy to use interface. I had to get a replacement because of Bluetooth disconnection issues but, with the replacement I decided to send the watch back because the sleep data is wrong and the GPS tracking in the app was a false claim. I like to see the GPS data route for assurance of accurate distance configuration etc...PROS:SPORTS: multiple activities from out door, indoor, dancing and gymnastics. Stop watch, timer,Breathing ,blood oxygen, sleep and heart rate.SMART FEATURES:calling: make calls from the watch, view call logs, dial. SOS contact. alarms, calculator, female cycle, messaging alerts and response option on Android. The watch assistant wakes your phones Google or Siri assistant to provide info.Music control, weather, find my phone, flashlight,remote camera and 1 game.Blood oxygen and heart rate are accurate readings in my experience. Step count is accurate as well if it logs the pace.CONS:women's cycle is limited with safe mode, Cycle and alert when it's near the time. More detailed on other budget watches.Call speaker is low and a bit muffled because of the speaker cut out location.False GPS route data, it's not available in app as advertised.Don't always record pace data per workout.No watch section to preview all workout session data for the day but, it's available in the app.No end time to the workout data in app.Sleep data algorithm is inaccurate. It struggles to detect when you are sleep or just dormant of activity out side of 10pm-10am. G-d forbid if you work overnight and sleep during the day within the week.üòÇGVR customer service is bad but, Amazon is responsive and good regarding the device issues.Messages can only be responded to through text not, third party apps such as What's app, Facebook messenger etc...Overall its a great value if you want basic data for workouts and alerts. The battery typically last 4-5 days."
"Overall this watch is decent and has some nice features, unfortunately they all don't work as well as they should.The step tracker works pretty well. It doesn't seem as accurate as the health app on my phone, but is very close.The weather doesn't seem to update unless I manually refresh it on the app.I have been unable to get the messages/notifications fully working. I have reinstalled the app, reset the watch and relinked the two multiple times and even though all the settings are enabled it only receives some message notifications, while others never come through. Some people's texts and automated messages work while others don't. It seems to receive notifications from apple devices, but not android.You can add a custom picture to the watch face and change text color, but that's where the customizations end. You cannot change the screen layout and have limited ability to change the watch shortcuts. Getting to a stop watch for example forces you to go through multiple menus.Again, overall this is a decent watch with a lot of features. Your mileage may vary with some of those, but for a first and cheap smart watch it's a good deal."
The only thing it is missing is a gps tracker.  Very basic and barely a smart watch
"So this is a decent watch. I bought it in January and have only had a few glitches here and there which I anticipated for the price. However when I bought it, I made sure it was waterproof as I enjoy swimming a lot. Now I typically don't wear my watch in the shower only because I just don't like to, but I recently went swimming with it for the first time. (I haven't had a chance yet since I teach full time and have a kiddo who keeps me busy in the school year. Much to my dismay when I went swimming this week my watch immediately stopped working. I've tried getting in contact both with the seller and Amazon, but it's definitely past the 30 day return of Amazon and i have yet to be successful gettimg in contact with the seller. So if you want a waterproof watch, I recommend buying a different brand."
"Fairly easy set up.  Battery life good.  Step and sleep trackers were substantially inaccurate, but gave me a ballpark figure.  My wrist is small and it fit on the very tightest hole, but buckle dug in and was a bit uncomfortable.  Sadly, I fell while wearing and the screen shattered.  It was a very hard fall and I also fractured a bone in two places.  I may reorder or look for a slightly upgraded smartwatch."
"I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just taking a minute registering or what but‚Ä¶ I decided to test it today since I wasn‚Äôt going to be doing a lot. Just sitting, napping, etc. I‚Äôm not moving much at all and I didn‚Äôt open the box till 3pm today. It‚Äôs 8pm now. I think this watch is counting all my hand movements as steps. I had taken a nap for about 2 hours and it counted 20 extra steps and I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs when my arm was moving. So that‚Äôs a problem.It‚Äôs also having a problem registering messages even though it connected to Bluetooth, it just doesn‚Äôt wanna display them. It‚Äôs also not wanting to sync to my apple health for some reason as well even though I synced them together multiple times.Idk. The watch does look nice and seems like it could be really good but it‚Äôs kinda a rough start at the moment. The call function does work though and the people I‚Äôve called from it say they can hear me pretty clearly so that‚Äôs good."
"The interface is about what you would expect (low-grade, but still ""functional""). The aesthetic and fit are actually pretty great. I honestly haven't owed this long enough to truly consider the durability aspect, but the build quality ""seems"" to be decent from what I've initially gathered. Nevertheless, for the cost, I would say this would be a decent buy. It features a step/calorie counter, sleep analysis (which I've never used/can't comment on), weather, music, and connectivity to iphone for messages/calls (which is pretty wonky/irritating and more bothersome than anything, honestly). So yes, for the money - there is a valid attempt at a good product here. I may even go as far to say that this could be ""recommended"" for a budget-seeker such as myself. HOWEVER, if you do ANYTHING handy, or plan on wearing this watch while doing activities - PLEASE BE AWARE - this watch face is super delicate and will scratch with the slightest of ease. I have worn this watch twice and there are already two ""knicks"" on the face that I have no idea where they came from, as I have not ""banged"" this watch against anything. That said, pretty disappointed for the most part, knowing that if the watch has already suffered this kind of damage, it won't be long before it's so scratched up it can't even be read. (Not to mention, I can only imagine the rest of the watches quality likely follows suit).Buyer beware - I'm on the fence about this one actually being a budget-friendly suggestion."
It has soft hum/buzz alarm that is handy.  Maybe real iPhone have that too? I knew when calls were coming  in. It used to show text messages. That stopped 6 months in. Stopped heart rate tracking last Mont and also  lost local weather info. Time to look for a new one but not going for expensive iPhone.
Watch was very nice but never could receive my text messages. Did receive calls and Facebook notifications though. Set up was too complicated
"It‚Äôs mediocre at best. It doesn‚Äôt count all of my steps which makes me walk more, which is fine, but it misses a lot of steps. Definitely sending this back this week."
"HONEST REVIEW!!! I bought this watch on NOV. 24, 2022. I would have rated lower but for the cost it really does work nicely. Some nights for some reason it would not record sleep data but most of the time it did. It‚Äôs mostly accurate though sometimes it said I was in light sleep I was awake. Again it‚Äôs mostly accurate. The heart rate was pretty accurate. The battery life is amazing! A full charge will last all week and sometimes more. I love that you can see txts on it and when someone is calling you though you can‚Äôt answer or respond to either. It‚Äôs mostly water proof. I‚Äôm a dog groomer and bathe dogs with it on. Some of the screen started to glitch a month ago but it‚Äôs been tolerable I just set the light to medium and stopped changing it from dim to bright and I haven‚Äôt really needed the glitched screen since. However, today is March 31, 2023 so 4 months after purchasing it quit charging. I tried reaching customer service months ago with a couple questions about the sleep mode not always recording and never got a response so don‚Äôt ever expect any customer service help. I guess for 4 months of constant wear for the price it isn‚Äôt bad but if it wasn‚Äôt as accurate as it was I‚Äôd be rating lower. Still want to because of the lack of customer service and it only lasted 4 months but what do you expect from a $25 smartwatch? Hope this helps!"
"I wanted to love it and I looked forward to wearing it.  It was not as easy to set up as the reviews said.  Sadly,  I returned it."
I tried it out for about 5-6 weeks to see if I could get used to it. The step count and calories burned were never accurate. While working out the heart rate sensor was delayed. The screen likes to go into a setup mode every time it is touched for longer than one second. It also does it if the side button is pressed too long. This happens on accident many times a day. And the strap constantly comes out from the little strap holder so it‚Äôs flapping around.
"I was super excited because the reviews seems good, but this watch is super inaccurate. Specifically, the heart rate and steps are inaccurate. It will tell me my heart rate is 74 after 30 minutes of exercise. Not happy with it.Edit -- Customer Service reached out and offered to refund the purchase. I will shop for their other products and see what jumps out at me. I appreciate them fixing the situation."
"Had this watch for less than a year. While I like the functionality of the watch, I am disappointed that it is not holding up very well. It already has a fairly big crack on the corner of the watch."
The step tracker stopped working a few months after I purchased the watch. Its been very difficult to contact the seller to ask questions. And I  cannot locate a manual for troubleshooting.  Frustrating.
I like this watch a lot. The quality and comfortability is great. Its a fraction of the price of more high end brands and does the same amount of stuff. The battery lasts forever..and stays on the charger good. I had the Fitbit versa 4‚Ä¶and trying to connect that to the charger was awfully frustrating. This one has a magnetic charger.
"Was very pleased with this at first, then stopped wearing it for several weeks (having set it up to sync with cell, etc.) and when I went to use it again, the time and day did not sync correctly. Could very well be user error, but......"
"This may not be anyone else‚Äôs experience, but I thought it was worth sharing with those who have dogs. When I opened the box, the watch looked really nice and I was so excited to put it on and use it, since this was my very first fitness tracker/smart watch. However, when I turned it on my dog started going crazy, running all around the house barking and looking very agitated! I finally figured out it was a noise from the watch that I couldn‚Äôt hear but she could. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the watch or if all fitness trackers bother her. Needless to say, I had to return this one and order a different kind. We‚Äôll see if it bothers her as well.Update a few days later: I did buy a different fitness tracker and my dog likes it!!üëç"
"Watch is great, but I'm about to send back my second set of straps. Description says 22mm. I bought 22mm and the straps were way too big. I tried 20mm and still too big. Guess I'm trying 18mm next. This strap is most definitely not 22mm"
"This watch does many things. All easy to set up after unpacking. But the one thing I bought it for, namely to tell time, requires cumbersome downloading of an app with passwords involved. I would not have minded the download of the app to access all the watch features but it should be easy to tell time right away."
"I‚Äôve only had this watch for about a week and at first, I was highly impress. It comes with a lot of functions, It‚Äôs very cute, the battery last an extremely long time. However, there is absolutely no way to get help. I do remember seeing voice assist on the screen, but I cannot find it again. I‚Äôve read all of the papers that came with it, I‚Äôve pulled it up on, YouTube, and I‚Äôve googled it. No one seems to have any answers on what any of these icons mean. Under the Help section there FAQs and that is it. You cannot ask anything that is not already listed so, I guess I will never get the full function of this watch because I don‚Äôt know how it works. What do you expect for 30 bucks?"
Can't get the oxygen tracking to work otherwise a decent purchase.
"I really thought this was going to be an awesome watch. Definitely not anything that I was expecting! The temperature (weather) is wrong 99.9% of the time it has me in a warmer climate. It says 60s-70s all the time and it 20s-30s where I live. Also it says I sleep 15 hours a day, Im lucky to sleep 6. A alarm keeps going off at 623 everyday.  I have tried changing all this issues but no luck. I thinks I received someone else‚Äôs returned watch. I am so disappointed! I‚Äôm to the point that I will find the box and return it. Don‚Äôt believe the advertisement on this watch it‚Äôs incorrect!"
"I liked the look of the watch and while I could link it with my phone for some things, I couldn‚Äôt get the steps to sync.  Maybe I was mistaken but thought if I walked with the watch and when I got back to my phone those steps would be added to my phone. Then I walked with both phone and watch and the watch was way less than my phone. I only wanted this so I could leave my phone at home while walking. I DID like the look and feel of the watch, just didn‚Äôt do what I thought"
It was very hard to set up
it works and great for the price
"I've had it for about 2 .5 months now and it's been great long battery life, kept track of my heartbeat it doesn't weigh much, it's really easy to use, but the band has latex I figured that out after I had an allergic reaction, I like the color but the quality isnt that good it cracks really easily"
You must download the app called Glory Fit. It won't sync my messages or contacts. It did sync the audio to my phone. When I'm watching something on my phone the sound comes through the watch. I like that it gives me my heart rate. I don't know how accurate the sleep tracking is.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The product page clearly states that it is possible to have multiple alarms in vibrate-only (soundless) mode (""alarms in vibrate mode only: Set Up to 10 Vibration Alarm Clocks. This watch can support up to 10 vibration alarm clocks, which can meet your all kinds of reminder demand without disturbing others"").This is exactly what I need, because my schedule involves getting up at 5 am‚Äîbut I don't want to disturb the sleep of my wife, who gets up later.When I tried to figure out how to set an alarm to be soundless, neither the user's manual, the YouTube ""channel,"" the answer bank at Amazon.com nor any other source or tool I could access offered guidance in this regard.When I emailed ""support"" for US customers, my first emails were ignored. So I emailed support for customers outside the US. I was initially informed that this watch has no speaker, therefore it could not be making any sound. I sent a short video (uploaded here) demonstrating that the watch does indeed make a sound, in addition to vibrating.Finally, support for US customers responded, with the same incorrect understanding of the watch, to which I replied by sending a copy of the video. Finally, ""support"" acknowledged the reality that an alarm produces a sound, as well as vibration‚Äîand, contrary to the product information online, there is no way to turn the sound off.I was told that the company's engineering team has been informed of this issue and urged to wait until a fix has been developed and implemented. As there is really no guarantee as to when‚Äîor indeed whether‚Äîthis will happen, I decided to return the product. If a fix is actually implemented, I may be willing to buy the watch again and give it another try. If it works well, I would update this review.In the meantime, I fault this company (GRV) for several things:1. Inaccurate online product information about a basic/essential function (what could be more basic, beyond simply telling time, than an alarm?).2. A very sketchy, incomplete, product ""manual"" (in name only).3. A YouTube ""channel"" with no information (just a one-minute promo for the product).4. A ""support"" email for US customers that ignores legitimate questions.5. ""Support"" personnel who lack sufficient familiarity with the product to provide helpful support.The irony and pity here is that, with a little additional effort, this could be a very good watch. Maybe some day the company will get its act together by expending that effort. One can only hope so."
I got this for school and when it came i we charged and ready to use it didnt have the right time and I couldn‚Äôt change it i downloaded the app that didnt help and when i need to change it it didn‚Äôt work like bruhLike don‚Äôt buy this idk why people r saying its good and now am in Africa for vacation thinking this is good but its not and now I can‚Äôt return it ugh -Brian‚Äôs  daughter
I need to have a connected to my phone for work and to an app on my phone.And I am constantly having to reconnect it to make it work and it is very Inconvenient When I am at work in this happens
"Obviously, you get what you pay for.  And on rare occasion a little more.  I agree qith others that it has its merits as an entry level time traveling device.The one I received worked well after having to get youtube instructions to load the app.  But sadly after less than a year it just stopped working.  Leaving me trapped here in the Nexus.  No power.  Not even a blip.Its not bad for the cost.  But you may want to purchase the warranty.  For less than $5. Or was it $10?  Whichever.  If yours fails, you can probably just report it and receive another.I didnt purchase the warranty.  But probably would, if I purchased this time traveling device again.  So, off I go to explore this strange new place.  I didnt pack for an extended stay.  Here, in the Nexus.Yet again.  The best laid plans of mice and men, (yawwn)...  you know the rest.That is alll."
This watch works well. The only thing that really bothers me is the part where the magnetic charger attaches. I have a metal allergy and this watch severely irritates my wrist. It got to the point where it takes several month to heal after one wear. I now have a scar on my wrist from the watch
"Nice watch for price. It had all the functions I wanted, but it‚Äôs not accurate for the temperature of the weather. I will be returning!"
"The strap broke within a month. The app is easy to use, and can read quick text and gets calls. For price it is worth the buy. Even tho I've had to buy 3 in 2 years."
I do not like how small the letters are on a text or email. This really needs to be fix!!You should be able to at least zoom in and out!I am hesitant to recommend this product. See pic.One good thing about this watch is the battery life last 4-5 days. Depending on how much it is used.
This watch is definitely not waterproof. Besides that I was really liking it.
"First the good News about this watch which I have had since May 2024 . The watch is easy to read as it has a large face. The watch has a great sedentary reminder, which is helpful. Now for the bad news, the watch does an inaccurate job of tracking steps. I  hike, the steps on the watch, which do not reflect how many miles I have gone per step (as I know how many steps are in a mile). I have got the accurate height on my phone but this is still not keeping an accurate step count. I also have to reboot the watch on my phone app to get the correct weather temper."
For the price I it was a good buy. I will be giving it to my 16 year old grandson.
"The watch is good for the price, pretty easy to set up & use. The band is comfortable & the battery life is awesome. I'm considering returning the watch for 2 reasons: 1 I cannot get my text messages to show on the watch. I've tried all suggestions in the instructions, looked up YouTube videos, reset, etc and still can't get texts to show. Other reason for possibly returning is the distance when walking/running is off. I compare the distance on the watch to my iPhone and its off by a considerable amount. I know nothing is going to be 100% accurate but it is frustrating when the 2 devices, used at the same time, produce varying results. If your looking for an expensive smart watch, this is a good one, just don't have too high expectations."
I see everyone saying that they are able to receive texts and calls but I tried and followed the instructions on the app and I have yet to receive messages that come to my phone to the watch. Otherwise it‚Äôs good for back fitness needs.
I mean it is what it is. It‚Äôs a semi accurate watch that you can wear that doesn‚Äôt give you SMS notifications for some reason.
"It won't upload all of my contacts. And the sound can't be controlled, so it rings extremely loud but you can't turn it down."
I got this watch and like it. My main complaint is you aren't able to change the way the distance is recorded. Its ONLY tracks in kilometers so I have to convert if u want to know mileage.
"Let's start iwth the pros: It's lighweight, has many face features, many functions and is lightweight. I do use a lof tohe funciotn, messages.HR/Stopwatch, music, alarm and I like thime. Here are the Cons:To see the time you must press the side button - This is ridiculous, it's a watch.  The accuracy is not 100%.  I did an 8.25 mile run and it sated I did 6.7 this is off as is the heart rate.  You must charge every other day, which is annoying.  Battery life should be much longer. But it's affordable and does almost everything it says't it does...  just not 100% accurately."
"Truly love this watch - comfortable to wear, easy to set up on the app it has you download (GloryFit), tracks my steps, tracks my sleep, and there's a ton of features - one of my favorites was answering calls and talking directly from my watch. The battery life is great. For my girls that like pink, this watch is it! I give it 5 stars for all of that. BUT this watch does NOT sync with my health apps (I use Samsung health and Google fit). I've had the watch for 2 weeks and unpaired and re-paired, gone thru every single feature and setting on this thing - there's no way to pair it. I bought this watch for the sole purpose of tracking my activity to sync with my health apps. And because it doesn't, I will be returning this.If the syncing part isn't a big thing for you, then I highly recommend this purchase. It's a lot of bang for your buck, and it's a cute watch! Just wear it and go üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"This watch is only okay at best. I think the heart rate and SpO2 measurements are accurate enough, but the sleep tracking is way, way off. Also, the step counting doesn't seem to be close to accurate either.But the biggest frustration comes with the Gloryfit app that this watch (supposedly) uses to store and track your data. For starters, the watch and app do not stay connected. No matter how close together the watch and phone are, they disconnect. They don't reconnect automatically either. It's a long process of Bluetooth on/off and unbinding the watch, etc., which only works sometimes.It refuses to alert me of incoming text messages, and as a huge lover of that feature, that alone would keep me from using this watch and app, even if there weren't other issues. I am not ignorant- I'm aware that tons of apps are Chinese and the translation isn't always great. But this one is so bad that you can't always figure out what it is asking you to do.That brings me to customer service, which may as well be nonexistent. I started my feedback concern with ""I have every permission enabled and have ensured that every setting that needs to be enabled, is."" Yet their only advice was to make sure I enabled permissions. Broken English that did not address any concerns.I gave up, threw the watch in a drawer, and went back to my old one. I'll replace it with an updated version that uses the app I've always had.All in all, no, I do not recommend this watch."
Watch was working great. I am no longer able to go to the internal fitness choices. Tried to reset it but to no avail. I still keeps time but no other features work. Any ideas?
"I originally was very impressed with this smart watch but after failing to adjust clock on Daylight Saving Time and otherwise adjust time settings I have found several more annoying things that developed. I sleep with the watch on as the sleep monitoring feature is important to me. Unfortunately sometimes the ""dial"" function will turn on if I move my hand or arm. However one major problem hjas developed - I can no longer link to my smart phone, given that there is no tech support that I have found I am very disappointed in this unit."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Monitors heavy rate and oxygen level. MUSIC App.  Also step counter. No camera or video, no Facebook or messenger.This was my first smart watch..I hot it to make calls. It does Tha but this is a very basic watch."
"I was super excited to have a smart watch. However, when messages come in, text is very small and emojis don‚Äôt show. It doesn‚Äôt seem like it stays connected very well. If I want to know my sleep patterns, I have to make sure I freshly connect my watch to the app. This makes me feel like I don‚Äôt get an accurate sleep reading. Battery life seems to be pretty excellent and I like that I can personalize the face with a photo. So in conclusion. I don‚Äôt hate the watch but, I don‚Äôt love it either. üòû"
The clasp that holds the watch on broke after a few months. Until then it seemed like a nice watch.
"Pro: I loved the brightness and clarity on the screen.  Long charge life  Custom background (pictures on watch face)  The price (great value for the price)  Syncs quickly to the app.Con: I got a rash, and a strange smell developed on my wrist on that spot after the first several days of wearing.  However this has improved after wiping the watch down with rubbing alcohol on a cloth and deep cleaning of my wrist )  Timer setting: When the timer is running to screen stays on (uses up the battery). Also the auto set times are not as helpful for me.  My main use of the timer is when my son needs to be placed in time out (he is 4 and setting it to 4min is not as easy as my previous off brand smart watch).Step counter: not so accurate (less accurate than my previous smart watch)Heart rate (HR)  not as accurate especially when exercising.  It has been off by upto 20 beats per min from my manual HR measurements."
I had this watch for almost 2 months to the day and it just stopped working. Won‚Äôt charge or turn on. However‚ÄîI loved it while it did work! I loved the step counter and the changeable watch faces. I just wish I would‚Äôve got more than 60 days out of it.Update: Seller reached out and offered a refund. I accepted and ordered another watch right away. So far so good! Excellent seller!
"Just received watch. Can't say much about functions because I haven't used it much but so far its lightweight and not bulky on hand, the set up was easy.The screen isn't very sensitive to touch.The band has a smell and will need to be cleaned before use."
"I have tried everything.  Tight band.  The whole it will give 3,000 steps if that and I do so much more.  Looks nice and I can set up easy things.  It is confusing to move around and find what you want.  I‚Äôm constantly swiping. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"It's pretty much like an apple watch but it won't let me respond to messages or call people. I can see text messages pop up and everything but there's no button to respond which is the only downside. The battery life is amazing, I charge it once a week (I wear it everyday too) and it charges pretty fast, maybe 30 minutes. It's water proof so it hasn't gotten any damage from washing dishes with it or being outside in the rain, I have not showered with it because I have trust issues but that's up to you. It also tells you how many hours of sleep you got at night, your heart rate (which I'm not sure if correct) I did notice the step counting is false, it adds steps whenever you move your arm so.. if your main focus is tracking steps, I would not recommend."
Had it a weekHad to charge 2x already and only wore it an hour per dayMay return
Love this watch but misplaced it within a week darn it!
"Poor Customer Sevice. Used product for several months and then had issues with it, and Customer Service did  not respond to several messages I sent in a timely matter. Use caution when ordering this product"
Nice watch. Accurate. Easy to use. But the band is terrible.  The band easily slips out of the device meant to hold it in place. Sending it back.
My wife loves the way the watch looks and feels but it's strange because she only receives random text. Only text from certain people will come through on the watch and what does come through is really small font almost like a typewriter style font not very readable. We know someone with the exact same watch paired with an iPhone and the text looks so much better and they have not had any issues. I would have sent it back but the wife had already threw away the package. For the price it's not bad for just a watch to tell time with and it looks nice also but as far as communicating it's not working out very well.
"My Fitbit finally broke, so I bought one that was way cheaper than what I wanted. Here are the takeaways:1. Looks really nice and the clock faces are free.2. The dim setting is still hella bright.3. The Bluetooth disconnects every other day.4. The battery lasts for.ever.5. I started to notice that the sleep recording is off. That may become an issue.6. The steps are inaccurate.If you want a watch to tell time, change the look of the clock face, record health data that may or may not be accurate for a decent price, this is the watch. But it will probably become annoying sooner than later."
"Can't set the time,even with the app"
"Poor design. There is no where to change from 24hr mode, it connects to the Bluetooth on my phone, but it will not recognize the phone as being attached. So I can't set date and time.However, the company was quick to reply and my sister was able to pair it with her iPhone."
Display stopped working after 5 months. App was not working previous to display disfunction.Edited to add: the company contacted me and made it right!
"Got this watch, says it has basic waterproof features. What a joke. Got splashed by my niece when she was in the pool. I was sitting away from the pool. Water landed on the watch, it started vibrating and the screen started flashing on and off. Took it off, dried it off, gave it time to fully dry out. Stopped working. Tried to charge it, screen won't turn on. Of course this happened just after the return window closed so now I'm stuck with a broken watch that won't turn on.Don't waste your money."
"It‚Äôs okay. Nothing special. You get what you pay for. It doesn‚Äôt have many features, and I‚Äôve tried everything to get it to show my notifications and it doesn‚Äôt work. You have to push the button on the side for it to light up, which is annoying. It would be better if it just lit up when you turned it towards you. You get what you pay for, I wanted a simple watch to track steps and exercise but it doesn‚Äôt do too much more than that. I‚Äôll keep messing with it, but you get what you pay for. Would‚Äôve rather ordered a name brand Fitbit or something that I know would work well. I also ordered purple and it‚Äôs not purple, it‚Äôs a reddish wine color, which is annoying. I wanted the purple. I‚Äôll keep it for the sake of needing it just for basic things, steps/exercise/heart rate, and for telling the date and time, but other than that my recommendation is just buy a better, higher quality watch that‚Äôs a bit more expensive if you‚Äôre looking for something to do more."
It doesn‚Äôt show the level of Battery and the Instagram notification it‚Äôs very poor . It doesn‚Äôt show the Instagram‚Äôs name profile .I‚Äôm a swimmer and it also doesn‚Äôt allow you to track the swimming track
"This is a basic watch that has some flaws.Pros:> Easy to read large numbers for the time> Simple to swipe between screens to access information> excellent battery life> heart rate monitor appears accurate> can notify you of incoming texts when linked to your phone (if you have a device that is supported)Cons:> Loses 2-3 minutes a week if not synced regularly with the app.  It‚Äôs very annoying when the watch says it‚Äôs 9:57am when it is really 10:00am.  It‚Äôs made me late to work a few times!> Sometimes records sitting in a moving vehicle, especially in slow moving traffic, as exercise.Summary:If you want accuracy, this is probably not the watch for you.  If you need a basic idea of how much you‚Äôre moving, don‚Äôt spend time in slow traffic, and can remember to sync it regularly to the app to keep the time accurate, then it‚Äôs an affordable alternative to name brand fitness watches."
"I was going to return this watch, the GRV because of failure to sync/pair with my Android Samsung phone. The app via the QR code that the watch points to requires a credit card to activate. Not me. I finally stumbled on the proper app to use by going to GooglePlay on my phone then searching through 9 different apps to find the Glory Fit app by ""Smart Wear"". I then was able to install, give permissions, and pair with the GRV watch.Up Date: 2024 - Just installed the app to another Android phone. I down loaded the app from Google Play Glory Fit. I then independently from the app activated my blue tooth to find the watch FC1. I then went to the Glory Fit app to search for the watch and it found it."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this in mid August. I like waiting a couple months before I leave reviews because of proper usage. The battery life for this watch is excellent! I love that it has 3 different face features to view on your watch. However, there's some features that have been inconsistent since I bought the watch. Bluetooth for example, it would disconnect from my phone randomly, solution was to refresh the device on the app. This worked for a couple months. By late November it stopped working completely, it's connected to the app and it logs my steps, sometimes my heart rate but no longer notifies me of incoming calls and texts which was the sole purpose of it for me. App says it's active and notifications are turned on, but I don't get any. So that's my beef. Also the band has lost its color over the months too, that doesn't bother me but I know it can for others."
Very glitchy and cheaply made. Returning it asap.
This was an aggrevating watch to set up and I never got it going. I even had problems trying to return it. It looks nice but didn't work for me
No customer service for weather location.  Steps not accurate- get 3 times more at mid day.
I liked it fine the first week. Recently on my outdoor walks the screen keeps switching to the music screen or only half of my walk is showing up. I also take issues with it pausing my walk and does not notify me . Half my walk is missing or more and then it picks up once I hit play again. It's very frustrating. I could be bumping the button with my wrist but it shouldn't be so sensitive.  Not very impressed!
I can't get my email can't get calls in my call log won't show up My text messages don't show up and I have a Samsung S9 Plus it is not working so far
"Easy Setup, love appearance/style, seems pretty accurate. Can not wear 24 hrs because contacts on back of watch bruised my skin. Would have given 5 stars if skin wasn't bruised."
"I liked the watch, however, it would not recharge after three months."
"I really liked this watch, but I guess I got what I paid for. Stopped working after 3 months ...*** update, they sent me a refund for the inconvenience"
Have to be on Bluetooth then I lose volume on my other apps. Have to keep going back and downloading things to get all the pieces to work.
"It looks nice and does a good job with messages and calls. It does not import contacts, it said I only have 45 phone numbers to import.The glory fit app is ok. It was tough to figure out how to change things off km and kg, it should just be a quick setting change but you have to go into several different areas to get them all changed.It also doesn't track steps accurately at all. I will literally count myself walking 30 steps and the number on the watch will not change. So if tracking steps accurately is important to you, this isn't the watch you want.Overall it's fine but you are definitely getting what you paid for."
One of the watch bane straps came off and I couldn't get it back on.
"I've had this product for less than 9 months, and all of a sudden it won't hold a charge longer than 50 hours or so.The sleep recording feature was always not correct, and when I would walk pushing a stroller or shopping cart it wouldn't count my steps. The little piece that holds the band down breaks easily, I've had to replace that.All in all I mainly used this to count steps and I liked I could change the watch face using personal pictures, but the battery isn't keeping charge.I charged it fully, after 12 HOURS it was already at 45%and ticking down.Currently looking for a different watch to replace this one with."
"This watch looked great and worked great. It seemed to do all the things I needed it to do and was simple but effective. Unfortunately, the side button of the watch to turn the home screen on broke within the first three months of use. I was able to turn the other activation method ( where you hold the watch still for a few seconds to light up the screen) on through the app, but I liked to be able to have that setting off and just hit the button when I wanted to see the time. Otherwise the watch light up while you move around in your sleep. I have cleaned and confirmed there is nothing preventing the button from going in. It just seems like a component on the inside did not hold up."
"Don‚Äôt buy it unless you only want to know what time it is.  Much of the time, the call/text alert doesn‚Äôt work so I have to keep my phone close. Glad I didn‚Äôt pay much."
"UPDATE: this sellar is legit!! They messaged me to make this right and replace the watch, the replacement was shipped and delivered appropriately (legit driver that actually delivered professionally and approoriately-amazob logistics have been a nightmare of theft, ',lost in transit's 'delayed', stolen and false delivery ...lately their delivery is hit or miss-a different but related issue...BUT Highly recommend this sellar for customer service!! (for context,  I am a service and quality fiend, but I rarely leave reviews, and considered the dead watch a loss after it died outside of the return window....was not expecting any recourse and surprised that GRV contacted me to try to make this right. Customer service surprise and they really followed up. Certainly was not expecting Cust service from a review. Longer story shorter: have yet to see if the replacement works and will last, BUT this sellar is legit and looking forward to trying the replacement device and hope it works and LASTS ( it IS a great looking device and when it was working, the first one, battery lasted super long, charging (magnetic USB) was efficient and fast. Overall Customer service: 10 stars, product replacement: yet to be determined. but they seem like they stand by their product....will update after use of replacement. Highly recommend this sellar!! UPDATE end#### Really disappointed. This watch looks great and was working, stopped completely after app update. Won't turn on, won't charge (magnetic charger was initially efficient, worked correct, watch held charge super long!!) Now, completely DEAD. Greatly disappointed, out of return/exchange/replacement window. Cannot recommend sadly and would not but again."
"Update number 2. The watch works ok still but the bad failed after 8 months.UPDATE - after this review was published, the company contacted me and offered a refund or a replacement.  Once they made contact they were very responsive and helpful.  I chose the refund because I had already replaced the watch.This watch is just 10 months old and now it will not charge.  It held a charge well and was a good odometer but now it will not charge so it is worthless.  Finally, I found the company website and learned that the warranty was only 90 days!"
"I have used this watch for 5 months daily and haven‚Äôt had issues until now. The watch itself seems to work okay for the price, but for some reason it will no longer connect to the app to upload my data. The app then logged me out and no longer works. And there is no way to reset my password, even though I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm using the correct one and it still tells me I‚Äôm not. There isn‚Äôt a way I can find to report the app."
It's okay for the price. Not the greatest. It disconnects a lot and my messages never show up.
"I have to recharge it every two days compared to others, I guess it came with something by default, eventually stopped working. Lasted around a year."
"This watch was not described accurately. The watch was bulky and the band was neoprene, and the smell of the band was like the smell of a new tire. I don't know if the watch actually worked as described, because the look itself was a turn off. I rated it a 3 because it just didn't appear as described."
"When I received the watch, I put it on, but the biometric features of the watch would not work unless I strapped the watch in very snuggly.  After about two weeks, I started feeling a little sore under the watch, so I took it off and noticed this rash on my wrist.  Has this happened to anyone else?  On the Facebook page, it seems there are a lot of cloth wristbands being sold, or available for sale, so it seems like it may be an issue!!"
"It is fine as a watch but, the step counter is WAY off and the app is not user friendly. I have had this for about a month and the outdoor walking activity in the app stops halfway through my walk and I can't figure out how to view previous activity. It seems good as a watch though and has enough faces to suit but, any of the smart features kinda sucks. My previous watch, that was even cheaper than this one was more accurate, easier to navigate but, it keeps time."
"I walk between mile markers, so I know how far I'm walking, but this watch always shows that I'm walking farther. I set my height on the app, but it constantly changes. The sleep app doesn't keep very good track either. The only thing that I like about this watch is that it's very easy to charge."
The charger did not come with the package so unsatisfied.
If you can set this up your an instine
"This smart watch is okay for the price. My biggest disappointment is that it does not give live heat rate on the main face. I have to move tiles got get to the heart rate and then it will take a few seconds to calculate my average heart rate. Took me a while of using the app to be able to edit the tiles but there are limited tiles you can select from. I wouldn't mind the breath and calculator being on the tiles. Wish when you go into the menu you could remove some of the things that I'm not going to use like music or AI voice or Alexa. I also would like to be able to delete the exercises I would not use. I do like that you can have a main face with active step and distance. I can switch to 24 hr clock. I do not like the band The band is a cheap feeling silicone and the watch clasp is plastic. These is a calories consumption feature on the app not the phone. That would be nice to view on the phone. Also adding water drank on the phone as well would be a nice feature. I would like water to be in oz as well, It is in mLs and I cannot figure out how to change it. Who measures their water intake with mls. The exercise tracking of this watch and app overall seem well done.Here is my Pro/Con list...ProsExercise tracking done wellFun features like calorie consumption, Breath meditation, cycle tracking for womenBudget friendlyNeutralWould like to be able to delete things I wont use off the watchWater measurement in mls and cannot change to ozConsCan not take live heart rate from main screen on watchPlastic and cheap silicone on the band"
"This watch is huge!!! The face of it covered my entire wrist from top to bottom and it is very uncomfortable. The apps they claim it has and things it does aren't very exciting either. I couldn't get the Alexa app to work, not sure what I would ask it if I could.It's very annoying too if you don't go into the app and turn off the ""drink water"" buzzer, and the ""get up and walk"" buzzer. And the time to go to bed, time to exercise, you didn't enter your weight buzzers. I wanted to throw it against the wall at one point.It claims to know when you are sleeping, when you are in a deep sleep and when you are in REM sleep. Well, I was watching tv and I checked out my sleep and it said I was sleeping during that time. Pretty sure I wasn't, I just wasn't moving around.My son thinks it's cool, he never had a smart watch. Me...I never had a watch so stupid.Sorry!!!"
"I have never had a smart watch and I have never wanted one. But since I was getting it through Vine, I decided that maybe I would give one a try at least to test. I'm pretty impressed so far, but as a person who doesn't use social media at all, I feel like the functionality of this watch is a little bit limited. From everything I read I'm assuming I can get text or gmail messages on this watch, but I can't see how you get to them. I can't access the list of them, like you can in your phone, but texts show very briefly as a notification. The long list of apps and features doesn't show Messages or Mail - at least on my watch.In any case, the health tracking features are pretty interesting. Like so many devices, it wants to track everything and it wants to send everything to other places. I'm a little skeptical of that for the most part, so I've heavily limited what it's allowed to share, send, and exchange. Nevertheless the few features that I'm using - like heart rate, Sp02, steps, etc. - seem very accurate and are quick to update. The display on the watch is crisp and clear, and it's super cool that it's waterproof.The charging interface is easy to use and discreet, although it is increasingly hesitant to connect and requires a lot of finagling to get securely seated. If it does not, it continuously tries to connect, buzzing and buzzing every couple seconds for hours on end.Originally, the battery life was pretty impressive. Today, after I‚Äôve worn this perhaps a week, I had the following experience: last night, the watch was at 80%. I attempted to charge it overnight, but it wouldn‚Äôt connect, making noise all night. I thought it was something else making the noise that I couldn‚Äôt control, so I let it do that all night, and stayed awake in the process. This morning at 8:30, the watch was at 78%. By 9:00, it was down to 71%. Now, at 10:30, it‚Äôs at 28%.So, who knows. I was initially impressed, but it appears this watch may end up in the landfill before too long."
I don't know what I was expecting it this seems like it's pretty light weight and it requires you to download the app before it will even give you access to the watches options and features.The charger is only capable of attaching in one direction due to the magnets but they hold strong enough to do the job.It seems pretty basic as for its features but it's nice looking and does offer the features it claims to. I intend this for my oldest daughter and it should do everything she will need it for but time will tell how well it will hold up to actually being worn and used.
It's good but had a hard time setting it up. Plenty of better ones on the market.
"This is a very limited smart watch, I do like that you have the option to attach it to Alexa features but it is lacking on other features and areas. The touch reactivity is questionable and hard to navigate- sometimes the screen will not respond at all.It does include your basic features- step count, health activity tracking and sleep tracking, time, date, etc.Limited display customization unless you want to pay money for more display options.It also offers a find your phone feature and notification ""peek"" as well as call feature.The app has been updated to be a little easier to use over the last few months (I had this app downloaded previously) but it is still lacking in some areas and even in the language used when in English.Overall my thought is this would be good for a cheap entry level smartwatch either for a teen or adult I guess but not really up to par with the high end stuff available."
Works great. Long lasting battery. Works as well as named brand
This is a nice cheap option to a fitbit if that's what you're looking for.  I knocked a few stars off because it doesn't track steps quite as good as a fitbit (i was comparing them) and it doesn't have a timer.  That drives me nuts as I use a timer daily.  It does count steps though and the app is pretty decent. It takes calls and messages and tracks multiple stats.  A decent buy.
Unless you are very computer or watch savy this is not the one to buy.  I got this and tried to set up and pulled in two more savy people than me and still not able to use.
"When I placed my order this item was priced at $39.99.  At the time of this review this item is CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE.The package include a smart watch, charging cable and instruction manual.The watch arrived fully charged (100%).It took 5 minutes to download the app and bind the watch.This ""SMARTWATCH"" have the basic features: answer/make call, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker.The watch face can be customized with over 40 faces or stored photos.However, I WOULD NOT classify it as a ""FITNESS WATCH"", because it doesn't monitor your blood pressure and oxygen level.I need to monitor my blood pressure and oxygen level daily.  There are several smart watches in the same price point with these features.Remove 2 stars."
"This watch would be really great. It keeps connecting and disconnecting to the Bluetooth so it will make my phone change from phone to watch in the middle of calls. Super frustrating. The band and the size are great, set up was really easy. Just annoying that there is no setting to keep it from stealing the calls from the phone in the middle of the call, or to stay connected by Bluetooth."
"Update: my replacement arrived and I‚Äôm not going to update any stars. I really hoped to be able to accurately track my workouts, but the heart rate monitor seems to not work once I start sweating. Again, it was grossly miscalculating my heart rate. At the end of my workout, it measured my heart rate at the sleeping rate, despite my physical bodily response indicating that it was much higher. So it‚Äôs not helpful at all in tracking my largest calorie burning activity. **** I was really enjoying this product, all the features, and the insights in the app. However, I wanted to wait at least two weeks to see how long it lasted. I‚Äôm glad I did. Yesterday, right at the 2 week mark, it started malfunctioning. The heart rate monitor went out first because it wasn‚Äôt properly tracking my workout. It said my heart was at rest - in the middle of cardio, when I had sweat pouring off my body and was gasping for air. Then, it rapidly declined from there and today it is barely functional. This decline occurred at the 2 week mark. I ordered a replacement and will update after wearing that one for a while, but here‚Äôs how it performed when it workedPros:- offers all the features of other brands, without a subscription- many options to customize- when it works, it performs wellCons:- terrible battery (it will NOT last 5-7 days)- touch screen is very sensitive. For people who prefer to have the watch face on their wrist, please opt out of it for this watch or you will be randomly calling people all day from the watch simply brushing against your clothing.- touch screen works with ANY material. If I accidentally brush against my plants on the plant stand, the watch starts calling people."
"I've never had a smartwatch before, and I decided to give this one a shot since it's pretty cheap. Most of what I wanted out of this was access to Alexa by voice, and a way to locate my phone because I am constantly setting it down places and losing it. It can't actually do either of those things most of the time because it is constantly losing its connection to my phone. Even when my phone claims that it is connected. The watch will say that it is not. As far as I can tell, the only time the watch functions as I would like it to is when I have the very fit app open on my phone screen. Which kind of defeats the purpose of having a smartwatch, doesn't it? The screen itself is attractive. It's clear and the display is very readable. It does seem to be able to read my steps and heart rate. It will take phone calls, but I almost don't love the all phone calls default to the watch instead of to my actual phone. It means that if I'm actually holding my phone and get a call, it will go to the watch and I have to change it. Turns out, I might just not be a smartphone person. But I also think that this smartphone has a glaring flaw in that it doesn't seem to want to stay connected. And I will note that I have a Google pixel 8A, so it's not like I have an ancient phone or anything. I will probably end up using this only when I am out exercising."
"This smartwatch has many test functions, and the functions I care about most are finding the phone, sleep test, call reminder, (when the phone is not around) exercise record, etc. But I tested my sleep status for a few nights, and it was not accurate at all. I was clearly awake, but it recorded my deep sleep. It is unknown whether the other records are accurate."
"How I despise items that you need to scan a QR code to activate. This is no exception. QR would not scan. Big and bulky on my wrist. I cannot provide a.complete review because I cannot activate it. If youcan, it might be worth it."
"I wanted to love this watch.  The setup was promising.  It came with the band already installed.  I was so relieved as many watches don't and you have to manually attach by movings pins that my clumbsy hands can't manage.  Setup was okay.  It used the VeryFit app I already had on my phone from a different watch, so there were no issues with pairing.I got my notifications on the watch, and it seemed to track my sleep accurately, which is a rarity for a smartwatch.  Then I tried to make a call on my phone, but the audio came out of the watch.  Okay, I'll turn that feature off.  No big deal.  Except I was unable to figure out a way to do this.  I went into the VeryFit settings.  I checked the settings on the watch itself.  The only way I could finally get my phone audio back was to turn off Bluetooth on my phone.  Which kills most of the functionality of the watch."
I am having a horrible time getting this to connect.  The instructions are minimal and does not go through functions.  The watch itself is nice and comfortable.
"Setting it up and downloading the app was easy, but the app would not stay connected to the smartwatch and kept prompting you to blind it multiple times. The touch screen is terrible on this device as well. I could not even try it out because it would not say connected to my iPhone. Build quality is pretty much what you expect from a cheap generic smartwatch."
It's essentially a paperweight. It won't connect and simply doesn't work. It looks nice but is useless.
This watch must be connected through an app on a cell phone and an account has to be created on the app's Internet server before anything can be done. The watch cannot even show the time without that app.The watch is worthless without the app.
I charged it for a whole day and it wouldn‚Äôt come on
"So I've had this watch for awhile because I wanted the opportunity to see the pros/cons.  I needed this since I ""fried"" my last fitness watch in water (different well-known brand that stated waterproof- did not include salt water!)  So this one also connects to my phone and a fitness app.  The first pro I like was the simple styling, easy fit & I liked being able to change the variety of watch ""faces"" on the screen for FREE.  It holds a pretty good charge for several days and even goes into an auto feature of using less battery when it's down to 5%.  The App is ok, has several options for workouts and tracking calories,  steps, etc.  However I don't feel it was accurate,  especially for measuring distance and steps (again comparing to previous different model watch )  So now the cons...I receive messages intermittently from my phone and only when App is active and in the background on my phone. I have found that I've needed to turn off/on Bluetooth several times to get watch to communicate. At one time I was getting messages in triplicate but remedied that by restarting watch, glitchy I guess.  The one drawback I noticed immediately was that I was unable to have voice response to texts like my last watch. But for some users, that may not be an important feature.  So overall, it's an ok watch, but potential buyers should just research which features they need, and which ones are just extras.  Decent price for what you receive. Oh, and I like the flashlight option, very handy!"
"I really liked this watch when I first got it. While it didn't work great on my right arm (I'm lefthanded). I noticed that when I switched it over to the left it started tracking my sleep patterns, heart rate, etc. where it only really tracked my steps and got phone notifications on the right. So, a lot of the issues I thought I had with it were gone when I put it on the left. Not really a fan of that since I usually wear a watch on the right but at least it made it work properly (I've actually ran into this with every fitness watch I've owned..I don't get it but wish someone would fix this!!). I would like to say all of the things I liked about it but it's a moot point because I went swimming with it one time and the display faded to half the brightness and a couple days later stopped working altogether. It says it's waterproof and I always took it off and charged it while showering so I had never really put it to the test. Swimming is my main form of cardio so the waterproof part was what I wanted. I didn't dive under or even keep it submerged for a long period of time so I'm completely disappointed. That being said, it's not an expensive watch so if you aren't looking for something that can go in the water, I think it's great but if you're like me and want to be able to track your swimming then I'd keep looking."
"This is my second ""fitness"" watch. The problem I have with these fitness monitors is that I question their accuracy. From the 'step counters' to the 'sleep monitors', I have little faith in the underlying technology.My experience with the 'sleep monitoring' is that it is wholly incorrect. The watch doesn't know when I am fully awake, but still in bed... perhaps reading on a tablet. My observation is that it considers this as part of my sleep cycle.The step counter is overstated. I appears to give me steps whist I am working at my desk. This puts the calorie counter in question, as it regularly exceeds 2700 calories burned in a day, when I've been completely inactive. If that were the case, I'd be at a 700 calorie deficit every day and would be losing a pound a week. That is most definitely not the case.Also, according to this watch, I am going back and forth between 70 to 108 beats per minute. Just sitting there. I measured my heart rate manually,, and also with a blood pressure monitor, and I am sure I am not spiking that way.The battery life is reasonable, and the watch face selection is pretty good. However, the whole point of these things is to give you feedback to help manage your fitness. This watch is simply NOT accurate, and is so inaccurate as to be useless."
The band on this one is far too large for an average female wrist.  Useless.
"One thing I noticed about this watch is that the step counter did not match the app I was using to count my steps. My phone is on me all day at work and the watch had one number and my phone had a different number, off by over 2000. Thats a HUGE  difference. This makes me wonder if the other monitors are accurate.The watch itself is fine. It has all the features you'd expect to find."
"*For Entertainment Purposes Only* (Please Read On)Okay, so first the good news; they tell the time :)So I was asked to join Amazon Vine, an Amazon program where you get to look through a catalogue of items, which you can then order to review. And at the time, all that I could find of ANY interest to me, was Charging cables and Smart Watches (as everything else seemed to be either Glittery Cake Toppers or Nipple Cream‚Ä¶, and I KID you not :)So, I ordered one Smart Watch, than another, than another, until I had amassed quite a few (hoping that the next one I ordered, would be BETTER than the last, and secretly waiting for the people at Vine to cut me off from ordering so meany Smart Watches, which they, as of yet, have not, although we‚Äôll see, after this review is submitted, that is :)So here‚Äôs the thing, these Smart Watches are, BASICALLY, the same, with the only real distinguishing feature being, which Fitness App, they were made to run on.Now the majority of these run on either the VeryFit or FitCloudPro app (with a couple of them running on the GloryFit and Co Fit app, and the 2 kid Smart Watches running on, watered down variants of the 4). And the ONLY real difference between the first two being, that the FitCloudPro includes the ability to check your, *Blood Pressure (*more on that, in a moment). Other than that, the main 2 Fitness apps are virtually the same, giving you the ability to track your steps, heart rate, stress level, blood oxygen level (?!?) and sleep patterns. There‚Äôs also an assortment of watch faces that can be downloaded (MOST for free, some at a smallish fee, more on that later as well) plus these watches come with other tools, such as the ability to answer calls and talk, right from the watch (with varying degrees of sound quality) receive and view messages (but not send them) alarm settings, stopwatch, and countdown timer.Also, for some INCONCEIVABLE reason, NONE of the watch faces available to download, or that come preinstalled (other than from the VeryFit app, and even then you have to do a bit of digging) either don‚Äôt have a battery level indicator, and if they do, there‚Äôs no percentage shown (only some form of incremental line or battery bar) and the ones that show a percentage, do so in 10% increments (i.e. 100%, 90%, 80%, etc.) which, to me, and in this day and age, is ANNOYINGLY ANNOYING, as I don‚Äôt want to have to try and decode, how much life my Smart watch has left, by some arbitrary incremental lines, battery symbols or wonky percentage points, I want, at the VERY least, to look at the watch and see, the exact percentage of battery level available at the moment (i.e. 97%, 85%, etc., then it can drop from 43% to zero, suddenly, on it‚Äôs own..., JUST KIDDING, but, that said, and since we‚Äôre only given a month in which to test and evaluate each Vine item, before a review is expected, I honestly haven‚Äôt had any of these long enough to see what kind of quirks might pop up, after months of vigorous usage, that is :)*My PERFECT watch face would consist of, the TIME (in BIG, easy to read numbers, as you‚Äôd be amazed at how meany of these watch faces seem to add the time as an afterthought, either with a smallish font, or with in a colour that‚Äôs so dark (and also smallish) that you sometimes barely have enough time to discern it before the display times out), the BATTERY PERCENTAGE in 1% increments (NOT 10% ones or increment lines of some such), the DATE (also usually seeming to be an afterthought on 90% of these watch faces) and THEN the fitness stats (not ONLY the fitness stats, as most of these watches seem to have, I mean, I know these are supposed to be FITNESS orientated, but they are ALSO supposed to be, SMART WATCHES).So now, let‚Äôs get to the (supposed), ‚ÄúAnalytics‚Äù of these watches; so here‚Äôs the thing, I was recently at my doctor‚Äôs for my 6-month check up (having type 2 diabetes, I get blood work done every 6 months, to check my average blood sugar levels for that time period) and decided to check the watch against actual medical procedural. So I checked my blood pressure and heart rate, and found that BOTH were off, as my heart rate was 83 bpm, and my blood pressure was 126/76, but according to my watch, my heart rate was 80 bpm, and my blood pressure was 108/69 (OH, and don‚Äôt get me started on the one watch, that claimed to have the ability to give you your blood glucose level, as 7 is the highest it should be, which is what I‚Äôm usually at, but, if I‚Äôve eaten something with sugar, it‚Äôs been known to spike to 11 for a bit, and it was at these spike periods that I tested my glucose levels with this watch, and got back 4.7 (?!?) which could be potentially DANGEROUS, to a diabetic, thinking that they could now go and eat a whole cake, since their sugar levels were SO low :(Hence, the reason the title of this review is, *For Entertainment Purposes Only*, as I believe that, somewhere in these Smart Watch companies documentation, is that clause, just on the off chance that someone is injured due to any bad info that they got from these watches.And another sucky thing, is that you only have the ability to store up to 10 contact numbers, on these watches (and the one, and ONLY watch, that let you store 100, gave me a contacts list that I‚Äôd NEVER seen before, I mean yes, they were my contacts, but the numbers were, for the most part, older ones that weren‚Äôt active anymore).Also, I was actually SURPRISED at the lack of any type of GAMES on these watches (except for the 2 kids watches I received, but, well, those games left something to be desired, but at the very least, they did try).Another thing to keep in mind is the (potential) power drain that having these watches synced to your phone, as my phone, by the end of the day, has usually around 63% of its battery left, which usually gives me about 2 days before I have to charge it. But with it synced to a Smart Watch (didn‚Äôt seem to matter which Smart Watch or which Fitness app was running) and even with all the analytics turned off, by day's end, my battery was showing 23%.So, these are the things to keep in mind when considering purchasing one of these Smart Watches:  a) the potential power drain on your phone (even when all the fitness tracking stuff was turned off, I still had my phone, in one day of average usage, go from around 60% left at days end, to 23%)  b) the questionable (and not very scientific) analytics  c) and the price point (as the $99 dollar ones, seem to be no better then the $29 ones)"
"I really like the steps tracker, heart monitor features, and sleep tracking.  I think these features are better than the Fitbit products I've owned in the past.  The battery life is absolutely lacking, and I have the bigger version of this watch!  Another detractor is the mapping capabilities.  You'd think with as much power as this watch sucks down on a minute by minute basis, the location services would be able to track your movements down to the inch...nope.  I routinely walk at the park across the street from my house - it's a 1/4 ""track"" around the periphery of the park.  I put the ""walking"" routine on when I head over there and turn it off when I get home.  It tracks my steps VERY accurately, but when I look at my route, it's totally wrong.This product should work better for what it costs, in my opinion."
"This watch is very disappointing in almost every way, compared to my watch 6 classic.  The watch is not accurate for tracking sleep is erractic when counting steps, but compares well to medical grade devices at least for heart rate..  The Galaxy Watch Classic does a great job on everything and is consist across everything I measure.  So in conclusion, I am more than a little disappointed.  one other issue I hate the band, so getting a good band may come at a extra cost to those that feel the same way.  The best part of the watch is watch face customizing.  Anyway, overall my personal opinion is ONE UI 6 and the newer wear OS, was not ready for prime time.  Just my personal opinion based on my own testing with the watch I received.  Maybe I got a bad one, but really feel it is more the watch needs a update."
"I like the sensor suite that this watch has. Its able to accurately track many different activities and health related metrics. The battery life is impressive considering what it can do and the size of the display. The big negative of this watch is the fact that there is hardly any faces to choose from compared to previous smartwatches! You CANNOT use watch face apps like Facer or Watchmaker. If you've purchased watch faces that worked on OneUI 5.0, some or even most will not work on this watch!! I still enjoy the watch and I don't really have buyer's remorse, but I'm definitely disappointed going from a selection of faces that numbered in the hundreds of thousands to now just the hundreds."
Functionality of the watch was nice. The only issue was that it was a gift and it had a blemish/gouge on the bezel.
"Literally, that only thing that makes this watch stand out is the availability of ECG. Paid all the good money, waited for the package, installed the apps, registered, logged in, set of a face watch, went through all the sensors, only to find out that the ECG will only work with Samsung made Android phones. IT WILL NOT WORK WITH ANY ANDROID OR APPLE PHONE. It's useless. The same design, look, feel, layout, capabilities, hardware is available with most other watches on the market today - for half that price. Compare sode by side you'll see that the ECG is the sole reason for the agregeous price. If you don't have a Samsung phone, don't buy this watch. It's useless."
Don't buy this watch if your primary objective is to track how much sleep you get. I lie in bed for hours trying to sleep and it records those hours as sleep. It is possible it will work better for you.
Like everything I can do with the watch! The battery charge is a real problem on the 40mm one. I need to charge it twice a day so that I can use it overnight (I use it as my alarm so I don't wake my spouse up). A watch that can't last 22 hours is really subpar. Wish I had known before purchasing.
"A lot of positive reviews seem to be from people who have never owned a smartwatch before. This is my third Galaxy Watch so I'm comparing the 7 to my previous experiences (most recently I had a 4 Classic).Pros:- The 7 (44mm) features a bigger screen and overall larger form factor comparable in size to the 4 Classic, though without the beveled steel ring (which I prefer - the 4's bevel looked nice but was too clunky). It's nice to have a larger screen.- The internal hardware is noticably improved. The user experience is much smoother as a result.- Not a huge deal since you can always buy your own, but I like the stock wristband a lot more.Cons:- Unfortunately, this device has a host of problems that make it inferior to previous models, including:- Unable to disable green sensor light. Unlike in the past, disabling settings like heart rate tracking or wrist detection do not disable the green light that flashes against your wrist. If you enjoy a slightly relaxed fit on the watch band, prepare to be blinded periodically every night while trying to sleep. I'm not kidding, the light cannot be disabled under any circumstances.- The New gesture features (pinch, twist, shake) are a nice idea but unfortunately result in way too many false positives to be usable. E.g. I use a lot of watch timers when cooking, and I kept wondering why my timer would be paused without my action. Well it was the new gesture features reading false positives from my normal hand motions. So these are useless.- There's a (seeming) bug in which the daily health reminders pop up even if notifications are disabled.- No more wireless charging from Samsung phones. The new watch sensor is designed in a different way that cannot charge via Wireless Power Share. This was a huge feature for me, and it's a major step back to see it removed.- The included charging cradle is shorter and uses a USB-c port. Good in that it charges faster, but it can't be used with a standard wall plug brick. Older charging cradles can still technically be used, but you are warned that they may produce excess heat.- Battery life should be improved, but it's at best no better than previous generations - about 2 days at most.TLDRA nice update to hardware specs, but that's it. Everything else is the same or worse than previous generations, including the removal of some key features. Firmware is buggy. Overall, I think this is an inferior product to the Watch 4, and wish I hadn't traded my old watch in."
"Defective, does not track rems. Spent hours with support ( very inept). Say I have to send in for repair (2 weeks without health tracking). A NEW watch! No thanks returning not getting stuck with junk!"
Bought this watch in October.  I have never been able to get more than 8 to 10 hours of battery life from the watch on a charge.  Even when it is in the battery save mode I can‚Äôt get past 10 hours.  This means that by mid afternoon the watch is dead.
"overall: for the price, good headphones if you are not using them for the mic and/or calls. there‚Äôs some connection issues (but that may not happen with every pair, it may just be mine!)i bought these headphones november 2023 and as of today, august 2024, they won‚Äôt connect to my phone anymore. the audio still works and it‚Äôs a decent audio, but it definitely is not the same as it used to be. the audio was the best for the first 4-5 months of having them. now, they do not have as clear or loud of a sound and the bass is nowhere near as good. they still connect to my laptop, but i‚Äôve tried everything possible and they will not connect to my phone anymore. ever since i got them, ive had random small issues with connections, audio, and the built in mic. i‚Äôm gonna make a list of the random things that have happened off and on ever since ive bought these headphones (just cause lists are easier!):- when in a call (specifically when watching someone screen share), the audio will randomly become extremely static and distorted and i can‚Äôt understand a single word. i have figured out no way to fix this other than waiting for it to stop.- the mic is just not good at all and never has been good. either no one can hear me or im breaking up. the only way people can hear me is if i take the headphones off and speak directly into the tiny hole where the mic is.- when i‚Äôm in a call with someone and trying to watch something in the background, the audio of the video or the music is HORRIBLE. i don‚Äôt know how to describe it other than a muffled deep fried distortion (if you know what i mean.) this is possibly normal but i‚Äôve not experienced this with other headphones/earbuds.- the headphones occasionally will say they‚Äôre connected to my phone and/or laptop, yet they‚Äôll actually be connected to neither. i‚Äôll turn them on and the blue light will stay solid (indicating it‚Äôs connected) and on my laptop and phone it‚Äôll say the headphones are connected via bluetooth, but when i go to play something, it doesn‚Äôt play through my headphones. it will either play through my devices‚Äô speakers or play nothing at all. to fix this i turn off my bluetooth and turn off the headphones, then turn both back on and it will usually connect and play correctly- lastly, there have been a few times where i just couldn‚Äôt get my headphones to connect to anything at all. i‚Äôve figured out that this only happens when the headphones are around 15-30% charged. on top of this, i will have to say that i feel like the battery life has diminished a LOT since i first bought them.i wanna add that ive done research and tried lots of things and troubleshooted lots to figure out if this was a device issue or headphones issue, and it is indeed a headphones issue. specifically these connection issues have never happened with any of my other bluetooth headphones or earbuds. i DO recommend these if you only need them for music or maybe streaming shows, movies, youtube. but these headphones are not the best option if you are looking for a good mic."
"Had these for a little over 2 years.  LOVED them.  Great sound, very comfortable.  Usually buy Sony - but thought I'd give JBL a chance (I was in a band for many years - and we had a lot of JBL equipment).The swivel on the left earpiece snapped off today.  I am not one to overly used equipment - so I was very surprised.  Looks like a quality manufacturing problem to me.  I would expect this after prolonged use...but not after 2 years.  They are not used THAT much.Think I'll go back to Sony.  Hope I'm happy with the sound."
"I'm not an audiophile and these headphones sound good enough for my needs. I am satisfied with this aspect of these headphones. My main complaints are:The non-stop clicking sound when there isn't any audio data being transmitted, when the headphones are idle. I say ""audio data"" because if I play muted or silent sound, the clicking goes away. If there hasn't been any sound within a few seconds and you do something that generate sound, there is almost a half-second of sound cut-off while the phone comes out of its idle state. This is most likely something to do with bluetooth power-saving.Speaking of power-saving, the timeout for the headphones to power off is too short for me and I keep having to turn it back on. And the duration that you have to hold the power button to turn it back on is weirdly long, sometimes 3 seconds, sometimes 5 seconds. I actually made a script to play a silent sound in the background to get rid of the clicking and to keep the headphones turned on while I'm working.Overall, decent headphones for the price if you aren't bothered by the issues I mentioned."
For the price I got them at they work pretty well but they are uncomfortable after about 30 minutes my ears start to hurt and it causes me to get headaches. Now this is inconvenient because I bought these so I could use them on the bus when I‚Äôm heading to work which normally takes me about half an hour to an hour hopefully I can find a way for them to not cause me headaches so I don‚Äôt have to go through the hassle of a return
"Pretty cheap, honestly. They sound decent but won‚Äôt connect to the app and the microphone doesn‚Äôt seem to work with calls. All good, for 25 bucks they are pretty solid but I wish I paid an extra 15 for the better ones.  If that tells you anything‚Ä¶ spend the extra 15 bucks. It will work with the app for eq. And bet they are better quality and sound."
"I don‚Äôt have a large head and this is very tight even when extended‚Ä¶. When I tried to widen it, it just broke. Without much pressure. Hat size is 7 btw‚Ä¶.. probably fine for kids, sure it sounds great like most of jbl stuff‚Ä¶ just pass on this one unless you have a small head‚Ä¶. Cheers"
"These were pretty good while they lasted. The sound quality is decent for the price and they‚Äôre fairly comfortable. I didn‚Äôt use these headphones often, so I was surprised when the connection on the right side broke. Now it just dangles by the speaker wire. They still work but are really impossible to wear anymore."
"So the sound is amazing, but the ear part is so small. Like, it doesn‚Äôt cover your ear, it sets on your ears. And it hurts after a while. I did keep them, I just gave them to my son. But I just wish the ear part was bigger"
"Amazing value but only 3 starts because the product causes pain when worn for more than 20 mins, maybe my head is just to big as its over 24 inches, I just should have returned it but I thought I would get used to it."
"Sizing is not fully adjustable.  There is a creepy irregular clicking sound from the right speaker when audio signal is off.  Bluetooth binds, but you are expected to interpret the bind/no bind ‚Äúmusical‚Äù sounds.  ‚ÄúConnected‚Äù and ‚ÄúDisconnected‚Äù synthetic voice would be much better."
"This is a great headset, great sound and quality. However it's not good to be used for more then 1 hour. When it is kept on for long periods of time it hurts my ears really bad. I have to take it off and take a break."
"Comfortable fit but if there is no audio playing once it‚Äôs connected, the right side makes the most annoying clicking sound. It almost sounds like Morse code, not always the same length of time in-between clicks. Ugh!"
"These are fine, they're very small and I have a small head. More for a child than an adult. They're very tight on the ears. They connect easy to my Bluetooth and sound okay"
Just serves it‚Äôs purpose. Nothing extraordinary. My other Jlabs air pop $20 worth earbuds sounds far better. Not what we expect from JBL. you get what you pay for.
"These headphones run very small? I have never had an issue like this before, but they seem to be more fitting for a young teenager-not an adult woman."
"1/  It allows a computer and a phone to be connected at the same time, but it does not know how to switch back and forth on its own.  You need to reconnect the headphones by hand pretty much after each call (Win 10 Pro Lenovo / Google meet and IPhone Max).2/  No mute button.  This is a big issue, as the microphone will pick up noise from the environment during conference calls, and you have to use the mute button on your phone or computer as there is none on the headphones.  This limits your freedom of movement as much as a wired headphones set would.3/  It turns itself off if not in use - this is a problem if you are waiting for a call or a conf call to start - by the time the call comes in, the headphones are off and you need to power them on and reconnect them before you can use them.4/  Headband a little too short (on max extension) for my head5/  Good battery life, quick recharge, as mentioned in other reviews"
I loved this product at first they are lightweight and comfortable however after a while the music would not play even when connected .
They have great sound quality and they are very affordable but they Broke and stop powering on after like 2 to 3 days.
Headphones sound good. Excellent battery life. Only problem is the rubber on the head band started to wear away after a few months.
"The JBL Tune 510BT headphones are a decent option for casual listening, offering that signature JBL bass-heavy sound.  They're comfortable enough for short periods and the battery life is impressive. However, the lack of noise cancellation is a significant drawback, making them unsuitable for noisy environments or important calls where background noise is an issue.  If you prioritize sound quality and long battery life over noise isolation, these could be a good fit."
"When listening to audio (music, videos, etc.) the headset performed great. It has good, clear sound and connects easily to all of my devices. Unfortunately, in the left earpiece, whenever I wasn't playing any audio, it would begin to click incessantly with an irregular rhythm.I reached out to Harmon/JBL tech support, and they quickly replaced it, but the replacement headset had the same issue. So, I'm looking to buy a different brand instead."
Good sound quality. My only complaint is they are kind of tight and uncomfortable.
"I love the sound quality,  but unfortunately they're very uncomfortable"
One of the speakers broke away from the headband.  They still work but it's hard to try to attach the speaker back on.  It just dangles there.  If I'm laying down I lay on the side of the broken one to press it to my ear.  It didn't last a whole year.  This happened about 10 weeks ago.
"When my old over-ear headphones finally died, I was excited to see these JBL brand name ones on sale for a good price. But I've barely had these for a week and these are so bad that I'm already planning to replace them. My off-brand headphones were 100x better, and for a cheaper price.Pros:Decent sound quality (but no better than the off-brand ones I had before)Cons:1. These are the most uncomfortable over-ear headphones I've ever had. I'm an adult with what I assume is a pretty average-sized head, but these headphones are so tight they give me a headache. You can adjust the length but seemingly not the width, and the width is the actual problem. To make it worse, the ear covers are small, so they just barely cover the main part of my ears (and again, I don't even have big ears). After a week of heavy use, I hoped these would stretch a little, but they are still way too tight, especially if you have any ear piercings or wear glasses (I have both, hooray).2. The bluetooth connection drops constantly, with no warning. This is extremely frustrating since it defeats the whole purpose of the headphones. When the connection drops, the devices always still read as ""connected,"" but sound just randomly stops coming out of the headphones. This is not an issue with my devices, because it happens no matter what I connect the headphones to, and those same devices have no issues with other BT connections. Troubleshooting is an inconsistent nightmare-- I've tried manually disconnecting/reconnecting, turning headphones / devices on and off, ""forgetting"" and reconnecting to the headphones, but none of it works consistently. I cannot figure out what could be causing this except that it's just a crappy product.2b. These headphones supposedly support 2 simultaneous connections that can be toggled back and forth. This never works right for me. The headphones just seem to get confused by this double connection and switch or drop both connections often.TLDR; These headphones are super uncomfortable and the BT connection is trash. They have had so many problems after just one week that I ragequit using them and my frustration compelled me to write this review. No wonder they're on sale. Even $30 is too pricy for these pieces of crap.Recommendation:If you're thinking about buying these, do yourself a favor and just buy the ones I had before. $20, ""Tuitager"" brand, product name is ""Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear..."" etc. They were super comfortable and worked great for 8 months of heavy everyday use. Totally worth it for the price."
It's been 6 months and they were great! Just what I needed. Just enough noise cancelling without me being too unaware of my surroundings. But now they don't work well. They show as connected to the Bluetooth but there's no sound. I have to keep disconnecting and reconnecting multiple times for it to stick and work. Disappointed.
I ordered these headphones last minute to have my daughter use on our airplane ride. I have a similar pair and black and these were cheap. They fell apart first day that she wore them and we had to continue to put it back together
"These sound great but there are a few things that I did not consider:1. They hurt my ears when I wear my glasses.2. They hurt my eyes due to puling my glasses.3. They feel small like made for a small child or small adult.4. The issue above are more due to people stuff. The biggest complaint would be blue-tooth drops periodically or when I pause a video on my my firestick. The video remains silent until they reconnect. Reconnection is not always consistent. Sometimes automatically, sometimes after rebooting the device. Sometimes powering off the headset for a time. Then I rewind my video.Just something to consider.Good sound but not really usable by me as the issues are frustrating. Returning."
Although the speakers itself are good and reasonable quality the head cover is terrible. Covered with plastic the grooves pull your head all the time. Small joins and seams with this are so frustrating everytime your head moves it breaks and pulls your hair.
"These headphones seemed to be the answer to my prayers for maybe 60 minutes. I loved listening to Wait Wait Don‚Äôt Tell Me until my laughter started annoying my husband, who then tried to talk to me, which is exactly what I was trying to avoid with my headphones. Then I suddenly felt warm and I thought I was having a hot flash, after a moment of dread I noticed it was my ears. My ears were burning up.  I took off my headphones only to discover SWEATY EARS! I hate being hot. And I hate being sweaty.I thought I would try again tonight to see if the same things occurred. Sure enough, my laughter got side eye looks, and when I shouted out the answers to my game show my husband cried ‚Äúwhat are you shouting at‚Äù, and soon he was bemoaning that he couldn‚Äôt talk to me.  My response was, ‚Äúhmmm. It‚Äôs like trying to talk to you when you‚Äôre watching golf, football, basketball, or baseball.‚Äù  My ears still got hot and sweaty and at this point the sound isn‚Äôt balanced. The right ear isn‚Äôt nearly as loud as the left ear üòêSo I came on Amazon to see what exactly my dear husband paid for these ear sauna, husband whining, lopsided sounding headphones. $34. Well that explains a lot."
"The sound is pretty decent for the price, however they appear to be normal size in the pictures, but the headphones are too small. After a couple of hours, they start to hurt the outer ear because they don't fully cover the outer part."
"Headphones are extremely uncomfortable.  My ears hurt from listening.  Also, when it's hot, your ears will be wet, the headphones don't let air through, they're tight.  The sound is good. Bluetooth connection excellent."
Sound quality & battery life is fine for $50. But I can‚Äôt wear them more than an hour without them physically hurting my ears. They fit like they‚Äôre made for a kid. Don‚Äôt recommend.
These headphones are difficult to use because they work for more than  very short period of use. They rarely perform for more than an hour. I would not recommend them to anyone.
"These earphones did charge for me without issue and fast. They appear to be well made. Nothing feels flimsy to me. They are not $ 200.00 headphones. But they feel very good for the price. And for their size they do have a little heft. They fit well on my head and felt good on my ears. I and prefer this on the ear design. The pair definitely look sleek in all black.However, they would not pair with my phone. My Samsung Galaxy Ultra says it cannot Pair because an APP is required. As suggested. I tried turning off the Bluetooth several times. And tried again and it did not work for me.These earphones have a lot of five star reviews. With how they look and feel it's not hard to wonder why. I guess I was just unlucky with this pair. Which happens from time to time. Even with the best companies with high standards.I have purchased products from JBL before. And this is my first issue I have experienced. So I am not soured on JBL at all. In fact, my first inclination is to on exchange these for another pair ASAP."
"I expected it can last more longer, but it died before 2 years old.If it survive more than 3 years, I won't complain."
"It is comfy, but the style was not good, mainly because of the size of the headphones, which were too big for my head."
"Happy with this purchase for the most part.Pretty good sound quality, clear, easy switching back and forth to my devices (phone, iPad), comfortable on the ears.Long battery life.It‚Äôs not noise cancelling as such but more noise reducing.The only con is one of the ear pads fell off only two weeks after I received it and it‚Äôs impossible to fit it back due to the position of the screws so hubby macgyvered it on with some double sided tape. Doesn‚Äôt look very cute but works for now!"
"I have a larger head for a woman, probably about the size of average dudes. The headphones feel very tight and give me a headache after about 10 minutes of wearing them. I'm constantly adjusting them to move the pressure on to a different part of my ear. My ears are not that large but the headphone ear pieces are on the small side so they have to sit on the ear in some way.The sound quality is okay for budget headphones. Build quality is decent, better than generic brands from China.I do like how light and portable they are for this type of headphone. They fold up easily and don't take up much space when you throw them down on your desk. This makes them easy to use and access and that's the main reason that has earned it 3 stars. The white colour is pretty enough.Overall I'm satisfied but may be giving these to my 7 year old daughter if I can't manage to find a way to avoid getting headaches wearing these."
They will not last 12 months.....I bought based on JBL brand but was disappointed.
great headphones but charger that came with it don't fit the charging port
"I should really give these one star, but those are usually ignored... You're reading this though! üòéI'm old (and lucky) enough to have had JBL 4208 ""bookshelf"" speakers in their day. Those were *sweet*, the 4206s as well.As with sooooo many manufacturers, JBL has seemingly dumped anyone that knows anything about acoustics, and never bothered to hire anyone that knows anything about comfort.Gawd these are - overpriced, horrible feeling, and WAY _WRONG_ ""bass enhanced"".Pricing is what it is... The other two points, I can rant on.---Comfort: these are ""ON the ear"" not over/around. If you've never tried them before, you'll hate 'em. I've had ""ON"" headphones before, and they have a certain appeal depending on what you're working with. (and also, production versus listening). I liked them for open acoustic guitar where you want more ""air""...These, _these_, are sooooo tight, and have soooo little cush in the headband and muffs that all you want to do is get them off. Can you BEND the frame? Sure, go nuts... It'll never feel right. The muffs are too dense to give a ""molding coosh"". And, they're small... Like, sound leaks *around* them through my ear cavity. Both out and in. ""ON"" aren't supposed to _seal_, but his is beyond that. This is air passing around the muffs and into/out of my average sized ear.---Sound: Do you like the bass enhancement of the ""beats"" product line? You'll HATE these. The boost frequency is wrong, and bandwidth is huge. If that's a foreign language to you, basically the bottom end sounds like someone hitting a large plastic garbage can with a roll of wet paper towels - while you're in it.I couldn't get them back in the box quick enough.Another reviewer mentioned a product from ""Tuitager"", they're very generic looking here, just labeled as ""Bluetooth headphones over the ear..."". They're VERY inexpensive, don't let that fool you. They're MILES and MILES better than these. Buy those. Love those."
"1. I cannot seem to answer my cell phone with these on.2. I listen to a lot of metal music; I can't seem to get the volume or eq right.3. I love how they fold flat.4. I love how the charge ports are concealed under the ear brackets.Overall they are ok, not necessarily bad. I am giving these to my son and buying my typical cheap brand."
"Purchased this product to use on the plane and while walking.  I like bass, so when I read on the box pure bass sound I was sold.  That's not the case with these earphones.  I hear more midrange and treble than bass.  They fill good on my ears, they fold up and travel well. I'm just not happy with the sound quality."
I had them for a week and a half. Battery lasted a long time as well but once they hit 30% I tried charging them nothing happened. Waited to 10% still wouldn‚Äôt charge. Finally they completely died and still no charge. I used the charger that came with it and everything. Very disappointed
Broke after a month.
"Great budget headset, but after a few months it started to disconnect randomly.It's not as simple as re-connecting, as you have to go back into your BT settings, forget the device, power off then back on and pair again, and sometimes that doesn't even work.A lot of the time it's way more of a hassle than it's worth, as it pulls me away from whatever I'm doing. They're a good cheap headset but they're inconvenient. (Imagine being at the gym, or working on your computer, and you have to stop and jump through hoops to get your music/podcast back on üëéüèª)Other than that the sound quality and volume is good, the build is good, as well as battery life. I'm not a sound snob so take that as you will."
"I wear headphones literally every waking hours, and am very particular about my requirements. Largely, they need to be comfortable to be worn that long, have a usable battery, and I‚Äôm specifically looking for a pair right now that actually works with my 2012 iMac. Surprisingly, a lot don‚Äôt and the Bluetooth seems to stutter/fail on the computer, or the headphones playback slightly detached from what I‚Äôm watching.These JBL TUNE 510‚Äôs connected fine, and the audio quality was okay. It felt very‚Ä¶ dampened? Like everything had been squashed together into a homogenized sound instead of letting there be peaks and valleys where you want there to be. All sounds were at one standardized volume, is what I‚Äôm trying to say. This doesn‚Äôt matter TOO much for me, since I‚Äôm no audiophile and am frequently attempting to AVOID sounds, but it‚Äôs worth noting for those who care.I have TMJ, where my jaw frequently dislocated, so I need to be careful about pressure around my mandibles. Not only is it just generally uncomfortable, it can become actively painful and leave me unable to talk or eat properly.Anyway, these headphones squeeze too tightly around the mandible/space in front of the ear area, and I couldn‚Äôt last longer than about ten minutes with them. Unfortunate, because it seems like they‚Äôd be a decent option otherwise.Also, as far as dampening outside sounds, I can‚Äôt use active noise cancelling because I find it irritating/painful. I look for headphones that provide a good barrier between myself and the world‚Äîenough so that it‚Äôs not entirely painful, but that I can still mostly understand people speaking to me without needing to remove them, if nothing‚Äôs playing. These dampen a bit too much for practical use as ear defenders, unless you‚Äôre looking to really, REALLY turn down noise. Just the physical barrier the earpieces allow cut my baseline sound down from 200%, down to maybe 60%. Meaning I know that my baseline hearing is more sensitive than most, but with these headphones on, my auditory processing disorder made it even more impossible to understand conversation because TOO much auditory detail was lost.Anyway, I‚Äôm returning them. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for use if you have TMJ, or particular pressure sensitivities on the sides of your head/face. And if you want high-quality audio where you can really live inside the sound, this ain‚Äôt it, either."
I like the sound quality and look of these headphones. For me though they are very uncomfortable after awhile as they are very tight on my ears. So much so that there is an actual significant difference in sound of i don't have my jaw relaxed lol
"PROS:‚Ä¢ Comfy on the head and ears (longest worn for about an hour and a half at the gym).‚Ä¢ 8/10 sound quality. Fairly basey and thumpy, doesn't sound like I'm underwater.‚Ä¢ Sound is immersive, great for ASMR and general focus in a quiet area.‚Ä¢ Doesn't fly off the head while in motion.‚Ä¢ Connects to bluetooth very quickly.CONS:‚Ä¢ I don't know what gyms y'all are going to, but mine plays music the whole time on their speakers. These headphones DID NOT cancel out the outside noise at all. In comparison to my Skullcandy earbuds which I still have and use, these are in no way of use in a noisy environment. Started getting overwhelmed too quickly due to way too many noises around me. Gonna stick to the earbuds when it comes to the gym for now on.‚Ä¢ I originally bought these because wearing earbuds for too long hurts my ears. I do like these, but I'm gonna keep to only using them at home or maybe walking in the park to give my ear canals a break from my buds. These do not work for louder spaces.‚Ä¢ Unfortunately, I have neighbors that are sort of a block a way that play annoying music sometimes, and I can still hear them with these on. They're nearly a block away. I'm in my house.‚Ä¢ So essentially the biggest con is that these are, like... 10-15% noise cancelling. Should've been a little cheaper than the sale price, and definitely shouldn't be almost 50 bucks at full price.TL;DR:Comfortable, clear sound, secure, but absolutely not fully noise cancelling as claimed on the product. Overall 7/10, would more than likely get a different headphone set from a different brand if these were to fail on me someday."
"Update: I still think these are decent headphones that do the job. The battery life is amazing, but I'm also using them less than I used to. The number one issue: they shut down frequently at random intervals throughout the day. As often as once or twice an hour they will just shut down even while full charged and while I'm actively using them (so its not like they are going to sleep). I know this is a relatively small thing, but its still super irritating when I'm in the middle of dictating a sentence of text and they just shut down. This is a known issue - google it and you'll see dozens of reports - and I've tried the fixes recommended and none of them have worked. If the damn headphones would stay on and not quit every 20 mins I would use them and like them more.Previous review:I've been searching for good bluetooth headphones to use for dictation on my computer for years. This is probably the 3rd pair I've purchased and so far they are ok. As many reviewers noted, they are not very comfortable after you've been wearing them for a while. I can use them for about 90 minutes and then have to take them off as they are squeezing my ears/head. The pain sometimes lasts for a while too - not very pleasant. The sound quality on my end is pretty good and anyone I'm talking to reports clear sound transmission (through my computer, haven't used them on my cell yet). On dictation specifically: they seem to be pretty good in terms of picking up what I'm saying and converting it to text. Sometimes they struggle to pick up the nuances between similar sounding words, but that could also be the shitty Mac dictation app - it's not always possible to tell.The only other thing to note is when I'm wearing them between calls or not listening to audio, there is a weird clicking in the right ear. I've adjusted them, taken them off, shaken them, etc. and the damn clicking sound keeps happening. It's not that bad, but can be distracting when I just need quiet time. Overall, you get what you pay for - decent headphones but not mind-blowing."
I loved these headphones so much! And they stayed on my head and didn‚Äôt hurt my ears at all but it did break after a few months but that‚Äôs on my part since I dropped it sadly:(
"Nothing too special about these.  The ear cuffs are too small, and my ears standard.  The fit above the head isn't great and can easily shake off.  Okay starter set, but not for working out."
Sounds good look good feel good but steer wearing for 4-5 weeks they were stretched way out of shape and basically falls off when I put them on.
I really wanted to like these. I got them during prime day so I got a good deal. They don't fully cover my ears so if I'm wearing these over my ears with earings it gets really uncomfortable and starts to hurt after a while of wearing them. They are really cute I love the color and sound really good. They come with a cord to charge them and they fold so they are easy to carry around and are easy to store . They seem pretty durable and sturdy. They will probably fit my 5 year old daughter better than they fit me.
These lasted about a year and 1/2 before the ear cushion came off and then they stopped working shortly afterward. Liked them but hoped they‚Äôd lasted longer.
I am surprised at the battery life; I stillHave not charged it and it‚Äôs been working for close to a month- almost daily use.
"The sound quality is excellent, but the material quality is unsuccessful and it hurts your ears when you use it for a long time"
"Having worn out 2 pairs of AKG headphones, I needed to find a name-brand replacement.  These JBL BT headphones work well and are less expensive than the hard-to-find AKG 500 ($119). Bluetooth pairing was easy, they are lighter weight, and cost far less than other name brand headphones of the same type.  I dropped stars for the headband being somewhat tight making them uncomfortable to wear, and the build-quality could be better for a JBL product."
"I really was loving the headphones for about 6 months until randomly the part that lets the headphone rotate appeared like small peice came off and it started dangling by a cord so I could only have it snug on one part of my head and I‚Äôm not sure why it happened because I have never dropped it or any other headphone and had that happen. Overall good sound quality and good features, but it‚Äôs not very durable so it may not last long."
"I am updating my review to reflect it only took 3 months and 1 day for the cover over one of the earpieces to pop off. Unfortunately we ordered June 3rd and the return window has closed. Just sharing so others know, you might save money and they are cute, but it seems kind of cheap quality imho. Original review: The delivery time was shown to be available for quick delivery with prime, but it took 13 days to get here due to the delivery being rescheduled twice and the app did not give me an option to cancel / request refund unless it didn‚Äôt show on the second reschedule. I am having a problem with Amazon more and more lately with delivery times. My daughter does like the headphones ok, slightly less than her Sony headphones that I accidentally broke."
The ear muff came off and I couldn‚Äôt figure out a way to put it back on.
It pressed on my ears and hurt when I put it on. Sound is ok not great.
"So I bought these because my AirPods died and I needed something fairly cheap asap. They are great if you need a cheap wireless headphone to get in a quick workout but for long term use, these hurt and start to give you that headphone headache. Ive had these for little over a month and there is this weird clicking sound when nothing is playing. I‚Äôm already on the hunt for something else. The color is cute though!"
These Headphones are more suitable for children. The Ear base is small. Sound was fine.
I love the sounds of it and it‚Äôs slick style especially comes with different colors
"But not as spendy, either. These will be my office backup pair. The sound is pretty good."
The headphones are very small. We had to return them
"For some reason it doesn't keep its connection with my phone. I think it's because I also have it paired with my fire stick and it takes priority for some reason. Even when I fully unpair it and pair it again or restart my phone it doesn't connect again for a very very long time, like hours later. I even unpaired it with my fire stick and it still doesn't connect. It must be some kind of glitch or something. Otherwise the sound it good but having it constantly disconnecting makes it pretty useless. I have a Pixel 7 Pro. I also looked into downloading the app to see if it needed to update but this specific model headphones aren't on there. So I'm at a loss. I've had these for about 7 months and slowly I have gathered this information and came to these conclusions over that time."
"The sound quality is excellent. These headphones are very stylish and they look expensive. However, the shape of the band that goes over the top of your head is not head-shaped. The curve is too flat. Even when I fully extended them, there was always an uncomfortable pressure on the top of my head. Sadly, I had to return them. I was promptly issued a refund, so no complaints with the buying process."
"These headphones work great, no problems pairing.But they are uncomfortable to wear. First, they squeeze my head pretty hard, and there is no way to adjust them to fit looser.Second, they have some sort of plastic covering on the ear pads. These make my ears sweat. My old pair with foam pads never had this problem."
Leaks noise but overall okay.
"I am perplexed by all these great reviews.  They are not very comfortable to wear.  I don't have a huge head or anything.  To be extra clear, I am talking about the part that goes over the top of the head.  Even with the adjustments set to the maximum length it still feels weird on the top of the head.  I dont know why.  I feel like the headphones my sony discman came with 30 years ago are more comfortable than these by far.Sound quality is good.  I will give them that.I am very glad I got them on ""sale"", as I see they are back to their full price of $50 now.  I would return them at that price.  However for $30 I will keep them."
wasn't loud enough
"Update 2023-10-09: The power button stopped clicking, but is still sensitive. So headphones act like the power button is being constantly pressed (which puts them into pairing mode). As it is out of warranty JBL offered support in a repair outlet which probably would cost more to send out than to buy new, and also offered a discount for a replacement. A bit disappointed as they were otherwise fantastic for the money. They only lasted 1 year & 9mos.For the money these headphones do the job. I bought them specifically for 3 reasons. 1. Price. 2. Not having noise cancellation 3. Battery life. Let me explain. #1 - I got these on sale here on amazon and for the money and my next two points, they are a really good value. #2 - No noise cancellation is actually a good thing in my case. My wife is constantly talking to me while I'm doing dishes at night, so I like to have one ear off or the volume low to hear if she's talking to me. These ones have little to no noise cancellation so - perfect for me. #3 - Battery life - these things last FOR EV ER. I have some samsung earbuds that last only 6 hours or so, maybe less, so I wanted something that could go longer between charges. These things last close to 40 hours between charges - a HUGE step in battery life! I'm incredibly happy here. They also pair bluetooth easily, and the volume controls & pause/play controls as simple and effective. The last thing I will say is that they're a bit tighter on my head than I'd prefer, and they slip off my ears pretty easily if I bend my head over to grab something, but I haven't gotten a headache and for my needs they are totally fine (if I stay upright). I highly recommend them if you're looking for similar characteristics."
"these work pretty well. My only complaint is that they don't block outside noise from my side. If I am using them to talk on the phone and anything loud happens around me, it hurts the ears of the person on the other line."
"I guess I'm just used to over-ear headphone that cover the entire ear, or earbuds. I kinda don't get bothering to make a circular ear cover that doesn't envelope the entire ear. These smaller ones just press against the ears a bit hard, and hurt enough to have to take off after a while. I'm about a week into owning these, and I can wear them for longer periods. It reminds me of developing callous on the fingers when learning guitar. My next purchase will be full-sized. Too bad blue-tooth doesn't work for live musical Instruments. Oh yeah, there is a slight delay when I connect to my PC that is more noticeable once one becomes aware of it. (Sorry if you own this already!)"
"They sound great. The frame gets weak alarmingly fast, almost to the point of falling off my head. They fit snugly at first, but quickly lose grip on less you wear a cap or toboggan. Shame. They sound great."
"You truly get what you pay for with these headphones. I was looking to replace another set of over ear headphones that had died after several years of use and opted for these as they are decently well reviewed. Three stars because they function, but thats really all I can say for the plus column. These feel as cheap quality wise as the headsets they hand out on flights. They also should not be marketed as over ear and instead on ear, because they are about half the size of my last set. Overall I feel like I threw money away because I'm going to have to save up to purchase a decent set to replace these."
"For some reason, I was expecting more from these since they carry the JBL name. I also have a pair of JBL Tune 760 and my Beats beats both of the JBL's, hands down."
"I bought these on sale for $29.95 USD. The headphones are visually attractive, but I feel like a dork because they are bulky and look funny on my head. I still wear them in public, but soon these shall be retired for home use only. The headphones are also heavy on the head after one hour or more.... the user may need to  readjust to keep them in a non taxing position. I wouldn't buy them again, but I dont hate them. They are just annoying and bulky and I am sure the $150.00 USD version is badass. I wouldn't buy again because of the fit, I do i have a large size head."
"They sound great. Only problem is, they hurt the top of my head no matter how I extend the headband or where I place the headband on my head."
"When searching for noise cancelling headphones to wear on flights, these popped up. JBL is a name known for their quality products so I ordered them without hesitation.When they arrived, I tested them by wearing them while I ran the vacuum. No good; I had to turn the volume up so high to cover the vacuum noise that my ears hurt. I read the manual more closely and discovered they are not advertized to be noise cancelling. Silly me; I just assumed when they came up in the Amazon search that they were. Other than tha, these headphones were comfortable and the sound quality was good."
So I'm a power lifter and I go to a very popular gym the reason why I got these headphones is because I'm on a budget and I wanted to get something overhead I regret getting these for the simple fact that I got overhead headphones and I can still hear what's going on around me that wasn't the point of this JBL I was supposed to be deaf to the outside world. Now I'm hearing metal and hip-hop at the same time.Pros: Comfort is great they're totally adjustable and they have a great sound quality.There's no noise cancellation with these ones
"I'm 6'2 and these are really tight on my head and ears.  Uncomfortable.  Sound is exceptional, but it's just way too uncomfortable to wear these regularly."
Not worth the time to get these if you plan on using them for talking. Sounded like I was inside of a cavity trying to talk.
"I've had JBL products before and didn't have any trouble, but these headphones stopped working after about 7 months of once-a-day use (~15 min/day for meditation). I could turn them on after charging overnight and they would abruptly turn off (in the middle of meditation!!) after 3 to 5 minutes. My husband, a sound and lighting expert, looked at them and said, yes, they're junk (and laughed at me for buying them: what did I expect for $25?) so I can't recommend them."
"These are cute, work well and I enjoy them, but they are pricey for what they actually do. They are comfortable for a while, but they do end up hurting my ears because they are so small. I like these and will keep them and continue using them, as I have for a while now, but the price point is a bit unfair. I think you're paying for the brand as opposed to the quality. I didn't notice anything about these that would set them apart from other cheaper brands other than possibly the ease of bluetooth connection. meh"
It's too tight for my head and hurts after wearing for a bit. Sound it slightly cheap sounding and airy compared to good headphones.
"They sound better than I anticipated, pretty good for the price point anyway.2 complaints, they are quite tight on my head, I picked these because other reviews mention that they are kind of big but they actually seem small and are hard to wear for more than an hour or so. Second, the bluetooth cuts out pretty badly. If I'm more than a couple feet from the computer, tablet, or phone they cut out unless I hold my head perfectly still. Other headsets I've used in this exact same house didn't cut out this badly."
"I bought these to replace my pair of Zihnic headphones which were clunky and creaked, rattled, and thunked whenever I wore them. I didn't realize I would actually notice a sound quality difference but whoo was I wrong! These JBL headphones are TINNY sounding. I don't know if I got a junky pair since everyone else has raved about the brand and the sound quality... I immediately went back to my Zihnic pair, and those sound better, albeit slightly muffled in comparison. And where's this bass they talk about? Non-existent.I was not happy with the fit initially since I prefer the ear cups to cover my whole ear, but I have a tendency to pull one muff behind my ear while people need to talk to me, and for that these are much more comfortable than the rigid style. They are also more lightweight and I wore them down around my neck for awhile and barely noticed them.I really wish the sound quality was better since the fit is nice, but the whole point is to listen to music and for that they are just not good enough."
The people around you will be able to hear anything you listen to. No technical issues though and they are comfortable.
Ended up returning them. Very small around the ears and around my head. They gave me a headache.
"Although the sound is not bad I would not recommend these headphones. The Bluetooth is easy to pair with my Sony TV and the sound is pretty good, solid bass and sharp treble, they hold a charge for a long time (at least 20 hours)and charging time is pretty quick (about 2 hours). That's where the good news ends, I found the volume control is a PITA as it only adjusts the volume in set amount increments so it will go from 72 to 66 with one press, no way of going from 72 to 71. Same for the up volume. The headphones were very tight on my average size) head and the pressure of the pads on the earsmade my ears hurt after a short time, they also gave me headaches if I wore them for more than a couple of hours. The head band is pretty uncomfortable and digs into your skull after a short time but my biggest beef is the construction quality. Sure they're not the most expensive headphones but I bought them August 2023 and they just broke on May 5th 2024. The ear pieces swivel and fold but the point of articulation is a very small, thin piece of plastic and it finally snapped as I was putting on the headphones to watch a movie last night. The First photo shows how the joint should look, the next two photos show the thin bit of plastic that broke."
"I ordered this because my old set was beginning to act up... not always charging when plugged in.  I just opened the box today.  I wanted it for watching TV after my wife goes to bed and to watch videos while traveling.  Written instructions are minimal but to my pleasant surprise it paired with the BT transmitter hooked to the cable box as soon as I turned it on.  However, much to my surprize and dissappointment there is no auxilliary input for use with laptop or airplane entertainment unit.  (Unfortunately I took it for granted.)  The diameter of the earpads is a bit smaller than my old one.  The tension of headband seems a bit tighter as well which would likely be a good thing if using them while working out or running.  The tension increases when extended to fit my larger head.  This could become uncomfortable with extended use.  This one will likely be going back."
"I'm glad I bought these during the Black Friday sale of 2023 for $25, because I would not pay a dime more for them. The sound quality is OK for the price, but nothing spectacular. They are ""on-the-ear"" design, not over-the-ear, so there is no noise-cancelling, but I'm OK with that. I have earbuds when I want to shut out the world around me. There are no crisp highs‚Äîhardly any highs at all, actually. Stewart Copeland's brilliant high hat work in Peter Gabriel's ""Red Rain"" is inaudible. Jeff Pocoraro's ""Rosanna"" shuffle seems flat.On the positive side, stereo separation and imaging are decent. The headphones are fairly comfortable. I have a large head, and at first they were a little snug, but loosened up after a few hours. Can' t comment on battery life, but it has been a few days since I needed to charge them.I stand by my initial statement of I wouldn't pay more than $25 for these."
One side broke within months. The earpad came out. Not good for me
"I got the black one a week ago and no complaints, I gave it to my son to used for his chromebook then I purchased the white one for me and got it today.  I have this headphones for a few hours listening to my music while doing my chores inside the house, I love the headphones but this one needs to be return. My ears hurts while having this on."
Worked great for about an hour then one of the ears quit.
They sound very good but my headphone cushion keeps coming off.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was wanting these headphones bc I saw them at target a few days ago. They are about the same price as Target. My AirPod Pros don‚Äôt work anymore they just die. I only had them since 2021 and couldn‚Äôt use them cuz my ears have been sensitive to loud sound since 2021. Plus these don‚Äôt fall off like my AirPods do if I move around or out my head down. So I wanted to find a good pair of headphones over ear. These are nice that you can customize the sound with the JBL App. It was a bit confusing at first but then I figured out how to connect them to my phone through Bluetooth no problem. I like that I can switch to vocal sound and video sound when watching movies or shows or listening to music on my phone. I love the lavender color it‚Äôs my favorite color. BUT the ear cuffs are so tiny. I have tiny ears but even these are too small for me. It‚Äôs a bit difficult to adjust them too for the head. I haven‚Äôt figured it out yet to adjust to my size yet. Oh and the headphones bend to close to put away without taking up too much space. They are soft in the ear cuffs. But too small even for me with tiny ears. Makes me sad. I might return these and invest in a pricier pair of JBL over-ear headphones if these don‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôll give it a go and if they still bother me with the tiny ear cuffs then I‚Äôll return them. Oh and I also purchased a case that matches the color of these super cute. Oh also another thing when I set them to studio my ears weren‚Äôt hurting cuz I mentioned in my review here that I have sensitive ears since 2021. So having a headphones to not hurt my ears is also important to me. Cuz my AirPods would hurt my ears. So this is my review hope it helps someone decide to get these or not.
"I like this headset.  Not to heavy, love the color, but jeez the charging cord is SO SHORT!  It's literally about 8 inches long.  No I did not mean to write ""feet"" - INCHES.  I guess they just assume everyone can charge it through their laptop, but unfortunately, I don't have enough ports so I have to charge it on the floor or countertop RIGHT next to an outlet with the an adapter.  I'm making it work, but it's pretty inconvenient."
It was great product overall came charged half way starting using it till I realized few hours later the charger ? Did not go into the headphones the c type was too big for my headphones so please make sure you check the charger!
"The sound is good, just wish the max volume was louder.  Not comfortable for wearing over 30 minutes. I recommend getting the over the ear model, not this on the ear version."
"I‚Äôm trying to find an alternative to ear buds so thought I‚Äôd give these a go. I didn‚Äôt even get as far as charging and connecting via Bluetooth because I couldn‚Äôt get over the feel on the top of my head. In spite of having padding, they still felt hard and uncomfortable. Maybe I just haven‚Äôt worn true headphones in a long time and am not used to the feel, but these are a no go for me. One other thing I noticed is that they look funny, really wide on my head. Assuming they‚Äôre made for all shapes and sizes, but for my smaller, female noggin, they looked odd."
Not bad for the price
"I questioned whether this was designed for kids, and have been since I got these. I don't have a big head, definitely don't have big ears, or any piercings that would get in the way, but I do have thick curly hair. These feel tight, and the earpad covers are so small, my ears are always sore by the time I'm done using them. If the band had a bit more give it wouldn't be as annoying, but these are NOT thick hair/glasses friendly in the slightest. If I had another option instead of these I'd be using them, poking around for different earpads as we speak (you read/I type, whatever)"
These were nice but I reccomend the 510's since they are noise cancelling. But overall this product is very comfortable and long lasting. If you put it on the charger for an hour or two you‚Äôll get about 3 ¬Ω continuous days of playtime. I like these headphones but they slip off easily and I cannot make them any smaller. Good pricing.
"I got these headphones to connect to my computer for when I write and do video calls. At first, they worked great. The sound was clear and the person could hear me, then they cut out. At first, I thought the other person accidentally muted themselves. That was until I played music on my end (that should have come through the headphones) and heard nothing. I powered them off, then back on and they worked. I thought it was a fluke and double checked my settings and connections and tried again. Same thing happened several times. I tried to look up why this would be an issue and didn't really come up with a solution.When the headphones work, they're great. I enjoy them and the sound quality, but the constant disconnecting defeats the purpose of bluetooth headphones."
I thought JBL would be louder than dollar store head phones.
The headphone connected or paired easily with my phone. It has good sound.The only con that I can say is that the ear cup is small and keeps falling if I am moving and it doesn't feel comfortable.It may fit better to a 8 or 10 years old.
I was excited to get these. Loved the blue color and I‚Äôm a long-time fan of JBL speakers so I was really disappointed to hear that that awesome sound quality I‚Äôm used to from my speaker is just not there in the headphones.  The sound is good but not great and seems a little muffled.  I compared with my son‚Äôs Beats and the Beats have a much better sound and fit much more comfortably too.  The JBL is not uncomfortable just not as comfortable as the Beats. Also I felt that JBL kept sliding back off the back side of my head so I had to keep adjusting it.  I‚Äôm going to return them in favor of the Beats
"I brought these for my husband thinking they were the same size as mine but they are small like it should be label for children. Although he uses them, he doesn‚Äôt use them for long periods of time. Sound is good but not recommended for adults."
"I bought these and another brand for the same price ($35 each) and I have to say, these just aren't worth it.They are tight , the cushions are uncomfortable, and sound is pretty subpar compared to other options in the same price range.I can recommend the Soundcore by Anker Q20i which I purchased alongside these over these any day.If there are better options in this price range I do not know, these are the only two I have experience with."
"Pretty good, but they're kind of fragile. The first pair didn't last much more than a year - one of ear pieces broke off."
"Great sound, lightweight, but they don't cover your ears like the JBL Live ones do. Yes, they sound great, but are for listening at home, not bouncing around at the gym."
The ear part is a bit flimsy very fragile prone to ripping if rough with it
"Bought these for the gym. Feels cheap, sound quality isn‚Äôt good, can‚Äôt turn the volume more than halfway up because of the sound leakage. The shape of the headband part is unusual and not comfortable. The ear part is smaller than I would‚Äôve expected. They feel very fragile and cheap. Overall poor quality. Would not recommend these."
"Is seemingly for an individual that has more of a  square shaped head. When on your head, the headband is wide and square leaving only a portion of it resting on the top of your head. I prefer more of a rounded shaped headband, that hugs your head and is more comfortable. The sound quality isn't bad and most normal noise is blocked out. I gave it a 3 because of the headband shape."
It's looked off of his head.It had good noise reduction but it kept slipping off of his head so he couldn't use it
The right ear is evidently louder than the left ear which makes for an uneven sound if that makes sense
Just opened the package and pulled the headphones out of the dust cover and noticed the headband separating slightly and the surrounding head cushioning pulling away. Hopefully this doesn‚Äôt fall apart after I use them.
This item has a great charge life but I‚Äôve had this item for less than 2 months and it sound robotic and makes everything I listen too sound robotic. It‚Äôs not really worth the money would NOT recommend.
Headset has a good sound but the volume is a lot lower than I wanted.
Returned product. They look like they belong on a child.
"They were not large enough to cover my Wife's ears.  My son loves them, but they have rarely lasted more than a couple of short car rides before they are dead."
Got these headphones today. The bass is not there at all not sure if you can change it. and the headphones itself are very small like for a kids heads.
All the reviews were good but once I received them I thought I had got a kids version they are super small & pretty uncomfortable especially if u have earrings
"I bought these for my daughter for her birthday.The minute she put the. On, she complained that they hurt her ears. I sent them back same day."
I LOVE ANYTHING JBL BUT THIS JUST DOESNT DO IT FOR ME ITS NOT AS LOUD AS I WANT IT TO BE. BUT AGAIN THATS JUST ME.MY DAUGHTER SAID THEY WERE VERY LOUD FOR HER BUT W.E.
I wish they were louder but they are okay to use in quiet settings or in the shower
I love JBL products normally but I can tell right away these are meant for kids. Too tight on the head and uncomfortable to wear for anything longer than a short period. They also make my ears sweaty. The sound is good although not noise canceling but they didn‚Äôt claim to be. Would suggest JBL ear buds for adults instead.
"Mine turn off all of a sudden, they won‚Äôt last a minute on, how can I fix it??"
Not as loud as I expected but they will get the job done
I cannot charge the headset. Charging xhord sent is incorrect!!!
I liked the headphones.  The side broke within 2 weeks.
My 16 year old son had the headphones on in the car and he heard a little click and one side of the rotator broke. Just over a month after buying it. Now it just dangles and is no good for useNow that we are over the return timeframe i had to buy a new one. Sucks to have gotten what i hope was a defective one. The sound quality and all was good other than it breaking out of no wher
"These work well, easy setup, quick charge with long battery life, but they don‚Äôt get loud enough. I don‚Äôt hear super well, and at max volume, I can barely hear."
I haven‚Äôt even had these 3 months and that already broken üò°. What a waste. Glad I got them during the prime deal days. üöÆüòí
These feel stubby in my head and sit weird.
I got these because I thought the bass would be great and it would be noise secluded I mean they‚Äôre JBL but they don‚Äôt seem to fit right the music is okay and the bass is not the best
Lasted 3 months.
Very small headphone around the ears. I bought much better JBL headphones last year that actually went around my whole ear. This one is awkwardly and painfully covering my ear. Not sure who would find this comfortable.
"I have no idea why there are so many good reviews.  I have had tons of headsets over my life and these are NOT comfortable.  They may sound good but I will never know.  It is too uncomfortable for me. I can make then longer but they are too tight -- meaning not wide enough to sit on my ears comfortably. I am sorry  -- but these have to go back, and I hate returning things  :-("
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The sound is great. The power on/off button failed. Can‚Äôt use them 3 weeks after buying them.
I bought these headphones for mainly video games and watching TV so I don't disturb my husband. They are VERY diffulit to pair with any device and very easily become unpaired. These headphones are very conformable. The hurt my hears and start to give me a headache if I wear them for more than an hour. I hate these and have to be one of the worst Amazon purchase I have ever made. I wish I could get a refund. Save your self the 40 bucks and don't go with JBL.
"I keep trying to keep the headphones on my head, but they keep falling off. I have a small head, so I don't know why they don't stay on. The sound is not as clear of sound as I thought it would be."
"It‚Äôs impossible to enjoy them when they‚Äôre constantly pressing down on your ears; they don‚Äôt sit comfortably at all. On top of that, it‚Äôs near impossible to hear the songs without them being completely muffled. If you love hearing music and sound distinctly, you‚Äôll hate these headphones"
They are uncomfortable and too small. Don't even cover ears. We'll probably return. May he okay for 5 year old head and ear size.
app reqd and data mining permissions required to use this product. very disappointed. same with beats. these are ligher than beats and a nice color but it is a hard NO for both dt privacy concerns.
I‚Äôd like my money back. I bought the larger ones a while back and I love them. These are junk!!!
"It was a present for my son, and never told me that the headphones were worthless.even with his cheap headphones you can listen much better.When I learned about it, was too late to return them.I am an old musician and had a profound respect for the JBL brand.Not anymore.Juan Manuel Garcia"
All of the photos for this product show large headphones that completely cover the ears.  What I received were some ridiculously small headphones that are unusable.  Extremely disappointed.
"These would be great if weren‚Äôt so tight. I am a small female with a normal sized head and I can‚Äôt wear these for very long because they press down on my ears. I took my earrings out to see if that would help, but it did not.  They are too tight and the ear prices are too small causing them to press directly on the ears."
"Jesus. So uncomfortable to wear. Sounds good, Boise canceling is whatever, but you can‚Äôt have them on for five mins without your ears hurting!!!!!!!!! Def better choices out there. Do not recommend at all"
Your charger doesn't fit the headphones
Volume is very low. I was expecting a concert quality sound w the headphones .No go.
"I ordered this for work meetings. I have a fairly small head, and this headset is SO tight. I tried wearing them for a few weeks to ""break them in"" and they did not get any better. If I wore them any longer than 30 minutes my ears would start to hurt, and so would my head.  Buy off brand ones that fit over your ears. These are not worth it."
I had to return these back they look nice but feel light and cheap they sound very low even with the app to pair them with the EQ on the app does not help won't recommend üíØ 1 star JBL should do better I got these in two colors sent both back took 3 weeks to get my refund credited
After 30 days the power button no longer works. The power light blinks but I have difficulty with powering the headphones off and on. JBL can not do any troubleshooting just offer to send new headphones under warranty (that can take forever to receive after you send the purchased headphones back). Very disappointed in the quality of these headphones.
"The advertise this as though you can put the headphones on your ear, over your ear or in your ear. But in reality, they only sit on your ear which makes them uncomfortable, and much less comfortable than an over the ear headphone.Not to mention there is no jack to hook this in to an airline seat or something similar, extremely disappointing."
"Was wonderful when they paired with my sound bar. About two weeks ago I noticed the pairing time started getting longer‚Ä¶and longer‚Ä¶ until I tonight after a half hour of trying, I gave up. I don‚Äôt have money to waste and am very upset."
I got the first one it lasted three days and the ear cushion piece came off. We sent it back and got a replacement took it out of the box and right away. The earpiece came off. These are made cheaply and are not worth $45.
The red light comes on for 30 seconds and goes off.  Tried using multiple adapters but still didn‚Äôt wirkt
"Bought these for my daughter for her birthday. Within a month of her using them, the speaker started crackling and it would turn up the volume or start changing songs without being touched. Of course we bought them early when they were on sale so by the time her bday came around and they stopped working it was too late for a return."
Sound ok. But used less than 40 hours and they died-- just like the other reviews. I've had Bose equipment for years. These are a ripoff.
"I don't know what happened to JBL, but these headphones suck! The ear piece is for a child not an adult. Sound quality is awful.I had a pair of JBL headphones before. They were amazing and lasted years. I also own a couple of JBL wireless speakers. Amazing.These are going back tomorrow"
"Woke this morning 9:12/2024, why my headphones doesn‚Äôt work"
After a month the right side stopped working. No sound coming out at all. These are too expensive for it to just stop working ugh.
"For the price, the sound quality is okay, and the battery is great. However-- headphones are super uncomfortable.Very confused at the many 4.5+ stars on this product."
These are not made for people with longer faces. Not very adjustable in height and not very loud at all
Amazon delivery stinks on ice
These headphones wouldn't stay on my head when running and perform sit ups.
Poorly made and tight on your head. Sound quality also not great.
Too small they hurt my head.
I bought some other off brand headphones from tiktok shop that are louder than these‚Ä¶ so disappointed.
One side went out right after the time period I could return them.
"Had these delivered today.  So far...eh.  I'm using them to connect to my Samsung smart TV via Bluetooth.  All setup was smooth, quick and seamless.  However, 1/2hr into using them and two things. First, not very loud. Just loud enough to listen to the movie.  Secondly,  extremely uncomfortable so far.  The earpieces do not cover my entire ear. So the outer section is pressing my top ear cartilage.  The bottom presses my earlobes.  I hope they break in or its a return for me.  The pain is pretty annoying, distracting to the point of being unbearable.  Will provide further updates.  3 stars for now."
My MIL got these for my son for Christmas. He uses them constantly. We always had issues with bluetooth not connecting/disconnecting. I got him a cord and he used them that way for awhile. Then we had issues with them only playing out of one side. We got the bluetooth to work for a bit but now that is not working at all. Tried all th fixes with pushing different buttons. Replaced the internal battery. Nothing. I get the white light but the bluetooth light never connects. I've had skullcandy headphones for almost 20 years that still work great but these lasted less than 2.
"I am very pleased with these, but there are a bunch of issues. I have had to buy 4 of them because they keep breaking. I handle them with care but they still tend to eventually fall apart after a few months. The cables that connect them to your devices seem to break/stop working quite easily as well. The first pair I bought (pink, which they don‚Äôt sell anymore) stopped turning on and the battery was basically dead, the same things happened to the second pair (white) too. The third pair (black) lasted for around a year, but it began to have a weird glitch where it randomly disconnected, turned off, or the audio froze and made a horrible sound. I decided to get new ones (black), the ones I currently own. These have an issue where the audio briefly cuts out for a few seconds, disconnects/turns off randomly, makes a deafeningly loud sound when you press on the sides of them, and my hair gets caught in them all the time. For every pair I‚Äôve ever owned, I have to wear them backwards because wearing them the regular way hurts my ears.The sound is amazing though, and the price is great. Although they do have a lot of problems, I still love them and have used them for years. The material is a good quality and they are super comfortable when worn backwards, in my opinion. A fully charged battery can last for weeks, and when it dies, it takes just 2 minutes to charge to 50%. Very impressive!"
too loose on my small head.  Definitely not for small heads. Too big
"These are fine. On sale for a decent price so can't really be mad.The ear peices are quite small so they feel awkward (i have small ears too).I'm very hard if hearing so I can't speak in the volume other than I do wish they went louder -- but, that's only because of my lack of hearing.I use these when I walk my dog so they serve their purpose. I just wish I looked better to see size of action ear peice."
Sound is rich and full as you‚Äôd expect from JBL but the headphone build feels like upgraded airplane headphones. They barely fit on my head and the earpieces are small and not so comfortable.For the price on sale it‚Äôs a good deal but maybe for kids.
"I have pretty small ears, so I thought these would work for me, but it was a relief to take them off after 20 minutes of wearing them. Sound is okay for price, however I found the soundcore brand to have much better sound quality. These are almost kid sized, not comfortable"
I was expecting a better sound guality from these headphones. I have purchased a few pairs from Wish for half of the price. The sound guality is better. Cheers!
These have a nice sound and ear phones fit well but the headband is hard and flat. Couldn‚Äôt see myself wearing for any length of time before getting a headache. Will look for a pair with padded headband
Good quality especially for the price but my bad that I didn't know on ear causes quite a bit of ear fatigue and headache
Headphones are comfortable and durable but they don't seem to be loud enough for me. That might be just a personal preference tbh.
Could be better sounding headphones‚Ä¶ does it job
"I basically used it for watching TV while doing kitchen stuffs. I found out if I was 23 foot from TV, the sound received was not stable. Secondly, I need to use my TV remote to connect the headphone through Bluetooth every time I started to use it, but my old headphone connected automatically. I think it is not primary for TV watching, I don‚Äôt know."
Product is great in charge but it is not so much comfortable in long-term use
I find them a bit snug. If you have a big noggin (I don‚Äôt) these are not for you.
"Update 3/9‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so first I‚Äôm going to say that I bought these with my own money before any reviews were out.  Didn‚Äôt realize they were a vine product.  After a few weeks of use the padding has relaxed enough so that I can feel the drivers poking my ears.  I wear my headphones around 4 hours a day on weekdays and 8-10 hours on each weekend day. As stated earlier I have a smaller than average head, and my ears do not stick out.  I can usually adjust the cups to be lower, but I don‚Äôt like them riding my jawbone.I would‚Äôve have overlooked that because they do sound good, however they are now randomly disconnecting.  I use them for YouTube and I‚Äôm literally 18 inches away and they disconnect. I check through the app and it shows a connection failure.  If I pause a video, again, they show connected, but the sound comes out of my iPad.  When I check the app it tells me there is a connection failure and to restart. While the sound is good I don‚Äôt think I care to restart my headphones every 10 minutes. Maybe they don‚Äôt like Apple devices? I‚Äôm not sure‚Ä¶.I originally bought the xm5‚Äôs. I finally got them last week only to find they were quite oversized for my smaller than average head. The weight of them made matters worse as every time I looked down they flopped forward. I had to return them.I am not one of those fancy audio people but I know what I like. My previous headphone were the solo pro 3‚Äôs and I do enjoy them. What I don‚Äôt like is the pain my ears experience after about an hour of having them on.I wanted over the ear headphones and everything I read and all the videos I watched pointed me to the xm5‚Äôs which ended sadly. I searched Amazon and saw these were a new model. Looked up what little I could find online about them and the consensus was these were the cheap version of the xm5‚Äôs. Yeah, I‚Äôm sold so I got them.Build:  They are cheaper feeling, not as bad as the 510‚Äôs, but nowhere near the xm5‚Äôs workmanship. But they are also not breaking the bank (as bad anyways, it still shocks me to see what headphones are going for nowadays). The sliding part is plastic reinforced by metal. I‚Äôll be honest‚Ä¶.I am wondering how they will hold up.Comfort:Excellent. These are super light. I don‚Äôt feel them resting on the crown of my head at all. There is no clamping on or around my ears. But the are secure on my head. The padding around the ear cups is decent and the cups are deep so most will not have their ears touching the speakers.Bells and whistles: these are old school, they have buttons‚Ä¶no swipe features at all. I like that because in my week of using the xm5‚Äôs I discovered quickly that volume adjustment was hit or miss with response time. It might be that my hands are always cold, but in 6 hours of wearing these I have already mastered the buttons. They are very well placed and very responsive.App:  They are part of the Sony Headphone app. You get an equalizer and other customizable features including the ability to connect to two devices at the same time and it works great as I use the headphones for watching music videos on YouTube and Netflix. I use my phone to adjust the equalizer for the music playing on my iPad.Another feature on the app is you can set the headphones to shut off when not in use. I was excited about the auto shutoff feature. Not so much now. It is not sensor based nor is it based on when you device‚Äôs screen shuts down. It is based on when you turn of Bluetooth. This makes it worthless to me and maybe a lot of us who do not ever turn Bluetooth off. I think it could have been done better.Noise cancelling:I‚Äôm going to call this adequate. With my Beats Solo pro with ANC I can‚Äôt hear anything. Not even someone yelling. These will drown out the hum of a fan pretty well, but they let in a lot of ambient noise (like my husband coughing in the next room right now!). Even the xm5‚Äôs were not as good as the Beats. But the on ear style of the Beats may have something to do with that. So I‚Äôll stick to the xm5‚Äôs comparison. I also want to say that there are supposedly 3 modes‚Ä¶noise cancelling, ambient and off. I have not noticed any difference between ambient and noise cancelling. There is no voice prompt to let you know which setting you are in. I will play some more to see if I‚Äôm missing a setting in the app and if something changes I‚Äôll edit my review.Sound quality: (of course this is subjective to each person) Excellent out of the box and I could not say that about the xm5‚Äôs. My first mission was to find the equalizer when I took them out of the box and tried them. Not so with these. The sound was nice. I still tweaked it but if I wasn‚Äôt able to change it a bit, I would still be happy.Other:They do not come with a case. They do not fold. They come with an aux cord and charging cable, no charging block.Final thoughts: This is my fourth pair of headphones in a month. I was willing to drop over 300 bucks on a pair. And I didn‚Äôt like any of them. Most important to me is fit and sound.  Most were severely lacking in sound quality.  These are not. And they were cheaper.I am most disappointed in the build quality. I think they should‚Äôve done better. To me $150 is alot of money to spend on headphones that feel this plasticy. And if they crack after 6 months I‚Äôll be upset. I‚Äôm not expecting $350 quality, but better. These are not too much better than the 510‚Äôs when they should‚Äôve been a little less than the 910‚Äôs. They are far less quality than the 910‚Äôs. Maybe I‚Äôm asking too much after coming from the Solo 3 pros and xm5‚Äôs which both have a superb build.BUT‚Ä¶..they make up for it in having great sound that you can totally adjust to your liking.  They are comparable to the xm5‚Äôs in sound. And far superior I feel to the 910‚Äôs which just sound overly undefined bass. And the comfort!! It‚Äôs spot on.These are the best out there in terms of sound and app capabilities."
"When I received the ones that replaced the returned first pair, my first thoughts that these were going to be returned as well. Nothing wrong with the packaging, etc this time. They feel flimsy out of the box but after listening to them, that made up for the looks. They sounded remarkably well. Not made up my mind yet but they do sound very nice. I might have put in a few more bucks in the build, Sony opted not to. They are light and fit over the ears ok as well. I believe all should know that Amazon sent me a returned pair the first time!"
"Decent but comparing these to other headphones I've owned, both a cheaper and more expensive pair, the price does not justify the product. Pros vs cons:- Quality: this is a con for me, the cheap plastic makes it lightweight but I cannot see these being durable. The Pads feel similar to the cheaper pair I've owned and possible to breakdown easily over time/use.- Sound: this is a pro for me, the sound is actually really great and will definitely be the highlight of the cost you spend on these. I mean this is the biggest reason we buy Headphones, right? The question is if the sound is really $150 worth? Ive experienced cheaper headphones with just as good of sound.- Ease of use: this is a pro for me, the connectivity seems to be seamless and Google connection is a plus.- Comfort: this is a con for me, the pads at both the ears and top make this a difficult headphone to wear for multiple hours.- Noise Cancellation: this is a con for me, and while the NC does work, it seems to be directional and compared to others I own, this doesn't work nearly as effective.- Look: This a pro for me, since these are more sleek they do give a better appeal than my bulkier headphones.Overall this is my personal experience and preference, if you decide to buy you may feel differently. In my honest opinion, the market for headphones is so vast and there are a lot better options at a more affordable cost. If cost is less of an issue, spend a bit more and go with something even better. This product should not cost more than $100"
"I didn‚Äôt expect much, but the ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù aspect makes me think the plastics aren‚Äôt as durable as I would hope.As having had plenty of headsets/headphones in the past, I can say the one point of failure is poorly designed/inherently flawed plastics. Some are very durable, some aren‚Äôt, and because there aren‚Äôt very many reassurances about the quality/durability I think I‚Äôm going to return these and try for a higher-end set.There‚Äôs also a couple issues I will mention; the cups turn outward -instead of the ear muffs turning towards your chest when you have them around your neck, they turn outward, leaving the plastic to lean against your skin. This might not be a big issue to you, but for me it clanks against my jewelry, and just seems out of place compared to other models I‚Äôve used. The bracket for the band to the cups also sticks out farther than expected, hitting things further out from my head than I‚Äôm used to. The muffs are also not really meant for use in the summer as you will get sweaty and moist in there (issue solved with just switching to some earbuds.)Over all a great headset for the price. The active noice cancellation is a cool feature, and it charges quickly. The usb-c is also good to see, as well as the wired cable (only ~~3.5/4ft) for us suffering iPhone users who don‚Äôt have headphone jacks :‚Äô(.Don‚Äôt let my review lead you astray, sony makes some great pieces of gear, which are worth checking out for yourself."
I got these for my sister as a birthday gift. She really dislikes how theres a lack of padding on the ear and they pinch her ear and make them uncomfortable to wear. The sound qauilty is okay but the battery like is poor for a pair of headphones that has a msrp of 150 dollars.Ive seen 20 dollar headphones with better battery life
"These headphones are great unless there are any loud noises.  You know, like the one's you'd probably like to cancel.  But no.  Sony knows better than you.  They have decided that someone may start talking, maybe to you, maybe not to you, and it's so important that you hear what they say that the headphones will amplify the sound and jam it in your ears.  Hey ya jerks, that's the ""noise"" that I want cancelled and bought ""noise"" cancelling headphones for."
Bought for the noise canceling option and thought spending a little extra money would be worth it but no. The noise canceling option doesn‚Äôt really block much out and in my opinion not worth the price since my previous $40 knock off brand pair were 10x better . Sound is good though
"I bought these with the intention of getting a set of good quality noise cancelling headphones. Out of the box this headset sounded great and the noise cancelation was amazing! But there was a problem with the advertised dual bluetooth feature where it would drop both connections at the same time randomly, this was fixed but I have no idea how.My MAJOR problem with this comes a little under a year after purchase where the headphones broke while on my head. Now I am not rough with my stuff, I have my headphones on a headphone hook on the side of my desk, no kids, no animals, and I don't stretch them to the max. I was just wearing them and the joint cracked and now there is no way to wear these headphones.Sony states that this particular instance is result of normal ware and tare and thus not covered in the warranty and the cost for such a fix would be well over the price of just buying a new pair. I have headphones that have been used for multiple years with no breakage anywhere, so I don't see this as being normal, it's definitly a result of Sony using cheap materials.If you've read this far I highly suggest you find yourself another brand that will respect your money and not try to BS you with a bad warranty."
"I have had these for a year and although I am overall satisfied with the sound quality, its connectivity issues in general and inability to connect to zoom in particular has me looking for a new pair of headphones."
Bought this specifically to use with smart tv. Won‚Äôt connect up with TV consistently.  Any adjustment such as fwd or backward results in static.  Contacted manufacturer and was basically sidelined.
"I have bought 2 pairs of these headphones and my brother has as well. They are great headphones but the only last 1-2 years before the actual over the ear piece of the headphones ends up breaking away from the headband. The wiring remains intact and they still function, but one ear dangles. These headphones are just over a year old. This is not the first pair that has done this. Every. Single. Pair. They all break in this exact same way. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm beating these headphones up beyond belief, but they are just not meant to last. This is extremely frustrating as I love these headphones. They have an amazing sound quality, battery life, and the noise canceling is great for the price point. Unfortunately, I will not be repurchasing these as I don‚Äôt wish to have a yet another pair break on me. Avoid these!!!"
"These sony headphones are exceptionally light, almost to the point they feel cheap. I have to fly a lot for work and was looking at replacement options for mySoundcore Q45‚Äôs. Compared to the Soundcore the Sony headphones felt cheap. The padding around the headphones on the Sony uses a more ‚Äúbreathable‚Äù fabric, ear cuffs have a mess fabric, compared to the Soundcore which uses pleather. On long flights the Soundcore headphones can start to feel clammy.Other issues I had, these are personal preference but ended up being reasons I stuck with my Soundcore Q45‚Äôs.Audio control notifications - On the Q45‚Äôs anytime you change the setting normal, transparent, or ANC (Active Noise Canceling). There is an audio message that plays. This is helpful during travel where you find yourself needed to hear a little more. For example, when I am seated on the plane I have ANC on, but if I go to the bathroom I will change to normal which will reduce the noice but allow me to hear more clearly in case someone like the stewards need to pass by. The Sony headset does not have that feature, in order to know what setting you‚Äôre in you need to have your device or memorize how many times you hit the settings button.Sound - The Sony headset sounds better with no ambient noise. Unfortunately do to it‚Äôs poor ANC you have go turn the volume up in order to hear clearly. When I am on the plane the idea is to reduce ambient noise. Planes or known for being loud and causing hearing damage when exposed for long periods of time. In the case of the Sony headphones I have to turn them up significantly louder in order to hear. Defeating the purpose I bought them for (reducing noise to hear better).Finally Sony‚Äôs app leaves much to be desired. You have the option to change your mode: normal, transparent, ANC. And that‚Äôs about it. They have some software that is supposed to adjust noise based on your ear and boost base but they seemed more of a gimmick then a feature. Sony does not allow you to adjust any of the settings for how strong the ANC is or what frequencies get passed through in transparent mode. On the Soundcore App, you can adjust how strong the ANC is 1-5. For transparent or Normal mode you can adjust frequencies responses. What this does is allows you to customize the filters. In my case I filtered out low frequencies on the plane. I don‚Äôt want to hear the rumble of the engines. This allows the high pass frequency to be passed through such as voices.Sony has good Noise Cancelling headphones at the high end. Unfortunately this mid-high-end ($160) is not one of them. There are better options for less money. I compared to the Q45‚Äôs as they are the most comparable in terms of price I have tried and are currently my go-to during my travel. These feel and perform like sub $100 headphones not $160."
"The sound quality is just fine, especially for the price, and the build quality seems adequate, but the quality-of-life features are so lacking that I can't in good conscience give this anything more than a 2.The unit uses a ""hold to do X"" way of doing things: hold the button down to power it on; hold the button down to power it off, etc. My last pair, a Bose, instead used an actual switch for this, which made it a lot quicker to power on/off, and made it a lot easier to discern if the unit was still powered on at a glance.There is only one LED indicator light, which is typical for newer products that eschew multiple lights indicating different statuses. Once the unit is on and connected, the LED blinks blue a few times to indicate the connection is established, and then the light turns off altogether. This means that you can't visually figure out if the bluetooth is connected or not. You have to press the power/connectivity button, which will prompt the AI voice to indicate battery status.Speaking of the AI voice, my old Bose, when the connect button was pressed, would indicate battery life as this Sony does. But if you held the button, it would indicate what device it was connected to. The AI voice on the Sony does not do this, because when you hold down the power/connectivity button...it powers the unit off entirely."
"The headphone sound fine. They‚Äôre comfortable, no syncing issues, and the Sony app works well. But the microphone sounds awful, and I was unable to use it for phone calls, because no one could understand me.The headphones are good as long as you don‚Äôt plan on making phone calls with them."
"On the phone, these sound great. The app is good, the enhancements in the app are nice, everything is great.On a computer, this has to be one of the worst headsets I have ever used. I have tried them on 3 different computers and get nothing but poor performance. My windows 10 laptop refuses to use the a2dp driver and will only connect to them as a bluetooth headset, which means the audio is low bitrate mono which sounds like absolute trash. The mono audio is a limitation of bluetooth with microphone, not with the headset itself. The fact that the headset won't connect with the right driver is a compatibility issue between the headset and the pc. If you were planning on using this as a true headset with mic though, you will have terrible audio. Forget gaming and chatting with it.My windows 11 desktop connects to it using the proper a2dp driver, but it still sounds worse than on the cellphone. The audio is very flat and muted, which is a huge disappointment due to the price of the headset. Even worse than that though, the phone quality shows the hardware is capable, but its hampered by some sort of software issue . I played with the sound settings to enable virtual surround, bass boost, etc. and nothing makes it sound as good as it does on the phone.Since it supports connecting to multiple clients, I tested it by opening spotify on both the PC and the phone, checked that the quality and eq settings in spotify matched, then swapped playback devices back and forth via spotify. The headset did remain connected to both devices and switch between them seamlessly. The noise cancelling also seems to be working well. Its not the best noise cancelling I have seen, but it seems right for the price point. The fact that it does these other things well only increases frustration for me though, because its clearly built well enough, it just has some kind of software problem getting in the way."
Lightweight base model that might be good for the gym.  Layers of programmable sound settings for the patient and experienced user.  Was expecting Q45 quality.
"UPDATE:  After a month the padding on the ear pads has compressed. I now feel the speaker within the earpad touching my ear.  This causes me not to be able to wear them for more than 30 min.  Which is really unfortunate.ORIGINAL:  So for context I bought these for these functions:  Wireless, Bluetooth, with noise cancelling and a microphone.I wasn‚Äôt impressed that there wasn‚Äôt a carry case for the headphones, or at least a leather bag.  But it wasn‚Äôt surprise.It took my several times to get them to detect via Bluetooth on my laptop.The headphones are supposed to be able to pair to two devices, this is not the case.  At least for me, I could pair to my Windows laptop, but it wouldn‚Äôt pair on my iPhone; even with the software installed.I am fairly impressed with the sound quality.The noise cancelling feature is good.  It blocks out a lot more noise than I expected.  They are not sound proof though.  For context I took them on a flight and it blocked out all of the airplane noise; it muffled voices but does not mute them out.Voice clarity is good during MS Teams calls.They are very lightweight and don‚Äôt clamp on my head like other headphones did (Soundcore) and I also wear glasses. But they also feel kind of cheap.  I worry about their durability.I‚Äôve already noticed them getting scuffed from light usageThe ear muffs themselves could be larger;  I felt them pressing on my ear lobesMy other issue is that the ear muff get warm!  So I have concerns for wearing them for extended periods of time.  After an hour long call I felt relieved to take them off.So I‚Äôm conflicted here, for $150 ($128) as I write this review, they feel more like a $80 pair of headphones.  But based on so many knock off brands in the sun $100 category, it‚Äôs really difficult to find a wireless, Bluetooth headset with noise cancelling and a microphone.  That‚Äôs what I need for my job."
"The good and bad point of these headphones are that they're cheap. The build feels very cheap because it is. The sound quality is ok, and the noise cancelling is fine, but it's not very comfortable and it won't last long.The padding is soft and the cup is almost deep enough for me, but there is a hard plastic piece in the middle of the headphone for some reason. The padding on the top of the head is thin and you will feel the plastic band pressing in.It also breaks very fast. The part where the headphone connects to the headband (which is the part that always breaks on these things) is very poorly made. Usually cheap headphones last me a year before that part breaks, but these lasted less than four months. Also their warranty doesn't cover physical damage, only things that you would almost never have problems with before the plastic hinge breaks, so be sure to buy the product support plan Amazon sells with it because Sony's warranty for headphones is worthless."
Sound leaks If you play medium - high volume. Could hear it perfectly clear after removing them. Decent but it‚Äôs kinda annoying
"These headphones were sold as ""new""  and I purchased a warranty to go with my ""new"" device.  However, when I set them up, they were already customized and shown with someone else's name.They're in great shape and work well. But they were not sold as ""used""."
If you put this on your ears for about 40 minutes then you start swallowing in your ears
"From the short time I listened to them through my phone, the sound was very good - a big upgrade from my previous CH-710's. But they simply are not compatible with Samsung TV's. Its a known issue that is likely Samsungs fault, but odd they'd sell a product without clearly stating what has been a frustrating and known issue for about 2 yrs now."
I bought these cause they connect to my pc but they sound terrible like they sound like a junky car stereo no bass or anything special but they do have a off and on noise cancellation which works very well I guess that‚Äôs what your paying for
"Item was noise cancelling, br comfort was sub-par.  A screw was poking in my head the entire time using and just not quality workmanship for the price... had to return and that was easy, so grateful for no hassle"
Noise cancellation doesn‚Äôt work properly
"They‚Äôre nice and simple. However, people will definitely hear everything that you‚Äôre listening to if it‚Äôs not set to a lower volume. The size is also a bit looser so if you have a smaller head they might not be as tight as you‚Äôd like. Personally I think I have an average sized head but the slightest angle, like when you‚Äôre at the leg press, they will sadly fall. The sound is good and they work well for the price though."
"Before I start this, I should note that I am used to much more expensive headphones, so maybe my expectations were too high. But overall: the sound quality is good and the battery life is great. I've been using these every day at work and they can go all week on a single charge. However, they sometimes just disconnect from my laptop for no reason. Very awkward when you're listening to metal in the middle of a quiet office and suddenly, the sound is coming from your computer speakers instead of your headphones. I've also had trouble on virtual meetings for the same reason.Also, it's super frustrating that you can only connect to one device at a time. So, if I want to take a break from work and watch some reels on my phone, I have to switch the connection before I can do that and then switch it back. My pricier headphones automatically switch between devices, which is super convenient.If you're not asking too much, I'd say these are worth the cost. But for me, I don't think I'd buy them again."
"Sound quality is good, but for how expensive these are, they fall apart. This is my second pair and they have both turned white on the ear cushions. I have only used this pair for a week."
"I didn‚Äôt like that they seemed flimsy plastic, not the sound quality I was expecting but at the price I paid for them can‚Äôt really too much.Didn‚Äôt like the noise cancelling quality and hated the Japanese voice that came thro when turning on/off, not sure why that was necessary and found it annoying.I got these for long haul air travel - won‚Äôt use again.I would advise spending a bit more and getting better quality"
"Headphones worked well. Good sound and great noise cancelling for the price. However, the left ear cup completely snapped off and the plastic actually broke less than 1 year with light to medium use. I never abuse my headphones and take great care of them. This does look like a weak spot in the design. I reached out to Sony and they actually said ""Unfortunately, the physical damage is not covered by warranty as it is not considered a defect. This model would not be economical for repair due to part costs and labor combined."" So even their warranty will not cover this. I guess I'm out $100 on these. I wish they would've held up because I really did like them. However, I will be looking at other brands in this price range now."
"There fine headphones, but just spend the extra to get the better model. If you want them for a casual setting then they are great, but for working out they are too quiet for me."
"If you're looking for a pair of bluetooth headphones to listen to music with or take phone calls while you're not listening to music, these are fine! No complaints! But if you plan to use them for phone calls AND music simultaneously, for zoom or discord, or if you just want to use them as headphones and have a better quality mic for your input - pick different ones. Unfortunately my planned primary use for headphones was to plug into my Blue Yeti mic, and these headphones have a feedback feature that you cannot disable, leading to me hearing a constant split-second delayed echo as both the headphones AND my mic give their individual feedback. Alright, so maybe I could bring them to work and use them there - no dice. For some reason, they immediately mute my music as soon as I join a call."
These sounded great just long enough for me to toss the packaging out. I was assuming they would still be great‚Ä¶ these headphones make an annoying crackling sound when I use them. I‚Äôve tried them on two devices and both come across with a crackle. I‚Äôm sitting right next to the device too. Also they are hot on the ears so if you are sweaty that‚Äôs probably not gonna be great.
"These WH-CH720n are a great upgrade from the previous 710n, better build, sound, and hearing modes(App lets you tune to your licking and adjust more for the headphones), these headphones have the V1 chip(Same as on the xm5 flagship)but the noise cancellation is not near as good as of the xm5, but these are entry level, so ill cut them some slack, but in this category there are better sounding and performing options( Soundcore, Skullcandy, ect.)At retail:$148, ill passOn sale between $98-128: ill consider them and they are decent for the price:)Final verdict: If you are targeting these for noise cancelling, they are ok, good at blocking out lower rumbles but seem to bring in more higher noises. Ambient mode lets in a good amount of noise without sounding robotic or artificial.Sound quality is subjective for everyone, out the box with no adjustments, they sound clean, calm on the bass and forward on the mids and highs. Good thing these have an app!, so you can adjust all settings to your preferences. Noise cancellation/ ambient mode does affect the eq on these headphones and lead to some distortion at high volumes.Battery life is solid!, if any pair of headphones gets through a week of moderate use, they are an instant winner!"
"I‚Äôm really really disappointed. I truly wanted these and chose these over JBL and the Beats! I wish I listened to my friends and chose the Beats for $20 more. They are very light weight and almost feel like they are cheap quality. I was shocked, especially coming from Sony. The Bluetooth connected easily I must say! The noise cancellation is good but not the best. I was cleaning and had the volume all the way up and could still hear a tad of noise from those around me. Very disappointed. I don‚Äôt see how they would be worth $150. I paid on prime day, $88. To me, not worth it."
"I was replacing a Cowin E7 headset.Sound quality is good but battery life wasn‚Äôt.They feel cheap.Power was a button and not a slider switch, which I don‚Äôt like.If they were $50 max new they might be a good deal."
"I liked these Sony model WH-CH720N headphones, but the sound cancelling function cut in and out since the day they arrived.  I just didn't notice it until I mowed the lawn.When the sound cancelling feature worked, it worked as well as my more expensive Bose headphones, which I love, but wore out after 3 years of heavy use.I have been looking for headphones to replace my Bose.  The Bose were not worth the cost, the Sony malfunctioned, and a pair of Anker Soundcore I purchased wouldn't take a charge after about two weeks.The Sony headphones were light, comfortable, sounded fine, and the noise cancelling was very good when it worked.I'll keep hunting.  Beats maybe.As an aside, I love my Sony earbuds, and really miss my Bose headphones!"
"overall i am happy with this headphone as i was interested in it for travel for the noise canceling stuff for airlines. i had hoped it would be better but its adequate as its capabilities are similar to another set i have from a different manufacture that is cheaper and comes with all the adapters and case etc... thsis set only comes a short usb charging cable and a audio jack cable,  overall its a solid 3 for audio and all that stuff"
"I was kind of disappointed that they don‚Äôt just pair to an iPhone. You have to download an app and use them that way. Nothing wrong with the sound or quality, just kind of annoying extra step to have to use an app. We sent them back and got something else."
Arrived with a buzzing sound present in one ear at all times. Returned for a new one
"My son said it works well. The sound was great for the first two days, then he said it started coming in and out."
"These headphones are very light and ergonomics are good, however where they falter is in sound quality. The sound is very muffled but you get really good bass.  I use them to watch movies with and that‚Äôs about it."
"Paid extra for Sony brand. These aren't super competitive at the $100 pricepoint. I got them used on Amazon for around $75, still overpriced. Not much better than my $35 Soundcores. These look decent and they are lightweight but it's not what I'd call a high quality headphone."
"Noise cancellation and sound quality are ok, but not as good as a previous pair of Sony headphones. The main beef is that if you use the Sony headphone app to have access to EQ etc they will disconnect every 30 seconds or so from BT. Uninstall the app and they stay connected. So you can have access to EQ or you can listen to music, but not both as far as I can tell. Pixel 8."
The sound quality on this headphones is really great. It is tru noise cancellation. Has ability to do multiple bluetooth connections at the same time although the configuration to achieve that is very tricky and needs to be done using a mobile app which is not very user friendly.Does not come with a carry case and needs to be handled very carefully when putting it in laptop bag.Overall I think value for money product.
The headphones work fine. The noise cancellation could be better. I find that I prefer wearing my AirPods instead. The comfortability is okay for about an hour but my head gets tired after that.If you have an Apple device it doesn‚Äôt connect as well as the Apple or Beats headphones.
"Buy other if you want noise canceling. Also, it sometime loses conection."
"This is not one of the the many 5 star reviews I've seen ""Best headphones I've ever used even though I can't use them for calls because the mic barely works!"" (there are plenty of them).Poor microphone/call quality: This is mentioned in reviews here, and on other sites. There is supposedly a setting in the Sony app that fixes the issue, but the option isn't present for me. Anyways, prepare for nearly everyone you call or conference with to mention they can't hear what you're saying, forcing you to switch to handset.I stopped trying to use these for calls after the first couple weeks. I've had many headphones and headsets, and even the $25 cheapo buds have better call quality than these.Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is average, ok, nothing special: These block noticeably less noise than my Shure Aonic 50 and Plantronics Voyager 8200. Yes, those cost roughly 3  x as much, but these are newer by several years so I leave this in.Sound quality is decent, passable, average: I'm not an audiophile, but I've had many audio devices over the years. These are nothing special or terrible, just average. I listen to mostly podcasts and voice. The  Sony app has EQ adjustment.Build quality: They are all plastic, but they don't feel especially flimsy and ready to break. Build quality seems decent, but don't expect lots of metal. This is not a con to me given the price point.TL;DR:-Average headphones in all areas except call quality/mic, which gets a 0.-If making calls or doing conferencing/voice is important to you, then you should run away.-If top-notch Active Noise Cancellation is critically important to you, then you might want to spend more money on something higher end. If you just want DECENT ANC, then these will work for you."
not in love with them due to them not being 100% noise cancellation but i guess you get what you paid for.
They came with the most inscrutable instructions I have seen in 40 years. Even with tech support I never got any indication that they work
"These are quite possibly the worst noise canceling headphones I have ever used, but they might be aok for you.Some context: for years, I used some Sony WH-1000 headphones after comparing those to the famouse Bose noise canceling headphones. And I loved them. When you put them on your ears and turned them on, it tuned out all the surrounding noise. I could be on an airplane, turn them on, and you felt like you were alone in a quiet room without even a fan blowing. They were so incredible at noise canceling, that when you turned them on, it almost felt like the airpressure around you changed.And then one day, at the aiport in Houston, someone lifted them off my backback as I was working my way through the crowd.So for a couple months I looked to find a deal on the pair I lost, but instead this pair came up. With 4.5 stars, it sounded like a great deal.This week I tried them out on a trip from Houston to Boston - and I guess if you have never had the experience of good noise canceling, they are probably fine. But having experienced the WH-1000 line‚Ä¶well, these are pretty terrible.The sound quality is fine, probably better than most. Compared to my ipod pros, the sound quliaty is better.It is the noise canceling that is just basically non-existent. My ipod pros cancel more noise.It‚Äôs like Sony just said, ok, if we seal up their ears enough, we could count that as noise canceling on this model.Nope.If you are looking for decent sound at this price point, and don‚Äôt care about blocking out the noise around you, these are probably fine. If you are truly looking to block out the sound around you, pass these up and spend the extra to get a product that will actually do the job."
"The noise canceling is okay, the audio is okay. But they are really uncomfortable will have to return these."
"I like the clear sound and it connects quickly. I didn‚Äôt like how loose they are, so when I looked down it moved around they fell off. Which isn‚Äôt helpful at the gym. Returning"
"use everyday and it's easy to set up, doesn't work with my chromebook or anything. be careful because it broke easily and had to replace it. battery life is good! and plays music fluently."
"So -  i purchased this unit and 2 others heaphones in the same price range to replace a pair that broke and this one impresses least of the three - and this one is definitely going back as it's the poorest fit of the 3 for me, the sound quality is ok but the lack of LDAC support is not helping me to keep it either. About those ear cups - the material isn't dense enough nor form fitting for me, could be just me or my hairstyle (crew cut) but it's just not holding onto my head well so the noise cancelling just doesn't shine in my home office environment, and the noise cancelling is just average, not bad but not great. Maybe if you really like Sony this is good enough, but for me, they were sub-par and I'm returning it as i can't get hi-quality Bluetooth audio and it just doesn't feel like a quality product overall.Overall not good value to me.YMMV, my 2 cents."
"ALL BUTTONS are impossible to see and very difficult to find.  WTF is Sony thinking?  Obviously they don't give a rip for their users.  The headphones are comfortable and the sound is great but by hiding all controls, I cuss Sony every time I put them on (which is daily).  They certainly aren't Apple."
I only wish that I could turn these 'off' as easily as I can change them from noise cancelling to not-noise cancelling.
"My husband order a pair of these and a pair of beats. The quality was OK, but nothing compared to the beats."
"The feel on the head and ears is very comfortable. The Bluetooth connection is good. The sound quality is good for this price range. However, noise cancellation is much less than I expected. I need to raise the volume in the subway cars a lot to hear the quiet part of the music. Cutting lower frequencies needs to be improved. I plan to use these on airplanes soon and see how they perform."
"I wanted to love these as I‚Äôve been a Sony user since I was a teenager. Unfortunately, the quality of all SONY products have gone down dramatically. The faux leather is fading and cracking after only 6 months of light use (I‚Äôm not a gamer, I‚Äôm just listening to music and taking calls 4x per week at home! I'm far from being a ‚Äúheavy‚Äù user). The most flawed parts are the Bluetooth and microphone and its connectivity: it is soooo bad! No matter if you‚Äôre in your own WiFi: the conection is intermittent at best. 100% of the people on the other side of the calls have a hard time understanding what I‚Äôm saying while I‚Äôm using these headphones: that means every call, and I repeat, in every call the mic/Bluetooth have failed to deliver. I thought maybe my set was defective, but after checking with other users, this is just the reality of this product. I would not buy these if I would‚Äôve known.I do not recommend this product."
"I don't know why bluetooth headphones are popular, unless you really like walking around without a cable. The delay is absolutely unacceptable. Think lips move visibly before you hear speech. It's jarring and not something anyone should just accept. I know it's the technology, not just these headphones, but this shouldn't even be sold without a HUGE disclaimer that delay is normal.Sell good products, not crap. Bluetooth headphones seem good only for music, wireless if needed, and phone conversations. But absolutely not for watching or gaming.But the thing that bothered me the most is that if the cable is attached, the volume controls on the headphones have no effect. That means on a pc the only way to control volume is with the pc, not the headphones. That's cheap, stupid, and also unacceptable. Stop making low quality.The volume controls are also poorly designed. Best would be a knob, instead it's a + and - sign with a play/pause button between, which means the finger tips have to decipher which button it's on, basically you'll more often than you'd like click the middle button. Also, it's clunky to click buttons, and with the two controls being easily confused too, it is much faster and easier to adjust a knob than buttons to correct any mistake of direction."
"I bought this less than a year ago in July 2023 to replace an older pair of Sonophone Bluetooth headphones that had broken. Those lasted several years before wear-and-tear got to them. These, however, cracked a few days ago when I was removing them from my head. Within a few days the fracture had gone completely through and the right headphone was dangling from the wiring, rendering the headphones totally unusable. I contacted Sony and was informed the 1-year warranty does not cover physical damage. They directed me to an authorized third party service center (United Radio in New York) who informed me they couldn't repair this item and to contact Sony for an exchange. Sony refused so I'm going to be trashing this item.The headphones worked fine. I was never super impressed with the noise cancelling but it was sufficient for the price point. The sound quality was good and no one ever complained about how well they could hear me on phone calls. I liked that the headphones paired to multiple devices which allowed me to toggle between work and personal quickly. However, I wouldn't recommend me these given how apparently easy they are to break and how unwilling Sony was to offer assistance. Maybe these would be better for casual use but for daily use look elsewhere."
"Flawlessly connected to my Android. At work and home, both Bluetooth settings doesn't show the device for iMac (ios ventura) and PC (W11). Used the cord before I returned the headphones. It does good for dampening coworkers talking in the office to help focuse, sound quality is good. For the price it's great deal but Bluetooth connectivity to my computers is priority."
"I loved these headphones and used them daily for work . . . for about three months. Over the last few weeks, they have rapidly refused to hold a charge, and now will not charge at all. I generally left them charging when not in use, as modern batteries prefer. Very disappointing from a Sony product.Not a one-star because when they were actually functional, they were light, comfortable, and provided excellent sound quality."
"I purchased these for work. I'm aloud to walk around with headphones. I already own AirPod pros but i wanted a more comfortable option.Here's what I  liked about these headphones.* These are so comfortable! You can barely feel them on your head ,even after hours of wear.* The sound is rich and full . The bass wasn't booming but tuned perfectly. I loved the way these sounded.Here is what I hated about these and led to my almost instant return of them .* The noise cancellation is almost non existent! I literally could not tell the difference between it being on or off.I went so far as having two different people try the headphones and I asked each about the noise cancellation. One said he could tell when the noise cancellation was activated but he felt it was minimal at best. The other person like me felt there was almost no noise reduction  at all. Both friends said the headphones sounded great otherwise.I ended up returning them, I could not justify keeping them as effective noise cancellation is a feature I need!Just want to note they're not super loud , either."
The sound was ok. But didn't like the headset it looks cheap plastic on head when your wear it.  3/5 for sound. I would just try other brands for same price.
"These headphones sound great, but even if you listen at a moderate volume, whatever you're listening to can be heard by everyone around you. The noise canceling is okay but nothing special. These are sort of disappointing for the price."
"I recently bought these headphones for myself. I did a lot of research on if they were worth it and good quality and decided to purchase. Now when I use them, the sound is good and I can listen to music but when I get a phone call or I am on zoom, the other person can't hear me. The microphone is very muffled and the people I speak to can''t hear me at all. I am not sure if this is just a bad pair or if this happens to everyone. Overall, good headphones I just wish the microphone worked because now I can't use them for zooms and phone calls."
"Absolutely disappointed in this purchase. I've had dozens of NC bluetooth headphones, and these are the most expensive ones. I had high hopes. They do not have a snug fit at all, and the earwells are not deep enough. Overall uncomfortable compared to every other pair I have owned, partly due to insufficient padding around the ear. The NC is severely lacking, and only suppresses low-frequency noise (and it's doesn't do a great job either). All high-frequency noise (like fans, rain on a roof) pass through. The material is very lightweight cheap plastic, honestly I do not expect them to survive more than 2-3 months (I use NC headphones daily for work). Only redeeming quality is that you can use the 3.5mm jack without turning the NC off. You're paying $10 for lacking NC and poor quality, and $130 for the ""Sony"" sticker."
"Second set for teen, they break easily at the pivot point!"
"Sounds pretty good, feels very light but cheap. A decent amount of pressure for someone who has a slight bigger than average face/head. That might be nice for some people, I absolutely hate it. And lastly, how is this noise cancelling. I can hear things very well, im not expecting complete sound isolation, of course, but this is noise cancelling?"
"These head phone speakers will NOT as described play music from Alexa app as a source of sound.  The headphones Will control the alexa app via the headphones micro-phone, but the headphones are not Fully Alexa compatible. Comfortable, ear cup nice and large.  Also quite difficult to connect two devices simultaneously.  Did not connect well with my Samsung TV and had to drop all connections successfully pair it to Alexa.  It will turn itself off quite quickly if it is not blue tooth paired, and defaults to that quick turn off."
"Fit is fine and they work great for watching movies and such on airplanes, however they don't actually ""cancel"" much background noise."
not too good for working outdoors where a lot of noise noise canceling not the best
"What the title is only had these for four months and these are already broken. The sound quality is fantastic, it's charge lasts forever, but I can only give this 3 stars because for the last 2 months, it's been having serious connection issues. And now, it won't connect anymore at all. To any device. It gets a 1 star for Longevity."
"I expected more from Sony for the price. Sound quality is pretty good and noise cancelling is effective, but only when you can connect! Which is too often not the case.Giving one star because 1. the headphones constantly disconnect from other devices at random, 2. microphone literally does not work for Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc., and 3. the technical support from Sony has been terrible. It‚Äôs 2024, they should have this figured out. I tried to get some technical support, but it's an onerous customer service process. I had to share multiple documents to simply confirm I purchased the item and was eligible for customer service. The customer service staff kept requesting more documentation to the point where I gave up. Shouldn't providing my Amazon order # be enough?I‚Äôve learned this mic syncing issue is common for Sony headphones. A friend bought the same ones and is having the same issues. Integration between devices (eg, connected to phone and computer at same time) is essentially not doable. Across all metrics except noise cancellation my beat-up 6 year old Sennheisers perform better.As someone who loves headphones I‚Äôm very, very disappointed with this purchase. Last time I‚Äôll be buying a Sony product, both due to poor product quality and terrible customer service. Wish I could refund them."
"Sounds good, light and comfortable, but I can't tell when noise canceling function is on and ambient sound settings are confusing even with the app. Can always hear noise when using these, unless volume of music is loud enough, which is kind of what all headphones do right?"
"I had doubts about these headphones when they arrived back in July 2023, i should have returned them. But I put those doubts aside and decided to keep them and see how they were. The sound quality is better than other headphones I've used but I've never bought any at this price before so that's not saying much. I've never had noise canceling before, but these seem to be okay for the most part. The bluetooth latency is noticeable on video watching. The problem is comfort and build quality. The ear pads are not good. You can often feel the speaker touching your ear. My ears become sore after periods of wear time. I've had these now for 6 months and as my picture shows these are now broken and Sony does not cover this under their warranty. This is from normal wear. They never leave my desk when not on my head. I have never traveled with them. They are poorly made with cheap plastic materials. In my opinion this is caused by stress on the parts simply by putting the headphones on and taking them off. They are very tight on your head but not so tight your head is pinched. You can not buy replacement parts for these as I have searched. I will not be repurchasing any Sony headphones as I've now seen this same exact complaint with many different models and their lack of backing up their product. They come with a 1 year limited warranty but Sony denies this as flaw in their materials and design. Investigating a repair cost and it could be nearly as much as the headphones cost me (i got them on a prime day sale)."
"I love the lightweight-ness of these headphones, and the sound is pretty good, too.  Unfortunately, I cannot use these with Apple/Mac products, as they don‚Äôt work for Siri, and have Bluetooth pairing problems.  They also try to re-pair with whatever device you pair them to first, even if you disconnect Bluetooth, and try to pair with a different device, which is annoying.  You have to keep on unpairing them and at the same time quickly pair them with a different device.Needs to be updated to have these issues fixed‚Ä¶.until then, sadly, I will need to return them‚Ä¶."
"Packaging was off, no case, very short charging cord, Andy the Headphones were wrapped in white shop paper towels. Very sketchy looking.My friend bought these same headphones from a brick and mortar store and they were packaged much nicer and had a case and weren‚Äôt wrapped in white shop paper towels.I just hope they work and last.Buyer beware."
"They are good but they definitely not for me,I‚Äôm a bass head so I need a lot of bass to enjoy my musicThey also have crazy sound leakage also"
Returning these for the fact that the noise cancellation is crap. It only reduces the noise. There‚Äôs also feedback coming from the right ear piece. Spend more money and get Bose instead
"One of the ear cups is loose (as seen in the image I've provided). I understand that I bought these used. But, I don't recall them being in ""Acceptable"" condition. So, why was I sold headphones like this? This is incredibly disappointing. Evidently, a product being in Very Good or Good condition just means that you can pass off anything as such. Am I expected to get some super glue and fix it? The noise cancelling is great. I wish I could enjoy it more, but one of the ear cups is loose for the reason I stated.Edit: I can't even fix these things because literally no glue will stick to it. I probably should have just returned them, but too late now. I won't ever purchase refurbished or used headphones from here ever again. Lesson learned."
Very frustrating case where my phone and laptop never discovered this headphones even tho it sounded rlly good. Cannot get the wireless to work at all.
"Gently used for 4 months.  Now the battery will not charge and keeps saying ""battery empty.""  There is not a good fix for it.  Not impressed."
"Bought it on the prime day's deal:Pros:1. Super light, much lighter than other over ear headphones.2. Sound quality is good. And you could adjust EQ thru Sony mobile app3. Connection is OK. I did not experience any disconnection during my 3 weeks' use with my iPhone.Cons:1. Bumps in both ear cups, depending on your head shape the bump might touch your ear. It would get quite uncomfortable when listening for over 2 hours2. Not foldable. So it is hard to fit it in a small bag3. The white headphone is not white. It is light grey4. No cases included, the headphone is wrapped with toilet paper like stuff in the box5. Physical buttons. But there are so many of them and it is hard to tell which one is doing whatMostly due to 1) I returned the headphone."
"These had a frequent very loud click or pop that was intolerable. When no sound source was playing (just running noise cancelling) it was nearly constant and when sound was playing it was less frequent but still occasional; this makes them unusable for me. The sound quality other than that seemed decent, and they were mostly comfortable. The sound cancelling was noticeable but I was hoping for something a bit more I guess. These are the first noise cancelling headphones I‚Äôve tried so I don‚Äôt have much to compare them to, maybe they‚Äôre par for the course at this price point. But the clicking was really awful so I‚Äôm returning these.  Maybe I just got a defective pair but it didn‚Äôt leave me impressed with Sony."
I travel for a living and needed these for use for phone calls in higher noise environments. The mic picks up too much ambient noise. Additionally they have the ability to fold flat but don‚Äôt come with a case‚Ä¶why?  Also they could fold more compact but as it is the third party case that suits them is bulky and takes up a lot of space in my backpack.
I have the volume at max and these just don‚Äôt have the loud sound I like.  Perhaps I have become slightly deaf? ( from listening to music on headphones at max).  I don‚Äôt think so since my son‚Äôs headphones (Beats) give out the loudest sounds  such that I have to turn it down.
I have the Sony WH-700N and have had no problems connecting to my Samsung TV.  But this product won't connect.  It will start to connect and then disconnect.  It was Ok on the airplane but I don't travel much and like to use it at home.  I had hoped the software update might fix the problem but it didn't.  I won't buy another Sony headset again and I have used many Sony products in the past.
"These headphones are Sony and sound fantastic, but like a lot of experiences I‚Äôve had with your more expensive or name brand products purchased via Amazon usually are much cheaper but end up having some type of defect or issues, and rather quickly. Everything was perfect for a week until they started cutting out every once in awhile, than few times a day then before 2 weeks they were basically cutting out nonstop."
"The quality sound resolution is not the best, noise cancellation is just ok"
I think it is overrated based on reviews and price.
"If these headphones were more reliable, I'd be a big fan of the form factor, battery life, and decent sound quality. The problem is the first headset I ordered arrived with with a short in the in the button circuitry. This caused the buttons I pressed to either do something random or cause a loud hiss in the right speaker. I ordered a replacement figuring it was a normal manufacturing defect. The replacement worked fine for about a month and a half. Now the right speaker is blown out and the noise reduction no longer works in that ear. It's outside of Amazon's return window. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined."
I loved these headphones except the pairing would crash every time I turned off the headphones.  It would take 20 mins to get the pairing to work with my Sansung TV.  I returned these and ordered the older version which didn't have problems with pairing.  I'm so disappointed because I really liked the light weight and sound.
"Tbh my largest complaint is the frequency with which these things cut out. Regardless of what device I'm connected to, the Bluetooth connectivity seems spotty at best.I honestly like everything else about these headphones, but sound quality and connectivity are THE most important aspects of headphones like this and I'd say your money is better spent elsewhere."
Headphones performed as expected - connected with my Apple devices - took some effort since instructions were not detailed enough.  Cannot get it to connect with my PC - Bluetooth signal not seen by my computer.  Will continue to try to connect with my computer and will update this review if and when I do.  Overall sound is OK.
"Let‚Äôs start with the big things people will generally look for in Bluetooth headphones: sound quality, battery life, ease of use, and comfort.The sound quality is somewhat okay. I‚Äôd exclusively used Behringers for a few years, and since my latest pair had been put through the wringer over the past year or so thanks to small kids and inclement weather, I figured it was time to try something new. The incoming sound quality is a little better than passable, and the built-in EQ is an interesting little feature, but really just seems to boost or cut treble and miss without having a notable bass boost. As for the mic, I was sorely disappointed; with the orientation of it, it picks up background noise better than it picks up my voice, so if you‚Äôre getting these for calls or recording voice clips, you may want to look at other options.Battery life is where this product earned some points. I constantly listen to music, like an average of 17 hours a day, and these can stand up to five days of that before needing a charge (I haven‚Äôt let them run all the way down, but after day three of showing at about 10% from dawn to dusk, I figured it was time to juice them back up).As for ease of use, there are four functions I consider essential to Bluetooth headphones‚Äô controls‚Äô usefulness: power on/off, pause/play, volume up/down, and track skip/back. The power on/off is simple enough. One button that feels like it would do that and does, though the automated voice announcing it sounds like an irritated, middle-aged waitress ten hours into an eight-hour shift. Think Lily from Duolingo, but all grown up and desperate for a cigarette break. The same button does pause/play (long press for power, short press for media control), which is pretty standard, though I could do without the harsh, shrill beep in my ears every time I press the button. These lost some points for sure with the volume and forward/back functions, because every other Bluetooth device I‚Äôve had that had these functions controlled by onboard buttons has controlled volume with short presses and skipping with long presses, but these are backward, so a little bump could skip or restart a song, and deliberately adjusting the volume can cause it to make massive jumps rather than going up or down incrementally. Consequently, I just control these functions from my phone and pretty much only ever touch the power/play/pause button. Beyond this, one neat feature my other headphones had that these don‚Äôt is the ability to use them while charging, so while being unable to use them during that process is standard, it‚Äôs still pretty irritating.As far as comfort, I frankly had to sacrifice a bit in this area to justify spending the money on them since the alternative would be to send them back and potentially end up spending more to do so than I would have gotten in a refund. The ear surrounds are abnormally small, so much so that my choices are to fold my earlobes and stuff them inside, rendering myself effectively deaf to all sounds in my vicinity, or constantly readjust where they‚Äôre sitting on my head so they continue to do so.All this being said, a big driving factor in my choosing to take a chance on these was price. That‚Äôs where the third star comes in, the first two for the battery life. They are very affordable, and I tend to champion the quality of lower-end products, but this is one of those instances where I unfortunately got what I paid for: cheap. I may give them another month or so, since I‚Äôve only had them about a week, but unless they magically get better in the interim, I‚Äôm likely to go back to the slightly more expensive ones I know work and relegating these to being my backup option."
"They just arrived today, and they are not bad but they are not a keeper.Weight and feel:The first thing I noticed was the weight; they are light, but in a cheap, empty way, but for the price, I was hopeful. The plastic looks flimsy, but I don't know that they are, and I won't be keeping them, so who knows?Era cuff:I put them on, and they don't fit snugly to my ears, but admittedly, I have a small head. The next thing I noticed was the cuff around the ear is not rounded; it's cut in a squared-off way and the seam rubs the side of your face. I posted pictures of the seam. The padding on the ears is thick and squishy, in a good way.Headband:The band isn't too tight and doesn't squeeze my head. There's enough padding on the headband for a spare set, maybe not enough for all-day use, at least for me.Overall, they are fine for a backup set of headphones, and they are inexpensive, but my other pair of Beribes that just broke (Beribes WH305B) was better and just a couple of bucks more so I'm going to order them. I personally find the quality of these not worth it even for cheap headphones."
"The Beribe headset is a good low cost headset that seems to last about 1.5 years before falling apart.  In this case, the synthetic leather ear pads detached from the ear-cups because the thin plastic coating separated from the underlying fabric cushion.  This is the failing of all synthetic leathers that is not present in longer lasting natural leathers.  I have original ear pads on my DC headsets from 33 years ago.  It shows wear and some of the black coating is fading but still in very good shape.As for functionality, the design does a fairly good job of passively isolating the ambient sound and it is light enough to use while exercising.  The passive sound isolation is still not as good as what you find in the Bose QC 45 but then again, the QC 45 costs 17.5 times more than the Beribes.  The sound reproduction is great for your average listener.  The battery life is great.  Casual listeners will probably have to charge the headset once every two week.  My daughter who is almost always on the headset charges it once every six days or so.  There has been no dropped signals and she usually parks her iPhone in the kitchen while wandering a 3000 sqft house with no issues.Given the costs, Beribe presents an excellent value just expect to replace it in a year."
I got the pink Bluetooth headphones I like the headphones for the wireless battery life and the option to plug it into my computer. but when it comes to using the Built-in mic it came with people seem to have a hard time hearing me when I have to speak up I feel like I have to yell to get them to hear me. when it comes to quality I wish I would have just spent the money and bought more beat headphones when it comes to the built-in mic option people could hear me better and the side buttons were not as difficult as these I could push them to answer and not get my phone out every time since I am disabled having easy use headphones are important for me so I can be phone free. I will reinvest later one these just weren't for me like I wished they could have been. reason why there is three stars hope this helps.
Just keep in mind the size isn't big and the battery won't last you 65h maybe like 4 hours or 5 if consistently used at max volume lowest volume then maybe you get 65h but who listens to music at the lowest volume no one and it doesn't feel that durable but it should work for while it doesn't feel that uncomfortable so long use shouldn't feel bad. The only good part I can be on a phone call and listen to music at the same time at max volume and the mic won't pick up any of the noise so if u plan to talk to a friend they won't hear your music
"Got these in 2022 and I use them watching on smart TV and PC usage.  These headphones sound good and the cups are fairly deep which is comfortable, but for me that is all that is good about these.  They will not connect to my PC via bluetooth any more. When I connect to my smart Samsung TV, if I pause what ever I am watching it takes 10 to 20 sec before the sound comes back on when I press play.  I don't have this issue with other headphones. There is also a noticeable delay between action on screen and hearing the sound so not good for gaming.  I hear no delay when using the cord but you lose the mic because it is not a 4 pole connection.  The built in EQ does have noticeable differences but if you like one specific preset the headphones don't remember that and resets to the default after each powerup. For $20 dollars I am not expecting amazing things."
"Using this with my PC, it doesn't have the same issue of falling asleep after 10 seconds of no sound that I returned my EarFun Wave Pro headphones for.  It's also a lot cheaper.  Not as comfortable, but not too bad.  If I have it expanded to it doesn't give me headphone hair, it hugs under my ears pretty tight.Lowered one star because the volume buttons are unusable.  I was expecting to tap the button to get like a 5% volume change like my wired headphones did.  Tapping does absolutely nothing however no matter how many times I tap.  Holding them does nothing for 3 seconds as well, then quickly shoots through 50% difference in another 3 seconds.  I was tapping to raise the volume because it was too quiet and nothing happened after like 30 taps.  Finally I held down and nothing happened either for several seconds, then my eardrums about blew out after another second.  Really weird."
"They feel pretty cheap, but they're super lightweight and fit snug. For under $20 they sound ok, I got them for the gym because I'm tired of spending hundreds for a pair of gym headphones, if I was going to use these any place else but the gym I would be returning these. Like I said sound is ok for what I'm going to use them for, but they don't measure up to my Marshall II or Skullcandys. If you want a cheap throwaway pair buy these, if you want some hi fidelity sound these are not it. But again for under $30 when the other headphones I mentioned are $150-200 sort of can't be beat, I can buy a pair every 3 months and still spend less than the headphones I mentioned earlier."
I like these for the most part but things I don't like are that my hair gets caught in them. The most annoying thing is getting them to charge. For some reason and I have to plug it in then unplug then back in until it finally catches and charges.
"OK let me start by saying I bought these after comparing tons of others since my decent headphones broke after 6 months (Headband bent and was apparently made of plastic) I decided to go with mint green after ALOT of thought. They look whimsical kooky and fun and not my normal choice. Let me start by saying the fit is slimmer and less goofy in the headband area but still room for improvement in the sleek area like beats look. You won't get the sleek beats look. They seem small and i have a small head but they adjust. They aren't every comfortable somehow ...the volume up and down button seems to do nothing. I have to control the volume through whatever device it's paired to. Lastly the noise cancelling is NON-EXISTENT which is very disappointing. The sound is already not rich but it does not cancel noise at all, not even a button for it. I won't bother returning them but I am a bit disapointed and wouldn't buy these again. They are fine for my 12 yr old maybe but just not for me---I would just like to update that the volume up and down buttons change your songs meaning it you can use them to go up and down in your music playlist but doesn't seem to control the volume which makes zero sense, I use these for audiobooks not music so it will go up or down in CHAPTERS. So the volume buttons mess with my chapters which is definitely NOT what a reader wants but if you're listening to music you can skip up and down in your music playlist. I'm not sure if this is intended or if my pair is defective"
"They are fine if you want a budget headphone, but if you are expecting anything groundbreaking, don't. Sound quality is mid."
"I looked over the review info and bought one - my first ever blue tooth headphone (not earbuds either).  I fully charged it until the little red light changed to a steady solid green.Then i listened to a college basketball game from local radio station that streams on internet.Although the info about it claims it has 65 hours playtimeafter about 3 hours continuous use (4 the most), the little red light came on again meaning it needed recharging.I'm happy for those reviewers who said they got great battery life, but i didn't and I don't want only 3 hours (or even 4) of battery charge and then have to recharge. Id be okay with 8-10 hoursSo I returned it within 24 hours.Otherwise it seemed like a nice product.... it folded up some if desired,  the ear pads were comfortable, reception and connectivity seemed ok/ good.Other frustration - when i pressed to turn it off,  i couldnt really tell if it was off or not for sure.This was my first ever bluetooth device and with rechargeable batteries. I asked others who use earbuds and headphones.  Several said beats headphones were very good and also Apple air something or other but both cost a lot more than the $20 Beribes.... over $100 or more?So I probably shouldn't expect much for $20.I know TJ Maxx has a lot of cheap earbuds for about $15."
"I have a pretty normal sized head, and no amount of adjusting will make these conform to my head/ears. The bottom part of the ear part hangs loose. Hope you‚Äôre okay with everyone nearby hearing what you‚Äôre listening to! For $20, they‚Äôre fine, I guess. I would not spend more than $20 though. Sound isn‚Äôt great, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶about what you‚Äôd expect for $19.99. Headphones also are clunky about connecting and powering on/off."
"I bought these ear phones so I could watch tv with my wife and hear the sound at the same time as she does. The phones dont allow that. I have a amazon fire tv and that may be part of the problem. Either way I had to send them back. They may work for someone else, just not meClay Barrilleaux82 and slightly hard of hearing"
"Even though the feature list sounds grand, it feels and operates like a budget headphone. Noise cancellation is poor. I bought these to wear at the gym and it hardly blocks any noise. I hear the gym music loud and clear through the headphones. Additionally, the headset doesn‚Äôt really stay on for the whole workout, but it does the job to an extent."
A little clunky compared to my last pair but still ok
Works as they should. Goes a long time on a charge
The sound is good but the mic is awful.
I'd say these are middle- to low-road bluetooth headphones. I bought amazon basic headphones about the same time and liked them better than these. These are larger than I expected--larger than needed for function and comfort. They drop out occasionally and take 5-8 seconds to reconnect. This is annoying. I still use these but will not purchase again.
"The sound quality isn‚Äôt that great. No ANC. But it‚Äôs good for listening 3 hours online classes. If I compare to Anker SoundCore Q2 ($30), this one isn‚Äôt that better. The Stereo quality is like mono audio. Better add some extra $ and get a better one. The most I love is ‚Äúit‚Äôs lightweight‚Äù."
"With the adjustment on both sides all the way out, they just fit, but the spring is too tight and not adjustable.  The result is that I get a headache after a while wearing these.  My old Yamaha headphones I could wear for hours without a problem."
"I use these to mow and edging my lawn.  Volume is important that that feature is the only disappointment in these headphones.  Great feel and look, just lacks volume.The volume lever is why 3 stars and not 5."
"After (2) years of constant use (running on the treadmill), right side has ripped. Left side is showing signs as well. Sound is still working great, just wished it would have been more durable. Will use it until I can't anymore."
"I have a head circumference of about ~24"" and these headphones started feeling like they were squeezing my head after about 30 mins :(They are lightweight and sound quality is good for the price."
"I had MANY headphone in the past...wired, wireless... you  name it  I've had it!  Sadly they all couldn't hold a candle to these!!!...The best noise cancellation and the 6 EQ modes is perfect,  you can play your music or certain songs just the way you want. when i put them on....they completely drown out everything. The battier life is amazing...I can go for almost 2 days b4 I have to charge them. The only down side is the color.. the site has the bright  greenish teal color pair that I thought  I was getting .... But i got was a VERY muddy mute green color....Also I wish the came with a case or pouch to place them  for their protection.  That being said, I will  still  buy another pair soon...maybe the pink onesUPDATE: I let them charge  once I received them. 2/5 /24 is  when I used the fully ... so far I will not be buying  again  at lest not the green ones ... the sound wavers in and out  unlike the black ones I got in the past... I will be returning  these ASAP... DON'T GET  THE GREEN ONESUPDATE to the UPDATE:  I return  the green ones and bought the black ones..... Big  BIG difference (1) the package was more secure in a tightly seal amazon box....inside my was my package warped around in  bubble wrap - which was better then the  poorly warped green ones which came in a over sized Amazon bag. (2) the new ones  which I got in Black....work right out the box, they had 80% power  and worked  great on my PC  and phone."
"Overall the headphones were decent for the price but in the end I had to return them, unfortunately.PROS:1. For the price, the sound quality is pretty good if you‚Äôre listening to anything on your phone.2. Connectivity was simple, easy and fast3. The range for the Bluetooth was surprising! I went outside to get the mail and my phone was on the upstairs in my house but the music was still playing without disconnecting or shutting off automatically.4. They are pretty comfortable.5. The battery life was pretty impressive as well since I had them for 2 days and used them consistently without having to charge recharge them.CONS:1. ( Reason they were returned) When paired with anything other than a phone, the audio starts to get iffy. For instance, I paired them to my laptop (for reference I have an HP) and the sound would often skip when playing music or even listening to a show. Most times it would sound like I was completely submerged under water and the audio was muffled.2. The adjustability could‚Äôve been better since most times the the mechanism would get stuck when it came to adjusting the headphones to the desired length.3. The volume buttons were odd since you have to hold it for little while to adjust the volume. I‚Äôm used to one click and the volume automatically turns up.While I may have more pros than cons the biggest thing that I need Bluetooth headphones for was to connect to my laptop in order to study and listen to music simultaneously without wires getting in my way. Due to me having trouble with the audio on my laptop I had to return them and this is after I tried troubleshooting and everything. I say they‚Äôre good but it depends on what you need them for."
Overall these are decent.  I thought about returning them but decided for twenty bucks they're worth keeping.  My biggest complaint is the volume issue.  Probably loud enough for most folks but sometimes I like to just crank it up and these won't get there.Pros- very comfortable- good quality sound- connects easilyCons- Max volume is about half of what I would like- I still can't figure out how to turn them off
"The headphones were surprisingly small, the adjustable length worked for me though the earpieces ability to loosely move 180 degrees combined with the thin plastic frame leads me to question the durability. For sound I noticed a lot more bass and disappointing audio quality, the audio is just dull to the point I'm pretty sure $5 wired earphones have more detailed sound. For example one song I listened to the background vocals were straight up unintelligible and the volume doesn't bring it back or make it clearer and the bass is tied to the volume which doesn't help. On my old Samsung for YouTube at least the volume up button skips to the next video and the volume down doesn't do anything. The ear padding is good the headphones came with the charging cable but not the part that goes into the outlet, a headphone jack for a wired connection and no storage besides the small box it came in. The headphones work but given a second chance I would've ordered the $35 dollar version or bought 4 wired earphones."
The bass didn‚Äôt work for me I felt it was too much close to being annoying I had to return them
"Unfortunately, these headphones just broke... the headphones themselves are supposed to fold in for easy storage but that seems to be what broke them... so do so with caution.. I only had them for 2 months so that's a bummer.On the positive side, I found them super comfortable and the sound quality for $20 headphones is amazing.Since these just broke, I purchased the slightly upgraded version of this set... Hopefully it is just as nice!"
I‚Äôm experimenting with less expensive headphones.  The sound quality is acceptable.  The battery life is unbelievable!
They worked fine and I enjoyed them while they lasted. After 10 months they just quit working.
Worked fine in the beginning but it stopped pairing even when charged. Don't know why. Returned.
The earphones are clear and functional. They are NOT noise canceling at the least.
"Firstly, the sound quality itself is amazing and I like to really feel music when I hear it so this definitely did the job for me. Second, they‚Äôre very comfortable and don‚Äôt hurt at all and are very lightweight, Bluetooth was also easy to connect as well. My only problem with these is that I‚Äôm the type of person who likes putting my music all the way up and the leakage of the sound from the outside is awful. Even putting these halfway volume you can hear it very loudly from the outside. Overall, the reason why I bought these was to have the good sound quality and not to be able to hear it from the outside and this didn‚Äôt meet my expectations. I‚Äôm quite disappointed to be honest. So don‚Äôt wear these unless you want everyone to know what you‚Äôre listening toüò≠"
"The battery life is great, but they don't stay on my head well, and the more I use them, the more the sound starts to echo no matter what I listen to."
The Bluetooth is good the buttons work well it fits great and adjust fine the noise canceling was terribly bad and even though it connected well the sound wasn‚Äôt as good as it could be they are very strong tho and not easy to break or stop working but it‚Äôs ok not the best tho
These headphones are very comfortable. Sound is fairly good. It's a good thing they come with a cord so you can still connect to your device.The biggest downside to them is that they are not able to connect to bluetooth at all. So that's a bummer. They're a good cheap headphones.
Had to keep putting cushions back on
"I would compare these to the $5 sets they sell at $5 and below, they work but they are not loud nor is the bass, they are okay but not worth $20 to me when I could buy similar for $5"
"Sound wise, fantastic. Especially for the cost. But, they do feel loose near the hinges. They fold, which is nice for storage, but that loose feeling kind of brings it down for me. Great for the price though."
"I got these for my wife to listen to TV without ""bothering"" me.The sound controls would cause the show she was watching to fast forward instead of increasing volume.I would NOT recommend them for tv's"
Perfectly fine headphones they work as intended. The ear cover is cheap like most and falls apart in roughly a year time. For the price you cannot expect more
"Not powerful bass, not deep bass, as described. Fairly easy bluetooth connect to mp3 player. volume control is limiting, have to turn player vol short of max to get enough sound out of it. will try to slightly tighten up to ears, loss of tone otherwise. are okay for the price, seem to be good quality. lower review rating because of weak bass where said were deep/ powerful. equalizer bass setting is weak but does improve overall. bass sound was compared to player with equalizer and earbuds that are bass enhanced, which overall sound is still not that heavy bass but come pretty close to it, based on what you would hear at a concert, but these headphones are just way too weak for a nice bass sound. of course best thing is no cord bluetooth . . ."
The sound is not bad but these things feel like they are going to break every time I use them and the external sound reducing is not good at all.
This item was not for my husband.  He couldn‚Äôt  get it to work properly.  So not bargain for us!
"Pros:Comfort and adjustmentEQ, not the best, but worksLight weightThey remember the last paired to device, which matters for home TV or Audio Receiver pairing.Distance for connection is on par with name brand headphones.Cons:Volume up done bottons require a long ores.  You have to press and hold and after 3 seconds, the volume decreases at a quick pace causing you to overshoot.Audio delay is noticable for TV use.  Not a problem for music."
"Good sound and bass , will keep charge for 30 hours but I never got close to that time. Not noise canceling."
Got these for $20. They're fine - nothing to write home about. Noise canceling function is lackluster. Sound quality is alright.
"They say they are working , they are connected to my tv the headphones work but have no sound."
The purpose of earphones is to what listen and hear well they not loud enough
"They are reasonably priced, last long on a charge and sound great. But the volume control sucks. Instead of one press equals one volume unit, you have to hold down the volume button down then after a 1 or 2 second delay the units jump. It's not a smooth slow increase or decrease of volume. So if you cab deel with the volume control, they work good for the price."
"Not as expected, doesn't fit properly and all external noises reach my ears.."
"First pair I bought malfunctioned before the return window closed so I was able to return them. I liked them enough to take a chance on a replacement. The replacement pair malfunctioned after the return window closed, about 2 months after purchase.On both pairs the sound went out and got weirdly wobbly and broken up. I get it's a cheaper product but it should last longer than 2 months.edit: revised rating from 1 star to 3 stars. After disconnecting the headphones from my device and reconnecting them, the sound fixed itself. The reason for 3 stars (which I didn't bother mentioning in the initial review) is that sometimes these headphones connect to devices when I don't want them to, like they will switch from my PC to my phone and vis versa. Consider this if you want to use these headphones with multiple devices."
They‚Äôre just OK you get what you pay for!
The volume is is not loud enough like Beats
"Everything is good! but the color is a mauve aka an ugly pink it's even darker in real life, and it's not what the picture shows might return this to get a white instead. I am very upset about that because it was $8 extra for the pink, and I wanted that pink, not mauve. But everything else is good."
"I love these headphones! However, if they are linked to my computer (not a Mac), the music crackles. The computer speakers don't crackle. Just the headphones when linked to my computer. However, connected to my phone they work amazing! I also wish I could find a case for these that they fit in!"
"I got these headphones a while back, maybe a year ago. The battery still lasts just as long; forever. One thing I have noticed is that the cloth of the ear pads has come off, revealing the foam, which is a bit embarrassing. The inside of the ears are also a bit dirty, maybe from my gross ears, but if you don‚Äôt want that to be noticeable, order them in black. All in all, they are good headphones that have served me well between road trips and two pairs of AirPods. They have a port where you can connect an aux cord to use as wired headphones, volume buttons, and a sound mixer with options like bass, rock, and so on. Their sound quality has not faded and they still serve me well."
"So, as stated, they are not expensive, and so don't expect Bose or other high end quality.  These simply will NOT perform like high priced branded sound units, BUT that does NOT mean that they are bad.  Put em on and crank up some of your fav music, go from there!"
"For the price they are alright, but otherwise there‚Äôs nothing great about them. They feel and look very cheap, just feel like lightweight hollow plastic, and the sound is okay but not wonderful. They are definitely a good budget option. But don‚Äôt expect them to be fantastic"
These headphones were disappointing. The audio quality and comfort are significantly worse than similar headphones that I have ordered on Amazon in the past. Wish I had just spent the extra $3 to get another pair of the Doquas headphones that I previously had.
"First off; I've only had these a few hours, so my 3-star rating may change up or down.The right side wobbles and twists  as if it's broken. This maybe intentional. Not sure.The volume controls do not respond with a click up or down. One must hold them down causing huge jumps in volume up and/or down.Mostly though, I am writing this to hopefully  spare you from this feature: Regardless of the volume setting on the phones or your device, when you switch the EQ button, it announces the mode (Rock, Pop, etc.), in your left ear REALLY REALLY REALLY LOUD!So beware. I will update as seems fit."
Not for a rocker expecting the power of old fashion wired headphones but the battery last a pretty long time. The felt material deteriorates rather quickly with every day use. Not bad for the price.
"My husband gives these 5 stars for fitting a big head and audio quality. But im giving 1 star for the following reasons:1. The buttons only include skip and power. If you want to pause music, you have to open your phone. Also, their placement means you might actually skip a track while taking them off if you're not mindful of where you grab.2. For my job, i have to keep one side off of my ear (earbuds hurt too much for 40 hrs a week). Because these speakers rotate individually, it means they just slide right off the back of my head when i do this.3. The microphone is not good enough to take calls on so you have to turn them off to answer a call. However, if you do this, the power button does not shut them off but instead rejects the incoming call, which is the biggest pain of all. I would return them for that reason alone if i hadn't missed the return window.I'm going back to my previous brand with gratitude (because it had NONE of these issues) after the pain of trying to make these work for me!"
"Got this for my dad for him to use it at work heLikes it does workouts ok , i feel like quality should be a little better. Noise cancellation isn't that great ."
"Let's start with good things about it.The noise canceling it good, I can't hear much when I'm wearing them.The sound quality it pretty decentThey are comfortable to wearThe charge port is not in a stupid spotThe charge is decentNow things I don't likeWhen in calls people hear buzzing from my end.At max adjustment it's still not big enoughWhen put around my neck to hear better, it chokes me basically.They don't agree with my glasses when I wear them.There's more downsides to these then good. But I'll deal with them until they break"
I liked the price so i guess it's partially my fault. I can't hear my friend when he talks to me bc I hear everything in his background and Vice versa
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            My #1 issue with this is that's there's no carrying case for the headphones. I don't know how one is supposed to protect it when traveling.#2, this may just be me, but the cushion for the top of the head isn't comfortable at all.The noise cancelation is absolutely one of the best I've ever seen. I can't hear a peep outside of them. It's really amazing. I think the sound quality is up to par. I'll give these another week to try out, but initially, I have to give these a 6.5/10."
"Three weeks ago, this review would have been 5 stars. I bought these a while back and loved them. A friend of mine accidentally broke my headphones so only one side worked and I was forced to buy a new pair. While the physical quality of the headphones is the same great stuff, the voice that says things like ""Connected"" has been downgraded from a smooth sounding voice to this highly obnoxious, robotic sounding thing. I have some audio sensitivities and certain sounds are triggering for me- this new voice included. I returned the new pair and repurchased thinking it may have been a fluke. The new new ones came in today and I was so excited, I met the delivery person at the door. That excitement was short lived. These have that same annoying, robotic voice.If the voice doesn't bother you, then these are a great purchase for the cost. They are very comfortable. The battery lasts forever. The audio quality (for audiobooks specifically) is great. The charge quickly using a USB type C cord.I can't get past the voice since it's literally triggering for me, so I will be purchasing something else instead. But if they ever change the voice back to something tolerable, will someone please let me know?!"
"Fit, pairing, and sound quality are all good, or at least adequate. I'd like it if they got a little bit louder in volume but it's not really a problem.The issue I have is that I use these to walk outdoors and take work phone calls. When there is even a slight breeze I am told it sounds like I'm in a tornado on the other end. The microphone seems to pick up wind and exaggerate the sound to the person I'm talking with to the point where they can hardly hear me."
"My sister has a pair and they're great, last long, mic is great, but they didn't fit my head, I guess my head is small?? Idk"
The sound quality was very good but I found them to be to hot and the cups did not fit my big ears
"Not true over the ear. Rests on ear lobes causing ear. Not that I have hideously large ears, just 6'3"" with proportional size ears. So these headphones are just a bit too small. Gotta be country of origin issue. Fits smaller people just fine, but to have so many different brands have similarly too small of earphone cups, hmmmmm. Couldn't tell you if the sound is good or if any BT lag. Never went past trying on for fit. Does use usbc so any newer phone charger will work. I'm done with the cheaper pairs of headphones, as they are are the same small size pretty much. Turning to the Sony and Bose headphones, with the much larger price tags. Someone has to make headphones for normal size people!"
"Bad quality, equalizer is great, easy to setup, good color, poor performance, fits for larger heads, not durable, poor range."
"Item works well, but dry rotted and started falling apart within a short period of time. I purchased twice."
"Yes, it looks goodYes, it's comfortableBut the ANNOYING WARBLING!Could not stand even 5 minutes of using it.Every time I touched the controls on my paired device, the sound had a staticky warble like it had trouble processing the sound data wirelessly.Not only that, but the sound is muffled, like if you put a pillow on top of a speaker.Returning almost as soon as I got it. What a shame."
"‚Ä¢ Takes long to turn on & connect and to turn off. This definitely needs to be shorter and the woman's voice is not appealing at all.‚Ä¢ Headband is very uncomfortable with glasses. However these fit small heads very good.‚Ä¢ The Bass on these headphones are not bad depending on the song that you're listening to. I think that you have to turn them up too loud to begin to hear a good bass line.‚Ä¢ Earmuffs are soft, comfortable, and the material is very good.‚Ä¢ Mic sounds ok and speakers sound surprisingly good.‚Ä¢ Can't speak for the battery life because I was through with them after my 2 or 3rd use due to having to turn them up very loud and they wear terribly with glasses.‚Ä¢ Button control can be very confusing. Normally if you it the + or up button on headphones it would turn it up or down. Well, not with these. It actually change the song. If you hold the button then it will control the button. Unlike others, that Normally use this as the skip/next/back feature.‚Ä¢ Music and video sound quality are pretty good.‚Ä¢ Overall, I am very disappointed that i can't wear them with glasses, that I have to turn them up too loud, and I will be returning them.‚Ä¢ Biggest con: no protective case or quality carring/storage bag. Just a thin piece of frosted plastic."
"To begin, I have owned hundreds of headphones and know exactly the sound I am looking for and can tell within seconds what I like, and this is not it. I decided to give these a try since popping up continuously on Amazon searches with a large# of reviews.  I was not expecting much with the low price and what appeared to be plastic build, and that's what I got.  These are typical headphones you may find in another large, low cost, budget retailer.  Audio quality is fairly hollow, bloated on certain EQ modes (Bass), although Rock sounded most reasonable.  I I own the Tozo H2 which are an absolute surprise for the $$, comfort, app experience and ANC.  I recommend putting your $$ towards something with better quality, fit, and sound vs minding the quantity of reviews as each experience will vary.  Will be returning them today."
"Day 1 was amazing! But then came day 2-3. I tried connecting it and it said ""pairing... connected"", so I playd my audio of course, but did it really connect? NO. After disconnecting it says pairing, and then connected, my bluetooth is literally off WDYM CONNECTED? It doesn't even work anymore after charging it for 2 days. My last bluetooth headphones worked for 5 days and you only had to charge it for like 3 hours, PS i got it to work after removing device and having to pair it again with smth in settings, so its fixed. Its a nice pair of headphones, the worth? probably 25$ considering what it put me through."
Plastic retainers break and leave the ear piece wobbling.
"I don't use headphones to listen to music or talk on the phone. I use them to listen to a scanner.  They are great for that purpose. They are lightweight and comfortable. I use the volume on the scanner so I don't know how the volume control is.  I also don't care about noise cancellation.  I don't need a lot of bass so these do the job.Updating, after using these for a few days, I have to say they are not as comfortable as some of my other headphones. They don't hurt my head but the fit is a little off. They don't stay in place when I'm laying down which is when I use them.  Still like them but wish they had a better fit.2nd update: I traded in my broken Bose QuietComfort¬Æ 45 Headphones for the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 thinking I was going to like them better than these. I do not!!! After wearing these nearly every night since Oct 2022, they are much more comfortable. Not sure if they just needed to be broken in or I got used to them.  The Bose 700 now sit in a drawer unused.If you are looking for a decent inexpensive set of headphones and aren't picky, give these a shot.Updated 09-06-2023 I marked this down to 3 stars because you cannot replace the ear pads and the pad on one side started coming off."
"These should be $15 maximum given the quality. They are painful to wear with glasses and the sound quality is subpar. If you don‚Äôt care too much about sound quality and just want a cheap pair of bluetooth headphones then I guess these would be OK. I would recommend investing in a reputable brand such as Sony, Bose, or JBL if you want quality headphones."
"I love the look, feel and sound of the headphones, but unfortunately, it doesn't connect properly through Bluetooth. It keeps on ""skipping"" when audio is playing and so I use it mostly with the wire attached. Probably should have returned it, but I do like how comfortable they feel and the overall sound."
These headphones were easy to setup and connect to my devices. The audio quality is ok but is not great when there‚Äôs a lot of external noise. There is no noise cancellation outside of pressing the headphones closer to your ears. Overall they seem pretty durable and work well for the price range
Good price.  Not for audiophiles.
"i'm beginning to suspect that these have always been 20 dollars, and only labeled as discounted from 40 as a marketing tactic.i love music, and i always forget my headphones at home, so i resigned to get a cheap pair to keep in my car so i don't have to shop while being assaulted by the various harsh sounds of a commercial enviornment. i have a lot of sensory sensitivities, so this is important for me. if i can't pull myself away from the beeping and buzzing of lights and squealing of wheels, i'm virtually incapacitated when i get home.the pads are hard. they sit awkwardly on my ears, and leave an open gap to the outside world. there is no sound blockage, which i suppose i didn't expect, but still. it's a lightweight plastic and feels cheap.the volume controls are UNBEARABLE. the buttons on the ears default to being SKIP buttons when you press them once, and you have to HOLD THEM DOWN to adjust the volume, in which case is impossible to do minor adjustments. i'm constantly skipping through my music when all i meant to do was adjust volume, and when i do adjust volume, i nearly need to come to a standstill to focus on getting to the right volume level. it just happens so fast, it feels like i have hardly any control. i don't need to land at an approximate range of volume, i need specific control over where i land. it matters to me.and the sound, my god. the only bearable setting to me is jazz, and even then, just barely. there's no bass range, which i would expect from a 20 dollar pair, but not one being marketed as WORTH 40 dollars. even the mid range feels cut. and the unplaceable inhuman accent from the robotic woman that dictates all of these sound modes just grates on my soul.if you just need to hear some kind of a noise in your ears, sure, buy these. but if you really care about music, like i do, and if you care about how it actually sounds? avoid these, unless you're into the sound of an ant sized speaker being amplified by a tin can.if i had realized the actual worth of these, i would not have bought them. i thought i was getting a deal, but in reality, i was just mislead from their actual worth. i'll use them until i get a replacement pair, but i will be getting that replacement pair asap."
"Seems like every time I grab the headphones, the battery is dead.  A full charge doesn't hold very long when sitting.  They work great when fully charged.  When the charge is low, the sound cuts in and out.  Probably wouldn't buy them again."
Sound quality not great.  They do connect easily and for voice they are ok but would not recommend for music.  I use them to connect with my TV to watch at night while not annoying others.  They are adequate for that purpose and very inexpensive.
so I brought these headphones about 10 months ago and all of sudden they just quit working.  I tried to turn them off and on but that didn't work because there is a blue light on them and it won't let me turn them off . I had no sound.  this is frustrating üò§.
"I haven't used these yet, but I wanted to let people know that these headphones feel cheap and cheaply made. I'm careful with stuff, but I'm afraid that no matter how careful I am, that these will break. They are lightweight, but that comes with a price: the lighter they are, the less durabe the materials become. I will update this after I've had a chance to use them.Also, this comes with a USB-A to USB-C charging cable, so this doesn't fast charge. To fast charge you would need USB-C on both ends because USB-A caps at about 18w.Ok, Ive had a chance to listen to these. They arent bad, but they arent good, either. The bass is mediocre, at best. Mids are pretty non-existent,  but treble is pretty clear. Overall, I'd give the sound quality a 6.5 out of 10.The range on these are absolutely horrible. After 25 feet and no obstacles, they started cutting out. The last pair of bluetooth headphones I used let me walk more than twice as far without interruption. Oh, these also constantly pause Spotify out of the blue without touching any of the buttons. I just walked 2 blocks with my phone in my jeans pocket. The bluetooth kept disconnecting and reconnecting despite being arms length away.Another thing that I dont like is that you cant adjust the volume from the headset despite having volume up and down buttons when listening to Spotify. Those buttons fast forward and rewind instead of controlling the volume. I would imagine this happens when using other streaming services, and it becomes a real inconvenience.The padding is wider than most other over-the-ear headphones I've tried, so there is more space for your ears. My ears don't touch the actual headphones, so I would imagine these are going to be more comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.With all things considered, Id have to give these 5 out of 10 stars. Would not recommend. Also, the return process was horrible and they took forever to refund me. Just save your money, this is bad in every way possible!"
"The headphones are comfortable and connect easily! The sound quality is pretty good, but I want to make it very apparent that they are not at all noise cancelling, and your audio is able to be heard from outside the headphones. I have my volume just below halfway up on my phone, and you can hear everything if you are sitting next to me. If you like to have your volume all the way up and zone out (same bro), these aren‚Äôt going to give you any cover for what you‚Äôre listening to. Perfectly audible to other people. Other than that, the battery life is good, and the headphones come with a charger. üëçüèª"
I have tinnitus and it affects my ability to sleep. I was using earbuds but they fall out when I sleep and the battery life means I need to pairs and have to swap them after 5 hours. Enter these headphones! Slept with them 2 nights thus far and they work great to pipe in white noise and the battery lasts all night and some.I said they are comparable to JBLs that cost 3x as much because they are. If they last 1 year the. They lasted longer than my JBLs did. The sound is good but not great. But for the price they do get 5 stars from me.Couple more pros:Pair easy with BluetoothHas intuitive instructionsThey are comfy and have big openings for the ears and supple cushions that appear to be quite thick and sturdy.The led changes when charging bs fully charged. All features expensive ones are lacking.We‚Äôll have to see how long they last but so far they are great.EDIT- changing to 3 stars because they don't last. They work fine for basic music etc but can no longer play True Tone - it just comes out garbled. They don't work any longer for the purpose I bought them.
"sound is pretty good.  Because the ears were put on wrong, to be able to reach buttons okay, I wear backwards. No big deal.  I bought these because I thought my headband speakers would be too hot in summer but so far I've only worn these on cool days and after a 45-60 minute walk, the ear pads are dripping wet and make my head sweat so don't think they'll get worn much.  Never had this happen, but have never worn the giant over the ear type.  Also, if wind blowing at all, makes a whistling sound through headphones"
"For a $25 headphones, they are ok. Ok bass, but very low volume even at max and could have dealt with that instead of buying a pair for over $100 like I intended, but returning as the volume buttons only increase the volume. So basically hitting the volume down button increases the volume instead of decreasing. Had hopes I could get by with a cheaper set since they did have good reviews and only planned on using in my home, but looks like if I want even a hint of quality I will have to look at something a little bit pricier."
Just received today. Bought mainly for gym but They feel like they are going to be sliding off. Hopefully they stay on. Seem pretty good for the price.
"I purchased a pair of these Beribes headphones in March of 2022 and have been using them for 10 months. I'm not sure if there's been any changes to the designs or features since March '22, so please note that this review is for the model I received back then.Here are the pros: these headphones have great sound and good microphone quality for calls, even if I speak quietly! They stay connected even if I move across the house. I rarely experience disconnection issues. The noise suppression is good enough that I can still hear everything in a busy airport.Unfortunately, I personally can't recommend these headphones until the following issues may be addressed.CONNECTS AT 100%:Ears beware: these Beribes headphones almost always connect/reconnect to devices at 100% max volume. This is unfortunately super loud and undesirable.I had to remember to lower my volume from 100% every time I used these headphones. This was on a daily basis.I looked for a fix (outside of manually limiting my Bluetooth volume via my device settings, which was inconvenient when using multiple sound devices).Unfortunately, the manufacturer said this feature is on purpose and completely intended (in their replies on Amazon).VERY LOUD ALERTS:The following alerts always play at 100% max volume no matter what your device is set to:- Power on/off (very shrill beep)- Call answered/hang up (very shrill beep)- ""You have an incoming call""- Headphone alertsPeople sitting across the room can easily hear these alerts going off when I'm wearing the headphones.SUDDEN SHRILL ERROR SOUND:9 months after purchase, these headphones occasionally emit a SUPER loud, prolonged, and high-pitched sound at random that lasts until I turn them off completely.I'm worried all this will cause ear discomfort or hearing loss over time for users.I ended up replacing these headphones with another brand due to these unfortunate features. I hope this review may help people when choosing a good pair of headphones."
"Almost everything about these headsets is good except sound volume, if they were louder they would be better‚Ä¶ but overall great for the price you pay."
"These are super comfortable, I wear them all day and sometimes fall asleep in them. I like the color a lot. My two complaints are that 1. there's a popping sound sometimes when I'm not listening to anything just wearing them. It's loud and annoying. And 2. the buttons are very minimal,  there is no pause/play button and no button to answer calls. You have to control those through your phone. Also the mic is okay but doesn't seem to be quite as good as my other headphones."
They do not block out noises which I thought they were listed as. I do not want outside disruption while using.I can hear someone talking on the phone near by.They are tight on the head.
"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas but something told me to give it to her early. Before the night was done she told me one side have no sound , oh yes! Going right back"
"Let me preface this review by saying I also have AirPod pros & off brand headphones.Pros: sleek design, nice dutiable case. Well made, have held up over time. Easy to connect.Cons: fit awful. I have a smaller head and after 30 minutes I get a huge headache. They squeeze in all the wrong places and my ears get hot. Really bummed because otherwise they are great. Just something to consider."
"If somebody is sitting right next to you in a silent room, they won't be able to hear your music, because of the great noise cancelling. The sound quality is also really good, and they don't fall off if you're running or exercising. They don't hurt your ears after a while, but they do feel kind of tight and might hurt the top of you head. For a cheaper option, get the Sony WH-CH720N, which are similar, and over ears, for 95 dollars less."
"I would rate this five stars, except I had to return them twice because both times the headphones fully discharged and I couldn't recharge them, so I docked them a star for each time I had to return them. I had already had a pair of Beats Solo3 headphones and really like them: the sound is excellent and they're comfortable to wear, even in bed. I like that they're Bluetooth enabled and don't have a wire to deal with. Apple really needs to work on their quality control issues..."
"I was so anxious about getting this because I wasn't sure if these would work because it doesn't say noise cancelling, which I absolutely prefer, HOWEVER, it does say SOUND ISOLATION.  I was ready to send these back before I even gotten them.  The sound is crisp and my ears aren't sweaty.  I have BEATS ""over the ear"" earbuds, which are cool and this is my second pair.  *heart*Update:  Last week, I had my headphones on and then when I went to take them off a piece of the the left side of the archway detached and now they are broken, so now I have tape on it.  Something is telling me that these aren't authentic beats even though it was packaged well.  These should not be broken right now.  smh I know amazon sells a lot of name brand items that aren't authentic and they are the same price or a tad bit cheaper.  I really didn't expect these to be broken after 2 months.  I use these maybe 3 hrs a day and they go right back in the case, zipped up for the rest of the day."
"I am a 6'2"" prime American male specimen and these were too small for my little head, let alone my big head."
"These are trendy, but the sound quality is nothing great. Bought these when they were on sale for $130, they aren‚Äôt worth a penny more.I have 2 pairs of Bose headphones that blow these out of the water. Sound cancelling and the quality is way better for not that much more money. They‚Äôre bigger and bulkier, but if you‚Äôre looking for a good pair, spend the money and buy those.The only good thing about these is they don‚Äôt move on your head as much. They grip your ears better and don‚Äôt move around so if you‚Äôre working out or doing yard work, they aren‚Äôt going anywhere."
"Good but I've had better ones for cheaper. The sound quality is very good, but I must say it's very uncomfortable and believe me I have the tiniest ears ever. It's pretty and I like how you can pause it and change the volume using the headphones. Battery life good (as it should be( and I wouldn't say it's the most durable because it's kind of falling apart."
"I bought this model Beats 3  of Beats on Amazon Prime Day in October. The title said ""The latest model"" which is NOT. The most current is BEATS 4. Amazon needs to monitor consumer information closer."
"This is my at least 5th pair of Beats and they are not very reliable.  After 3 months of use, they are not working anymore.  I've done factory reset and everything else possible.  I'd save my money and get a better pair and completely avoid these."
"I‚Äôve never had a ‚Äúnice‚Äù pair of headphones before so I was excited to try these when they went on sale. Soundwise, no complaints, however, I was really surprised and disappointed with how uncomfortable these are. If you wear glasses, would not recommend, especially if you have a thicker or plastic temple, I have to wear my thin metal pair for the glasses to even sit right and if you wear earrings, even my small studs digs in. The part that goes around your ears just feels too small and I don‚Äôt even have big ears. Overall, I like the sound quality and that they fold but it‚Äôs vastly overshadowed by how uncomfortable they are"
"After receiving my headphones I was super excited to try them out. After putting them on, I realized none of the buttons were working and the sound was cutting in and out on the right side. I tried following some troubleshoot ideas and reset the headphones, but it still didn't work and now the sound was no longer working on the right side at all. I contacted Amazon support in hopes they'd be able to send me a replacement item after returning the defective ones. They refused to let me do this and the customer service person I was connected in chat with was so rude, did not give me the time of day at all, and just disconnected the chat when I was asking questions about receiving a return label. If you have issues with your product, go straight to the manufacturer, Beats. I was connected with a person immediately and she was so helpful. Set up a process for me to send them in and get them fixed for no charge at all. Hopefully others' experiences are better than mine, makes me not want to buy from Amazon if I can't trust they're going to be helpful if a product I received is not right."
"These are cute, and look expensive. However, the fit is tight on the head and the ear muffs are too small for normal ears. Even when adjusting the height of the headphones, they still fit too tight and they not noise canceling. I returned for the beats studio three and they are perfect."
So I got these for my daughter for Christmas she had a pair of the red ones from last year and she loved the but these one witch I got silver if it makes a difference are different they are smaller and it barely goes over her hole ear honestly not that impressed wish I bought her a new pair of the old model instead cause these are not it
Beats customer service was great and provided a free pair (the pair I‚Äôm reviewing) and that is why they get a 2.  Right ear stopped working the fifth? time I used them.
Excellent sound but unless you have small tiny Ears like Shrek or a child These aren‚Äôt for u. I don‚Äôt have big ears but I have pointed kinda tip ears and these always press directed on them making it unbearable to wear for more than 5-10 min. Never had this issue with any other headset in my life
The ear pieces smell like paint and I‚Äôm unsure if this means they were used before and the smell is so nauseatingly strong.
"I was so excited to get these as I was choosing between these and the beats studio 3. Literally everyyyyyoneeee told me to get these and the reviews are all good? So I did. To my dismay.. the sound quality is absolutely AWFUL. It sounds muffled, like if you were to be blocking the headphones with a blanket. I tried adjusting the setting, I had my friends try them out- it was not just me. I got these for the gym, the noise cancelling is good, not the best. But they do nottt go loud either! Idk.. I have the apple airpods pro and those are crystal clear and so noise cancelling. I wanted over the ear headphones and these did NOT live up to the hype. IDK if i got a dud, but I'm 25, i've had beats in the past and gone through my fair share of headphones and im extremely disappointed that I spent my money on muffled, quiet headphones."
They are overrated and the sound is too low lol and I got them for $100 a big discount but not  worth it in my opinion.  I have $ 30 dollar headphones that are wayyyy better.
"Everything about these headphones is perfect ‚Ä¶except that they‚Äôre sooo uncomfortable. The material of the over-ear covers makes my ears hot and sweaty (granted it‚Äôs summer here in Texas), collecting sweat in a gross way. The ear covers do not fit over my ear, so painfully sit in my ear . . . I have slightly smaller ears than average, for reference. I‚Äôve never had a problem with this before. The headphones are so tight that I get a headache after about 2 minutes. For reference, I have an average sized head for a woman.The charge time, charged time, Bluetooth connectivity, color (silver), sound quality, and everything else is fabulous. I just never get to use these because they‚Äôre so painful. Wish I had not purchased these even though I got them for $40 or so on Prime Day.NOT worth it"
I‚Äôve had these headphones for almost 3 months now and I thought I just needed to break them in but they are still uncomfortable. The ear pads hurt my ears so bad I can‚Äôt wear them for more than 30 minutes at a time. I tried to look up the break in period and it seems I‚Äôm not the only person with this issue either. I dont have abnormally large ears but they just press too hard and don‚Äôt fit on my ears without crushing them. The sound quality is great which is why I gave it 2 stars but the comfort is so bad I feel like I wasted my money.
"Average sound quality and comfort. Do not plan to use this as a headset for PC as it will not configure properly for things like zoom, teams and discord. Also the mic sucks anyways."
The part for the phone was missing and I‚Äôm not real sure how to contact them to send it to me. For this product to be so expensive at expected everything to be in the package.  will not be buying again.
Heavy and like clamps uncomfortable to wear. Sound quality not as good as airpods pro
"These headphones were great at first, but after about 6 months of normal/light use, the right side speaker started to glitch in and out and after another month or so it stopped working completely. Do not recommend."
"Not like Beats of the past... Bought as Christmas gift and by end of April the headphones do not work consistently... one side will work, other wont, and vice versa... what is consistent is that they are inconsistent... I think the ""foldable"" style bends the wires and weakens the connection... I would not buy again..."
The headphones didn‚Äôt fit on my son correctly. The items says free returns but they only offer the option of a Whole Foods drop off and no other option.
I bought these for Christmas. The right and left headphones do not work. I trouble shouted them. According to the instructions. I looked it up on YouTube. A lot of posts regarding the head phones not working.
"I don't found the 3.5mm RemoteTalk cable in the box, or I bought it for that..."
"Bought these for my 16 year old grandson who is a very responsible person with his things. He calls me on Tuesday January 30, 2024 to tell me that one side quit working while wearing them. I bought these in October 2023. None returnable. I don‚Äôt understand why. I will NOT be buying this or any other product from the company that sold them me."
I bought the solo 3 beats and the charging port stopped working. Beats did not last 6 months. Waste of money.
Bass was very low sound sucks. I threw mine away
The parts covering the ears are very small.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I got these on Xmas from my parents and they worked great. The sound, comfort, everything was great until like January-February. I thought they stopped working because of the charge but no I‚Äôve charged them for hours wasting the time I could‚Äôve charged my other devices with. They completely stopped working the light don‚Äôt turn on, nothing ‚òπÔ∏è"
"These are pretty neat work really well with my iPhone Pro Max to play music all the time however, I am concerned of how low the volume is. It seems like there‚Äôs a limitation to it and it‚Äôs annoying that‚Äôs why only gave it three stars definitely not worth 250 bucks."
"I've had these for 9 months. They no longer work very well (and haven't for awhile). They continue to disconnect from blue tooth and don't easily reconnect, the volume control continues to stop working. If you mess with these for a very long time, sometimes some of that functionality comes back but doesn't stay. Really a pain. Very disappointed in these."
One side of headphone became defective after a few weeks of use. Had to wiggle one side just to hear on that side. Returning them.
"Ok so fully charged the earphones, go for a walk on Friday listening to them for about an hour. Power them off for the weekend and go back to wear them on Monday and they will not turn on had to charged them again."
"I bought a pair listed as new and they came packaged and wrapped as though they were, but they were already paired and named for someone else. If I was fine with used headphones, I‚Äôd have bought ones listed as used."
I bought 2 Beats headphones for Christmas. Working great enjoying them and now one set quit working after a month. Waiting for response now going on a month. Will update results of response.
Great sound but the ear pieces are too small for my ears and hurt after just a short time of wear. JBLs have larger ear pieces and are much more comfortable
I‚Äôve had these headphones for 2 months before they broke. One side of them doesn‚Äôt play the audio anymore. I have never dropped them. $130 head phones should never break this early.
I bought these less than a year ago and one of the ears is already going in an out with sound.
"I purchased these for my son only to find out that these do not have any noise cx feature. The volume is not great and the clarity is not great. It is all pointless anyways since as a dad- I would assume spending this much money on ""Beats"" headphones they would have noise cx. They don't... which makes the noise quality terrible, voice terrible and overall everything terrible. Save yourself the money, don't buy ""Beats"" as they over charge you just for the name and never buy any headphones without noise cx. (No where in the listing said they don't have noise cx when I bought them so I just assumed they did... thats my fault). Product returned."
They only worked for 2 months
"Put it on and after an hour, hurt outside of my ear. Can‚Äôt use it if it hurts. Don‚Äôt bother to buy it. Had to return it . Disappointed!"
The sound is bad and cannot get it to get better no matter location
"Came fast, they are comfortable. Unfortunately they are not loud or noise canceling. My air pod pros are way louder and cancel out noise way better than these, I‚Äôm highly disappointed. I will be returning not worth $100."
"Purchased in February 2024‚Ä¶.. It‚Äôs August and the right ear cup has no sound. Only use Beats for airplane travel, which equates to limited usage.  I was not expecting this from Apple or Beats given the perceived image based on quality"
"I wear these headphones a lot and I would expect that people cannot hear the background noise but it is actually louder with the headphones on than it is when I actually talk on the regular phone. Unfortunately I am stuck with these headphones, they are useless because all I could do is listen to music. Nobody can hear me talk whenever I am anywhere that has background noise, shame on you Beats!!! I don't want these headphones I want my money back, but I know that's not going to happen."
Volume level is pathetic. Don't buy. Turned up as high as they go and it's no good
I thought with beats I will drop my shoes‚Ä¶. Nope. I like listen to intense music like trash metal and these just don‚Äôt cut it What a bummer
Purchased for my daughter for Christmas. November 23rd. It's February and one side has gone silent!
"When these Used very good headphones arrived it was missing Aux Cord, Amazon refunded me 18 dollars so I could buy new aux cord.While using with Bluetooth left ear is not workingSo I go a for return an I can only  receive 72 dollars of my refund meaning I was not discounted SHOULD‚ÄôVE JUST ALLOWED ME TO RETURN..DON‚ÄôT BUY AMAZON USED PRODUCT JUST PURCHASE NEW."
"Bought in November for Christmas present. Worked about 1-2 hours and kept disconnecting from phone. Eventually, the device was no longer discoverable. Reset procedure for Solo3 does not work. Oddly, the procedure for Solo2 looks like it works as described but headphones never become discoverable. Almost like Bluetooth processor burned up and firmware is Solo2 instead of Solo3.  Judging by the box print, looks like I received set not intended for U.S. Very disappointed in Beats. Lives up to my reluctance to ever buy these overpriced, over-hyped headphones."
Really sad. Headphone (one side) stopped working after almost 6 months. Really ?!! What is the point to pay more because its quality? Not for Beats.
i just got these in january and they worked great until 2 days ago. the right side of the headphones keeps going in and out or sometimes shuts of completely. i‚Äôm very frustrated because they were pretty pricey and didn‚Äôt even last a year.
I couldn‚Äôt wear Beats for long before it caused my ears to hurt
Buy the 2nd week one side of the speakers didn‚Äôt work
"Put these headphones up in a shelf, unopened for a couple months.  Decided to give to my niece for her bday and upon opening for the first time, they were cracked and damaged.  Very disappointing as the time to return them has now passed."
These are too tight and hurt my ears after a short time. Sound quality is good so am disappointed in the fit.
"I'm a runner and use my headphones/earbuds for usually an hour or two at a time. While the sound quality is nice on these, they hurt my ears after about an hour. Also, I am a runner and run in colder temps. It was 32 degrees the other day, and with a full charge, these stopped working 5 minutes into my run. I would not recommend purchasing for that reason. I noticed other people have complained about the same issue."
I bought these for Christmas for my daughter and by March one side had no sound.  It is now May and they‚Äôre completely broken. Lasted less than 3 months. Warranty is a joke!!! Will not purchase again.
Missing the beats 3.5mm remotetalk cable so buyer beware the description is wrong
They don‚Äôt work after 6 months. Sound only coming out of one side. Total waste
I got these for my son for Christmas. I can honestly say he loved and took amazing care of them. Today 03/18/24 the right side stopped working. I would think at the price they charge for them they should last so longer than 3 months.
"Quality was good up until this morning, ordered 3 pair as Christmas Gifts and this was the 4th pair that I purchased for myself. I attempted to turn them on and thought they were probably dead and that isn‚Äôt the case. Just a waste of money."
"I bought this Beats 2 days ago because on Amazon says it comes with a 3.5 remote talk cable, I just opened the box and it didn't come with the cable, plus it was a delay, I was supposed to receive them yesterday. Sounds quality is good and they are comfortable"
buyer beware. these have terrible sound leakage. i‚Äôm talking anybody who was next to me was listening to my music with me. i returned these headphones over a month ago and still have yet to receive a refund. do yourself a favor and get the sony ones. if i could i would give this review 0 stars.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This was my 3rd beats purchase, first from Amazon. The only reason I purchased a 3rd pair was because someone stole my last pair. If I would have known I wasn't getting the cord with the mic, I would have ordered from the place I got my others from. This pair doesn't even do anything when I press on the ear(skip, pause, etc doesn't work). I'm just super bummed..."
"These headphones have great sound quality, but unfortunately the ones I received do not hold a charge and die within about 20 minutes of use. At first I was thinking it was possible user error, but after several times of fully charging them they continued to die within that same short time window. I'm returning them."
"Purchased in December as a Christmas present. By March, less than three months later, it will hold a full charge for only about 10 minutes before dying. Not optimal. They sound great, but can't recommend."
Bought it for my college daughter for Christmas and no sound out of either ear by February!
"I received an empty box, except for a small carabiner and some Beats headphones promotional material and instructions. So far, I‚Äôm out $150 and no headphones."
This was a gift for my son and I'm a single mom with no job currently so I was ordering for Christmas gift and the item wasn't opened until Christmas Day only to find out only 1 of the headphones works.
Sound quality was NOT acceptable.
One side of the beats stop working. It's only been 2 months. How can I get replacement when you only have 30 days.
"They only lasted me for two weeks. The battery died and when I re-charged, it never charged up nor turned on again. They don't work anymore. Can I please return them for new ones?"
The headphones will not charge and will not turn on or connect wirelessly!!! Will be returned for refund!!!
When I got the product it was already broken and I was sad it was a Christmas present gone wrong moment just glad I got my money back
"Super bummed, spent a lot of money and they only work on one side"
"I can use them one time, for about 30 minutes before they die"
The right headphone stopped working after just 1 1/2 months.
Do not order this product unless you are ordering for a child or have unusually small ears.  Very uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time.
They  won‚Äôt turn on
Right side stopped working 2 days after the return window
Left ear audio stopped working after two months.
Volume so low it‚Äôs ridiculous
Stop working less than a month..
"I bought 2 pairs of these, one for me and one for my partner. On his, the place where the right ear cup attaches to the headband broke after 1 year. 3 months later, mine stopped turning on altogether. The quality just isn't there to make them worthwhile at this price."
"On an international flight and these went from nice to some weird sound and was sooo much nice just to take them off. SUPER disappointed,,, who likes these anyway??"
"This is my 4th pair of beats as I‚Äôve always loved them but this pair is so flimsy and after 9 months, one side doesn‚Äôt play at all. Disappointed, but this will be my last pair of beats."
Great for first month or two. Now right side is going in and out sure it will completely stop playing here soon. Seems this is a major problem for a lot of people.
"I decided to bite the bullet and buy a decent pair of headphones for casual TV watching and the occasional music session. I was immediately struck by the quality and design, and initially they felt great on my ears. However, this lasted about 30 minutes, as they began causing discomfort to the outer edges of my ears.They sound clean, but I was disappointed in the lack of bass response. Perhaps this is due to the on ear design, as opposed to an over-ear. For movie watching, I'm not too bothered. It's the music that I was having trouble enjoying, especially when I would remember I spent close to $150 on these.I was most surprised at how quiet they are. While they maybe loud *enough*, they certainly don't get LOUD. For TV, not such an issue, but for some Pantera, they lack the volume and bass.Also, they are micro-usb charging, which is annoying. Those three items, but mainly the ear discomfort, had me returning them the next day. I instead bought the Sony WH-CH520's. While I don't expect the fidelity of the Beats, they are lighter, more comfortable, and $100 cheaper (a family member already has them, so I am familiar with them)."
Literally broke within a year
"These headphones produce a sound that is not mindblowing but for the price, they adequately drown out people or noises when you‚Äôre trying to be productive. The noice cancelling is sufficient for how I use them in my open office with 3-4 other coworkers.Ear pads are rather comfortable and seal well around the ears.They are quirky in that, even though you‚Äôve already paired with a device you still will hear the following messages each time you turn them on, ‚Äòpower on‚Äô, ‚Äòpairing‚Äô, ‚Äòconnected‚Äô.You cannot adjust the volume when using the headphones during a MS Teams call, so hopefully you‚Äôre not stuck on a call with a loud talker.The range is about 12ft, with no obstructions, from source device.I‚Äôm overall satisfied for the money, but these are not ground breaking, just good enough."
"It replaces some treble with base, due to the construction of the solid back. Still hard to find better if you want wireless, but if you don't like the constant hum of base its not for you. find something like steelseries arctis 1 that has good treble and still has sound canceling though not as good. They buy reviews."
"For 100-dollar headphones, these are really crapy. The sound quality is pretty bad. They are not very comfortable. They feel and sound like they are from Temu"
The sound was very low not what I expected at all. That‚Äôs why it was returned.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Just got these today!! I‚Äôm by no means an audiophile, but I think these sound great. There‚Äôs an app to you can use to adjust the EQ. I was really nervous abt these since they‚Äôre on ear, I‚Äôm an over ear person but they‚Äôre so light and don‚Äôt squeeze my head at all. I really wanted something less bulky and these are perfect. The only thing is they FEEL incredibly cheap lol. I will update if anything in quality stands out or deteriorates!Small update: it‚Äôs only been a few days but the battery life on these is incredible!! I‚Äôve been using them like nonstop and they‚Äôre still only at 50%Final update: realized later on the day they were delivered ‚Ä¶ something is rattling in the left ear and the microphone doesn‚Äôt work at all. When I‚Äôm on a call with someone they can‚Äôt hearMe and I can barely hear them. The battery system is weird, I thought it was lasting so long but it only tells you when the battery is at 100%, 70, 50 and then dead I think. I just turned it on and it said 50% and 2 minutes later it‚Äôs showing it‚Äôs in the red and said low battery. Idk why they would make it like that. Thankfully the app that you can connect it do does tell you, so I just saw it‚Äôs actually at 20% even though TWO MINUTES AGO it said 50%. Anyways. Gonna try to get whatever is rattling repaired, for the price it‚Äôs not awful but honestly my 15$ tozo ones are better quality sound wise and structure wise. I do like that this has an app though. 3 stars final update"
"I do the like the headphones, they are wireless, comfortable, and good sound quality. However, there was no warning that you have to download the sound connect app to utilize on your phone, and there is no app for your computer yet. I wanted a spare pair of Bluetooth headphones for the hours of studying I do on my phone and laptop. They are not compatible for laptops, and you need an app for your phone. My beats headphones are easy to hookup to phone and laptop, so I prefer those to this pair."
"I like the sound quality, color, build quality, and connectivity of the headphones, but I am a person with glasses and they are very uncomfortable. They press my ears against my glasses frame, and I cannot tolerate them for more than 15 mins. I usually use them for meetings which in general last from 30 mins to 1 hr. My ear just hurts‚Ä¶I do not advise them for any extended listening."
"I wanted to love these SO much but I couldn‚Äôt wear them more than 3 minutes because they were hurting my ears. I don‚Äôt think my ears are abnormally big lol but the size was just too small for my preference. Everything else about them was great but if you‚Äôre sensitive about your ears just a heads up, they do sit on top of them, not around them!"
Nice set of on ear headphones BUT lousy execution with the charging cable being all of 6 inches long and the charging port on the headphones being proprietary. Plan on buying an extension USB cable unless you want these things dangling off your wall socket. They're also kind of expensive for what they are.
"These headphones perform their basic function and have decent sound quality. However, there are a few things I don't care for. First of all, I had to create a Sony account and enter my email address, sign a bunch of lengthy user agreements, etc.. in order to get them to work. I've never had to do that with any other Bluetooth device and really wasn't a fan of being forced to complete this process. Secondly, there's a blue light that flashes for a couple of seconds when you turn them on but when you push the power button to turn them off there's no way to tell if they're off or not. Lastly, I've only used them twice so far and the second time it took me at least 5 minutes to get them to pair with my phone. They actually did pair for a few seconds and then disconnected themselves. Then I finally got them going. That's a pain when I'm at the gym getting ready to work out and can't get them to sync up. Again, every other Bluetooth device I've ever used has been much easier. If I had it to do over again, I probably would not buy these."
"Main issue is they have issues staying on my head if I'm moving around. That's, pretty much every over the ear headphones I've ever had. Having earbuds for so long I forgot, but it's manageable unless you bend over a lot.Get scuffed fairly easy but definitely engineered to listen to music with quality and mobility. So while I think I could go do yard work and the noise cancelling would work I am afraid these are just too fragile to risk.Being able to connect to two Bluetooth devices, does not mean dual audio you need to actively stop audio from the first source before audio from the second device will play.Noise cancelling is more than my earbuds so I tend to not hear much when using these, and that has pros and cons as well.Microphone works for calls, but so far is not usable with  any games I've tried. It's really meant for music.On sale for $40 is perfect for these, the original MSRP is too high for the actually product and performance. Admittedly that's probably why they are price dropped 40%.If there is one thing I can say for sure it's that these have 3-4 times the physical range as my galaxy buds that cost $180. Sometimes that's exactly what you need though, like listening to music from my server wherever I like."
2nd life Sony ear phones were smaller than I thought they would be. Sound wasn't loud enough to warrant having Sonys name. It is what it is.
Headphones themselves are great. But I ordered  Amazon refurbished and they were covered in sticker residue. I tried to clean off but returning these and buying new. Some ways Sony is better than Beats: more comfortable and way less. The controls on Sony are harder to find and if they had Beats controls on these Sony CH520 then it would be a perfect world. Both have app that controls but Sony not as much as Beats. I got more for Audible books and less for music.
I payed a lot for them . Only for my Grandson tell me they won't work on his computer!!!
The Bluetooth is not connecting automatically and requires manuall connect. Will not purchase again.
The ad description did not say for iPhone or iPod only
You have to install an app to pair your headphones with a device. I‚Äôve been trying to pair with another device for about 30 minutes through the app you‚Äôre forced to download. I should have sent them back when I first learned that I needed an app to use them. Now I‚Äôm stuck smh
"I‚Äôm trying everything in my power to make these headphones louder, I need these to work out when I go to the gym , just wanna listen to some music and focus ,but these headphones at not loud at all when I play music . It‚Äôs only loud when I‚Äôm on a phone call"
while these bluetooth headphones are high quality and sound very nice with a great mic these headphones are very annoying to use as they permanently pair with a device with no way to connect pair with another device without having to remove the connection entirely from your other device. its a lot more annoying than you would think especially if you're bringing these headphones with you to use on a your phone or something like that cause if you forgot to unpair the headphones from your previous device than you literally cant use your headphones until you get back home it's so annoying. overall they are nice headphones but with a very large and unavoidable flaw
"I thought since these are Sony brand headphones, they were going to be better than the JBL 510BT that I loved, but they are not. I decided to try the Sony, because after some wear, and going thru a couple JBL headphones, they wouldn't fit as snuck and constantly fall off, damaging them with every fall. Unfortunately, the Sony headphones will do the same. Sound quality is good, but doesn't beat JBL for me. There is no noise cancelling on the Sony. If there is, it's nonexistent. When I'm on the phone, it picks up all the noise in the background. These are slightly more expensive than the JBL ones."
"I had a pair of sony headphones that my husband lost a few years ago and I've been trying to find their equivalent ever since. Thought these were close, they are not.They function fine, can't speak to sound quality as I only listen to audio books.I have a smallish head and very small ears so all these new releases with the huge speakers that look like they're from the 1970's are a no. The size of these speakers is ok, slightly bigger than I wanted but the smallest I've been able to find by far.Unfortunately these seem cheaply made, the plastic is thin, the buttons are super shallow and the light is strictly for charging. You have to hold down the middle button to power on/off and play/pause. The problem is the way the buttons are situated I can't tell if I'm pressing the correct one by feel and of course I keep accidentally pausing when I try to adjust the position over my ear.The charging light is roughly the size of a pin head and so dim that I couldn't find it when I plugged them in to charge.I don't recommend."
"I ordered these as a replacement for my broken Sony noise-cancelling headphones. These are a lot cheaper in price and in quality. The look and sound is fine, and the phone calls are clear. These headphones hold a great charge, much longer than my noise canceling Sonys. However, I'm a relatively-tall grown man. I'm not exceptionally big (pointing that out because these headphones Not fitting would make more sense if I had a huge head). These headphones make it feel like my head is in a vice. The pressure is constantly uncomfortable and at times, they feel like their giving me a headache. The older, more expensive Sony headphones were amazingly comfortable. These are not at all. One more thing, the over-the-ear part on these (WH-CH520) are too small and don't completely cover my ears. The old Sony's are significantly larger over the ear and are more heavily-padded. I could wear those all day. With these, I need to take breaks often. Overall, if you have a smaller head, they're probably fine, but for a grown man with a decent sized head, these are a poor choice"
"I bought these less than a year ago on Oct 9, 2023. The quality has been amazing and they are so comfortable. There is also a free app you can download to customize the settings on your headphones, which I was super stoked about. I've honestly been in love with these things since the day I bought them, but they have recently broke completely. Over the past few months, I have noticed the material on the earphone cuff peeling. I was fine with this, as it did not affect the quality. Last week, the arch of the headphones broke, which I was able to duct tape back together. However, just last night, the entire right earpiece broke off and I am unable to reattach it. I am disappointed in the lifespan of these headphones, especially since I was so in love with the quality of the product. I didn't even get a whole year out of them. It's a real shame."
Prime Deal?  Seriously?  What a joke.  I bought the black ones a month ago for $38.00 (apparently a 37% discount from $59.00).  Now they are advertising the mocha headphones as a prime day deal for $35.99 (and advertising a discount of %55 off of the list price of $79.99.  All of the other colors are still available for $38.00 at 37% discount off the list price of $59.  This should not be allowed to even be listed as a Prime Day Deal.  What a joke!As far as the headphones.  They are okay for a lower cost headphone.  They have a smaller circumference than I would like.  I would prefer the speaker to cover more of the ear.  And they are bulkier in the thickness of the speaker than I would like.  Would prefer a narrower thickness.
"I really loved these headphones because they kept out noise, were very comfortable and lightweight, fit my face and ears well and the music quality sounded great.8 months into having them, when I went to grab them from my bag they looked like this. This was pretty upsetting because these are a necessity for my job. Now I‚Äôm debating whether to buy new ones or a different brand‚Ä¶"
"These headphones are great!  They connect readily to my Pixel, play whatever I want, and act as telephone when I need that.  So why the two-stars?  Because that's the only thing they connect to.By contrast, I bought an Anker Soundcore 2 (ASIN: B01MTB55WH) about the same time.  It connects to everything, acts as an excellent speakerphone, and cost $28.30/$41.38 or 68.4% the price of these headphones.You of course will see that this comparison is apples to oranges.  I entirely agree, and that's actually the point.  Very good headphones crippled by some BT standard that I will never understand, and couldn't have anticipated when buying..., easily beat by a more modest-cost product from a neighboring technological niche.Wandering far afield from the subject of these headphones..., it's my impression that Sony the ""megacorp"" used to put out high-end products & services.  But that was then.  Nowadays, I look to brands like Starteck, uGreen, & Anker for the superior product."
No good if anyone else is talking nearby - they pick up everything.
"I waited to purchase these headphones for over a year. They finally went on sale to where I could justify purchasing them. I was disappointed. The audio quality was good and better than some other cheaper headphones, which I purchased several of and returned. My main concerns with these headphones are that while the performance/audio is acceptable, the comfort is lacking. The cushions sit on the ears & are hard to wear for extended periods of time because they do not go over the entire ear. I'm a petite girl and I don't have large ears. They're comfortable for about 20 minutes or so. The headphones are adjustable but I found that when I was lightly jogging on the treadmill the adjustable straps were coming loose.  I found myself having to adjust the headphones multiple times, interrupting my workout."
directions hard to follow like speaking in heiroglyphics.
small for my ears
"These headphones work great! The battery remains charged forever! Sound quality is good and it connects via Bluetooth very easily. Unfortunately, after only a few months of using them, one of the ear pieces broke off. Poor manufacturing quality for a company like Sony!"
They are ok.
Clear sound
"My biggest complaint is that they are bluetooth only. I was aware of this before buying it, but I figured we were moving into an all bluetooth audio future and I wouldn't miss out on much. Little did I know, all of my use cases outside of spotify on my phone and watching youtube videos would just not be as good. The latency on them isn't that good which is why playstation won't let you pair with them. (my playstation died literally like two days before these came in so I didn't realize until I had gotten it fixed) I also just decided to test out a keyboard I had and see if it worked with my computer, and the lag was really bad, so of course I went and got out my old headphones that were falling apart, plugged them in, and there was no lag. If there was a plug in option, I would be able to use them with my playstation and my laptop no problem, but sony decided no, bluetooth only.On the otherhand I really do enjoy the sound quality on them, and they work well despite the slight lag that's really only noticeable when you are doing something where sounds lining up matters. I can walk several rooms away from the audio source without any breaking up in the sound, and when I plugged in my old heaphones, the difference in sound quality let me know that I wouldn't go back to anything worse. However, 3d audio seems like a joke considering nothing out there utilizes it, and the ps5 that I thought I could finally experience it with can't even connect to them."
"They‚Äôre not noise cancelling but at that price, they‚Äôre good basic headphones. Ok on the plane and did take out some background noise. Controls could be better, but overall, decent quality for the price."
"The Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Headphones excel in sound quality and design. The audio performance is clear and balanced, and the sleek black design is modern and stylish. However, the ear cups are quite small, which made them uncomfortable for extended use. The small size led to discomfort and pressure on my ears after a while.If you have smaller ears or don't mind adjusting them frequently, these headphones are a solid choice. But for those seeking comfort during long listening sessions, the fit might be an issue. Overall, they offer great sound and aesthetics but fall short in comfort."
"I can't believe how much I spent on these and they're just not great. I know they're not super expensive in the world of headphones, but for the price I expected more than what I can get at Walmart for $15 or less. They work, but the quality is nothing to write home about and my ears hurt after wearing them for about an hour.I'm not a professional, or super knowledgeable about headphones, or sound-- but the best way I can describe the sound is a severe lack of depth. I planned on using them for ASMR and music while working, and they're so disappointing.I found some old earbuds in one of my drawers and they are better than these Sony headphones. I'm going to try to send them back and get my money back."
"I only had these for a few weeks before they completely died. I didn‚Äôt even use them every day. I should‚Äôve known something was off when every time I turned them on for the last three days it said the battery was at 70%, but my computer said it was closer to 50%. I was using them one day and they just turned off. I tried charging them in an AC outlet and with the USB port on my computer, I tried using the charging cord it came with as well as another one I had lying around, but nothing worked. The indicator light never came on. I couldn‚Äôt turn them back on. I went on Sony‚Äôs website to try and troubleshoot it myself , but I got to a point where if the headphones won‚Äôt charge it brings me to another page where it asks for the model number before suggesting a fix. ‚ÄúThis model is no longer available,‚Äù of course.I probably just got unlucky and got a defective product, but honestly they‚Äôre so uncomfortable I don‚Äôt even want to replace them. I always struggle with headphones because I wear glasses and am very sensitive to pressure and headaches. I couldn‚Äôt wear these for more than a half hour without having to take them off for a while. My old pair of wired Sony on-ear headphones were much softer and more comfortable, I kept them until they were literally falling apart. I‚Äôm just going to look for different headphones at this point."
"I can‚Äôt wear these very long without my ears getting sore, but the battery does last a super long time."
"They‚Äôre very quiet, ok for the price but not my favorite. Nice and small and durable though"
Bought them thinking they were noise canceling and quickly realized they weren't while trying to study.
"The color is accurate, though the headphones are small. I have a small head and small ears, so that wasn't a problem for my. However the ear pads don't fully cover my ears and start hurting after about 30 minutes of wear. These do not work well for noise-cancelling, and you can hear audio from them if you're standing near someone wearing them. They also break Discord if you change the sound settings on the headphones themselves. When I was streaming, I changed the audio with the buttons on the headphones, and the audio in my stream lost quality and I had to restart my stream every time I changed the volume.The battery life is great. I have forgotten to turn these off so many times and I'll come back to them 3 days later (whenever my ears stop aching from wearing them) and they will still be at the same battery life. I don't like that there is no exact battery life percentage, just a voice that says ""battery full"" ""battery about 75%"" ""battery about 50%"" and ""battery almost empty"".If you set up the app, you can connect to two devices. However, you can only get audio from one device at a time, which is annoying. And the second device audio is VHS quality, so it's not a great experience.All in all, would not recommend nor purchase again."
"great sound but the box lists as Apple compatible and I have an Android Samsung phone and I can't get it to connect to bluetooth, although it did with my BLU and Nokia phones......I am keeping them because they are awesome sounding like any of my Sony products....but I can't use them the listen to music on my phone via any app like You Tube or Pandora"
My first impression was that they look and feel cheap. The sound quality is good though. I‚Äôm having a hard time getting them to connect to devices. It will only connect to one. I have to go disconnect it to get it to work with another device. I plan to give these to my kid and buy a better quality one for me.
"I ordered these headphones October 2023. I have since used them 3x a week, mostly for the gym and studying. The sound quality and battery life is amazing. However, after less than a year, the left side just...broke off. I don't throw these headphones around, especially since they're on the pricier side. I keep them in the glove compartment of my car as well, so they're not seeing any wear and tear.Keep in mind that the one year warranty Sony offers does NOT offer any physical damage coverage! I spent two days attempting to contact their customer service, only to be told to contact their repair company United Radio. Who then contacted me and said that since these headphones are not covered within the warranty, they can't even repair the headphones since they don't know what parts are required. (NOTE: The wiring for the headphones are completely in tact, it's literally just the hinge that snapped.)I was extremely disappointed since these are fairly pricey. And they are advertised as being sport/gym and daily life friendly. I will only be repurchasing when these are on sale. (I still need headphones...)EDIT 11/2014: I repurchased these headphones after the previous pair broke. Now less than a few months later, this pair has broken in the EXACT same spot. These headphones are not cheap. And for a working student they are meant to be an investment for at LEAST a year. Do not buy these if you 1) work out, 2) put them in a school bag, 3) do anything that isn't treating them with upmost care.The terrible durability and lack of warranty coverage negates any positives in my initial review. This product will not last and it is not worth it. Do not buy these."
"After 5 months of use and several falls to the tile floor I can say that they quality is top notch.The battery duration is excellent, I have only had to charge it 3 times and I use it for about 1 hour every day.The sound quality is very good both for music, phone calls or YouTube videos. That range of the connection is impressive, flawless behind closed doors and across different floors.It does have a couple of flaws: the ""passive"" noise cancelling is no good is you have people talking around you and the over-the-ear design gets quite uncomfortable very fast. I can't use them for more than half an hour without having to move them around or take them away for a moment to ease the discomfort."
"Listen, I understand you get what you pay for.. but as a Sony product I expected these to hold up a little longer than a year and some change. The actual headphone cushion has started to peel away, and it‚Äôs getting worse by the wear.The buttons on it have become almost unusable you have to push so hard for them to register.It randomly stopped finding my phone to connect sometimes, even while on I just can‚Äôt get them to connect to anything. Really is a shame because they were great the first few months of use, which is why I‚Äôm giving it a 2 stars!"
this sony headphones has stop working
"Decent sound. A bit uncomfortable because they are stiff as a board. And that ""charging cord"", really, why bother. I liked my JBLs much better, butat this price point, they're both just one notch above dollar store headphones, and you get what you pay for."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            My husband has the same model, but in the color black. I have the blue. His pairs with his iPhone. The blue does not pair or even Bluetooth recognizable with any Apple products including the iPhone iPad or apple computer that my husband has and pairs with his black headphones. Total waste of money so I am throwing them away. Tried to contact Sony but got handed over from one Sony person on the phone to another."
"They weren‚Äôt really great, they sound good but only work on certain devices, also you need an app for them to work"
i‚Äôve used this for a reallyyy long while and they‚Äôre still doing good sound wise! although the cushion is chipping away it‚Äôs still doing good! at first it was really uncomfortable but now that i kinda broke them in it‚Äôs a lot more comfortable but now it‚Äôs just reallyyyy loose and falls off my head pretty easily! still good headphones for the price during prime discounts (which i did not purchase during since i payed full price)!
Kid took my last pair of the previous version and ordered these. Disappointed with sound quality and fit.
"Edited Oct 15 2024These headphones died.They were being used to watch TV and without warning, stopped receiving the signal/sound. They will not charge. None of the operating lights or switches are responsive.The TV is transmitting just fine as another set of headphones proves this.These headphones had a life of barely over 3 months. If I could give 0 stars, I would.Get yourself a pair of E7's instead. They're more comfortable, they stay on your head and they have a reasonable life span.*******************************************************************************************************************These were purchased specifically for watching TV quietly late at night. There is no need for Alexa, Siri or other device interface, so no need for more expensive features. These seemed like a good choice for basic headphones.Out of the box, they are much more lightweight material than any other headphones. The headband is flexible, but does not have the tension strength of other headphones, hence they slip off the head with activity other than sitting still. The over-ear portion is smaller than other headphones, but this does not affect the sound quality.The sound quality is what you would expect from Sony. Crisp, clear, and clean. Both dialog and music come through without distortion under most TV watching volumes. Distortion does happen at really high volumes, however. Not sure if this is the TV or the headphones though. I would not pair these with a PC or phone for music listening for that reason.Battery life is outstanding. So far, I've been able to listen/watch TV for over 24 hours without recharging.In short, these are fine for simple listening in limited circumstances. These would NOT be good for listening while active around the house. They tend to slip off when bending over as the headband tension is simply not strong enough to hold them on your head w/o being upright.These do what was intended at the time of purchase. I'm pleased with the price, audio performance and battery life for basic TV watching. Nothing fancy needed, nothing fancy received."
Got these specifically for my son to use on his ps4 and they're not compatible.
"These Sony Headphones are great Headphones, but the ear peices are smaller than I like. I personally like the ones to go over my ears, not sit on top of my ears..These would be better for little kids not adults, in my personal opinion.They are good quality and all from the experience I have had with them, which you would expect from the Sony Name. But, the ear peices are way to small I had to trade with my daughter who doesn't mind this type of Headphones (it is better than nothing).  But, they would be so much better if they fit over the whole ear and not sit on top of the ear.Now, I personally would like to say these Headphones are Great Other than that!I do love them --- except for the problem listed above and if they were the type that coveted the whole ear... then, I would give them  5-star raiting. But, this is such a big thing to me and I can't even use them for the most part because of it.. (daughter uses them instead), that is why it is only 3-stars, I am sorry but they were a gift to myself and I can't even use them.These are great to get as a gift for your teens though."
"I like Sony. However there are NO user instructions in the package. You have to go online. Instructions do not say whether or not to charge device before use.And what the heck is it with these eight inch charging cables?Finally, charging cable is USB connect. My laptop does not have a single USB port anymore."
"I think that these are pretty good quality for the price and are also a cute color and style. However, I have issues with these headphones hurting my ears and giving me a headache with how hard they press on my head. They also made my ear piercings sore and bleed."
ReliableDecent qualityAcceptable soundThese are affordable headphones that work well. They are not going to give you the rich sound of a more expensive pair of headphones. But they will be comfortable and do the job. I‚Äôd recommend over a non named brand.
"I've owned these headphones for about 8 months now and while they worked fine in the beginning, the last couple months have gone significantly downhill. Bluetooth connection is spotty as best, the battery lasts a fraction of the original life, and most recently the sound has entirely stopped working. I'm not sure what the longevity is on a product like this but I would have expected it to last longer. Quite a bummer.When it does work, the mic picks up on a ton of background noise... this is not a good option for those that take calls in airports/coffee shops/loud offices."
"Headphones worked great for 1 year, then the left side stopped working.  Warranty expired a few days ago.  Oh well, going to order a new pair.  I am sure it not a common issue."
"They are okay headphones. They are very small, they definitly arnt tight around the ears. When you sweat it makes them even looser. Sound is a 5/10. If you need el cheapos they are good but nothing beyond"
These headphones were too small and didn't cover the entire ear. I bought another pair of Sony headphones that cover the ears and are noise cancelling.....for myself and my wife (WH-CH720N) and we love them!
Others can hear my music and the audio isn‚Äôt so amazing but it‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs not noise canceling so it hard to have the ‚Äúascending from my music‚Äù moments.
"Product arrived quickly and are super light to wear which is what I was looking for. It doesn't have very good noise cancelling which was not my priority. I wanted lightweight headphones to use with my phone and laptop since I have some bulkier headphones that do noise cancel well and hook up to multiple devices but they're too big to travel with comfortably. These Sonys say they can hook up to at least 2 electronics but only hooked to my phone, not my laptop. Will return and find a different pair."
"Sent these back because they were warm on the ears, and you can't hear yourself talk in the headphones which was weird. Good quality to hear others talking."
Work as expected and last a long time on a full charge. Volume isn‚Äôt the best or highest quality in comparison to ear pods though.
"The appearance and sound quality is excellent on these headphones, and I love the color, white. However, the only issue I have is that it won‚Äôt connect to any of our PC computers both MAC and Chrome. The only device it connects to is my iPhone but I purchased the product for my 12 yr old who doesn‚Äôt own a phone. Unfortunately, we‚Äôll have to return them. I do recommend these headphones but read the description thoroughly to ensure it will connect with your devices."
"These headphones have a good sound quality, has a pretty good Mic, charges fast, battery lasts a long time, and are at a good price. Although, the comfort is lacking a little bit."
"Software quality seems fine and I haven't had any issues, although the build quality seems very low for the price. (The plastic feels very flimsy and thin) Overall not worth the price, but its not worth sending it back either. The app required to connect the headphones for the first time seems low quality and I'm still not sure whether or not it was a fake set of headphones."
"Nice headphones with good sound for the price. They paired up with my Lenovo laptop but try as I might, could not get them to pair with either of my android phones; they didn't even appear when trying to sync. Had to return as I bought them for use with my android. Box even states it ""works with android"" so YMMV."
"I bought these on sale after my Powerbeats kept cutting out and disconnecting from Bluetooth after awhile. Doesn't even compare but I couldn't justify paying the money again and went cheap. I typically only use headphones while at my desk job when listening to music or movies, but not for meetings. The sound is okay, seems to pickup a lot of office background noise for other people when on a phone call. You can definitely hear you're own chewing a lot if eating while listening to something. Also walking, I could hear my footsteps prominently moving through the airport. I'm not sure if that's due to the padding completely covering my ears or just these headphones specifically. The battery life is good and the swivel design for the earpads is great for carrying."
I feels tight when you use for long periods.
"broke after 9 months of use. both sides disconnected from their base (the part that allow the headphones to swivel) and they were not exposed to a blunt impact either, and just ended up hanging there from the cable attached to it. other than that these headphones are a 10/10 in my opinion."
"Low volume, not for gym, only for home use"
The headphones work as expected. Battery life is good. Sound is average but not great. My biggest issue is that they fit too tightly on my ears to the point where I have to remove them after about one hour or so. There is no way to loosen them even though they are adjustable to head size. They still clamp too tight on my ears.
"Honestly, I had higher hopes and I feel as if the minimal wishes weren't achieved.1. Firstly, I was SHOCKED when I put it at 100% and it sounded like it was at 30% volume. I am confused about what the problem is. This was genuinely the first thing that I didn't expect to have a problem with.2. Secondly, I did read some reviews stating that it's a bit tight at the beginning but it gets better, however, I would say my head and ear size is slightly smaller than average, however, after wearing it for only an hour, I feel pain on my ears and later my head.*random note: the packaging was a bit confusing and unconventionally difficult to open + I do wish the headphones came with a case*Considering that $40 isn't the cheapest for headphones, I wouldn't consider this headphone purchase to be ideal."
"I like the style and the sound quality of this headphones but after a little bit that I‚Äôm using them, I start to feel uncomfortable and my ears start to become really hot so I have to stop to use them. Probably I wouldn‚Äôt buy them again."
"It has a bright blinking light that can't be turned off, even if you get the app. If you want to sleep with music, try something else, you'll have a light in your eye all night."
I guess I have oddly large ears and no one ever mentioned it to me...these needed to be positioned exactly right for them to cover my ears which is how they have to fit to work....
"Cheaply made plastic Bluetooth headphones with average battery life and sync response. They dont bend so hard to store in a backpack when traveling and the material seems rather delicate as well. Sound quality is average, but they dont also really fit very comfortably on your ears. I'd suggest using your money on a better product with a better return on investment."
"I was using BERIBES headphones before these ones but the padding started wearing off about after a year (of heavy use), so I wanted to give these Sony ones a try to see if they would last longer.However, the battery of these headphones don't last nearly as long (have to charge every other day) and (more importantly) the buttons are really annoying. I keep switching to voice control when trying to pause and unpause. I've made 4 accidental phone calls in the last week because of them. It's really frustrating, I wish I could just turn that feature off.Also, the app that they want you to install as part of the headphones requests a ton of tracking data from my phone, so if you care about your privacy, it might not be for you."
"These are $15 headphones, they are not worth the money. The sound quality is nice, but they‚Äôre small so they don‚Äôt fit over the ears very well, and they‚Äôre tight. My ears hurt after wearing them. Will be keeping for a back up pair, but immediately ordered a new pair of same priced JBL‚Äôs which I‚Äôve had before and liked. I thought since these were originally priced at $60 (on sale for $30 something) I was getting something a little better quality but they are absolutely not worth the money."
Worked well for a bit with great battery life but we may have a lemon because 4 months later only one earpiece works!
"With the name Sony, you‚Äôd think you‚Äôre getting quality right? Welp not so with these. I had Sony headphones back in the mid to late 90s and they lasted forever!! Anyway, I bought these particular ones say back in like 2020ish? Well the quality was great & the connection never dropped & the ONLY reason why I had to buy a new pair is because they broke.I figured well I‚Äôve had such good luck with this brand, WHY NOT get another pair. Um yea huge f‚Äôing mistake. My BIGGEST complaint is the constant dropping. Mind you I‚Äôm sitting right NEXT to the computer & the signal still drops & I'm constantly having to reconnect. At this point..I think there are some Bose headphones I‚Äôm going to go take a look at. Cost more sure, but at least you know you‚Äôre getting quality.Do yourself a favor & go with something that cost a bit more & are of better quality."
"I loved everything about these headphone when I bought them in June. Color, size, fit, weight, adjustment, and the sound quality. But I started noticing the quality got way worse after a couple of times of using them. Now it‚Äôs September and I can barely hear put them when everything I turned completely up. I even used the Sony app to play with the mix settings and same thing. I would not recommend these headphones ever."
"Ok so let me start with the positives, l9ve the blue color and the quality feel look and materials are great 5 star specially for the price. My issue is I bought these for gym to jam weightlifting. I had a blue pair JBL that were about $30 @ TJ Maxx about 50 or 60 retail comparable to these. I gave them to a kiddo who didn't have descent headphones well a teenager kid of a friend's that don't have money to spend on them. Anyways I simply expected similar sound quality but I will say not near as Hugh volume with these and far less bass. Having said that there is no bass distortion even full volume with rap they're a good set with descent sound. But if you have change for similar price go JBL, I'm js. JBL $60 retail headphones sound good as $150 ish price Bose with better Bass. These not on that level. But if you want a good set to listen to medium base and ok volume that look nice and are comfortable these you will like."
The headphones have decent quality for the price but the ear cuffs were extremely small
Looks like someone‚Äôs return and damaged package.  But it is working. So I may keep it. (Deciding)
"In less than one day, I heard the other side‚Äôs voice crackling which triggered my requests for repetition. It made me look bad , because those calls were work related.On the other hand, the fit over my head was much better than the white one. The white one was great for a few months , but died out  eventually"
When I first bought this it started out very well the sound was great and I used them once I tried to pair it with my phone it would not pair so I couldn't watch a movie when I was out and about running errands and I got home and tried to pair it with my notebook and I was finally able to pair it but no sound came from it I couldn't hear anything I turned it on and off and on again and then back off and still no sound so I've only used them one time and it only had 2 hours of charge time which doesn't make any sense cuz I had them charged in for at least two or three hours so it should have been multiple hours of charge time but I won't waste my money on these anymore I'm going to have to do some deep investigation this is the third pair in the past month that I have purchased from Amazon that was messed up this makes absolutely no sense I bought two other kinds that were no name brand that I've ever heard of and then they wouldn't even turn up or down cut on or off and it definitely didn't have any sound cancellation so I bought these thinking that they would be better in the sound is better but that's all it is you know and I don't want to waste my money on something that I can only use one time that doesn't make sense
The audio sound was good and fit on ear fine. But the quality is suspect. These didn‚Äôt last 4 months. Broken while adjusting them over my head. Not good because Amazon cancelled the warranty so I didn‚Äôt have them covered. Also Sony has a 90 day warranty which just expired. Terrible. I will not buy headphones on Amazon again and will demand a warranty or will return them.
"I love the battery life on this product, i feel like it‚Äôs always at 100% and i use it so often. i heavily dislike the ear pieces, they hurt so bad when i wear them for a while, and i tried to find some covers but it seems like there‚Äôs no solution."
on many occasions the connection and sound lost ... and in a meet have a lot of intermittence and cuts
I bought this looking at the word noise cancelation. But my opp person could hear very clearly all the noises and even for me all the surrounding sounds were so audible. Will never recommend this one to anyone.
They are in fact quite aight
"Has a wonderful sound,  but the ear pieces aren't padded enough and after 20-30 of wearing your ears will hurt , hooks up to Bluetooth easy , awesome battery power ! I can go a week without charging them, just know the padding needs to be better for your ears."
"In order to use the headphones you must buy the Sony app for $29.99. Also, the ear pieces are small."
"When  A audio starts, especially from YouTube, it begins at a high volume and reduces level after a few seconds. Touching earpiece. While playing causes a burst of static it‚Äôs ok if you never change volume or touch the headset. A little disappointing.. I expected better from Sony, even for a cheap headset. I‚Äôm trying to mask Tinnitus with various sounds. Setting volume is difficult because of sensitivity of the headset to touch with unwanted audio level changes and difficulty setting proper audio level. There is no user manual. Just a page for warranty and a lengthy disclosure. Experimentingi learned what it think is necessary but the volume jump just by touching the earpiece is an irrational when trying to set audio level."
"Now that I‚Äôve these for a few weeks, I can give an honest review.For sound quality, it‚Äôs pretty clear! However, songs with a lot of bass or more ‚Äúheavy‚Äù sounding messes up the sound quality a bit. I‚Äôm not sure if this is my streaming service settings or the actual headphones but I‚Äôm leaning more towards headphones because I haven‚Äôt had this issue with my airpods. It‚Äôs pretty disappointing because otherwise the sound quality is pretty good, especially for the price.For aesthetics/quality, the headphones look cool and are pretty sleek. I wish the actual headphones that cover my ears were a bit bigger or something though because they feel irritated if I use them for too long/work out in them too long. Maybe I need to break them in more? I dunno.Altogether, they‚Äôre pretty good headphones and I got them while they were on sale. They‚Äôre definitely not worth full price."
"Everyone tells me i sound like i am under water, and they cut out alot. Disappointed"
"Listen I LOVE JBL but whoever approved the dang Google Assistant/Auto Pause/Anytime you move an inch it makes a chime sound should be (fill in the blank).These headphones are so annoying and a prime example of someone trying to do too much, instead of just keeping things simple.Then you're supposed to be able to go into the settings and change all this stuff that's on there automatically.  NO THANK YOU.  Then you go in the app and it's not even clear where or how to turn these things off.I eventually managed to turn off the auto pause but they still make this bleeping sound anytime i love my head. Like if I tilt my head to the side, bend down etc etc.  The sound is great as you would expect from JBL, and it terms of functionality they are brilliant if you have been frozen into a statue and will not be moving for the duration you're wearing them."
"I wanted on-ear headphones with noise cancelling option, because the popular over-ear style makes it really uncomfortable when you're also wearing glasses. I loved my Bohm 66s for years, but after my 2nd set broke, it was time to try something new. This could've been it, except for a few details:1) the headphones assume you want full-bore noise cancelling, all the time, every time. They don't remember that you had turned it off on your last use; every time you turn them on, you're back at having to reset all the time.2) all the buttons on one ear? Is there a reason at least a few can't be shared on the other ear? And what's the point of a button for bluetooth? I mean, on average it's not something you'll be reaching for every ten minutes. That's a definite candidate (along with the on/off bizarre push-toggle) for the alternate side.3) I really want to know who thought the play/pause button should be lower than the forward/back buttons. Worse, the buttons are tiny, enough to make it difficult to tell which one your finger's on (there's a reason we do digital buttons at minimum 32px, people). Those buttons are really candidates for three separate and distinct buttons, so there's no doubt which one you're about to push.4) It does this strange thing sometimes. If I'm watching streaming and I pause via the browser, when I come back and hit play, it'll play for two seconds and then I hear a warble and my show pauses. My impression is the headphones expect me to pause via the headphones, but I'm not interested in spending several seconds trying to make sure my thumb's on the correct button when I could just hit the space bar instead.I appreciate the little bit of AI in them, but I don't need them to do my thinking for me, not when they can't even remember the settings I want or throw fits when I pause by some means other than them. I doubt any other JBL model will be different, but at least I can exchange these for one that only does active. At least then I have only one button to turn off the nc every time I start the headphones up."
"The sound quality of these JBL Bluetooth headphones is decent for the price‚Äîwhile not exceptional, it‚Äôs reasonable given the affordability. However, I was disappointed with the design. Every time I take them off, they pull and tangle my hair, leaving it messy and even breaking strands. This has become a significant inconvenience, and because of this issue, I‚Äôve decided to return the product."
I like this headset but wearing it for more than 10 minutes is very uncomfortable.  The button placement on the headset makes muting a call difficult with the danger of hanging up on the call.  Overall I like the product but it's probably better for listening to music and not taking calls.
"I really love these headphones, but they have a couple annoying features and don't last nearly long enough to be worth the price.I've been using these headphones for the past two years at least, and I have three pairs of this same model of heaphones. The battery life is incredible, I think they have only died once or twice on me the entire time I've had them. They can easily last many days in a row. The sound quality and noise cancelling were both good, nothing to complain about.The only thing that was immidiately annoying was the some of the features the headphones have. It can pause and play music automatically whenever you put it on or take it off. I didn't want to use that feature, so I turned it off in the app. However, it still makes a little 'bee dee boop' whenever you put the headphones on or off. Unfortunately, the detection isn't great, especially when lying down or with one side off your ear, so it repeately makes that noise without being able to see any way to turn that off.That was annoying, but okay to live with. However, with all three pairs that I've bought of this, within a month or two, every single one had at least one earpad break and at least some buttons fail to work. The fabric of the earpad doesn't get connected well to the foam, so it comes off over time and blocks the drivers. Eventually it comes off altogether and you need to replace the earpads. Even worse than this is that the buttons, especially volume up, volume down, and play/pause. These worked fine at first, but then they seized up a month or two into use and stop working. I've tried pressing them hard or in different directions, but none of these buttons work on any pair I have."
I bought these recently and Amazon was listed as the seller (I hunted around for that on purpose).  I gave them a fair try and the sound is very good (typical JBL) but they hurt my ears when wearing them.  I decided to return and am very unhappy to find that I can only return to UPS store if I pay $8 or bring label - QR code isn't enough.  Anyway - be forewarned if you are planning to give these a try.  Returns are more of a hassle than usual.
"Sound is okay. Compared to my previous Duet BT headphones, this set is heavier,  which i dont mind personally. I prefer that this model is covered in a mesh cloth and won't suffer from flaking pleather that the Duet had. Bass is kind of flat. Hard to find a balanced eq that I enjoy with these headphones. The right side on my pair is looser than the left and has a problem where if at a certain angle, will make the bass pulsate/pop in a very unpleasant way. It will work well enough for podcasts but I may feel unsatisfied with my daily music experience."
"Has a very unhelpful feature that pauses when it *thinks* you are removing the headphones from your ears. Sometimes, when I am getting up from a chair, the headset shifts somehow and pauses with a cheerful ""bloop!"" Then it resumes (because nothing happened and it thinks it has been re-seated properly), but I'm already trying to adjust the headphones to make it realize I want it to keep playing music, so it pauses again, and then I have to manually press the ""play/pause"" button to resume. I have long hair and sometimes if enough hair gets caught between the ear cup and my ear, it will randomly read the obstruction as another time to pause. Also, sometimes I want to pull one cup off and keep listening, and this feature makes that inconvenient.Bluetooth pairing is STUPID. I have the headphones paired to my phone and my laptop. Switching from phone to laptop takes 45 literal seconds. For some reason, the headphones need to stop dead for a period, then ""turn on"" from an already-on state, test out the noise-canceling, then announce that it's ready to pair, at which point I have to tell my laptop to connect (which I already did; this prompted the described preparation process from the headphones). Overall, it is less capable at remembering my devices and connecting right away than other, cheaper headphones.Sound is fine. It's fine. I bought these to replace $35 Skullcandy bluetooth headphones, and it's about on par. Nothing stands out as bad, but these cost a lot more than the Skullcandys and I don't perceive a difference in quality.Noise Canceling is ok. I can appreciate the differences between settings, and I can accept that maybe I'm just not the right person for the feature."
"Got these on sale for $65. For that price they're a good deal. I only use these for the gym.My experience after only 8 months of 5-day workouts per week:PROS-Battery life (the longest I've had in headphones and I've had Beats, Bose, etc.)-Audio quality is superb-Noise-cancelling is great. I'm able to drown out most of the music from the gym if I choose to do so-On-Ear is great for the gym! It stays on your head during workouts and is comfortable on the ears. Additionally, they're comparatively lightweight unlike the other over-the-ear  ""gym headphones"" that are heavy and fall off your head during workouts.-USB-C charging makes charging easy if you already have USB-C devices around the houseCONS:-The play and volume button is already broken. This was disappointing as one of the main reasons I bought these were so that I can keep my phone in my pocket at the gym. Now I have to pull out my phone every time I want to change the volume or when it auto pauses and I want to press play again (see below)-The auto play/pause function is way too sensitive and incredibly annoying! A slight tilt or turn of the head can activate it and stop your music randomly. On some days, it feels like it's got a mind of its own.Overall would buy again but for the right price ($50 or lower). It's not worth it for $65 or even for the regular Amazon price."
"I really tried to like these headphones. I used them for a while, and I was looking for headphones that are small, not huge or bulky. These are nice and small but I have a a couple ear piercings and these headphones caused some pain. They squished my ears a bit and made them uncomfortable. The features that I did like on these were the nice ambient sound that plays when you have the headphones in but aren‚Äôt playing anything, it‚Äôs like nature sounds and it‚Äôs nice and calming. I used these for runs and when there was some wind or a breeze it would go right through the headphones and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear the music. if I didn‚Äôt crank up the volume I would just hear the headphones kinda rattling against my ear & piercings. I really tried to like these because they‚Äôre nice & small & pairing them was really easy,  however the noise cancellation is not that great. I took these to the gym and I could hear a lot of noise around me, so again I had to crank up the volume to flush out the noise. Compared to my AirPods Pro, the noise cancellation was a bit weak. Noise cancellation is really important for me as I‚Äôll be wearing these to the gym and on the airplane, where I don‚Äôt want to hear anything but silence or my own audio. If noise cancellation isn‚Äôt too big of a concern for you then I recommend these but not if you have piercings like I do."
"In case this applies to the way that YOU use headphones, you should know about this flaw. I own TWO pair of these, along with 4 pair of other headphones, so I'm able to compare these JBL's with one another, and with all of the others that I own. Also, BOTH of the JBL's have the same problem, so apparently, I'm not dealing with a ""fluke"" that only applies to one pair that came defective from the factory.  The phones are nice, and I enjoy using them INSIDE my home. However, I cannot use them anywhere that there is more than a ""whisper"" of wind. As soon as any breeze blows over the phones, I hear horrible, loud noise in my ears, which almost hurts. I don't understand exactly what is happening, but it ""feels and sounds"" as though the wind sound is somehow being ""amplified"" by the headphones. Ouch! I'm guessing that this problem is related to the noise cancellation feature. I WANT TO BE PERFECTLY CLEAR that I'm talking about listening to recorded music or podcasts -- NOT talking on the phone -- so there is no microphone involved. On every occasion that I've taken these outdoors, I've given up after a few good ""blasts"" to my ears, then carried them with me during the rest of my walk. The wind was NOT severe...  just the usual breezes. And when this occurs, I'm walking, not running. So I'm not increasing the wind speed by running into the wind.  I do not have this problem with any of my other 4 pair of headphones, regardless of the brand. Even the $29.00 ones are quiet when the wind blows on them. I hope this is helpful information for those who desire to use their new headphones outdoors."
"I do like how tight it is on my head because i like to pull my hair back with my headphones, but it tends to pull out some of my hair whenever i take it off and it really hurts. It also annoys me so much when my headphones keep triggering siri for no reason or keeps spam pausing my videos randomly and i cant disable it. I really wish i could at least get rid of the siri problem, and i wish i could have my headphones NOT pull my hair out. It doesn‚Äôt pull it out in huge clumps, but it takes out enough for it to hurt. I wish it would stop pausing my videos whenever i unpause it. I also wish there was a way to disable siri/alexa in the app. The audio jack features is very nice, though because it‚Äôs easier to hook up to my school computer. I used to get jbl510s, which i have bought twice, but it pulled out my hair too much, and i thought it was nice thought to get  a noise canceling feature."
"I bought these headphones last November and they worked well for gym use and everyday usage. One thing that bugged me a little in the gym was when I would move and then the music would randomly stop. The motion was very sensitive so it would sometimes hinder my workout or make me just want to take them off completely. Other than that they worked good, up until a few months ago when they wouldn‚Äôt turn off or unpair from my phone and I would just have to let the battery die and then charge it again however, that was never a permanent fix. Suddenly they just stopped turning on. I would still be able to charge them and see that the charging light was on, but even still the headphones would not turn back on. I have tried force resetting them and nothing has worked. I would recommend to get the damage protection because they starting acting up around the time I bought them a year ago."
"The quality sound is ok, with the phone app you can eventually change the equalization.The noise cancellation feature is also ok since it's an on-ear headphones and can't cancel the noise as well as an over-eat headphones.The headphones has also a feature that stops the music when you take it off, the issue is that it is too sensitive. If you adjust the headphones on your ear, it will stop the music.  If you run, the bouncing can mess up with the sensor too. So, to me it's a totally useless feature and I deactivated it.I tested it in a conference, audio and mic work well. You can't speak softly tho otherwise the mic won't pick up.My main complaint is it is as hard as a piece of wood.Do you wear glasses? Forget it. It's impossible to wear this headphones with glasses. It will compress the temples and make your head explode lolI can wear this for a couple of hours top. Then my ears start hurting a lot.I just wished they used better padding, maybe made of gel which is better.Alexa and Google assistants are pretty useless to me. Jocking aside, tell me a mentally healthy person who ever used them lol JBL please focus on wearability and sound quality.So overall they are an ok headphones to buy at a discounted price. I would never buy them at full price."
"I have to use headphones because ear buds don't stay in my ear when I workout.  I have small ears. I have a pair of Sony headphones but they are to big. So when I saw these, I was game to try them out.  First, the fit is perfect but over  the last 4 months the connection to my phone is spotty.  I can be less than an inch from my phone and it will disconnect.  I'm not sure what the issue is but it's very frustrating. Other than that they are comfortable and the battery life is fantastic.  I can go months and not charge it. Since I only use them when I work out."
"I have had this product for one day. They are slightly uncomfortable and don‚Äôt stay on well, they fell off my head once and broke. Another thing to add is don‚Äôt run or even walk quickly with them, the wind like sound is very annoying. But overall the sound quality is fairly good and has an equalizer built into the app. L"
"Bought for the gym, while out running they had tons of wind noise, and when touch top to adjust they pause.  Overall wish had went with diffrent ones but they are ok."
"For the price, and the well-known brand, I expected these headphones to impress. At first, was impressed, but I quickly learned that every good thing about these headphones also has a downside.For example... the sound quality is nice enough, but I don't particularly notice a difference in quality between these and my previous, $15 bluetooth headphones from a generic brand. And, while you can remix the sound via the app, it really isn't worth remixing the levels constantly for every different song/genre you listen to, which is the only way I ended up being able to hear a distinct difference.Additionally, it is very frustrating and annoying that the functionality of these headphones is controlled only via an app. While the headphones are arguably usable out of the box, if you want to adjust the levels, or set up the voice assistant, or do anything more complex than simply connect to a device with bluetooth, you have to download the app and allow it location-track your headphones.I was also frustrated that the headphones did not come equipped with a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. While a cord was provided, the connecting hole on the headphones was much smaller than standard, so if the provided cord ever breaks, I will have to pay out of pocket to replace it.However the worst thing about these headphones is the auto-pause function. It is supposed to pause your music for you when you take the headphones off, however, what ends up actually happening is that every time you make a small motion with you head, or you stand up, or sit down, it beeps and pauses the music. Essentially, unless you sit stiff as a board while listening, it will pause. And there is no way to disable the sensor that makes it do this. Through, of course, the app, you can turn the setting off, however the sensor is still active, so it will click and beep every time you move, it just doesn't pause the music. And it is loud, and annoying, the volume of the beeps doesn't seem to change as you adjust the volume of the headphones.The only feature of these headphones that I couldn't find an issue with was the battery life. They have decent battery life, and even charge fairly quickly.If these were ten or even twenty dollar headphones, I might be more impressed, more willing to work with the issues they have, however, for what I paid (about $70), and what they're currently listed for (about $100), I would definitely advise you to spend your money elsewhere."
"Not bad, just don't expect hardly and bass and clarity. Good for low volume listening."
"If you're looking for some basic headphones with great sound, I think these definitely hit the mark. However, if you're looking for that plus comfort, probably not. They look cushy and nice, but as soon as I opened them I was disappointed. The ear pieces are very small and not very squishy the way I prefer and expected. The band is not cushioned at all to be honest. It is covered in a fabric but the cushioning on the top of the head is basically non existent unfortunately. Will update if I can adjust them and change the comfort level. They're also on a weird cusp of high tech and poor design, for instance if you lift them to adjust, it pauses. I assume it's to sense when you take them on and off but every small movement causes a disruption.**UPDATE**These headphones HURT. I decided to try them out in the gym and oh boy. If you're buying these because they look cushy and comfortable, don't fall for it like I did. The band doesn't sit still on the crown of your head and there's nothing there to help it do so. It's just plastic wrapped in a later of fabric. The ear pieces are way too small and press on all the wrong parts of your ear. Heaven forbid you have any piercings. I had to keep lifting them and adjusting them trying to get relief and give it a fair chance."
"Pros :- light weight- quite good sound quality (good base, clear mid and treble)- sturdy build quality, made with premium-feeling materials- long battery time- no heat build up around the earsCons :- not exactly comfy with small earcups and the headband that are not that cushy- noticeable hissing noise present when ANC is on.- ANC is not really good compared to entry-level headphones coming out these days such as JBL tune 670nc"
"Purchased these headphones over a year ago. I can hear ringing on the right hand side now when there's no music playing. Also, it keeps shutting off every so often and makes the sound that it's shutting down but it doesn't shut down. I can be listening to a song or watching a movie and it just shuts down for no reason. I have tried to download and update the software but it keeps saying that my software is up to date. I've tried some other troubleshooting but still does not work. Unfortunately, I cannot give this product a high rating due to it just being a year and already acting up. Pretty sad I normally like JBL products. Needless to say I will not recommend this."
The product is good but delivery from UPS was terrible they delivered it to my next door neighbor and put it on their back porch. I am thankful that my neighbor is honest and gave it to me. To sum it all up good headphones and UPS sucks
"this product has a good noise canceling technology but very uncomfortable to wear, the sponge is too small, and it hurt my ears, not very comfy, the bluetooth works well but because of the comfort factor I have to return this thing."
These are nice headphones- good sound and lightweight.  However they are terribly uncomfortable to wear for more than a very short period of time. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. I‚Äôm not the only one who doesn‚Äôt enjoy wearing them.  Disappointed because JBL usually have good products
"Four flaws that made me stop using.  (1) Too many buttons with similar feel on the on the edge of the right headphone make it hard to quickly, intuitively find the right button to due what you want to do.  (2)  sound cancellation doesn't work right in breezy conditions.  The sound of air movement is accentuated to a higher pitch.  The button to turn off the cancellation requires two pushes to do it, but they have to be timed just right with an interval between pushes.  (3)  The battery life is good, but the headphones don't audibly advise battery level when you turn them on or off so you still run the risk of unexpectedly running out of power when out and about.  The only way to know the battery level is in the app and even then it's a number in very small type, maybe hard to see for some people, and isn't labelled.  You must turn on the headphones before the app can work.  (4)  You can't use the Google Assistant if you're wearing a hood or anything else that brushes against the headphones as it triggers Assistant and cuts off whatever you want to listen to.  In sum, too many design flaws in this headphone."
These make my ears hurt so bad. They push on every part of the ear. I wish they felt better because the sound is really good.
I didn‚Äôt like how small the ear muffs felt and I had to be pretty precise how you wear them. Where as with bigger headphones they feel easier to wear.
"If you have very small ears on a very small head, these might be comfortable. Admittedly I made the mistake of purchasing ""on-ear"" rather than ""over-ear"" headphones, but the fact any on-ear headphones, let alone JBL's, are marketed as noise-cancelling, is laughable. I've bought three of JBL's bluetooth speakers and have had no complaints. I was expecting the same level of quality on these, but I was sadly mistaken.Bass response is impressive, at the expense of midrange frequencies and a muddy high-end. But there's only so much you can do with drivers of this size. For headphones of this price range, the sound is pretty good, though that's not saying much.A previous review mentioned being able to fall asleep wearing these, and I've done so a few times, always to daylong ear soreness the next day. The majority of the times I've tried to sleep wearing the headphones, I've wound up giving up and taking them off due to them randomly pausing my audio at the slightest turn of my head.The noise-cancelling effect is barely noticeable, and I frequently have to turn the feature off and on to check if it's even working. There's a reason Sony noise-cancelling headphones are regarded as the consumer standard, and if you're able, it's well worth saving up for those rather than settling for these."
I wanted to love these headphones but the reviews saying that the ear cushions hurt are true. I do not have big ears these headphones do not fit your ear properly and after about 2 hours of wearing them your ears will hurt. I bought these specifically for airplane travel because I use earbuds everyday and headphones for noise canceling purposes. The sound is great the noise canceling is great The size of the earphones are not. Unfortunately I would not recommend these for long-term use short-term use they're fine. If you're going to use these for a long flight be prepared for ears to hurt and be uncomfortable
"Decent headphones. I think more equipped for a teen or someone who wants to use them casually. After long period of time my ears hurt, the sound breaks up when there is wind or a lot of noise. Battery life is awesome. Probably going to return these though.Also the buttons were too small for me to easily feel which button was which or the buttons are too close together."
"There aren't a lot options available when it comes to smaller ""on ear"" type headphones so I tried these out but had to return them.  I thought they were decent until I went for a walk outside one day and every time a little wind came up it sounded like a tornado.  I guess they didn't put much insulation of any kind in the cup housing. Weird because they actually work pretty good at noise cancellation at the gym.  They sound really good but not significantly better than other BT headphones I have that cost quite a bit less.  On the plus side they almost never cut out like other phones I have. Maybe because there is no insulation to block the signal.  I didn't find them that comfortable, especially compared with the over the ear type. Just overall not worth the price even if they do have JBL on them.  I guess the JBL brand doesn't mean much when it comes to headphones."
I bought these for my son. They barely cover his ears. Unfortunately it was past the return date when I gave them to him on his birthday.
"I'm glad I got these on sale because I would not purchase for them full price. I've had them for a month now and here are some things I noticed:-noise cancellation is not great, I can hear the wind gushing around me, but I can't hear other people talking, so that's great!-they hurt my ears after maybe... half an hour? I wouldn't say I have large ears, they're actually kind of small, so this is unfortunate. They kind of feel like they're compressing my head, (again I'm not a large person).-sound quality, meh, doesn't get as loud as I'd like when I'm exercising or riding my bike, full volume is probably mid volume on my airpods-does not come with a case of baggie and the charging cable is only three inches longOverall, I think I'd enjoy these a lot more if they didn't hurt my ears!"
The product was not as good as expected from JBLThe ear pads are very small the sound quality was so so  for JBL had to purchase something else to get that sound.
"""Get help from your preferred voice assistant using your voice or with a tap on the earcup""That right there in the product description. It should read something like, bump or adjust your headphones or get them close to something and the music you are enjoying will stop. I'm returning these."
".. but they must be for kids not only do they do not cover my ears, they sit on them flattening the ear.  Very uncomfortable and also the band squeezes my brain so sound quality YES..  comfort and fit a NO"
I‚Äôve had these headphones for less than a week and they‚Äôre already making a weird noise when noise canceling is on. The left headphone makes a quiet thumping noise when noise canceling is on even when videos are playing. I haven‚Äôt dropped these headphones once but JBL has been giving me so much problems. I‚Äôve bought JBL tune buds and those also crapped out not even a month into owning them. Never buying JBL headphones/earbuds
"Less than 30 day update: downgrade to 1 star.The auto pause is terrible. You lay down on a bench for working out and it‚Äôll pause your music.Battery life, what battery? Full charged I got less than 10 hours with ANC off. Went to the gym today, turned them on showed 30%. 30 min in dead.So overall these are good, but not great. These are solely gym headphones and they lack a lot for this particular use for me.Pros: sound is nice, good bass, ANC works awesome, talk through works well.Cons: as a ‚Äúsmaller head‚Äù man 7 1/4‚Äù hat size, was hoping as on ear they‚Äôd stay on my head during up and down movements such as sitting up off a bench or bending over, they slide off fairly easily. Really making them not working at all for in gym.App is good, pairing was super easy as expected.Have to give 3 stars due to them not staying on my head."
"Fantastic sound for price, but the headphones themselves have issues with keeping connection, turning off & on, & activating buttons that have not been pressed such as Siri voice control. I downloaded the jbl app to disable the auto play/pause, but it still randomly pauses after glitching. Since I use these for lifting & studying, you can see how frustrating it is when you‚Äôre mid set & your headphones start beeping and then pause your music or even TURN OFF at 100% charge.This is the second time I‚Äôve given JBL a chance for headphones. Last pair I bought were $200 & they broke within 2 months while on deployment. Stuck in the middle of the ocean.JBL continues to disappoint. Thank you."
"I have been looking for a solution that can work with my phone and my PC, and these do the job. Sound is pretty decent, and moving back and forth is reasonably easy. Battery life is good enough for a day (with a break to charge at lunch). Main problem is that while you can extend the arms on each side to get a custom fit, the cups still are tight on the ears and get to be uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. Take a break and leave them off, and then you're good to go again - but it would be nice if they either had more cushioning or used a material that was more ""ear friendly""."
"Had these for barely 2 months. The battery life is simply amazing I use them for multiple trips to the gym and they've never dropped below 50% even after weeks on end of usage. The noise canceling is sufficient. They aren't BOSE quality but it'll defenitely be helpful on a plane or in a noisy environment. Sound Quality is pretty great considering the price point. My biggest gripe is the fact that the volume down button on these broke literally 2 months into ownership. The headphones still work and I can turn them down on my phone, but I am out of luck when I pair them to my TV. Don't know if poor quality control or just a crappy build."
These actually drive me insane because they pause randomly all the time. Like many times a minute and then it will play again. I don't know what to do about it. I don't know if it is just the pair I have that is faulty or if this is an issue across the board. Battery life is good though.
"I've been looking for a pair of on-ear headphones for casual use to listen to music/watch shows on my phone/tablet. My number one priority in my search has been comfort, with sound quality a close second. For me, over-the-ear headphones start to hurt by my jaw within a few minutes, and in-ear get uncomfortable after a couple hours. I also wanted to keep the cost ~$100 maximum. After doing research on multiple options and brands, I eventually purchased both this product and the JBL Tune 660NC to compare. While these headphones did have superior sound quality, they were tight on my head and overall less comfortable than the JBL Tune 660NC, so I ultimately returned them."
"These headphones sound good with Noise Cancellation except the normal, inherent white noise in the background that most headphones with NC make. However the sound in ambient mode or with noise cancelling mode turned off, sounds terrible with overbearing mid and upper boomy bass that makes the sound quality muddy and unlistenable. Very inconsistent sound quality between Noise Cancelling mode, Ambient Mode and Off.I wanted these headphone mainly to use to listen to music or movies in ambient mode so I could still hear the kids. With the sound quality so bad, I don't want to even use these.In contrast, the JBL Tune 660NC headphones and JBL Tune 230NC TWS earbuds sound excellent and don't change the sound quality from different modes or off. These 2 sound excellent and are much better than the JBL Live 460NC!"
"Won‚Äôt shut off, I might have a defected product, other than that they are really painful to wear for a hour. Do not buy! Save your money! If the seller sees this I want a refund! I‚Äôm losing faith in Amazon, they should be embarrassed they allowed this product to be sold."
"The pain they caused my ears was enough for me to return them, but I decided to give them one more shot. The second time I wore them the feature that pauses your music when you take them off kept getting triggered somehow. I couldn‚Äôt keep my music playing. Since they don‚Äôt fit around your ear they move a bit more and every time they move a millimeter they shut off my music. I then have to fidget with it to get to play my music for quite a while. Maybe there is a way to turn off that feature with the app, but since I‚Äôm already returning them, I won‚Äôt even look into. Don‚Äôt plan on that feature working well.Noise cancelling seems fine. They are the first noise cancelling headphones I‚Äôve tried so I don‚Äôt have much to compare to. The sound seems nice. But again, I‚Äôve only had cheap headphone before. I got them because they have a designated on and off button. My cheap ones didn‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm returning these and starting the search over. Sad because Black Friday deals are over now."
Spend your money on something more high quality. It randomly cuts out on music and began glitching (static in the ear) a month in to use. For reference I use them for a few hours a day or less. They have been taken care of super consistently and should not be glitching already. I do not suggest buying this product.
It did not meet expectations. Really needed much better noise canceling feature.
Headphones come with some form of gesture on off feature that is very poorly designed and continuously causes headphones to turn off during normal everyday use
The ear piece on these headphones is so small. Even for a child
"It must have bad wiring, it shuts off intermittently ever since the purchase, it's only gotten worse over time...It does sound fantastic while working, but then shuts off..."
Good noise cancelation battery life and sound for the price but the auto pause and play feature is junk. It's constantly pausing while I'm working and I'm not in a position to restart it for long periods of time and doesn't actually work as intended when you take off the headset. I disabled it in the JBL app but the play/pause button is absolutely tiny and in between other tiny buttons and is very hard to use.
"If I hear that recording (the Google Assistant is not connected) one more time I'm gonna trash these phones! This is the MOST annoying pair of headphones I have ever owned! That's really unfortunate because everything else is 5 üåü perfect: they're beautiful, sound awesome, punchy bass, and started out relatively uncomfortable but my ears got used to them! If you're looking to use only to listen to audio I wouldn't recommend! I thank JBL though for this learning experience. If I ever purchase another pair of headphones, they WON'T have built in Voice Assistant."
I wanted something with better sound quality than my Raycon earbuds. These definitely have better sound quality and the app lets you set the equalizer the way you want.My biggest issue is the way they slide back and forth on your head at the gym. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt fit my head right. I‚Äôm sure if I wore them over a cap they wouldn‚Äôt slide but who wants to wear a cap at the gym.I haven‚Äôt decided if I‚Äôm sending them back. I may just keep them for plane rides and when I‚Äôm working in the yard.
They sound is great but they do not cancel any kind of outside noise I swear it‚Äôs louder with them on I have a older pair of jbl over the ear headphones that cancel the noise way better and they are advertised for it
My pair had an electrical problem which I'm glad because they are uncomfortable smashed against my ear.  Wind blows right in as well.  I ended up getting 660's which I like much better.  These might be fine for kids but I'd say that they are too expensive for them.  I'm not sure why they designed them this way.
This product did not drown out outside activity.
"Have had these for over 6 months to replace an older pair of JBJ headphones. Difference between the past pair and this is the ear detection. They hold up well, but it's constantly beeping, pausing and playing, some times dozens of times in a row. It's super frustrating and I'll never be buying a JBL product with this feature again. Avoid if you want a simple pair of headphones that don't require phone app support to work right."
"Owned the headphones for approx. 8 months when power button (which slides) stopped working. At first, had to work the button back and forth and after about 20 times, they MIGHT come on. Once they‚Äôre on, you couldn‚Äôt turn them off. Had to wait for them to time out. Finally power button stopped working completely. Tried all the JBL instructions to reset the headphones. Nothing worked. Had to throw them away. Spend the extra money for a real headphone company like Beats, Sony or Bose. (Owned all of those in the past and they were all great)"
"These headphones are a really nice quality. They look great and sound great; however, I haven‚Äôt had these for a year and already the power button is broken. Also the auto play/pause function is way to sensitive. I kept having to press play every time I turned my head. I think I would prefer a simpler design. Too many buttons for my taste."
"Sound is good.  But, the padding for comfort is not good."
CAN NOT WEAR THESE HEAD PHONES VERY LONG BEFORE THY BEGIN TO HURT YOUR EARS.... COVERS ARE TO SMALL....CONTROLS ARE HARD TO OPERATE WHILE WEARING THESE PHONES ..... THINGS GET ALL MESSED UP PUSHING THE MANY FUNCTIONS.... GET THIS ....THE JBL APT DOES NOT WORK WITH MY ANDROID SAID INCOMPATIBLE/ DISCOUNTED....  WHAT?? WITH OUT JBJ APT FOR THESE HEAD PHONE MODEL I CAN NOT CONTROL FUNCTIONS .... CALLED THE HELP NUMBER ...I GOT INDIA THE GUY COULD NOT SPEAK ENGLISH OR UNDERSTAND ENGLISH ..... I TIED TO FIND OUT WHERE I COULD GET A  JBL APT THAT WOULD WORK WITH MY MODEL # HEAD PHONES ....  AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS THE FELLOW SAID JBL WOULD GET BACK WITH ME ..... YEAH.... THREE WEEKS NOW NO CALL OR INFO FROM JBL  ....... THIS STINKS ...JBJ .... I THOUDH YOU WERE BETTER .....
"I really hate these headphones, at first they were good, audio was good, they didn't hurt my ears, the noise canceling was good.But it all amounts to nothing because I can't listen to a single freaking song or anything without the stupid things pausing every 30 seconds.These are waay to expensive for what you get. And I wouldn't even want them for free as again they can't manage to do the one thing I want them to do, which is play audio for more then 30 seconds."
"These headphones hurt my ears because the ear rest are so small, which kind of defeats the purpose of me getting them as I only got them because my airpods hurt my ears. They also pause randomly a lot, but besides that the sound quality is decent and battery life is great. Next time I‚Äôm buying headphones I‚Äôll just invest a little more money in them, you get what you pay for."
"Sound quality is pretty good, comparing to my Sennhesier Momentum 2 headphones. I bought them because my Sennheisers make my ears too hot sometimes, being that they're over-ear. These JBLs however put too much pressure on my ears. They have very thin padding and too much tension. Otherwise they seem decent, cheaper than the Sennheisers, keep ears cooler, pretty good sound and more bass. Battery life is supposed to be a lot better but I haven't really confirmed that personally.Overall I cannot recommend these headphones unless you only use them a couple hours at a time. I'm going to try and modify them to have a better cushion."
JBL headphones cut out if you move your head an inch. They claim they are noise cancelling but they don‚Äôt even cover your ears. The look big in the Amazon photo but the photo is deceptively shot they are way too small for a man. I got sick just after they arrived and the one month return window close now I‚Äôm stuck with trash headphones. I told Amazon I‚Äôd return and pay the diff for some quality headphones. No progress yet just red tapes d stupid rules that drive away customers.
"I'm a huge JBL fan, so I thought I'd give these a shot. They're affordable, and sound great genuinely. But unfortunately, gonna have to return because after an hour my ears hurt! Would not recommend for this sore reason. It's a shame because the sound quality is great."
Super uncomfortable and ear crushing; especially uncomfortable when wearing glasses. These are tiny.
"These earphones have a feature where you take the left earphone off your ear and whatever you're listening to pauses. Nice right, NOPE! these dang things pause all the time for no reason. It's getting to the point I don't even want to use them. I almost want to give them a one star because it makes listening to anything impossible. You know what, yes a one star."
"The sound was fine, I got it for noise canceling though. It hurt my ears after a couple hours of wearing them"
"Great sound and noise cancelling. i wish you could adjust the fitting to a more custom level. They sit tightly on ears, and ears begin to hurt after a short time. I dont even have a big head. if i had known, i would have chosen an over ear model option."
"If you plan on using these paired with a single device, sound quality and construction are good. If you have multiple devices to connect, prepare to pull your hair out."
"This is what I get for trying to go cheap. I would not recommend these to any runners! Idk if it‚Äôs the bounce when running or wind but the sound constantly turns off and on when running and you hear the beep as if you‚Äôre pressing buttons but you‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs very frustrating causing me to have to try and tap the headphones or buttons or press play over and over again while I‚Äôm trying to run. Wish I had returned these during the return window, but I guess you get what you pay for."
"Great sound, comfortable, about what you would expect for headphones over 100$ but for the past 8-9 months that I‚Äôve had these headphones I‚Äôve been on the verge of taking them off my head and throwing them on the ground Andy Sandberg style. THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY PAUSE AND UNPAUSE WITH THE SLIGHTEST HEAD MOVEMENT. The best part, you‚Äôll go days without it happening. But when you realllly need them most, time and time again, you move your head too far to the left (pause), back up (play), to the right (pause). I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can go before I obliterate these garbage cans. The only thing stopping me is knowing I spent 140$ on them."
"If JB takes a page out of the Stats Audio B headphones that are truly loose and comfortable, these headphones would rock. Too bad Status doesn't make them anymore. Updated note July 22, 2024.  These earphones hurt the freaking cartilage of the middle of the ear. Not a nice feeling at all. Noise cancelling is incredible.  But JBL if you read this, go get Status B blue tooth headphones and copy their design."
I used the headphones for one day. It is NOT noise cancelling headphones. The ear pads hurt my ears to having a slight headache. I'm not familiar with JBL product but I didn't want to spend too much money on the headset. I guess you get what you pay for. Don't waste your money.
"The design isn't good. They're uncomfortably small and will hurt your ears. The noise canceling is not that great. Compared to previous headphones I've used, the design along makes them not good at maintaining noise cancelling (High wind . The equalizer is a good feature and I wish more headphones had an app with this feature. The voice assistant is bad. You cannot deactivate it and it is very sensitive. You will be interrupted many times by alexa or siri just because some object slightly brushed up against the left earphone. I will commend the battery life, as these headphones last quite a long time.Overall, I would recommend you get something else."
I loved my previous JBLs and then I got these ones and they hurt my ears. Too tight and designed for small ears I didn‚Äôt believe the review I read before but they are right. Also the buttons on the side are really sensitive and requires a lot of knowing how to work I am going back to my JBL660
"The sound was great, and the headphones were easy to use. I like them a lot. The drawback was how they fit on my big old ears. They were too small and I prefer the over the entire year style."
-comes with a very short charging cable-noise cancellation is great however the volume on these is not the best. Still loud and clear but my AirPods are louder-comfortable-decent quality for the price-charge lasts foreveeeeeeeer üëç
"They‚Äôre good headphones. For me, they‚Äôre not nearly what I expected for noise canceling. And when I am on the phone and there is background noise the person I am speaking to cannot hear me. So, idk. Those are why I got the headphones. But they play music ok"
"I really wanted these to be my walking-around-the-city headphones. Lots of positives. Good sound and 2 noise cancellation settings, which work well when the air is calm. I really like that playback pauses when I remove them. Unfortunately, these do not do well in the wind. No matter what noise cancelling setting I choose, the headphones seem to amplify the wind, which drowns out whatever I am listening to. It's so bad, I'm guessing the engineers didn't give this a thought. Oh well, guess I'll keep looking."
I have a small head and these were so tight I couldn't wear them for more than 30 minutes at a time. Sound very good though. Maybe better suited for small children.
"The most UNCOMFORTABLE headphones I have ever used. They barely fit the ear and are way too tight. Adjusting them is impossible since the design was made to be like that. My head size is average and my ears are slightly smaller than average but the headphones were still too small and uncomfortable. I used them for less than 10minutes and i already started having pain in my ears.Another problem is that you NEED to download the JBLHeadphone app to change audio settings and turn off noise cancellation. Which already come set and cannot be change on the headphones themselves. The fact you need to download an app (made just for headphones) to fully enjoy a product you paid for is ridiculous and unnecessary.The headphones also have this very annoying feature called ""Auto Play&Pause"" which beeps then stops the audio of whatever you're listening to whenever you move the headphones or your body. This feature CANNOT be turned off despite doing so in the JBL app. It's built into the hardware and will continue to beep and pause audio.Overall, this is a terrible product not worth buying. I don't think the buyer's experience was even consider when making this crap."
Adaptive means you can pause/play audio by speaking or touching the earphones.The sensor in the pair I returned was possibly damaged by sweat or was broken.My audio would start and stop randomly and for no apparent reason.
They are good quality headphones for the price I got them at but they‚Äôre really finicky. They‚Äôll pause my music outta of no where while I‚Äôm doing something or even if I‚Äôm just sitting still. Gets really annoying when doing tasks.
These headphones won‚Äôt charge which is pretty disappointing.
"Haven't tried them yet, but will update when I do. I know I should have read tiny little details. But I was pretty disappointed this came with no type of case for it. Even a cheap velour type bag."
"I bought this headphone and the volume button simple stopped working. Open a request for a replacement and it they replace it. After some weeks, the volume button on the replaced unit also stopped working (I never use this button since it‚Äôs always connected via Bluetooth). I opened a new request for replacement and this time the Customer support was terrible, giving me misleading information and being not very clear on the next steps - promising 2nd day air delivery and it‚Äôs been a week and I still don‚Äôt have my replaced headphone. Now they are saying they need to confirm the receipt with the carrier in order to start the replacement process, and the carrier is presenting a ‚Äúslightly delay‚Äù. The messages they are sending are pre-written templates that one day say ‚ÄúX‚Äù the other day ‚Äúfor X, we need Y‚Äù. Don‚Äôt waste time buying this product because if you have any issues with the unit you will have a bad time fixing it with a robot customer support."
Like the sound and ease of Bluetooth connections. They were uncomfortable and have to remove after a short time and they shut off with the least movement. Returned and purchased the JBL 650 over the ear version and love them. Comfortable and do not shut off.
"These headphones have great sound quality and noise cancelation. However, they fit extremely tightly. I have a small head and they felt uncomfortable at the end of a plane ride."
"The headphones worked OK for a  month or so. After that I began to have a hard time pairing them. Then about a month later they just started not working well. The signal kept going in and out and then just disconnecting, Overall I was very disappointed with this product."
I can‚Äôt run workout or even vacuum with these headphones cutting out on me
They broke within 5 months - no sound coming out of right side.
"Overall opinion:These are entry-level Bluetooth headphones that are not too comfortable. They begin to irritate my ears after 45 minutes. In addition, the headphones compress tightly over the ears.Pros:Sleek designFast chargingLong battery lifeExcellent microphone for phone callsCons:Uncomfortable after 45 minutesThe JBL app is weakIt's a challenge to switch between my laptop and my phoneI have to connect Bluetooth to my phone manually every timeFinal verdict:It gets two stars because of the discomfort. Although I like the phone call quality, it is a hassle to switch to Bluetooth on my phone most of the time.  Finally, the sound quality is average. Therefore, I believe it is wise to spend a little more money on headphones of better quality."
Bought these in October 2023 and they stopped working completely in August 2024.  These didn't last very long for me.  I would not recommend these.
"I‚Äôd caution against purchasing this product. Any problems within the return policy of this company would seem to require anyone in Hawaii to pay for the return and basic box size costs around $24.00 with upwards of $4.00 to insure it because it‚Äôs over $200.00. That‚Äôs just if you decide you need to return it. The Bose warranty is decent but my experience is that the warranty requires you to return it to Bose first and then they replace it and it all takes about 60days that you won‚Äôt have this super pricey headphones. Having said that, here‚Äôs my review: the sound quality is average. Even using their Bose app the most you can do is choose presets and adjust the  EQ a bit. The internal ai is difficult to hear, interrupted Siri when phone calls come in. Even though it interrupted and overrode SIRI it didn‚Äôt automatically switch from Audible app to the call! It just keeps repeating that you have a call and it tells you that you‚Äôre connected to your iPhone. Um, not sure what good that was supposed to be but it‚Äôs amazingly irritating and you still have to MANUALLY choose the headphones on the phone app. The voice is robotic and,unlike Siri, doesn‚Äôt do anything to help you answer the call. During the time that the headphones are spouting this silliness, the buttons to answer the call DON‚ÄôT WORK. The noise cancellation is not even as good as my NC25‚Äôs and although it has a ‚Äúmodes‚Äù setting on the app with a ‚Äúwindy conditions‚Äù setting in its ‚ÄúOutdoor‚Äù mode, it doesn‚Äôt do much to increase or improve sound quality within the headphones because it doesn‚Äôt really block outside noise well. When I need noise cancellation I really want the headphones to actually block all noise so I can meditate or listen to books or music without any interference or distractions. This headphones doesn‚Äôt do that job. The mic quality is scratching and picks up all the noise around you during the call you finally manually accept because the voice is nattering on unintelligibly and actually ends up amplifying the sounds around you. That‚Äôs terrible üò£ the ear size is adjustable upwards or down but the inner ear area isn‚Äôt padded at all and the padding on the outer ears is minimal and not very comfortable so that my tiny ears kept rubbing against the inner plastic and ended up being painful after a bit. I couldn‚Äôt experience the length of time that it would keep doing something because IT DID NOT HAVE A CHARGER BLOCK and I wasn‚Äôt able to get it to work with any adapter I own (6 different ones) so it never could charge and the charger light wouldn‚Äôt go on. And after 24 hours it was still at 40% according to the headphones voice‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt say much about its durability except that the plastic ear parts felt flimsy and it would need delicate handling. The headband squeezed my head very badly (I sincerely have a pretty small head width and I wear a size small hat size to give you an idea of my head size!) and after about 30 minutes it hurts to the point of pain and I took it off until the pain decreased. no matter how I tried to adjust it using the ‚Äúsizer‚Äù parts on the top on both sides, this badness was the usual. The volume control worked but because the app doesn‚Äôt do much besides let you adjust the eq a bit, I didn‚Äôt get the sound that was clear and bottom heavy. This box didn‚Äôt come with ANY startup manual except a bit of info about their app that‚Äôs on the box but the app doesn‚Äôt really tell you how to do anything besides check battery and use preset settings. the app doesn‚Äôt do much so I couldn‚Äôt even get sound equal to an NC25 which is a super inexpensive headphone. It‚Äôs not worth the price or the bother. In this price range you should get premium service that doesn‚Äôt take 60 days turnaround that leaves you without your headset for 2 months and requires you to send your headset first in order to get the replacement. It‚Äôs possible that because I‚Äôm not rich I just don‚Äôt have enough of something in the qualifications department to rate this headphones properly but if Bose is catering to ‚Äúregular people‚Äù like me who wants the best quality sound at the $300.00 price range then maybe they should think a bit about what people they want as customers. I‚Äôm sadly disappointed in Bose over this headset. I‚Äôve owned a couple of their clock radios and they are awesomeness incarnate! These headphones just kinda don‚Äôt have the same Bose that we‚Äôve all come to expect and deserve. I wish they‚Äôd just redesign the thing and move forward."
"First I want to start by putting a disclaimer that I am by no means an expert on headphones but go by a lot of research and personal experience. These headphones were very comfortable and the battery lasts forever. It also charges fast. It‚Äôs  build was nice just plastic and kind of cheap feeling. It tended to slip a lot on my head but it didn‚Äôt make my ears warm or anything or yank hairs out. It also doesn‚Äôt squish your ears/head. So on the comfort aspect 4/5. The sound however is another story. First of all, if you play music above 20% volume everyone can hear it because the sounds leaks. When connected to any Apple product the sound diminishes greatly in quality. You can barely hear whatever you‚Äôre playing (again at levels that don‚Äôt leak sound) and it sounds very far away and muffled. I commute a lot so this was a deal breaker for me. However on my HP laptop it worked like a dream, bass was great, but it still leaked sounds when playing at half the volume or less. Again, that was super annoying. Connectivity wise everything went smoothly and this far I haven‚Äôt had an issue. The aware mode is kind of staticky and windy sounding and not really good like the AirPods Pro. The noise cancellation is decent but you can still hear a lot of things and doesn‚Äôt really cancel much out, the AirPods have much better noice cancellation. Overall, it depends on what you‚Äôre wanting to use it for. These slip a lot on my head when working out and for commuting just wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for. I got them on sale and still don‚Äôt feel $200 justifies the cost for what I got. Will be returning giving three starts because of comfort."
"I bought this to upgrade to wireless from my earlier QC model.  First, I found out it won't connect to my computer for Zoom meetings.  Not PC compatible for some reason.  Tried to connect it to Bose Music App, now just Bose, but that app CANNOT send music directly to their own headphones, which is very lame.  You have to pair them with a Bose Soundbar, then mute the soundbar.  I had the soundbar connected to my TV's ARC HDMI port, but it started turning the TV off randomly.  That quit when I disconnected it.  So, you have to have some other WiFi compatible Bose device to send music to your headphones without phone calls or video games interrupting the music.  This info came directly from the Bose help desk.Also, SoundTouch does not work with them and when I went to the Bose Connect app, it told me there was a better app and loaded Bose Music app which doesn't run the headphones directly.  LAME!Finally, the last time I was in a Best Buy, the tech told me to buy Sonos, not Bose.  I should have listened then.  I have three kinds of Bose devices that don't talk to each other.  So LAME!"
"I purchased these headphones for the purpose of working from home in a call center environment for 8hr a day. My main reasons for purchasing were: to go wireless, and increase comfort. I am often in meetings and calls for hours at a time, and the headphones my organization provided were painful.On my first day of use, I noticed a couple issues. First issue is that on Windows and Mac the microphone volume is far too low. Nobody on Microsoft Teams or my call center software could hear me. I needed to install a separate application to artificially boost the microphone by around 20dB. Second issue I noticed is regarding having two devices connected at the same time. Example: If you are actively streaming audio from a Windows computer, and then your iPhone gets a text notification, the headphones will cut the audio from the Windows computer to play the iPhone notification. When this happens, your Bluetooth connection either drops, or the audio quality gets very bad (crackling, stutters, etc) and you need to disconnect/reconnect devices.On my second day of use, I experienced random drops in audio quality and needed to power off/on the headphones 3 times.Bose has many suggestions and troubleshooting steps in their support articles, which I have gone through. That being said, these headphones are fine. I will keep them and enjoy them for my work (when they are working) and enjoy them for traveling. That being said, I do wish I would have gone with a Microsoft Teams certified device instead for my purposes. This product appears to be more intended for casual use as opposed to professional use.The sound quality is very good compared to my Sennheiser HD598. Audio is very clear, especially in the mid to high frequencies. Other reviews mention a lack of bass, but I found the bass to be MORE than enough. The active noise cancellation has a huge impact on music listening; I feel like the sound stage is very wide as I can hear many details in songs I haven't picked up on before.Noise cancellation is insanely good. I don't have a great basis for comparison, but it's almost eerie how silent the world is when you have these on. At most, I can barely hear a super loud fan a few feet away, or I barely hear the faucet when washing dishes. I look forward to using these while doing chores around the house!Comfort and fit is great for only 2 days of use. They are much more comfortable than I expected, as I have a big head and typically need to ""break in"" headphones a little bit longer. I had these headphones on for hours and they didn't give me any issues.Overall, despite the annoying connection issues I have with these things I am going to keep them. I like them enough to where I am willing to work around these issues for now. The next time I need to travel these are going to be a life saver. I can't wait to finally sleep on planes! If you're working from home, I would recommend seeking a Microsoft Teams certified pair of headphones."
"The sound of these headphones is pretty good, but there are a few annoying issues. The first one is, if you don't switch the headphones off, they will kill their own battery overnight, even if there is no other device for them to connect to. This is the only set of headphones that I've ever had with this issue, and it's kind of unacceptable. The second issue is when the battery is low, a very annoying robotic voice will scream that the battery is low every 2-3 minutes until you plug them in. This leads to the third issue: why is the voice for a pair of headphones in 2024 (or even the past few years) so horrible? I can't understand anything the robotic voice is saying, besides ""awah air"" which apparently means aware? And ""BATTERY LEW"". You'd expect much better quality from Bose to be honest, and these little features do make a difference, so be aware."
I use these primarily for working (10+ hours per day). Overall I think they are fine headphones but I wouldn't be as ok with them if I paid full price. They are lightweight which makes them feel cheap if you're used to more hefty headphones. If you're taking a phone call outside the mic picks up the slightest breeze and makes conversations almost impossible. Battery life could be better. My old headphones lasted 2 weeks without a charge but these ones need a charge every other day (again for 10 hour days). Sound quality is fine but sometimes the bass does something funky and the static is really bad.I purchased these for 50% off and they're just good enough for me to not send them back. If I paid full I would probably have returned them for something else.
"So for under 200 I think they're okay. Comfortable, decent battery life, and sound is solid though less bass than others around the pp. Base is still okay depending on what Music app you're using.The app is less interesting than others and very basic. It also forces you to agree to everything or you can't use it which should be illegal. You buy an item then without you're knowledge when buying it, in order to use it with all its features you must agree to all terms of some always changing nonsense.Like other headsets it uses fake leather unfortunately which will peel eventually.The Bluetooth is snappy and seems to be solid. Overall it's a solid headset and all of them have issues imo."
"I think overall, the sound and feel is great for the price. Noise cancellation is some of the best I've used. I paid $200 and am overall happy.The biggest issue is latency. For me it's noticeable for videos, games, and even apps like duo lingo.And that comes down to lack of aptX LL support. It includes aptX Adaptive support which is not the same thing. aptX Adapative only works on a very small amount of phones that are Snapdragon sound certified.If you only use these for music/podcasts, not bothered by latency, have one of the few phones that support aptX adaptive, or just use wired, you'll have a better time."
"These headphones have the best sound quality I've heard for their price range. However, I sent the first pair back for replacement, because I continually had Bluetooth connectivity issues. Either they would not connect, or the connection was bad (tinny sound or static). The second pair started doing the same thing. I solved the issue by making sure that there was only one connection at a time. According to the documentation, these headphones should seamlessly connect to two devices. I made sure that the phone app was forgotten, and only connect to my Roku device. This seems to have solved the issue. Not good, considering these are Bose products. You'd expect better.Update: After using for a month, my solution of only using one connection (connect to one device only) has been rock solid. Connects every time to my Roku device, and the sound quality is excellent."
"I wanted over the ear headphones because I worry the in ear could cause damage. Especially when listening loudly as I do. Here are my pros and cons.Pros: Sound certainly is good.Cons: To large for my head. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù. Not that height necessarily translates to head size, but wanted to give some reference point. Headbands fit me fine, although always slide off. The upper part on the headphones don't even rest on my head in the lowest position.Can hear the music external to the user which doesn‚Äôt happen with earbuds.Bose made a huge miss on this one. When resting the headphones around your neck, say like when waiting for your plane, the ear part turns up to rest comfortably against your next or shoulder. But why turn UP. The padded headphone is then facing up. So let‚Äôs say something gets spilled nearby or you are running through rain, it exposes the headphone and padding to damage. If the earpieces turned down it would be padded against the neck/shoulder and much more comfortable.This is my first on/over ear headphone purchase. Would not buy these again and would look to another popular brand."
"First one should know that when one gets the apps to actually work (there a new app) and  one finds the equalization one finds it pretty meager.  The noise cancellation is good.  But given the cost of these headphones I cannot say these Bose‚Äôs are worth it. The cord for non-Bluetooth applications is proprietary to cost you money down the road.  The wired impedance match to a big screen tv is terrible. You TV has to be up full to hear thru the Bose just modestly. AND noise cancellation doesn‚Äôt work when on the wire.  I also find the headphones uncomfortable after a couple hrs.  I would definitely not buy these again knowing what I know now.I found the chat support to be near useless.  The telephone technical support was good, but I really should have needed to call them at all to untangle their apps and get them to actually work.  Then there‚Äôs the legalities:You should be aware that Bose is surveilling you. Parts of the agreement is vague enough one really doesn‚Äôt know how much the devices is surveiling.  I can say if I read this agreement before buying these phones I never would have selected the Boses product. Before buying this product you should  examine their privacy statement at their website. Unless you agree, their app which you must use to EQ these phones, will not work. These headphones produce far too much base to not use their app for EQ.Their agreement statement is lengthy.  Here are some things you must agree to:Information about your access to and use of Bose websites and emails, such as your IP address, browser language, the state or country from which you accessed the Services, software and hardware attributes (including device IDs, operating system, and browser type), referring and exit URLs, the links you click and files you download, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the terms you use in searches on our websites, the date and time you accessed our websites or opened our emails, and other similar information.Financial and transactional information, such as credit card information, and purchase and transaction history."
"My biggest gripe with these headphones is if you leave them sitting with a full charge , they have no battery retention. Pick them up in a couple days and the battery is 0 again. They charge kind of slowly. You cannot use them while being charged, and the headphones don‚Äôt even connect to the app while charging. They go into complete ghost mode. This results in me not being able to use the headphones as often as I‚Äôd like to use them, considering how much I paid. Also, this might not be good for a person with big ears. I feel like my ears are on the bigger side and after an hr or so of wearing these, it can start to feel some ear discomfort.  They use like 16 different commands, all through just 2 buttons, and I can‚Äôt ever remember the freakin Morse code secret handshake button dots and dashes they want me to remember to be able to take a call or use Siri. Volume is the easiest one, it has its own two dedicated buttons.Pros, they are comfortable, and the sound is good. Music sounds awesome. The noise canceling is good, I‚Äôd say it blocks out about 70-80% of ambient noise. I like the case and how they fold up to be pretty slim, so I‚Äôve brought them along on many trips, you‚Äôre just SOL if you forgot to charge."
"This was my third Bose noise-canceling set of headphones so I am very familiar with the feel and this set isn't like my others. Thankfully, I bought them as a back-up pair so I don't have to wear them as much. I get a headache every time I put them on. The sound is fine but I wear these headphones up to eight hours at a stretch so I am not happy with the quality."
"They work like head phones should. I can't see much difference with less expensive headsets. Maybe these have bells and whistles I don't care about. As a pair of plain headphones, though, they do the job. As noise cancellation out of the box, not impressed. I can still hear my neighbors radio and hammering on his house.!!"
"Purchased two Bose QC Headsets. Trying on the first pair and comparing them to our other fleet of headphones I was impressed, all good. The second pair, not so much. The second pair were muffled and had hardly any bass response, So I returned the faulty pair and tuis 3 star review."
"Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling HeadphonesI am part of the Insider community participate; I received the Bose Quiet Comfort Wirelsee Noise Cancelling Headphones as part of a promotion.The set up is very easy, just scan the code in the box and put the headset on to connect through Bluetooth.  I had 70% when I received my Bose headphones.The Bose Quiet Comfort headphones are very comfortable for extended period of time to listening to music. The quality of the Bose headphones is excellent!  The headphone is adjustable to fit comfortably on the head and ears, with or without wearing glasses. I own quite a few sets of brand earbuds and headphones.  WOW!  I must say the Bose Quiet Comfort are the best sounding headsets I've ever owned.  You can easily adjust the SoundTouch to your likings, I like to use the bass booster setting in the Bose app because I like more bass. The music is both crisp and clear. I think Bose has established themselves as the best in sound quality with these.  The Bose headset picks up more music notes and sounds seem to be missed by the Bose competitors. The noise around you disappears but you can still hear some noise in your surroundings unless you blast the music in the headphones.  You definitely will not be disappointed with the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones.Battery life is excellent; however, they do take a bit to fully charge if you let the battery drain all the way. I would recommend charging them when the battery life drops 50% or under if you plan on being away from a plug for a while.The right ear cup has volume controls, forward or backward mode for music selection and can answer phone calls, and the charging port. Also, on the right ear cup you can power off or on. The left ear cup has an AUX port and a button to toggle between ""quiet and aware"" modes. There are different modes to help with the wind cancellation and you can choose no more than 2 at one given time. The other two modes are a permanent fixture, so you can have up to four total modes.I could not use the Bose app on my, Ipod even though I could connect the music on my Ipod to the headphones., it can only be used on my IPHONE or IPADThe case is also nice and makes it easier to transport.They have become my dedicated headphones for listening to my music to walk, travel or just listen to music at home without disturbing others around me.Small glitch:  slight pause in music every now and then.  Bose needs to fix it!But the Bose earbuds are better in noise cancellation.Would I recommend these"
"I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just mine or not, but sometimes they make scratching sounds like they‚Äôre not getting a good connection or something. When I have my phone on me or my iPad is less than a foot away. It happens a lot. I haven‚Äôt had these a week yet and idk what the deal is. Is that common? They feel great on your ears and head. Very light. I love them besides that issue. I honestly have no clue why mine do that. I can‚Äôt even return/exchange them because I threw the box away the same day I opened them. So I‚Äôm disappointed for the amount of money I spent on them."
"3.5 - 4 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êPros:- Comfortable Fit: These headphones are incredibly comfortable, perfect for long listening sessions.- Great Sound Quality: The audio performance is impressive, offering clear and enjoyable sound.- Stylish Color Options: The variety of color choices is a nice touch, and the green ones I chose look amazing.Cons:- High Price: The cost of these headphones is on the expensive side.- Limited Features: For the price, they don‚Äôt offer as many features as you might expect.- Outdated Bluetooth Version: They use Bluetooth 5.1, which is outdated compared to the newer Bluetooth 5.4 available in other models.- No Spatial Audio Support: One noticeable drawback is the lack of spatial audio support. In an era where immersive audio experiences are becoming more common, the absence of this feature feels like a missed opportunity, especially considering the premium price of these headphones. For users who enjoy a 3D soundstage or a more engaging listening experience, this could be a significant downside, since you can get the Beats Studio Pro for about half of the price of these (on sale).Overall: While the comfort, sound quality, and style are strong points, the high price, lack of features, and outdated Bluetooth technology may be a downside for some users."
I really feel like you‚Äôre just paying for the brand name here.  My husband wanted these cuz he heard they were good.  They are.  But we compared them to a no-name brand of speakers and they sounded about the same to me.
"Edit: maybe a week later and I‚Äôm deducting another star because I can‚Äôt even tell that it‚Äôs on the noise cancelling setting.  It‚Äôs really, really bad.  I‚Äôll check for a firmware update or something but it‚Äôs pretty bad.‚Äî‚Äî-My primary headphones are Apple AirPods Max, so that‚Äôs the bar I‚Äôm measuring by.Cons:- the inner ear fabric is lumpy and shadowy, making it look a bit cheap- there isn‚Äôt an auto pause when you take them off (or at least one I haven‚Äôt found yet- mediocre noice cancelling in comparison- they‚Äôre difficult to pair / discover for some reason- the leather fabric is crinkly and doesn‚Äôt look like it will age well- they are light enough to feel a little flimsy; I‚Äôm not confident they‚Äôll last yearsI noticed the box was in a little rough shape, but it was a Black Friday deal so I didn‚Äôt mind.- the purple just looked weird on my head for some reason.  Not sure why.- the buttons are in a very nonintuitive location unless you want to use your thumb.  Which is fine, but it‚Äôs taking getting used to and is a little annoyingPros:- easier to clean than AirPods Max.  You can wipe them down  instead of paying $60 to replace the porous, stained fabric- LIGHTER.  AirPods Max are SO HEAVY it gets old- they actually come with a carrying case that covers them!- the headband is adjustable!  You can make things longer or shorter.  AirPods Max are one size and fit weird on my head.I‚Äôm going to switch on and off with them as necessary I suspect.  Not by any means top tier but not terrible either"
"SUPER DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE with the price slash they didnt give me things !!!!This is my 2nd pair of these phones and I payed full price, they have a sale and they come up short with the phone cord extension which is very short and of a lower quality as well as the charger cord, I think its maybe 4 inches, this is BOSE , PEOPLE, I have pride in their products, perhaps someone new is in the front office,yet if there is I......SHALL, GO ELSEWHERE if you dont value me as a customer.Today there is way too much of disrespect to those who have supported you over the years."
"The Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones offer a comfortable and secure fit, making them a solid choice for long listening sessions. I particularly appreciate how they feel on my head; the over-ear design is generally soft and easy to wear. However, as someone who wears stud earrings, I‚Äôve noticed that after about two hours, the pressure starts to cause some discomfort on my earlobes. This can be a bit of a drawback if you‚Äôre planning on wearing them for extended periods.I primarily use these headphones for travel, and they do a good job of reducing ambient noise, especially on flights. However, I‚Äôve encountered a recurring issue during takeoff: the headphones produce a lot of static feedback when the plane is ascending. This has happened on all eight flights I‚Äôve taken since purchasing them, which is disappointing for such a premium product.In everyday use, the noise-canceling feature is effective but not perfect. While they significantly reduce background noise, they don‚Äôt completely block it out, so you might still hear some external sounds.Overall, the Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones are comfortable and effective for noise reduction, but the static feedback during takeoff and slight discomfort with earrings are worth considering."
"The microphone isn't good, I couldn't take calls while using these headphones. They are very comfortable, but what's the point if I bought them to wear when working."
"I read the reviews before buying and they seemed mixed. Here is my take without writing a thesis. Reasonably easy to setup. The sound quality makes my AirPods sound like garbage by comparison. However, the 1 and 2 star reviews are spot on with the cancellation on, I can hear everything. Noise cancellation is not the most important thing to me so it is not a dealbreaker but if it is, maybe consider something else."
"Overall, they have a nice fit and sound. My only complaint is that they frequently have a crackling sound."
"I have had these for a few months now and they are ok. I bought these to help block out noise primarily when having a migraine. I was hoping they would be a better option than my skull candy headphones, which are very good, but still not good enough for what I needed and was hoping these were better at blocking out outside noises.The reason for my ratings1) The headphones were too big to fit my head, even adding something to take up space they would still not stay on my head, constantly falling forward or backwards.2) The ear muffs were too big and didn't block out near the amount of noise my skull candy headphones do.I am only glad I got these on sale, and currently are sitting on a shelf taking up space. I am sticking to my skull candy headphones for sure.For reference I am a grown woman, with a normal sized head, not a child by any means."
No instructions. The wireless button seems to be the ON OFF button. The USB charging cord is about 6 inches long . No way to know whether the only tiny light I saw means it is charging or fully charged !! That will be a problem if I don‚Äôt know if these are even completely charged .  I am disappointed in Bose. Returning them. I will pay the price for a pair of B&O.
"I bought these to upgrade my previous pair of noise cancelling headphones, which were a cheaper pair by Anker. A while back I had a non-ANC pair of Bose that I loved dearly until I updated to ANC, so I assumed these would be great!Well, unfortunately not. Honestly, save your money‚Äîthere are cheaper pairs that offer mostly the same benefits.I'll start with the good. Bose headphones feel great. They're comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, and they're not so bulky or heavy that it is too noticeable. Truly exceptional in this respect. The sound was a step-up from my previous pair, though not lightyears better. Annoying for the higher price, but it's fine. Battery life is better than I was told to expect. USB-C port is a nice upgrade from older stuff.Now for the down sides. For a long stretch I was getting frequent (like every 2-3 minutes) cut-outs and static sounds. A reddit user suggested I remove the much-praised Bose app from my phone to fix the problem, and it did! But if the app that's supposed to improve the headphone causes them to function worse... seems like a pretty big flaw! Removing the app largely fixed the issue, but there are still plenty of moments where the sound just cuts out for a second. I know this happens with bluetooth headphones, but it happens far more frequently with these fancy Bose than it does with AirPods or the much cheaper Anker Soundcore set I had.The biggest flaw, though, is the microphone. It is borderline unusable, and it's what prompted me to write this review just now. My current pair is actually my second. Sent my first back because the microphone was *literally* unusable. The replacement pair works better, but good luck using it on a phone call without someone regularly saying ""Hello? Are you still there?"" I have not tried the wired microphone‚ÄîI assume it is better, but the fact that the built-in microphone is this bad at this price point is unforgiveable. I've had two pairs of AirPods and the aforementioned Anker ANC headphones... all of which were at least USABLE for calls. This is truly a joke with these, and I can attest that it is not a one-off issue.I still use these because the sound is fine enough and they're very comfortable. I keep them at my desk and use them only to listen to music while I work... but I bought these with the expectation that they would be at least passable for audio/video calls, and that's just laughable now.Get something cheaper, or save up for the better Sony or Apple pro headphones. I got these on sale so it's fine, but I would never recommend these to anyone else."
"Bought these and thought the quality was really great and they looked fantastic and simple. What I didn't like was that the bluetooth connectivity was pretty glitchy as it tries to switch to multiple devices (something the AirPods do flawlessly, but these don't). They instead kept clicking or stuttering every minute or so of streaming audio from just one device. It's extremely frustrating to be listening to such great audio quality only to have it be interrupted so often. I also hate that Bose now requires you to download a very invasive app (look up just how much access they require of your device just outside of your connectivity and you'd be surprised) just to be able to use them with your phone or tablet. Unless you'll always be wired to them, they are not worth the price point for issues that should've been fixed ages ago. These were dealbreaking points for me and I had to return them."
"I owned the original qc35 since 2016 and they were one of the best purchases I'd ever made. I had to replace the ear pads 3 times before they finally gave out on me after almost 7 years of quality service.I was excited to get a new and improved version of my beloved headphones and expected this edition to be all that the qc35 was and more, with better sound quality, USB-C charging, and a sleek all black look. But i've been extremely dissapointed. At the center of all of it is an infuriating ""crackling"" sound that comes from the headphones frequently when watching video or especially when switching audio sources. I never once had that problem with my old headphones, I tried everything from updates to resetting to re-paring but nothing worked. The crackling was so annoying I ended up just getting rid of the headphones.There is also a much louder white noise sound when no audio is playing that was not present in the old headphones. I also didn't notice any improvement in sound quality at all - for being 8 years newer... really the only improvement for me was USB-C charging and the fact the logo was black.I truly wanted to enjoy these headphones but sadly if you are expecting the same quality as the older headphones you may be let down. I hope others haven't had the same experience."
"Short Version:Long time Bose user, Bought this model to replace ""Bose QuietComfort 35 II"" was excited because of all the high reviews, it seems that if you never experienced the original this one is great but this is a huge step down if you are used to OG Bose quality. Still better than earbuds while sound is playing.Long Version:I have used the ""Bose QuietComfort 35 II"" headphones daily 3-4 hours for many years (Purchased Nov 25th 2018), they were a solid pair of headphones and I only replaced them because they were becoming a bit worn and the battery life has decreased enough to where I had to charge a few times per day. I recently purchased the ""Newer Model"" of these headphones (Bose QuietComfort) as they earned my loyalty throughout the years.Upon opening the box I noticed everything was very well packed and had no worries about damage to the headphones. I was excited to see a similar design and the startup sound filled me with joy as it was seemingly the same Bose sound I have become accustomed to. Sadly had to use a different APP as Bose Connect no longer works but was quick and easy to setup with included instructions. Upon using them my excitement quickly faded when I crushed my bottle to throw away and the sound of the ""noise cancelling"" trying to compensate hurt my ears, no biggie right? Just don't crush bottles or go near loud high pitched noises (mind you these are noise cancelling so the idea is its supposed to block out noise not amplify it but I digress). I enjoy using my headphones for a few more minutes and go to stop my music where there is a ""clicking"" noise when sound is stopped for longer then 5 seconds, okay fine while I am using them they sound great so just have sound playing, I can work with this. The nail in the coffin for me was when I was outside and the wind blew a bit ""to hard"" I guess which then resulted in a constant noise in the right earpiece as if the noise cancelling was trying to compensate even when the wind had stopped (this went away after about 2 HOURS when I heard what seemed to be a small pop in the earpiece). I have never had any of these issues with my previous pair of nearly 6 years and am highly disappointed that they changed what to me was a 5 star product, sadly I will be giving these to family as they are still an upgrade over earbuds and I will be going back to my original pair. Mainly giving 2-stars because I still love my old pair of Bose."
I've have these going on 5 months now. Never dropped them or gotten anywhere near water or anything but last week they started randomly going static and just stop playing. Not even disconnecting since it never pauses my music it just stops and I'm constantly having to turn them off then on to fix it. Feeling like a rip off.
Petite woman found this to be large even with adjustable band.  Too bad.
"The sound and noise cancellation of these headphones is incredible, but I had to return these after less than a month. I can't complain about the sound quality or noise cancellation at all. Call quality was apparently was pretty good too based on the calls I was making.Unfortunately, the headphones dropped connection A LOT. Songs would get buzzy, the mic would stop working. At first I thought it was my work computer, but switching headphones immediately resolved the issues I was having. This problem only continued to get worse, even if I just had the headphones connected to a single device. I would have loved for these headphones to work, but unfortunately, they're being returned.Sound and noise cancellation, they have a chance to be amazing headphones for the price, but the connections problems makes them unusable in certain situations."
Sounds good but hurts the top of my head.
The noise cancellation wasn‚Äôt that great clean design tho
"I waited a long time to get a pair of these.  They fit little ears nicely and are very comfortable.  The first thing  I noticed is the lining in the ear hole (which they call scrims) is just a cover over the electronics and these are very uneven and fit poorly.  I opened the cushion to see if it needed to be readjusted and that's not the problem.  These are just cosmetic and thin so the sound comes through.  I have an older pair of Bose corded headphones and they were made much better and the scrim is held firmly in place by the ear cushion.  The next problem was the near impossibility of snapping the cushion back on.  Again, on my older headphones it only requires even pressure and they snap back in place.  I watched the video on ""how to"" but no joy.  The ring around the cushion base is cardboard.  So getting it back under the clips is a difficult process.  At this price point I would have expected better, especially from Bose.  You have to manhandle the cushion by bending it a little and with your fingernail and pressure gently get it back under the tiny clips around the ear piece.  I noticed that on the side I didn't take off- the clips are not engaged all the way around.  These only cost what they do because of the Bose name.  In the design of the ear cushions and scrims they missed the mark."
It does block noise but not 100%.
Static sounds for this higher end product‚Ä¶?
"Even when the volume is turned just slightly past halfway, other people in the room could hear the music.The headphones themselves have a beautiful sound, but the sound isn't insulated at all :("
"I've been buying this brand/model of headphones for 6+ years now. They're very comfortable with great audio quality, and they have the best noise-cancelling around; I used to wear them pretty much every day. But, over the years, Bose QuietComfort has gone from the best to unusably bad. My newest set crackles and cuts out within a minute or two of listening to anything, on every device I own; Windows PC, iPad, Android Phone, Steam Deck, doesn't matter. The issue started less than a week after I bought these headphones too. Nothing I tried, from changing audio codecs to resetting my device list, would fix the issue. My brand-new headphones are pretty, comfortable, and completely useless!This really surprised me after my last pair, which, after a year+ of daily use, ""only"" cut out every once in a while after a long time of listening. My other sets from before that never cut out at all, even after using them all day every day for years. I only replaced them because they got gross and torn up. The padding on the ears, though comfortable, will be torn to shreds within a year or so of wearing the headphones every day. You can replace the pads, but new ones are almost impossible to put in from my experience.I'm disappointed to see how poorly made these headphones are now, despite still being the most expensive headphones I own. I recently bought a cheaper $80 pair from another brand, and it works flawlessly compared to these. Still has decent noise-cancelling too!If you want good noise-cancelling headphones, don't buy these. The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is because they're comfortable; at least when the sound's off."
"These headphones (left) are noticeably cheaper quality than the previous gen Bose Noise Canceling 700s (right). I bought these for my wife for our first anniversary present, and they really let me down.HEADBAND:-The headband cushion is that cheap faux leather that eventually starts to peel over time. The previous gen has a nice thick rubber that is slightly inflated to give a cloud like rest on your head.-The headband frame is a lightweight plastic. Seems like it's prone to breaking. The previous gens were a metal/graphite like compound that make them feel more durable and fancier.EARS:-The earcups now rotate like the old school Skullcandy's that we used to have in 8th grade. Also, if you want to adjust, they extend like them as well. The previous gen has a cleaner and simpler design where if you want to adjust, they rotate and slide up/down the headband frame itself.-The ear cushions are much thinner, and a less cloud-like feel than the previous gen and are also the faux leather fabric that is used in the headband cushion.-There is a weird/obnoxious Bluetooth switch on the external of the right earphone. The previous gens had a slicker button layout and design.I wanted to bring my opinions to light in case anyone else values the manufacturing quality for a 350-dollar pair of headphones. I wish Bose would take a step back and reconsider the amount of craftsmanship they are putting into this new gen. I purchase their products since they usually set themselves apart from the other brands. From a business standpoint, this new model is without a doubt saving them on manufacturing costs, and we are taking the hit with that hefty price-point."
I have come to expect so much more out of Bose over the past 15 years. Sound is decent but the make and build is poor. Very cheap plastic material. Feels flimsy and not at all solid. Not a very tight fit on my smaller head. Light weight could help managing back pack weight I guess but that‚Äôs the only benefit. Would love if the cord were longer. I intentionally bought it because it also has a wired option. $349 because of the Bose name but it probably cost $10 to make. At least it‚Äôs not made in China. I might send it back.
"The sound quality is impressive, and the noise cancellation works well, though it's not completely effective. My main concern, however, is with the customer support. It‚Äôs neither responsive nor user-friendly. Last month, I experienced two separate issues with the microphone that required a factory reset. While needing to reset once could be understandable, having to do it twice within a month points to a potential defect.  During that time, I was unable to reach support or request a replacement, as the product appeared to be defective. The lack of efficient support made resolving the problem frustrating."
"First. What do you mean I cannot charge and listen. Even with the 3mm head phone jack plugged in, there was never a way to charge and listen. I can charge and listen with headphones I got for my daughter that costs 20 dollars. .Shame. Beats cost around the same much as these, they have better sound quality and if the charging cord is connected to the pc, it plays sound through the usb-c plug. For all others I can plug in the charger and the 3mm headphone jack at the same time and it will play sound and charge. Don't see how this cannot do that. Technological capabilities are lacking here.My set was defective though. Didn't always connect. I would have to clear the known list of devices every time I wanted to use these. Then When it connected, it dropped the connection at random. I could be in the middle of watching a movie for example and it would completly go silent. I would look up and the movie wasn't paused. The headphones just decided to stop playing sound. There was never a connected/disconnected warning and this happened at random intervals so there's no way to accurately reproduce this error.  Sometimes when I try to connect, it would drop the connection within seconds and refuse to connect back to the same device unless the entire connected devices list is cleared. Even though I only ever paired these to 1 thing(my computer) It was sheer madness. Just trying to use these was counter productive. I shouldn't have to have random blips in my work or entertainment because of headphones and I certainly shouldn't have to stop working until they are charged up again. Buy anything but these and your workflow and entertainment will not be constantly interrupted.I really think it was just a defective model, I was going to exchange them, but they started squeezing my head in a way that made my ears ring so I had to switch back to the old pair I was using and completely refund these."
Immediately when I opened the case I thought I was sent the wrong color. They're a much lighter/pastel blue than in the product pictures.
"Sounds was ok, nothing terrible, nothing blowing me away.  But what blows me away is the quality of these, they look and feel insanely CHEAP.200 bucks for headphones that look like they're on par with Skullcandy headphones quality.  I refuse to spend money for these headphones, I'd pay like 80 bucks max for these.The buttons feel cheap, volume up clicks nicely with feedback, volume down didn't click at all, it worked but there was no feedback from pressing the button.Spend youroney elsewhere."
"Very pricey but best sound output quality I‚Äôve heard in any headphone. Not sure about its durability but the noise cancelation on this thing will save you in the loudest rooms. It's a need if you have ADHD and need to focus. The cushions are super soft and it‚Äôs lightweight, making it ideal for long term use.EDIT: Took off 2 stars because I own an older version of the headphones and the materials for that are a lot sturdier. This one feels plastic. Sound output is incredible but input is garbage. Every person I‚Äôve called using this headphone asked me if I was in a tunnel because of how bad the audio was on their end."
Bose quality has diminished a LOT. The sound quality and the noise cancelling were terrible. There was this constant white noise -  like a shhhhhhhhhh - in the backround. Perhaps if these are only used on a crowded plane they'd do the trick. Outside of the fact that they were too big ( I do have a small head ) these were a huge disappointment. I expected a lot more from Bose. But could not hear a difference between these and say mid level JBL's.
The battery on these is not good. It doesn't even last as long as they claim. For this amount of money i expected so much better. My old pair were a cheap generic pair that cost a quarter of these Bose ones and I only charge once a week or every 2 weeks. These I'm lucky if I can use them for a day.They're reasonably comfortable. But not too much more than my cheap old pair.I love the look. Clean. Smooth.
"The headphones themselves are great - excellent quality and great noise reduction. My problem is that the case that came with them was defective - the zipper broke as I was trying to close them after the first use. I didn‚Äôt want to return them because there was nothing wrong with the headphones, so I reached out to Bose to get a replacement for the defective case. On my first call I was told that the cases were on back order and if I hadn‚Äôt heard anything within 3-4 weeks to call back. At 4 weeks I still hadn‚Äôt heard from them so I called customer service again. This time I was told that they don‚Äôt carry inventory to replace cases and that they only deal with issues with electronics. I was given the case model number so I could purchase one from a 3rd party supplier. Uuugh. Alas, my brand new headphones will continue to live in a case held together with a rubber band. Great job, Bose. And with that you‚Äôve lost a customer."
"I needed a pair for flying as my ear buds didn't block out the ambient plane engine noise, these do that very well. When I received my headphones I removed my pair of Mieze Headphones and put on the Quiet Comfort headphones. It was a noticeable drop in music quality. Not as clean and crisp. The Meize cost about 700$ so the sound quality I imagine is what you pay for. Good but not blow you away sound."
Too big for my head!!I got the green ones to replace my broken (earlier model) Bose quiet comfort. The headband of the these new green ones is very loose compared to m last pair. New ones fall off if Iran forward or backward or if I lay down. I‚Äôm going to try another set incase this was a one off with the weird sizing. I HOPE they work cause these are wonderful headphones. I absolutely loved my old pair but they broke LITERALLY a couple days after the 2 year warranty and BOSE customer service was NOT helpful. They offered that I could send me a new pair at a discounted price. When I looked on the Bose website they were on sale for cheaper than what I had been offered PLUS they were going to take back my old ones. I‚Äôm glad I checked before I got ripped off. One more chance for Bose‚Ä¶Hope I won‚Äôt be disappointed because these are really nice.Green color looks awesome!!!
"Replaced an old set of Bose noise cancelling headphones with these.  These are not as good quality as my old headphones.  To top it off, they ship a 10 plus page book of warnings in every language imaginable but can't go to the trouble of including a Quick Start Guide, let alone an owners manual.  Very poor user experience out of the box for the priciest noise REDUCING (not cancelling) headphones."
"Honestly, after years of being an audiophile and having family members that know so much about audio quality I decided to try Bose due to its reputation. I got them on sale for $200. Let me tell you, my $45 headphones have better quality and feel sturdier than these. I'm disappointed. The packaging is nice, and they come with a cable, case, and charger. But the quality, is not all that wonderful. I expected more clarity, more bass, and most importantly ‚Äîproper noise cancelling. Maybe I'm mistaken? Maybe I haven't figured them out yet. But you don't need a genuis to figure a simple app. The features are not that advanced. They didn't even pass the indoor test. I took them out on my NYC commute, and I can hear a bit of conversations around me, including all the train sounds. Horrible noise cancelling. The only thing I like is their amazing color shade and how lightweight they are. But it's such a shame they feel so cheap. Gonna have to return. Not worth their value, it's just a name at this point."
"Love them when they work well, but the electrical crackling gets very annoying"
"They are comfy. sound is great. the included cord is an absolute joke. it is about 2 fee long. My first time using it with the cord, I have ripped it out of the speaker 3 times. I need to purchase a bluetooth adapter to get these to work with mu puter. if the hardwire is selling point for you. move on or buy an extension."
"I bought these as a cheaper alternative to my Airpods Max when they died (multiple times, but finally my AppleCare plan expired and I had to buy a new headset). I figured I'd save $150+ or so by buying these, since Bose is so well known for their noise cancelling technology and I see people wearing them on planes and stuff. On the first night, sleeping next to my loudly snoring husband, I found them to be too uncomfortable to sleep in, with insufficient noise cancelling. I couldn't sleep, so I got up after an hour or so, carefully put them back in their packaging, requested a return, and bought another set of AirPods Max so that they'd be at my house the following night. So much for saving $150+... not worth it. Better to pay more and get really solid noise cancelling and better comfort."
"The sound isn't that great compared to the Sony's. Even worst if you have to plug them directly into your laptop. The automatic Spotify controls are pure annoying. Example) I have the headphones hooked up to my work computer and cell phone. Whenever a notification sound plays on the laptop the Bose headphones start playing Spotify even if Spotify is off. And if Spotify is on and a notification pops up it will play a different song. I have turn all permissions off of Spotify to try and stop this. Uninstalled and reinstalled as well. But it keeps doing that. Also, in just about every Teams meeting I try to use these after about 20 minutes you can hear interference and then I have to plug them into the laptop. None of this happens with my Beats headphones, but those are my small running headphones. Not noise canceling expensive ones bought for work. Oh and I'm over needing to use my email address for everything. You can't make preference adjustments without giving them your email address.

"So I bought these on prime day on sale along with Beast Studio pro. They were also on sale. Their starting price points are the same $350. Bose sound quality is far superior. Bass is immersive, highs have serious resonance. Listening to all kinds of music is seriously enjoyable And Bluetooth sync is great.  Beats sound quality is subpar. Bass is low, highs are loud, and trying to use them to watch Netflix is a no go due to the unsynced audio.  I will be returning both of them due to the fact the Bose is made of plastic that feels like it won‚Äôt last more than a year. They already feel loose on my head. The Beats are sturdier. They will last over a year without completely losing their shape."
I bought these headphones 3 months ago and used them at most 5 times. The foam cushions are already frayed and breaking up.  I have not abused or misused them so I don't understand why this has happened. They were expensive and Bose quality should be better than this.
"I've decided to return the lilac headphones and stick with my trusty QC 35IIs.For $200, they don't do anything better than my older ones did, and they do have annoying interference from the induction stove. I tested the older phones, and they don't have that at all."
These are crackly for whatever reason randomly when switching between songs or apps.The sound dampening is OK.I owned a pair of these years ago but broken them over about 1 year of use. Purchased this pair because of prime day sale and honestly I feel the quality has gone down.The buttons aren‚Äôt in great places in my opinion and are hard to remember.These head phones charge pretty quickly.I don‚Äôt think they are worth the money when there are other better options that don‚Äôt require an additional app.The carrying case is bulky but secure.Would not buy again $200+ head phones should not crackleThe base is these hits like a fly against a window. (Weak asf)Truly debating on returning them.
Either I have not completely understood how to set these to provide optimal results or they are defective.  I‚Äôve owned Bose before that were excellent in cancelling background noise on an airplane. These are far inferior. Clearly not worth the price I paid.
"Don't buy these if you are planning on using them with an Android phone.  The only Bluetooth codecs that the new Bose QC headphones support are AAC and SBC.  The HD audio is only available through AAC which is an Apple system.  Android systems can run it but do so very poorly.  When I connect them using HD Audio through the AAC codec sound is poppy and scratchy and goes quiet frequently this is because Android can't run the AAC codec well.  It works great just using SBC but that is not HD audio and if you are paying over 200 bucks for headphones you should get amazing sound quality that SBC just can't deliver.  I'm sure they sound great on an iOS system.  The Noise Cancelling is amazing.  I will be returning these.  I got the Sony WH-100XM4 for slightly less than I got these Bose for and they work amazing using the LDAC codec for HD Audio and my Android phone has no issue with it.  The noise canceling on them is also great.  Not as good as the Bose but it's still amazing and Sound Quality is paramount.  So if you have an Apple phone go for these, if you have an Android go for the Sony.Oh and contrary to what other reviewers have said you CAN use the noise canceling while in wired connection mode.  You DO NOT have to use bluetooth to get noise canceling."
"I've hade a QC35II for over 5 years, and have replaced the muffs, battery, and a hinge on that pair, and have loved them.  I hate inductive buttons used on many other top end headphones, so when it came time for a new set of headphones, The new Bose QuietComforts seemed like the perfect fit.On the plus, the pass through mode is an improvement, though I honestly preferred the old 'high, low, off' noise level settings. The new modes are less intuitive as to what the differences actually are - though the noise cancelling is great.The real kicker that knocked them down was that, while the physical buttons are the same, the actual functionality has taken a step back.  Previously, with the QC35IIs, you could Double or Tripple press to skip forward or back. Holding the button at the end of these sequences woulld fast forward or rewind.  This does not work with the new model. It only skips forward or back to the end/start of current media.  You may be able to change this in your media ap settings, but you can't have both.  As a main point of headphones is to NOT be tied to your phone, but a cable or controls, this is a huge backstep. Until I figured out how to at least change the default I as about to return them.  Switching it was a compromise, but really, they should have kept the full control capability of the earlier model.If you don't care about the control functionality, they are otherwise awesome headphones. Super comfortable and great sound."
I wish these fit me. I really like these. Feedback said the background noise was pretty high on meeting calls but mostly I bought these for the gym. I kept adjusting them thruMy whole workout and for leg presses I actually had to put the headband on my forehead or they would fall off. I did some research for other small headed people to see if anyone has come up with a solution- but it doesn‚Äôt seem like it which is a real bummer.  I got these for a great price so I‚Äôm just gonna give them to my bf who has the older version of these (35s). The green is gorgeous btw.
"I had a QC35 which I used from 2016 to 2024 without any major problems and unfortunately got it stolen due to a break in my car. I ordered this right away since I was pretty happy with the product / brand, its value proposition, quality, and properties. However, the current pair is the second one after using another pair for a week. Both have the same problems so far: Connectivity issues; cracking sounds every 7-8 minutes, and loss of sound for a couple of seconds frequently, regardless of the source, laptop, or phone. I am not sure if this discount is related to these standing problems for this model or not. I am considering returning this pair too since this is not a product that I can use in the long term. Because, at the end of the day, this is not the service that I can accept after spending close to $250."
"After reading multiple reviews and tests on you tube, I decided to pull the trigger choosing these over Sony XM4 or 5. My reasoning was that Bose had always offered a superior sound to my ear in real life regardless of what mixed reviews said. The reviews where mixed, noting the same strong points and poor points. The absolute most important thing I wanted in my purchase was sound quality. I was willing to sacrifice the best noise cancelling for just good, and 24 hours of battery life to about 12 (still happy with this). Noise cancelling is noticeably slightly worse than the Sony XM2s that I replaced, although quite close. Sound quality, voice clarity, average bass tones, overall clarity, was not as good as the Sony headphones that I had had for years. The EQ adjustments were new and slightly helpful in getting the tones that I wanted to pop, but ... not as good as out of the box sound from my last headphones.I would not purchase these headphones again. It is hard to find something in this price point, the over the ear headphones are either higher in price or lower in price and not as good. I will however continue to consider Bose products in my future purchases as this is the first ever poor experience I have had with them."
"First let me start by saying these headphones are about 99% perfect. If you are using these for general every day use, gym use, or short haul travel they are fantastic.The huge design flaw is the microphone placement on the ear cups (used for ANC). The location of the microphones is too far back and will rub on travel pillows, neck rests (on long haul planes), or improvised pillows (think folded hoodie/jacket). When anything rubs against the microphone when trying to get comfortable on a flight - the noise this produces in the headphones is AWFUL! This happens when the ‚Äúaware‚Äù mode is on or off, and I tried desperately to find a solution to this.  As a result, these headphones can only be used when the sides do not make contact with any fabrics or materials, which left me sat bolt upright for a 9 1/2 hour international flight and was very frustrating. My wife used Beats Studio Pro‚Äôs and they do not have this issue when the ‚Äútransparency‚Äù mode is not active, so I will probably end up purchasing a pair of those instead. Very sad to be sending these back as they are so comfortable (more comfortable than the Beats), but they do not suit my intended use due to this huge design flaw."
I broke down and bought what I was was a top end product and it‚Äôs just okay.  Sound is fine - nothing bad but not exceptional.  Noise cancelling better than nothing but not what I expected at this price point.  I do love that I can connect 2 devices at once and easily switch between them.  Riding in my diesel truck - other end of the call couldn‚Äôt tell though my end still had a bunch of background.Nothing bad but nothing exceptional overall and therefore only 3 stars
"I got a pair of these a month ago, and I've really been enjoying using them. However, the first set I got skipped audio at a random rate around every 5 mins, which can get really annoying. I got them replaced, but the second set that I got also does the same thing. I think it's a fault with this supplier or maybe the product in general, either way I would love these headphones more if they worked like they were supposed to. Pretty disappointing that getting them replaced once didn't work."
"This is my first pair of high end headphones and I was not impressed by the sound quality. Not bad, just not great. Too much bass while also not enough bass. Hard to explain. Also the noise canceling / aware mode has no option to be turned off and it causes a pressure in my ears like you‚Äôre on a plane or something. They are light, comfortable, and sound ok, but I feel like they should sound a lot better at this price point. I returned them and ordered AirPod max"
"I hate these so much. Worst purchase I made because it was ""on sale."" Sound quality is nice, noice cancellation is nice, stopping playing and making scratchy sounds when it stops playing - not nice. Not nice at all. You know what isn't fun? Falling asleep to some nice music and then *SCRATCH*CRINKLE* nothing, then a moment later *SCRATCH*KRINKLE* thing you were listening to comes back...a minute goes by, repeat..and so on and so forth.And, because it took so long to ship, I ended up on a business trip when it was delivered and by the time I experienced the issue, on a different trip, I ended up missing the return window.I've had issues with Bose before, looks like things haven't changed. Wish I stuck with Sony."
"I heard great things about these headphones but unfortunately I ended up returning.Pros: very light, good noise cancelling, and I like the buttons for control settings.Cons: kept disconnecting from my computer, short range for Bluetooth, not for people with big ears.Overall they are not bad but I expected more from a $300 pair of headphones. They would occasionally cut out/ glitch during use which can become annoying. I did find them comfortable but too loose if you use them to jog."
I wanted to get some high-end (superior quality) headphones for work. The Bose name is easily recognisable and so I did my due diligence and picked this product.I expected the noise cancellation feature to be wickedly grand. And the overall quality of the product to be solid.I received a med grade product which failed in a variety of ways. Design wise - it‚Äôs cheap hard plastic for the body.  Simple and rather wack buttons. I could have moved past all of that and then experienced the sound. The noise cancellation feature is ‚Ä¶ mediocre. I have a sound core maker Q20 model (mid-level price) and its noise cancellation feature was superior.I won‚Äôt be looking to Bose for any of their products.
"I can't comment on the sound quality as I never got going with these. They were just too big for my head. I am not a large person, but I'm not tiny either. I ride motorcycles and my helmet size is a consistent medium whatever brand helmet I try on. As for the Bose headphones, I  would think for the price, they could offer them in various sizes such as small, medium, and  large."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The product works and does what it needs too but for over 150$ headphones gthe case Bose made for them is trash. Sadly it cross threads and un-hooks it is overall a terrible design of the case. If you purchase these expect to buy a case for them that actually works.. i open and closed it very little and it just doesnt work anymore. Sadly my return window closed so I have to deal with a poor case or just buy another case..
"Even when I'm close to my Bluetooth device the sound keeps cutting out, or I'll hear crackling noises. No update is needed, I've tried all the troubleshooting I could find and nothing has worked. I've never had this much trouble with my $30 noise canceling headphones, which also have a much further Bluetooth connection reach. Too late for me to return. I had high hopes for these given the price. Very disappointed üòû"
"These headphones have been on my wishlist for awhile. Sadly, the sound kept cutting out even when my iPhone was right next to me. I looked up solutions online and nothing worked. It's a shame, I was enjoying them in cafes working remote and I can see how great they would be for travel. The gym would be a no go - too sweaty. Overall, decided to keep looking for a better option."
"Wanted to love these Had great reviews. Idk if I got a faulty pair but I cwn charge for a few and go to use them and they are perpetually at 80 or 90%. Probably less than 10% it goes to 100%.Of I remove the charger in the off position and put them in their case, I can go to use them a few days later and they are ALWAYS dead!Super disappointing for the price. I do the love the color. They aren't that comfortable as well. I always use the ""L"" on my left ear and ""R"" on my right ear but after awhile they hurt. Unhappy all around..."
"The sound was good and they were very comfortable. The problem I had was the connection would drop randomly. It would come back after a second. It was so frequent that I just had to return them. I wanted to keep them but it was just so disruptive. If you are spending hundreds of dollars on an item, this should not be a regular occurrence."
"I think I may have a faulty product. It was skipping sound when I first got it, but I use them in the gym so I thought it was my wifi connection.  However, at home where my connection is perfect, the the sound was still skipping. I cannot use these for meetings because I cannot afford to miss audio/communications shared."
"I needed noise cancelling headphones for a long Atlantic flight. I bought these because I figured Bose headsets had the best noise cancelling reviews and cyber Monday deal was a steal.  Definitely not the case.  This pair muffles some sound but you can definitely still hear babies scream and people talking when you‚Äôre watching a movie or something on the plane. Didn‚Äôt need to take the headphones off when the flight attendant came through asking ‚Äúchicken or beef‚Äù because I could hear them.  Yes they were turned on.  They were also too big and would slide off my head.  Can‚Äôt adjust to smaller, only bigger. Not really sure it was worth the money‚Ä¶"
"For a pair of 350$ ish headphones (that I got on sale for around 180$) they could be better. Especially the ladies voice when you turn them on, sounds like a temu factory worker recorded it, it just feels cheap. Overall, if you covered the logo and had to guess what they cost, I‚Äôd say 75$."
"Reason for the 2 stars: sound quality and the software.I have used a non-NC Sony for years, and I must say the sound quality on the Sony was way better than Bose. Sure it may not be fair to compare a NC headphone w/ one that is meant for enjoying music, but expected more from Bose.I can still live w/ the sub-optimal sound quality, but what really bothers is the buggy software. I have my MAC and iPhone paired to the Bose, and some times it is able to switch correctly but more often the Bose gets stuck paired w/ my MAC and I have to manually disable the pairing for the Bose to pair w/ my iPhone. Happens at least 2-3 times in a week. Hopefully Bose is able to fix their software nad make it less painful to own this Bose.What it does do well, is NC (Noise Cancellation)."
"**Update** (July 30,2024)I've had these headphones for several months. Not even a year yet and they disconnect randomly.The biggest peeve is being on a phone call and that person on the other end says they cannot hear me or I am breaking up. Mind you, I do have the phone right next to me most times. For these being expensive headphones the quality hasn't been the best so far for me when it comes to phone calls. I must say that I do like these headphones. I've never owned anything Bose. So this is my first purchase.I look into these headphones because I could not get any kind of earbuds to fit inside my ear. I did have a pair I really liked but one of the earbuds ended up going out within 3 months. I got frustrated and decided to go with over the head headphones. Going old school I should say! LOLI love the color and they are pretty decent at noise cancellation. I wore them the whole time in the airport and on the plane. They are very comfortable and did not irritate me in any way giving a kind of headache or bothering of the ears.Con:My only issue that I get really annoyed about is that even though I have it connected to my phone and I am currently listening to music, it disconnects and connects to my iPad. I don't know how or why it does that but that's the only thing that frustrates me. I'm not sure if maybe I have to play with my iPad settings but even though I turn the Bluetooth off my iPad it'll still turn on and then my headphones connect. So that is my only frustration is when I'm listening to music it will randomly disconnect from my phone and connect to my iPad instead. Phone calls are great and the buttons are easy to access. I do like how the button I'm able to hold it and use voice to do whatever command I need. I have an Android and it works fairly well.Overall, I really like these headphones"
"I loved everything about this headset the moment I got it from the noise cancellation and sound quality to the design and build until I had to take a phone call. Unfortunately, from the moment they came out the box, the microphone was garbage. I would try and talk wireless and people on other end shared that it muffled and sounds like I was under water. I chalked this up as just interference but after recording a video so I cold hear myself, it was utterly disastrous.Now they are just really expensive headphones where I have to hold my phone to my ear to take calls instead of being able to use a primary function.Microphone -248904239084308/10"
"These seem like great quality headphones but I just can‚Äôt get them to stay connected to anything or maintain audio after pausing, let alone use the multipoint connection feature. This is really disappointing considering that the multipoint connection was a huge selling point for me on these when I was researching headphones.Even when only using singlepoint connection, if I pause my audio to get it to play again I have to completely re connect the headphones to whatever device I was using. Even though it says it‚Äôs playing and that the volume is turned up, after pressing play I can‚Äôt hear anything. I check on the app, the device, and the headphones themselves to make sure they‚Äôre still connected and that the volume is turned up. Multipoint connection working is just out of the question :(I‚Äôve tried fixing it through the settings and have deleted and reset all the connections through all of my devices‚Äô bluetooths. I even redownloaded the Bose app, reset my account, and redid all the initial connecting that you do when you first get the headphones. I can‚Äôt seem to get them to work again, and now I can‚Äôt even connect to one device with singlepoint connection and pause my audio without having to turn the headphones off and on and reconnecting. It‚Äôs a huge waste of time when trying to watch lecture videos (I thought these would be a nice investment to use while I finish my undergrad and begin grad school) and I‚Äôm starting to feel like these were a huge waste of money!! I‚Äôm outside of the warranty window and wish this began sooner so I could‚Äôve at least tried another pair."
"Did not like that head phone a bit large for my head. They are set for smallest head size, but still slide off. I like color and sound. Not as noise blocking as I expected."
"Super disappointed. Noise cancelling and transparency mode are -impossible- to turn off simultaneously. Don't want any noise cancelling? You're stuck with transparency mode on full blast so you can hear EVERYTHING around you loudly. Don't want any transparency mode? You're stuck with full-blast noise cancelling that makes you feel like your ears are plugged on an airplane. The best you can do is 50% ANC and 50% transparency, so it's only half as annoying in two different ways!And to top it all off, these features they don't allow you the freedom to disable will only drain the battery significantly faster than any other headphones that have them turned off. Great design! I can't fathom how anyone saw this glaring flaw as acceptable.Too bad I can't properly enjoy the quality of the audio or comfort of the headphones themselves when the manufacturer apparently doesn't trust you with the smallest amount of freedom with how you use them. For the price, this is absolutely unacceptable. If you love ANC and transparency mode 24/7, -literally-, have fun.If you live in a construction site or only use these when you're walking around bustling New York City streets, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. They feel like solid quality mechanically. If however you would actually like the choice when and how you use these features and don't appreciate them forced on you, don't even consider buying these for a moment.Returning them, and probably won't bother buying another pair of overpriced Bose headphones ever again. Physical quality means nothing if the software is so terribly half-baked I can't enjoy them how I would like to."
"I have always loved Bose products, I also just recently purchased the open ear buds and was super excited to score this over the ear set during prime days. I wanted something that could isolate me, could give me that nice calm silence and add wonderful sounding music.BUT when I received it today the right earphone did not work at all. I was setting the headphones up on my phone and no sound came out no matter what. Reconnected, updated and reinstalled the app even, troubleshoot it for a while before giving I'm that they are defective.This was extremely disappointing especially because I have been scoping these out for so long and with the sale I finally decided to do it and now I'm upset I got excited just to be let down. Plus it's all made so much worse by the fact that they will not iist offere a replacement.  It's like what was the point of the sale if the were broken.I have tried to contact Amazon but it just takes me in circles through self help guides and suggestions for troubleshooting,  all things I have already tried.Again it is very disheartening that after watching these for so long and the time I decide to go for it, they don't even work and the only option I was to get a refund so it didn't matter that I bought it on sale.  Definitely going to change who I purchase more expensive products and do it with a big box store."
"This review is for Bose NEW QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones,... Amazon is crap about mixing reviews, so folks please label your review like this.Read the other reviews... there will be dropouts once you connect multiple things... I don't hear them on phone calls, but watching YT videos on my Dell laptop I'll have audio dropouts every so often.  Bose will just want you to send them in for replacement... they all do this, so just learn to live with it.  My Plantronics never did this, great 50$ bluetooth headset, but no noise cancelling.  It might be that replacing the BT transmitter (like getting a new chiclet dongle) could help... I don't seem to have this problem at work using a brand new TPLink BT5.2 nubbin.I do intellectual work in an industrial environment so these have come in as life-savers.  When the heat exchanger near me turns on, I tune out!One critique I have is that the onboard voice is crap... you can barely understand it, and it spells out everything except 'iphone'.  I guess we're lucky it can talk at all."
"I had QC35's that I wanted to hand down and get a pair of new headphones with USB-C, so the QC headphones seemed to be the newest, with the same style of the QC35's that I loved so much. Unfortunately, they are plagued by a Bluetooth issue with multipoint enabled, where you get sound hiccups/interruptions and additional static noises when short sounds play, like notifications or chimes from Mac. I would return them if I could."
I‚Äôve had them for a few months now and while I love the quality of sound and everything the microphone is simply not working. I have tried all the troubleshooting tips I found online and it just won‚Äôt work. I am tired of people on being able to hear me or videos I have to rerecord because the microphone wasn‚Äôt picking up a single sound.I wish I had returned them when I first noticed.
"11/16 update: I finally have a working headset in my possession. It is the wrong color, and the item is well outside of Amazon's return window, so I can't even exchange this for the color I originally purchased.11/8 update: It has been 2 months since I started the support ticket for this item. I still do not have a working headset nor do I have the headset in my possession. If you ever take the risk of buying these headsets and there's a defect, just return/replace it through Amazon and do not go through this same terrible experience I did with Bose's support.The good: The actual sound quality (when the headphones worked) was amazing, and the transparency mode worked wonderfully. It's also a VERY comfortable headset, both on the ears and even for someone with a wide head that usually gets pinched by standard headset sizes.The bad: The headphones only worked properly for about one month before it would just start dropping audio randomly. It wasn't disconnecting from any of my devices or turning off, either, as I could still hear everything around me in transparency mode. It just stopped transmitting any sounds from my connected computer and phone for minutes at a time.The really bad: Service requests are extremely slow. The headphones have been with Bose and out of my hands for longer than I've actually been able to use the headphones at all. They also do not have the same color options on the service website as they have for sale here, so you will not be able to get anything but black or white headphones to replace whatever you send to them."
"I bought these to replace my aging pair of Bose over ear headphones from 2017. I will say the sounds quality is absolutely amazing. The base the fidelity, just wow. But the quality of materials and the fit feel cheap, and too tight. Also makes my ears overheat which never happened with my previous pair. I'm going to return and try the higher end version and hope it's better."
"Android phones have issues connecting the QC45 headphones to the Bose Music App.For a $200+ product you'd expect all features to work properly. The App on the Google Play store was last updated Jan 2023. Yeah 2 years ago. Which is likely why no one can connect their headphones to the app. The good news is the headphones do connect to my Android phone and laptops via bluetooth no problem. The factory settings are good enough for me, but it would of been nice to have access to the app to dial in the EQ some more. But for me they sound good without having to tinker. The Active Noise cancelling works great. The only other issue which is fairly common on bluetooth is latency issues with watching music videos on youtube. The sound is about half a second behind the singer. But if your just watching a youtuber doing a podcast it's not as noticeable. But for audio books and listening to regular music playlists they do the trick. But forget about the app. If the app's features are important to you,  don't get these with any android device. Garbage app. A ton of bad reviews on the App store regarding the ""Bose"" App. I should of done a better job of researching these, but amazon has them rated very high. Oh well. Good luck."
"The audio is fantastic! I love how sound proof it really is. And it‚Äôs soooo comfortable !So why 3 starts? The connection is a bitch. It can‚Äôt just be Bluetooth, you have to download an app that only works about half the time to connect your headphones to your phone... actually I take that back, even the app can‚Äôt connect the device to my phone. I have to go through BT settings (which is fine!) but, Every time I go to connect, I have to forget the device and reconnect to it. Very frustrating compared to the easy set up of other audio devices the beats to JBL. I should just be able to select the device and it connects without whatever is happening. And yes, I keep my iOS up to date along with the app."
Noise cancelation is not good. I have Bose's headphones that I bought 9 years ago and the noise cancelation is 10 times better than these headphones and I only had them for a day. I wore them on a busy bus and I could hear everything still.
"For $39‚Ä¶Product came intact, properly in its box, no issues. Easy to connect/pair via Bluetooth with iPhone (intuitive pairing). Regular quality of sound when listening to music or videos. I‚Äôm not looking for top-notch studio sound but I know I paid $39 for them, so it‚Äôs cool. Cushions are Ok, headband fits properly as it adapts. Controls are simple but effective. Noise canceling function (three modes) not the best but not bad for $39 bucks.All the above info would put these at 4 stars. However, I rate it three stars because I had a couple of FaceTime and WhatsApp video calls with people, and they told me they kept hearing a constant ‚Äúclicking‚Äù or ‚Äútapping‚Äù noise or sound and it could become annoying. I tried messing with the audio input settings on my iPhone (automatic, standard and voice isolation) to find out if this would help but it didn‚Äôt. It wasn‚Äôt until I muted the mic that the noise went away, which makes me think there no toper compatibility between the headphones and the audio input software in the apple devices.So, if you‚Äôre looking to buy something to get you through a long flight or travel to listen music and movies, or maybe reduce the ambiance sounds a little, by all means; it‚Äôs only $39 plus tax. Quick and painless.If you‚Äôre looking however, for flawless sound integration with devices and communication software, you‚Äôd better invest in name brands like Bose, Sony or Beats."
Overall they are a decent head phone not wow like bose or higher quality but they do the trick for a cheap pair of head phones. They‚Äôll work until the holiday sales start.Pro‚ÄôsBluetooth or aux cord. Most devices are going away from aux cord but they know a lot of people have older devices and can not financially update and this allows both.Decent sound for a cheapo pair of head phones. I wouldn‚Äôt rave it great but it gets the job done. I compared them to my older head phones from 10 yrs ago and was a bit impressed but def NOT  wow they‚Äôre great. No where near bose but it does the job. It does some sounds decently but is not so great at other sounds. If you like surround sound I would not rate these great for that. I love good sounding music and these don‚Äôt cut it for me but will do until the holiday sales kick in. I live in my head phones so I will get high quality ones these ain't it.Won‚Äôt break the bank. For a cheap head phone these are actually pretty decent. I‚Äôve had my fair share of cheap not so great head phones. If you are not hard on your head phones you could easily get a couple yrs out of these. I have a lot of aux cord devices and this will probably end up being a back up pair for those. In the long run I may eventually take out the battery and keep them as a aux cord headphone.Great noise cancelation up to about 90 dec. That's pretty much most back ground noise. Works great as I'm a light sleeper. This is a standard feature with most head phones these days.Con‚ÄôsShort battery life. I mean 40 hrs isn‚Äôt that long. I know other head phones that can last up to 3 days with a full charge. I mean that‚Äôs every other day you‚Äôre charging them for 2 hrs.Short axu cord. Sorry but 1.5 ft is very short and you need at least a 3 ft cord to be comfortable with it. You can easily buy a longer aux cord on amazon if this one be too short for you. Yes the aux cord can affect the sound quality. You be best to buy a more decent one than the cheapo one that came in the box.Charging cord is very short 0.5ft. Designed to charge device off to the side not while using it. I am glad I bought a universal head charger as this won‚Äôt cut it for me. Am I the only one who finds the tedious charging of head phones annoying?Environment affects battery life. This head phone is designed for the ideal temps of 40-90f.  Anything outside of this range can heavily affect them. If you read the manual this is in there.Volume controls are a bit difficult to access. You have to tuck under the ear piece and feel for them instead of blindly taping the ear piece for it. This is a bit frustrating.Not the best sound. Great for a chep pair but I wouldn‚Äôt go raving about the sound quality. I am use to high quality sound such as bose or better.Can‚Äôt hear anything in a noisy environment above 90 decimals unless the volume is over 30%. Sorry but my old beats could easily blast through that and I could hear my beats as low as 5% volume in noisy environments. I had a fan running in the back ground and had to have them 40% or higher to hear them.App that comes with the head phones will steal the data on your phone. So many people fall for this and you can run the device fine without it. Please read the i agree clause and you will save your self from this fate. You do NOT need the app and they work just fine as a stand alone device.Unable to disable the voice notifications. I use my head phones a lot and find it annoying when your device randomly says ‚Äúbattery low‚Äù or gives an odd command out of the blue. Zero way to disable this.A bit tight for me. These are pretty tight on my head and I do not find them the slightest bit comfortable. The ear pieces are huge for me and it would be nice to have them a couple inches smaller.
"I got the headphones so I could have something to listen to and possibly cancel some noise while working. I have not gone in to work with them yet since I've only owned them for 8-10 hours so far. However in that short time I was pleasantly surprised they so far are better than expected.I have a good sound system with a REALLY big subwoofer (Martysub) that can play well below 20Hz. And I've tried headphones in the past that claim to play that or lower but fall far from that claim, most roll off at 30Hz which imo is too early. These headphones actually have bass reaching down to 20Hz (Haven't tried any lower yet) at loud enough volume to impress me. I don't need it to be super super loud, just loud enough to be there.I played ""Bassotronics - Maximum Excursion"" and each note was there. It doesn't sound as clean as my Subwoofer. However it's not totally killed by loud harmonic distortion to totally ruin the fact that it is there and the pressure is felt. I'm not normally a very loud listener, so I'm not sure how loud it can play that low without sounding strained. But it get loud enough for me. I wish I could explain how loud I listen but it's different for everyone, but it's probably close to 80-90dBA.Noise canceling isn't something I can properly review as this is the second noise canceling pair of headphones I've tried. But it's not as bad as some people I've seen say. It's not going to block out the world. But it does better than expected for a $40 pair of headphones.It was better than the other pair of headphones I've tried, my friend has the ""Plantronics Pro 2"" and in my car with the engine running and AC blowing I could still easily hear those sounds, just slightly quieter with the Plantronics. With these headphones the engine nose was ALL gone. And just a slight sound of the AC running was heard.Trying them out while in my church (I'm in the sound booth running the livestream and had free time during the singing to try them out) gave really good results again better than expected not totally blocking all the sound. But blocking enough to impress me and a few friends. For the $ it's pretty good in that situation.If you plan to listen to music with NC enabled then there will be a sound quality hit from what I can tell when activating it. The bass becomes more relaxed and might lose a bit of the mids. But that's not a total deal breaker to me since it's only $40 and I'm not using them to critically listen. So the hit to the SQ isn't enough to bother me. (Yet, we'll see as time goes on, I could change opinion of that over time as I use them more while working)I can't comment on the actual sound of the headphones as I'm not one who is able to really identify the sound signature that quickly. And because this stuff is VERY subjective and everyone will have a different opinion in the end. But if you're looking for BASS. These things have more than expected. You don't even need to bother with the extra bass feature they offer. They seriously have more than enough bass. If you're into more neutral sounding headphones, these might not be for you.But for $40 it's worth picking up and trying out if anything I've said in this review caught your attention. Worst thing you could do is decide to return it, and as far as I can tell Amazon offers free returns for this, and I'm not returning it after using them for only 8 hours.I'll try to update this review after giving them some more time, or of something major happens like it stops working, or one side becomes sentient and tries to take over the world.EDIT 8-10-2020Noticed while using ANC there is a flutter sound now. I'm 90% sure it's the driver moving for no reason trying to cancel out something pointlessly. Every step I take and every head movement I do there is a flutter sound. It's quite annoying when not listening to anything or if listening quietly.I'm not sure if this was present the day I got them and used them. But I'm disappointed that it does that and I'm not sure if it's a defect or what, but I have to knock it down to 3 stars from a very very solid 4 because of that problem. I might listen in a room with a loud fan or AC and it does a good job blocking it out, but the fluttering sound is still there and makes listening quietly annoying if you even slightly move your head or plan to walk while listening quietly. This problem is only while ANC is on just to repeat myself.But... in other news... While mowing the lawn (probably not a good idea with these, but wanted to give it a real test) it really blocked out a lot of the noise (not all of it) and I didn't have to BLAST music to drown it out. Was very nice."
"I purchased these to replace my old Studio Beats Pro that finally kicked it after eight years. I wanted a cheap replacement, so I wasn't expecting much. When I received these, I immediately noticed the quality matched the price. The buttons felt flimsy and were not very responsive; many times, I'd hold the volume up or down button to switch between songs, and instead it would only adjust the volume. It'd take a few tries to get it to switch tracks. The noise cancelling modes were also confusing, and the noise cancelling quality was really not impressive.Anyways, that's all to say that these headphones started distorting sound this week while using them for my Logic Pro recording projects. I know, I know, these are not high quality studio headphones, but still, I would've hoped for them to last a bit longer. The volume wasn't even very high when I started noticing the distortion, and I checked with different headphones and the same tracks sounded just fine.If you want an affordable pair of headphones, these might suit you just fine. And to be fair, you may have better luck with them than I did."
"The only con with these headphones:I'm giving this a 2 star review because (at the time of writing) ""Home Office"" is included in the product title. This is misleading because most ""home offices"" have Windows PCs. I have used other Bluetooth headphones for gaming with my desktop Windows PC and was able to select the ""handsfree"" setting to get both the input and output to work. No luck with these. Customer support was quick to respond, but ultimately it was useless. They confirmed that a TRRS aux cable would enable the microphone to work with Windows vs the TRS aux cable that comes with the product. This did not work, so now I have to return the aux cable. I tested my other two TRRS wired headsets with in-line mics and they worked, so this is definitely not a jack issue with my desktop. I saw on Reddit that the mic on this headset does not work when wired: just like ANC. ANC DOES NOT WORK WHEN THESE ARE WIRED.So the lack of mic with PC and the lack of ANC when wired are the cons. This wouldn't be that big of an issue for me if these were not advertised for ""home office"" use. I was planning on using these for online meetings.Pros:-These headphones are GREAT for talking on my smartphone and I have had no complaints regarding my voice quality. They are also very comfortable while sitting up. The only discomfort I've experienced is with dangling earrings in the way or while lying down on my side. Even so, those did not deter me and the headphones were still ""comfortable enough"".-ANC works well in Bluetooth mode. It is effective and comparable to what I experienced with a popular set of white wireless earphones from a top global brand. These are well worth the price with that type of efficacy.-Mic works in wired mode with provided aux cable for smartphone calls (but not for PC, as stated above)-Easily switches Bluetooth between devices: even though the mic on these doesn't work with Windows in any way, I can still listen to audio easily and the headphones seamlessly switch between my desktop PC and  smartphone when calls come in or even if I'm just scrolling on my phone while it's connected to both devices.Overall review: This is a 5/5 smartphone headset and 5/5 PC headPHONES (because the mic doesn't work with the latter). As an overall product, however, I have to give these 2/5 stars because they are ultimately useless to home office users who want to use its mic with their PCs for Zoom, Google Meet, and video calls/meetings in general. If you push ahead to buy these for video calls on PC, just have a separate mic ready and disable the ""handsfree"" options: the sound quality is HORRIBLE for the automatic ""handsfree""-labeled output option and applications like Discord will often automatically switch to that and refuse to go back."
"To begin withbuild quality is reasonable - when I held it in my hand for the first time, I was shocked how light it was. No breaks so far; but below are my speculations. The usual points of failure are the swivel joints of the cups and the slider mechanism for the headband. The swivel joints are made of good quality plastic, but I don't expect them to last for ever, as they are loaded when you wear the headphones. But my main concern is the headband - fixed metal with plastic sliding over it. This is a recipe for disaster. The rigidity of the metal band and the plasticity of the plastic slider results in the plastic slider disintegrating at around the one year mark. Ideally the plastic slider should be reinforced with metal on the inside, so it becomes metal slider in a metal band. I'll update if I decide to have this till then. This has not been an issue after 7 months. Speaks volumes about the quality of plastics used. Skullcandy can learn a thing or two from this model.One aux cable and a micro USB charging cable were provided in the box along with a pleather finished carry pouch.Comfort is - good. The cushions are kinda small and may make them ""over the ears"" if you have larger earlobes, but I don't have this problem and I have no complaints. The cushions are soft enough and there clamp force is not excessive. It is freezing here, so can't comment about how it reacts to sweat and hot weather - something for an update.Sound quality is above average for it's price. The bass is a little boosted, not overdone - but it is muddy. There is no separation at the lower frequencies and you can't resolve the different instruments and the different tones. The mids are there with better resolution and the highs are slightly recessed. Overall not tiring or shrill and just about worth it for the price.No aptX support here, so I expected latency, but surprisingly, there is none. Can definitely use this for watching movies and videos. I suspect this is the reason for the general lack of separation and resolution in the otherwise good sound. I didn't like the bassup feature, makes the already muddy lows muddier.Noise cancelling is great for this price, almost all the lower frequencies - road noise, water flowing., etc are filtered out almost completely. People speaking, not at all. But this is quite impressive to say the least. It almost has the Sony XB950N1 (IMO one of the worst built headphones ever) beat in noise cancelling, which is impressive at this price point.Connection strength is impressive, I can now move around the house (or move the music source) without the music being interrupted (there are other actions that do that, more on that later). Bluetooth 5.0 seems to do the trick here.Battery life is also impressive, I expect to hit the claimed 30 hour mark easily.Now the issues I've had with the device1. Even though this is the costliest headphone, and the latest one at that, in the soundcore website, it looks like this is NOT the flagship product in the headphone category. The soundcore app doesn't support the life series (only the true wireless earbuds and the Space NCs, the previous flagships, are supported). So, no way to adjust the sound profile.2. When I walk normally (or when I am not absolutely still) with these headphones on, there is a faint creaking/vibrating sound coming from the cans - like a small weight mounted at the end of a horizontal spring is vibrating due to the movement. This is an isolated issue, didn't happen with the replacement I received.3. The bigger problem is when I eat something (move the jaw) or when I walk fast or when the vehicle hits a small bump in the road, there is a short jarring high picthed screech which is very irritating, to say the least. This is what I need to see if I can live with. This is prevalent in all three of these headphones I've used so far. So, if the ride is tough, you will have to switch NC off.So, is it a good value proposition? On a normal day, it is. There are not that many better options at the price point of $50. If NC is important then none as good till you hit the $150 price range. But with Thanksgiving around and the Sennheiser HD4.50 BTNCs discounted at $80, I believe it is a better deal to shell out the $30 for the Sennheisers, only if you are okay with the Sennheiser quality of uninspiring, but very high quality sound. The Sennheisers have bluetooth 4.0 with aptX support. Which should be fine. But at the end of the day, if you can live with the small niggling problems, these are a steal at around the $50 price range. The Sennheisers above had a vice like compression which became very uncomfortable very soon.[UPDATE] reduced rating because the power button is acting weird. Not powering on or off most of the times. Also cannot double press it to connect the second device. I have to put the headphone on charge for the power button to work exactly once after that to turn the device on or put it in pairing mode. After pairing the power button again goes back to not working. I am trying the reset (charge while long pressing power * volume+ buttons). Will update rating if the reset fixes the issue. Else i will have to make a warranty claim.(UPDATE) Raised a warranty claim with the description of the problem, and received a replacement within a week. Almost no questions asked. The new one works great, at least for now. But honestly I didn't expect this to last this to perform this well, for it's price. So, definitely worth the price and I would highly recommend - especially if you are about to buy a Skullcandy - these sound much more balanced.(Update) the build isn't as good as it seemed to be. The band is literally cracking and crumbling all around. It started around the 'R' and  'L' marks in the band. I used superglue to seal these cracks. Now, the clip with the two screws is coming off.Overall, i will only buy another soundcore product of the build issues are fixed. Everything else is tolerable or better, but for the build (still better than Skullcandy)."
"Pros: I do a lot of international travel and waited to write a review until I used them for a few trips.  The sound quality is good for the price.  The noise canceling does a good job on a plane.  It was easy to set up the bluetooth with my bluetooth transmitted from the airplane screen.  They do recharge quickly.Con:  I have yet to get more than 4 hrs of play time with NC on.  I cannot tell you what the volume level percentage is but even if it was  at 100% it should last longer than 4 hrs.  No where near the advertised play time.  Sometimes if I just have NC on, the headphones will turn off.Bottom line:  For the price they are a good set of NC bluetooth headphones.  If you do not need a long play time they are a good set."
"I've ordered 3 pair of these.2 pair initially in Sept 2021BF's broke by April 2023 and I ordered him a replacement pair.Mine broke Sept 2024.By broke, I mean PHYSICALLY broke.Both in the same spot that connects the earphones to the headband.  Leaving the earphones working but dangling by wires.  BF's broke on one side.  Mine broke on both sides.  It seems to just be a weak point in construction.We were on a trip, so I literally bought electrical tape and taped them back together for my flight home.  LOL (pics are with the tape, but you can sort of see the break point)Overall, for the price point, they lasted 3 years. But disappointing they broke.The noise canceling, BT connection, and other electronics worked great."
"The problem with these headphones is that it seems it is tuned for the ANC mode. When it is on, it sounds good, clear, balanced. But if you turn it off, there is too much bass. The wired mode sounds similar or worse, too much lower, not enough upper, it doesn't sound right. You have to mess with the equalizer.But the problem with wireless mode is that there is too much latency. If you're playing games you have to use the wire. And ANC or equalizer don't work in wired mode. So it sounds bad.I also have an MDR-7506 which sounds much better with the wire. The only downside is the cable is ridiculously long, the short thin light detachable cable with these is nicer with the VR headset. But I'm not satisfied with the sound in wired mode.So if you're just going to listen to music or watch videos and you want ANC then these are great. The ANC works well and the headphones feel like nice quality.But if you want to play games, especially rhythm games, or use apps with sound effects on button presses then don't get these or any bluetooth headphones, the latency is too much. You have to get a good pair of wired headphones.P.S. It would be nice to switch ANC modes without excessively long sound effects that mute the sound for several seconds."
"Comfortability: 9/10Noise cancelling 6/10 ( idc for noise cancelling)Sound quality 7/10 (sounds a bit shallow, not as good as the Q10)I think these headphones are a bad business move for Anker. The Q10's were already superior in terms of Bass, Sound Quality, and battery life. They were also a similar price point. I compared the Q10's to 300$+ Sony's before and I could tell no difference in sound quality.Thought I was going crazy, so I had my brother do the same test , but with his eyes closed. Same result. The Q10's although having the same flaws such as sound leak, but they did have great build quality and for their price were going toe to toe with headphones 10 times their price.So why would Anker discontinue a beloved headphone and release an 'upgraded' Q20 that doesn't compare? I don't know...Sure, maybe you could say the Q20's are visually more attractive than the Q10's, but considering but models have sound bleed and some of us aren't going to wear these in public anyway because of that; the focus goes back on the sound.Just a bad business move. Please bring back the Q10's.if you are looking for a replacement for your Q10; keep looking. This is not it.  Sorry Anker :("
I was so excited about these headphonesMy favorite part is the noise cancelling capabilityMy daughter would throw tantrums screaming so loudand when I put the headphones on it lowered her volume down by atleast 50% without music playingThey‚Äôre comfy on your ears nice and lightweight and sounds pretty clearMy only disappointment is they worked great for 1 weekNow I‚Äôm hearing static at random timesIt started with static in my right earNow they both have static Randomlyand it isn‚Äôt based on the distance away from my phoneMy phone was in my hands and the earphones were cracklingI‚Äôm debating returning but I don‚Äôt have the box anymore üòí
"Just got these and have been trying them around the house, before I take them on a long plane trip. So far, it seems like the ""noise cancelling"" is mostly just music drowning out ambient noise! With no music playing, they don't seem to cancel much of anything. I had some Bose (I know, apples to oranges) that I used for years and eventually wore out. They too would play music, but even w/o, they were VERY quiet and good at cancelling the ambient noise. I was hoping for similar with these, but not hearing it so far. Anyone have similar issues? They do look great and sound very nice for playing music, and are comfortable."
"I had a pair of Mpow H19 headphones that worked great for years. I broke them recently. I couldn't find Mpow on Amazon anymore (research says they were booted off for soliciting reviews). The sound quality of these is not as good as Mpow. Also the Mpow verbally said ""Power on"" and ""Connected"" but the Soundcore ones simply beep and its not obvious what it means. Also the Mpow had a slide switch for turning on/off noise cancellation. It was obvious, by feel, whether it was on. The Soundcore simply beeps and there is no tactile way to figure out status of noise cancellation."
"Purchased to muffle and ideally cancel out loud noises outside room-gym balls hitting the wall and yelling. But out of the box, no luck.With music, it was ok, but I was hoping to be able to use the noise cancelation without music.The NC light turned on and then off. I read others had that problem. It may have been operator error, but the directions are very limited. Supposedly there is an app. to try.Comfort: For the moment I wore them, they were comfortable.Probably just fine for music, but for noise cancellation I would keep looking."
"Why in the world do they not allow you to turn on the Active Noise Cancelling when using the 1/8"" cable?!?  I got these because, for some reason, there are hardly any Active Noise Cancelling wired headphones.  So I figured I'd just get a wireless ANC set that has an 1/8"" jack...  Nope, not gonna work!  Freaking ridiculous decision...Can't find anything stating that in their manual or on this page.  At least tell your customers before they buyOther than that, they fit really snug and comfortable, but without ANC while plugged in they're pretty much worthless to me..."
"As someone who balks at seeing some of the big brands like Bose and Sony command triple digit prices for their wireless headphones, I was praying for these to be a decent budget option compared to those. Sadly, it does not even rate that.I got the package, opened it up, let it charge to full. Then I connected it to my laptop, and basked in in how it made everything sound COMPLETELY FADED OUT. These somehow sound WORSE than a $20 pair of Bluetooth earbuds from Target. I have had better audio experiences using a pair of 3rd-party corded headphones that cost about $15 at a Radioshack from 2005.EDIT 10/31: Turns out my terrible first experience was because I was using the frankly awful factory default settings. Surprisingly, these headphones CAN do a competent job. If you remember to adjust ANC or plug it into your device with an aux cord. And adjust your device audio settings, especially if you're making a jump over from earbuds to over-ear phones like I am."
"I've had these headphones for a while now. The sound quality is very good and they hold a charge for a very long time. However, there are two big negatives that are leading me to order a different product long before the useful life of this product is complete. One: the max volume is low. This is a personal preference, but I like my music loud. It's is not an issue with my phone. The max between these and my earbuds is noticeable. Second and more importantly, the fit is extremely poor. I have a pretty big head (7 5/8 in a fitted hat) and the smallest setting is extremely loose and they slip off regularly. You have to be Andre the Giant to get a good fit with these. It's exacerbated by the fact the tension in the band is not very strong. I recommend choosing a different brand."
"While the sound is good, there is not enough if it.  When at the gym I like head banging music like iton maiden and I want it loud.  These headphones are nowhere close to loud so I am really disappointed.  I will keep them just to listen to podcasts but now I will have to do some research to find what I was hoping these would do"
"I bought these headphones in 2022 and did not use them very much.  As the photo shows, the headphones are in bad shape with the fabric peeling and the right side broken completely.  They are now worthless junk, I expected them to be more durable.  If you don't mind replacing them in 2 years or less, then I guess they are fine."
"I've owned three of this model of headset now. They all die from the same exact design flaw. I'm not willing to buy another but if you learn from my mistakes you'll probably enjoy good performance for a long time.Don't wear them around your neck. That's pretty much it. As you can see from the photo, the plastic framing holding the joint just above the earpiece isn't designed to handle much stress. A lot of the time I leave my headset on the desk when not in use, and that provided a long enough lifespan for me to tell you the good parts:Call quality is great, I never have any complaints. The noise cancellation (for the wearer) is about a third as good as more expensive headsets or earbuds I've tested, which makes sense as they're about a third the price.Battery life is pretty good. I can get through a six hour conference call marathon, but it'll leave me using laptop speakers and mic by the end of the day because you can't charge during use.Comfort is better than par. Anything under 4 hours at a stretch has been no problem for me. I'm relieved to take them off after five or more hours of calls.Unfortunately I forgot, after maybe nine or ten months, what not to do with this pair. I was up from my desk, getting a coffee, and wore my headphones out of the room in case there was a question that needed my response on the call (there wasn't). When the call ended I lowered the headphones to my neck rather than place them on the kitchen counter.After grabbing my coffee, heading back to the office I gripped the headphones in one hand, grabbing the center of the headband, and pulled back to take them off my neck. This wasn't a forceful motion at all. I felt only mild pressure from the headphones against my neck, no real discomfort, but sliding them off my neck in this manner was enough to end them.Like I said, this makes 3 for 3 of this model that died in the same way. The first was a similar story. I grabbed by one ear piece and tried to sort of curve it around the neck to take it off, breaking that same joint. Pair number two lasted the longest. I remembered every time to grab with both hands on the earpiece, every time I took it off my neck, but a few dozen repetitions was too much for that joint by the earpiece. They cracked and broke in the same place, pretty much the same way as you see here. This now makes a third pair of Soundcore Q20 that broke in the same manner through normal use.If you're confident you'll never wear these on your neck, and you'll only ever gingerly move them on and off your head with both hands holding both earpieces, they're honestly a great performing headset for work calls, good for an audiobook while mowing the lawn or blowing leaves, and not bad for music.Just don't buy these if you like to hold your headphones on your shoulders, draped around your neck, like many of us do. They can't handle the strain."
"Soundcore Life Q20 (hereafter Q20) sound very muffled - in that high frequencies are heavily attenuated, as well as muddy - in that quieter instruments with rich overtones are indistinguishable.  On top of that, my unit's frame broke after one year of light use.  As this is my first encounter with active noise cancellation, I find Q20's performance satisfactory.Q20 is another recommendation from Don Lindich.  I am comparing Q20 with Modern Portable HiFi Elite Super 66 (hereafter Super 66), the best earphones I have owned and a satisfactory Lindich recommendation.Compared with Super 66, the very first impression Q20 gives is isolation, signifying a different ear cup design.  If you are not accustomed to such designs, it can feel strange even with NC off.  Additionally, this design makes listening much more difficult when you eat anything including soft food.My main focus on sound quality is clarity and balance.  So I choose Smetana‚Äôs Vltava (The Moldau).  In particular, listen to the string plucks at the beginning, and triangle amidst varying levels of orchestral sound.  Not all recordings of this piece can reveal the subtle differences in sound reproduction.  I found a 1989 Deutsche Grammophon recording of Boston Symphony Orchestra/Rafael Kubelik really good in details. (If you are interested, this is from Deutsche Grammophon's album ""Smetana: M√° Vlast‚Äù (My Country).  I also find the same recording in a Deutsche Grammophon compilation titled ""Dvorak: Symphony No. 9 'New World'.)  Unless specifically noted, sound quality is assessed with noise control off.Q20 simply cannot deliver softer triangles the recording contains, and is less balanced.  Meanwhile, I appreciate the increased details in bass in quieter segments due to Q20's better isolation.  The main problem, however, is a cutoff of high frequencies.  You do not need any challenging material to find this.  Any naturally occurring sound including human voice feel muffled.  Sound quality doesn't change whether wired to a MacBook Pro or transmitted via Bluetooth.I originally bought Q20 for daily listening as my aging Super 66 started to wear out. (Unfortunately, Modern Portable seemed to have ceased operation.)  But due to lack of sound quality, I only lightly used it for occasional late night TV.  Even under light use, Q20's headband broke after merely one year.  Unlike Super 66, large segments of Q20's movable parts are not enhanced by metal. (The white residue in pictures are from duct tapes I used to hold the piece together.)To test noise control, I put Q20 on while operating a vacuum cleaner.  I can easily hear audio content, while the vacuum sound is quite remote.In summary, Q20 lacks sound balance and wants sound clarity.  I would not recommend it for music at any price.  Q20's headband heavily rely on plastic strength.  My unit disintegrated after merely one year of light use.  If you are luckier with the plastic pieces, maybe you can use it in Zoom meetings or to fend off office noise.Additional observations about Q20's software:Interaction with audio control on Macbook Pro is strange in that the Bluetooth connection disables computer control.  Instead, it is either maximum output or no output.  All control remain on the headset but there is no indication of level.  This is different from when it connects to iPhone or Apple TV, where adjustments on the headset are reflected on the device's sound level indicator.Aux cable connection interacts with powered functions in truly bizarre manner.  If the unit is turned off, only left driver produces sound.  But both driver can produce sound once the unit is turned on, even if it is subsequently turned off.  After some time (I haven‚Äôt determined the exact sequence), aux can only drive left ear driver again.When both drivers produce sound on aux input, NC can be activated - even if the power option is turned off.  But when NC is activated with aux input, it interferes with sound production in a disastrous manner.  So, if your unit sounds horrible with aux input, make sure NC is turned off. (When the main power is shown as off, NC could remain on without the green indicator light.)"
the sound on these headphones was good for music but calls were awful it was like being at the bottom of a well all the time. no one could hear me well.  also it was really frustrating because there are no audio prompts.  you have to decipher which series of beeps means you're connected to bluetooth and which means it's disconnected.
"In a hurry to replace a very clear, simple to use Grado SR80e Prestige open back headphone that I loaned to my wife, I bought the Anker Soundcore Lite Q20 and the Philips SHP9600. I was disappointed by the sound quality in the Anker, but to be sure my ears weren't playing tricks, I compared each of these headphones with the same music at normal listening volumes with digital music stored on a Sony Walkman NW-A45/L. The reference headphone used was the Audio Technica ATH-M50X.  None of these headphones have noise cancellation capability. The specific music was Debussy's Ave Maria, chosen because of the excellent clear production and spare instrumentation. All testing was done in a quiet basement room.  Each of the headphones were connected sequentially with the same stereo cable to the Sony Walkman (Bluetooth was available only on the Audio-Technica, but was not used).  These are on a 1-10 scale (10 being the best sound experience, but I surrendered to two half scores), without benefit of testing instruments. In short, I am evaluating the clarity of sound at all frequencies that I can hear:Anker Soundcore:  2Philips 9600:  6.5-7Grado SR-80:  8.5-9Audio Technica M50xBT  10Why did I purchase the Anker? Price and the reviews. In retrospect, I can't imagine what the reviewers listen to, but the Anker sound is muddy, distorted, and very obviously and annoyingly boosted (with a blurring tendency) at the low end.  With the Anker, when the flute and piano were playing together in the composition, the Anker boosted the low notes of the piano and muddied the flute.  Save your dollars. Maybe for podcasts? Cheap, but really not serious music listening.Why the Philips? Price was a positive influence. And the brand. I clearly misunderstood the size of the over the ear cups. They're huge (""spacious""). Comfortable but huge. Background noise can be heard through the earcups - it's an open-ear design, but the sound quality of quiet passages, low notes, high notes, and the instrumental clarity when both flute and piano mingle was SO much better compared with the Anker.Then the Grado SR80e. This has been a favorite as a lightweight, high clarity headphone for eight years for me. As an open ear design, background noise can be a challenge, but in the right listening environment the comfort with accuracy in sound reproduction has been welcomed.  You can wear these for hours in complete comfort.The Audio-Technica M50x? They've been worth the investment, when you want to listen to the instrumentation, or listen to the vocalizations sitting at your desk or in a comfortable seat.  The over the ear cups do hide what you're listening to from all but the nearest neighbors in the office or on the the couch. They're comfortable, they've lasted through travels for seven years, and the clarity of sound is sweet.None of these headphones would work to wear while mowing the lawn - they don't clamp to your head, and the open back designs allow ambient noise in. The Philips might do the best job of staying on your head during walking and simple movement.  I hope this helps."
"My son bought these and they broke in a year, a price of plastic fell off and they are now Scotch taped together . Fortunately, we bought the insurance plan and they will be replaced, but he uses them daily so he‚Äôs having anxiety of being without waiting for the replacement. He loves them, but if you do get them, get the warranty!"
"I've owned 2 pairs of these headphones. They can be somewhat durable. My first pair lasted roughly a year before one of the ears stopped emitting sound. I bought a second pair and now after over a year of use, the foam is peeling and leaving its residue on my ears when I remove the headphones. It also has created this odor around the foam that is rancid and I am a very clean person. The smell is unbearable to the point that I'm thinking of just tossing these headphones and looking elsewhere to replace them. The smell is the first time I've ever experienced with a pair of headphones and I've been a long time PC/headphone user. Rather sad because outside of that, they provide decent sound and the noise cancelling is great."
"Does not come with a user manual, only a worthless quick start guide. Connection so far has been tedious and hit or miss, sound quality decent once connected. Have not figured out purported active noise cancellation. Without any user manual it's hard to get much function out of them."
I recently purchased this headset after losing my Q35 headset. I had been so impressed with the sound quality and noise canceling feature of my Q35 that I had expected comprable quality of this headset.  Unfortunately this headset has fallen short in both the noise canceling and sound quality.I use my headset when commuting by public transportation and the headset is impacted by any vibrations in both trains and buses. My previous headset quality was never impacted while commuting. I guess if you are using the headset indoors or when walking then it‚Äôs worth the purchase. If you are seeking to use it while engaged in physical activity like running or commuting consider the more expensive headset like the Q35.
Bought these a year ago and they've worked great. However the headphones say they charge with USB C but mine have a USB micro b charge port which is annoying. I have to keep a separate micro b charging cable just for these.
The phones were great when they worked. After about 2 months they began to shut down after a few minutes of play. It appears this is not a rare problem based on complaints on the company website. None of the proposed solutions have worked.Update: Anker Life has resolved my problem with their product and I have upgraded my star rating.
"Updated on 12/5:I've had these headphones since late August and use them daily, and I wanted to update my review. Please be advised that everything I mention below is still true so I'll leave that text in tact.Occasionally these headphones experience a BT hiccup interrupting the sound. It's usually less than a second, but it is noticeable.I'll add as an item wish that it connect to multiple devices.I go through a lot of over-the-ear headphones because I sleep with them. I've probably bought 5 pair this year alone because they've either broken or no longer take a charge. I like these because they're comfortable, have better than average (for the price) noise-cancellation, have excellent sound, can go a couple of days without a charge, are about at the ~$50 mark, which is about as much as I want to spend on them. I like these so much that I'm going to buy a couple more pair; one to keep at my desktop computer and a couple of pair for my kids.  The only thing these are missing over a JBL set I bought urgently from a retail store is the ability to connect to multiple phones and automatically switch to whichever was producing sound."
Arrived with zero documentation. I had to figure it out on my own. I would prefer a slide power switch than one button that acts differently for different length pushes without clear and distinct audio feedback
Its has good sound quality and is pretty good however after about an hour in it starts hurting your ears as it a bit tight
"I bought a pair at the end of 2021, and they're pretty good budget headphones except for one major flaw (more later).They're comfy out of the box and even better with M50x pads (the plastic frame from the old pads needs to be removed and reused to put the M50X pads on.) For sound quality, they're bassy but not overdone. They sound great with an AutoEq preset on whatever you're listening on. Battery life is fantastic, noise cancelling is pretty good, and the option to use them wired is nice.The only flaw is the very brittle plastic used for the arms. They made some creaking noises when new and some dry lubricant in the seams seemed to fix that. My pair cracked around the hinge after about a year. I glued them back together but now there's more stress cracks on the outside of the arms and in the plastic on the size adjustment. These live on my desk and don't get thrown around. I like Anker's stuff, but the build quality on these is disappointing."
"I got these on sale for prime day specifically for noise cancellation. It unfortunately does not work that well. It‚Äôs okay for drowning out white noise in the background like a fan. But it‚Äôs not good for office chatter. If you‚Äôre looking for headphones to cancel out talking, these aren‚Äôt the ones. Apple AirPod Pros are great for noise cancellation but they hurt my ears. These soundcore headphones are comfortable and have good bass but not noise cancelling. I wouldn‚Äôt pay full price for them."
"Worked great until a year later now & they won't charge....read it's a common issue, so they came out with Q30"
Noise cancelling is average at best. Got these to deal with a colicky baby and they hardly take the edge off.
"Pairing was no issue, and the sound is reasonably good. Instructions were atrocious: printed in <1/32"" type and diagrams of ""controls"" shows a bunch of icons with no explanation for what they mean or where they are located on the headset. You will need a magnifying glass to locate and try to decipher the black-on-black symbols on the headset buttons.Ear covers seal well, but make wearing very warm.Overall, they work and are worth the low price."
The bass isn't that good and the ear fabric portion is beginning to peel after a month of daily use.
"As others have mentioned, the headband is a little long, the product as a whole is heavy, and the plastic near the joints where the headphones bend does crack and break after some time. Mine only took a few months before this process started to happen. I‚Äôve had mine for about 4 years now and am about to give up. The plastic has completely broken off at one hinge (the other side is not that far behind) and the headphone has to be duct taped to stay attached to the headband. Considering I only used it for less than 10 hours per week on average for the first two years and paid over $50, it wasn‚Äôt bad but it could have been better. Definitely could have been constructed better to avoid the issues I have. In contrast, the MPOWs I received as a gift before these that I use everyday for at least 20 hours per week are still in beautiful shape."
"Update 4.27.2020Adding a star because Anker Customer Service reached out to me and sent me a replacement pair of phones for free. I will use the new ones and reply back after i have had them for a little while. Only time will tell how well they hold up.Update 3.30.2020Updated review: 2 StarsI still stand by the original review in terms of sound quality, noise cancellation, and battery life. Those continue to be exactly as they were. However: After just three short months, the once plush ear cups are just a flat lumpy mess. The foam inside does not stand up to daily use at all. The leather covers are also starting to dry out; its only a matter of time before they crack and peel. And lastly, the plastic body now creaks and groans every time i put them on, turn my head, or take them off. I honestly wonder whats going to happen first: The plastic is going to crack, or the ear cups are going to rip. Only time will tell.Original Review: 4 StarsOverall, I would say these are a solid buy for $60. Anker soundcore products continue to improve with each iteration, but they still have some room to grow. They aren‚Äôt *quite* up to par with Bose, but are probably up there with Sony or Sennheiser. Obviously, this is subjective to personal tastes, but I  think these headphones actually have a pretty wide sound stage. The treble is clear without being shrill, mids sound good and in their own space and  they don‚Äôt get left behind or crowded out by the bass, which is solid (and honestly better) without the bass boost (which is really more of an EQ change instead of a real change in amplified bass frequencies. I leave it off). Bass is punchy without feeling ridiculously warm or overpowering; Beats these are not. Ive also used these to listen to some tv and movies, and I feel like the dialogue is clear and present, while leaving enough room for the effects, background noise and music to all fit in together.But they aren‚Äôt without their drawbacks. They ear cups are super comfy, and I have actually fallen asleep with them on a few times, but the faux leather liner leaves no air in or out, so they don‚Äôt breathe at all and become a sweaty mess, even now in the winter. The band is nice and wide, so it fits my stupidly large head well enough, but the weight balance on your head feels a little top heavy, and I find myself adjusting them even when I‚Äôm not moving around. And the ANC actually kind of sucks. It works well enough to drown out light background noises, like typing on a keyboard, or even walking around an office building, but it isn‚Äôt strong enough to nullify a train ride or a plane engine, and the headphones don‚Äôt seem smart enough to figure out how remove constant white noise like a fan or heavy rain; that kind of noise actually seems to get drawn in by the mic, and I find that I actually get better passive noise control from the ear cups with the ANC off for noises like that.Again, these aren‚Äôt perfect, and they don‚Äôt have a fancy app with tons of bells and whistles to fine tune the experience, but they sound incredible and they were only $60. You also can‚Äôt find a better customer service experience anywhere else, Anker has literally never let anyone down. Ever. For that, I can live with their shortcomings."
Nice enough to wear for along time. Cheap enough to toss em if they suck;Update 10/20/24- first flight on 10/7 the left side extender won‚Äôt close flush. Now they stay like that. Move on people. If it were Clearance item at 9.99 with a 5 dollar coupon deal for these. Sure. Buy em for the entire fam. Other than that go in the other pocket and double the budget.  The right also doesn‚Äôt feel good or comfortable after 60 min. Cracks slightly on kill tony. Sound cancel was good. No engine noise. But final- these for the birds y‚Äôall. ‚úåÔ∏è
"I've purchased two of these headphones and gotten a replacement for one as they continue to degrade. The ear cups are only held in by a small piece of plastic, and when that plastic inevitably cracks, the entire cup falls out from under you!The battery life is good, although I primarily use mine over an AUX cable but Bluetooth is also an option for wireless playback. The sound is good, but nothing to write home about. The padding at the top is a bit stiff, but the headphones fit fine on my head and aren't super uncomfortable.Overall, this is a very 'you get what you pay for' pair of headphones. Although I am disappointed there's such a glaring flaw with the plastic retainer for the ear cups, I'll probably keep buying this pair since there's nothing that beats these for the price."
