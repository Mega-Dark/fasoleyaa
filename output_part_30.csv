"This product heats up well, holds temps, auto shuts off, is ergonomic, pours well , fill lines easy to read, BUTstainless it is not.Brown spots appeared in the base of the well. The company blames mineral deposits... but I have never seen this in a product I have used in my house in the past including stove kettles . I like this product a lot, but am leery of the rust"
Not working after 2 years.
"I don’t need all the different temperature controls, but this was one of the few electric kettles available that didn’t have any plastic on the interior. I do, however, really appreciate the “temperature hold” feature, but I could never get it to work consistently. Often, the Hold button would turn off on its own before or immediately after the water boils. I’ve used this kettle every morning for almost a month now, and the Hold feature has worked only 3 times!I use it only to boil water for black tea, so I just press the Boil button, but every now and then the lights go bonkers and bounce around to all the other temperatures. It’s like flashing Christmas lights! And when I try to press the Boil button, the kettle just continues jumping the lights to the other settings.Other times, the kettle doesn’t even reach a boil before it shuts off. One time, I pressed Power + the Black Tea (Boiling Water) button, and then the kettle just shut off on its own after 1-2 seconds!I give up. I’m just going to refund this and get a simple stovetop kettle."
"I got this in part because my prior pot failed to beep when it reached temp and failed to stay at that temp.  It was workable but annoying.  So I looked at the reviews and prices and got this one.  I actually sent the first one back because I could not get it to beep no matter what I did.  There are directions in the manual to shut the beep off but nothing I did could get that beep to work.But this one does beep but it's supposed to beep 3 times when it reaches temp and it only beeps once and it is barely loud enough.  You have to be right near it to hear it.  Way quieter than my last one when it worked right.So I seriously considered sending this one back as well and getting one from a different company.  But I guess I'll make do with this.It does keep the temperature and reaches that temp quickly.  So 2 out of 3 ain't bad.By the way, I emailed the company on the first one's problem and they responded very quickly and tried to be helpful.  That was nice."
"After 8 months of use those stains showed up, leaving residues in the water every time we use. We never used anything besides water on it."
"I cannot imagine that anyone is standing there and waiting for the kettle to come to a boil, so of course, you will probably step away and do other things while this is brought to a boil. But you have no way of knowing if it's done when you return. If it had some sort of light that lit up that said ""Ready"", this kettle would be perfect but this is a main feature that is missing from this particular kettle.Also, when I posted my questions, someone responded that the HOLD button will blink and then goes solid when it's ready, and I tried that and it's not true. That does not work. So again, no way of knowing when it's the temperature you need it to be."
"Update: The seam between the bottom and walls of the kettle leaked boiling water drops out on me. Instead of get it fixed, I gave it away. Bad manufacturing.--I really like this product. Beautiful and  beautiful ends swim, just perfect. Except for Webb. When you go to takeoff the lid, it’s got a pretty good catch on it so you have to go and get very hard would usually results in the lid, flying somewhere, burning your hand and/or exploding water all over the place.It’s just like a design thing. If the lid wasn’t so difficult to pull off, I wouldn’t burn my hand and get water everywhere and that’s the only reason I’m giving four stars. It really is a nice product, if not, for the annoyance of not being able to open it without a mess."
"Update 2022 -I have a new phone and wanted the same shortcut button on my old phone’s Home Screen that starts my kettle with a single press. There’s no way to add that shortcut. I can’t transfer it from the old phone to the new one either. Since the shortcuts are the main reason I picked this one over the one my roommate got (which cost less than this), I’m lowering my rating. Otherwise, the kettle itself works fine.Original review-Before this teapot I used to boil water, and then have the tea sit for X amount of time to try and get it to cool down enough for it to be drinkable... however, that took forever so what would happen is I'd forget about the tea and never drink it. Cups of tea all over the house. But now I can start the boil without having to go downstairs and then back up to wait for it, and it's always the exact temperature I need it to be. The beeps are loud enough without being piercing or obnoxious. It's awesome. I know it's a gooseneck for coffee, but I just think it's so cute too and that's a big deal for me. Function first, but form absolutely as well. The app is easy to use and there's an option to put a shortcut on my screen for whatever items I want so now I have a shortcut called Mrs. Potts <3"
"Started leaking after about 6 months (right where the seam is between the bottom and top parts of the kettle). Every time it’s used, we end up with a small pool of water sitting on the base, which seems like an electrical hazard."
"I liked this kettle with only a few small annoyances for 8 months until it died.I used it between one and three times a day on average so it wasn't in tremendously heavy load, and always on a saftey power strip, but one day while cycling up to heat, the electronics stopped working. The heating element still works, but the buttons don't respond and it occasionally will beep at me, nothing more.Edit: it started working again like nothing happened a half day later."
"I like the size and weight of this tea pot, plus it looks nice on my counter, but It automatically shuts off when you lift it up to pour your water. Then, you have to turn it on again and choose the stay warm button, but that doesn't last long at all. The teapot shuts off after 2 min or less."
The electronics continue to work fine ..though the warning buzzer setting still turns itself off periodically...resetting per instructions work.The powder coating on the lid is failing/chipping.otherwise has worked well !! thx...
"Works great, looks great, no complaints other than the fact it has a hideous safety sticker on the lid. I of course peeled that sticker off like anyone with a sense of aesthetics would, leaving behind a gunky residue. Tried very hard to get it off with a soft dish sponge, soap, warm water etc and it wouldn't budge. Was forced to use some acetone and it started coming off, so I rinsed the acetone off, then started scraping with my fingernail to get the last bit off. My fingernail suddenly scraped the thin layer of paint off, leaving an equally hideous scratch in the paint where you can see the stainless steel through. Would still recommend this product otherwise, but beware you'll have to put up with an ugly sticker or risk damaging the paint of your kettle."
"The Cosori Gooseneck Kettle I received was USED. It had numerous water spots and finger smudges on all three pieces. Plus, it had mineral deposits (or rust) in the inside bottom edges of the pot. It had a foul mineral (rust-like) odor. For kicks & giggles, I heated some water in it, and even the water smelled bad. How in the world can this kettle be rated so highly? Buyer beware! Mine is being returned."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I initially purchased the Cosori Electric Tea Kettle with high expectations, based on its sleek design and positive reviews. Unfortunately, my experience has been quite disappointing. After just over a year of regular use, the kettle began leaking water from under the spout, rendering it essentially useless.The leak seems to have developed from a structural issue, which is highly concerning for a product that is meant to handle boiling water. Not only does this compromise the functionality of the kettle, but it also raises safety concerns. I expected much better durability and quality from a brand like Cosori, especially considering the price point.Given that this issue occurred shortly after the warranty period ended, I am left with a faulty product and no recourse. For a device that is supposed to be a staple in the kitchen, lasting just over a year is simply unacceptable. I am disappointed with the lack of longevity and reliability, and I will be reconsidering my choice of brand for future purchases."
"I purchased this kettle hoping for a reliable and efficient product, but unfortunately, it has proven to be a safety hazard. The kettle continues to heat even after the desired temperature is reached, and there is no way to turn it off manually or adjust the settings once it's started. The only way to stop it from overheating is by physically unplugging it, which is extremely inconvenient and concerning from a safety standpoint. This issue makes it unsuitable for regular use, as there is a real risk of overheating or potential fire hazards. I would not recommend this product due to these serious concerns."
"The hold temp feature needs some work. The way it works is you tell it to hold temp, and then when it comes to temperature it beeps and then holds the temperature until you turn it off. In theory, this is great because then you can go take care of something else real quick while it's coming to temp. The problem is that there is no visual indication that the water is at temp, so if you weren't around for the beep (or were listening to podcasts on your headphones), you don't know it's at temp. You have to turn off the hold temp to see if it's ready or still coming to temp.The beeper went out on mine recently (<1 yr old), which means that there is literally no indication whatsoever any more that the water is at temp. This is tough for regular come up to temp-it just turns off so you have to watch it like a hawk because if you don't catch it turning off, you won't know how long it's been since it got to temp. It may have fallen too far. When using the hold temp feature, you have to turn the hold temp off to see if it's gotten to temperature yet, then remember to turn it back on if it's still heating.Otherwise I've been very happy with it. The gooseneck works great for pour-over coffee, the temperature selections cover all the brewed beverages I drink, and the water comes to temperature faster than it would on the gas stove."
"Mixed feelings: Every part of this (the kettle interior, the lid, and the base) rusted within 2 weeks of receiving the kettle. Also, I exchanged it for a replacement but the lid on the replacement is too small and falls off when you tip the kettle to pour water. So, automatically there are some big issues. You can see the rust in the photos, this is only 2 weeks into using the kettle AND these are taken *after* I cleaned as much rust off as I could. But, the one perk that is going to keep me using this kettle is that there is NO plastic anywhere– no plastic seal, no plastic hinge– no plastic at all. You'll just have to be super diligent about preventing rust.One other random thing– I do miss having a physical button to press. These buttons are like using a touch screen, and sometimes they don't register you touching them. Usually if there is a little drop of water touching a button, this is the biggest culprit of making the buttons inactive.*Also, you can turn OFF the sound. It makes a little beep when the water comes to temp. You can turn off the sound but pressing and holding the :hold temp"" button– there are instructions in the manual."
"We have now had two of these go bad. First due to leaking neck, now second due to the base on longer tuning on. Nice kettle when it works, just want them to last longer than a year..."
"It’s okay, boils water. those buttons are so hard to click, they work 50% of the time, why would you do “touch” buttons on a kettle, i just want my water hot, i have an iphone for touch experience. Wouldn’t buy again"
It heats up pretty quickly. The buttons work well.The app functions as advertised but in reality it isn’t that useful. Yes it can give you real time temp readings but it would be nice if there was a display on the unit that showed you real time temps so you didn’t have to open the app.  You can customize the exact temperature you want in the app but 95% of the people don’t need to do that considering the most common temps are an option on the unit.There is a temperature gradient in the water. The surface temperature is roughly 5 degrees cooler than the bottom. (Not a defect but just the nature of any kettle that has a heat source on the bottom). So the variability within the pot makes the ability to set a specific temperature mute.My biggest gripe is that it started leaking where the spout connect to the base after 3 months of use.  For that reason I just ordered an Oxo kettle that has a temp display on it. All in all my kettle experience is costing me $170 ($65 for this kettle and $105 for the Oxo replacement))If I would have just got a Fellow pot initially ($170) I would have paid the same amount and wouldn’t have to deal the aggravation.  I guess that’s what you get for going the cheap route.
"I liked this kettle at first bc of the price, look and fast boil HOWEVER (and shame on me for not contacting the manufacturer/leaving cautionary review sooner) there are a few MAJOR SHORTCOMINGS (product malfunctions) to this affordable kettle: 1) IT TURNS ITSELF ON EVEN WHEN EMPTY, 2) The Hold Temp feature also seems to toggle itself on unprompted, and 3) It has a relatively low max capacity for an electric kettle (boils only 3 cups at a time).The goose neck and fast boil features are nice, but you get what you pay for. I wish I had paid more for a product from a more established manufacturer. Thought I would follow the positive reviews here and support an up and coming brand, but alas.. you get what you pay for. Luckily this product hasn’t started any fires in my home but I wonder if it has for others.If you decide to go for it and buy this, UNPLUG IT WHEN NOT IN USE and/or MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FIRE EXTINGUISHER ON HAND. Shame on this company for not issuing a recall. 😡😤"
"My biggest beef with this device is that the app absolutely stinks.  It regularly removes the kettle from my list of devices (it's the only device), and then I have to re-pair it, adjust the settings, etc.  Have re-installed the app, etc, doing the normal things to troubleshoot it.  Even tried putting the settings where I wanted and then uninstalled the app, and even then the unit reset them after a week or so.  In addition, there are rust spots on the stainless steel lid.  Would recommend that you try a different brand and if you want this one, get the basic model without the malfunctioning app."
"Had for a few months, had regular cleaning. Developed this mold/mildew residue at the bottom that won’t scrub off. Disappointing because it worked well other than that!"
Product worked great for about the first 6 months then started erroring out in the middle of heating up water. Now a couple months after the warranty window closed it won't work at all.  Just keeps erroring within 30 seconds of being on and won't heat. Gave it 2 stars because of the lack of  longevity and amount of issues. Really wish it would have lasted longer and worked better.
"I'm not a tea fanatic, but it's nice knowing that the water is the proper temperature for the type of tea. The pot heats rapidly, and the option to maintain temperature is a good feature to have when it's needed. It has a great looking design. Holds about 2 normal size servings, so it is smaller than many other electric kettles.My only complaint is the slow leak at the seam that runs around the pot. It's slow enough that water isnt apparent, but the ugly, cooked-on minerals quickly become obvious against the black paint. It does occur more slowly with filtered water, but still occurs. It's not along the entire seam and others don't seem to have the same issue, so I may have simply received a defective one."
"Small footprint with preset heat water settings. Sounds perfect! Unfortunately it was defective! No beep alerts, the preset lights would go out, it’d just shut off. Hold Temp didn’t hold, turned itself off after 10 seconds. I took the coffee setting temperature with a Thermapen, it did not reach 205 degrees for coffee at all. It’s disappointing, such a good looking water boiler, too many defects, had to return."
"As I wrote in the headline -- this kettle heats quickly to a variety of temperatures, and the 'hold' feature is handy (keeping the water at the right temperature instead of automatically shutting off and cooling) however, the black coating on the outside of the kettle started peeling soon after we started using it, so it quickly came to look awful."
"I’ve used this daily for several months now to make pour over coffee. First issue is it’s small. Description says .8 liters. It’s probably closer to .7. I have a six cup Chemex and this only fills about 2/3.  This kettle is really only sufficient for one (16 oz) cup single use application. Second, the beep notification stopped working after a few months. Third, once it barely reaches a boil, the “hold” temp is much cooler. I am constantly turning it on and off to get boiling water. Fourth, the lid comes very loose fitting. So loose that it will fall out when pouring. I had to take a screwdriver and bend the lid to make it fit tighter. Fifth, while it is certainly faster than a stovetop kettle, it is still slow (about 5-6 minutes to boil). I understand this is not a $200 model kettle, but for the $70 I spent, I expected more. I’m now in the market for something else."
"The coffee and oolong buttons failed almost immediately (don't respond to touch or light up), which were the 2 buttons I used the most.  Can still pick  coffee brew through the app, but that seems to forget I have a kettle and I have to re-add it which is inconvenient.  Doesn't forget to show me adds for other stuff though.  All in all a disappointing product, because I like the way it looked at it was easy to use when it worked.Being out of the return window Amazon has sent me to manufacturer.  After researching issue, they have sent me a replacement product, within 2 weeks.  It was the standard kettle instead of the Bluetooth one, but they didn't request that I send anything back."
I loved this product until the bleu tooth stopped working - It has been only 6 months and I can't conenct to blue tooth anymore - and I cannot find any info on how to get in contact with the seller or manufacturer
"The temperature does not go up high enough to brew hot tea or coffee. If you like LUKEWARM tea or coffee, this kettle is for you."
"the tea kettle itself is great, but the app is lacking. I have the notifications turned ""on"" on my iPhone, but never receive notifications.  I’m curious if this is a bug, but why are there no notifications on my phone that the water is ready? The tea kettle beeps, but if I am out of the room, I would expect that the phone would notify me?  Just being able to turn the unit on from another room doesn’t have very much value.  I have to stay in the room to know that it is ready or have the app opened and watch the temp on the app.  Not very handy. Maybe it's just a but, but it's not worth the extra for blue tooth if all I can do is turn it on from another room or adjust settings"
"New to tea drinking and have been using a kettle.I bought this because I thought it might make a difference because of the different hot water temperatures suggested by tea companies. Well...it turns out that the water temperature never heats to the proper temperature. It was always 5-10 off. I used a thermometer to measure the temperatures. And it never got above 202.So I decided to just use my tea kettle and allow the water to cool to proper temperature if need be.It does heat up faster than the kettle but if you're buying strictly for temperature control, I'd buy a liquid thermometer to test and make sure you are getting your money's worth."
"Update August 2024:3 years later and my Cosori Kettle is turning itself on at random times.  It is freaky.  For several months 3 of the buttons did not work and I had to use the app to select the desired temperature. Then suddenly all the buttons work. (shrug)  I think there are firmware issues.  The Bluetooth connect is much better lately compared to when I started using the kettle ~3 years ago, which helps with the convenience. It heats water nicely and it conveniently fast.Update June 2022: this product has recently been operating erratically by turning on by itself after adding water and then not being able to turn it off manually, and also defaulting to a lower temperature setting than desired.Water heating does well but have to deal with ""bluetooth anomaly"" everytime I want to heat water. Have to be in close proximity.  Kinda defeats the purpose.  Becoming less and less of a fan of this kettle the more I use it, and I use it daily."
It does okay but it leaks like a tablespoon of water every time I use it which is nerve racking.If you leave it on after pouring the water out then it starts beeping and won’t turn off unless you unplug it… not sure what that’s about.Just a lot of trouble for something you are buying for convenience but wasn’t into splurging on a kettle. Will look forward to upgrading after this dies.
"We bought this earlier this year and we liked how well it functioned as a kettle for making tea and coffee.  The gooseneck pours well, kettle feels substantial and design is good.However, after about half a year's use, the lid rim started to rust.  I would clean it off and the rust kept returning.  The attached pic showed a spot where no matter how much cleaning was done, the rust was too stubborn to be cleaned off.  Apart from the lid, the rest of the kettle is fine and has no rust.  It is strange that the lid rim which has least contact with water would rust so badly.  Did they skimp on manufacturing uality & control for this part?  It is disappointing that I have to replace the kettle so soon."
"The buttons on this device are rendered non-functional if they come in contact with water. It takes several minutes for them to return to working order after being dried off. Good thing that will probably never be an issue with a device that is intended for heating up... water.When boiling water, the water audibly boils at least 15 seconds before the device registers this and beeps. So if you want the fastest performance possible you have to babysit the device instead of waiting to hear it go off."
"I’ve had it for 2 years and 5 months and used it most mornings. It’s broken. For a while now it’s occasionally flashed all its buttons in some kind of distress, but plugging it in only when using it worked. Now it will only agree to one temperature, and it’s not one of the ones I want.I know things die, but it’s a basic appliance, and it should last at least a decade. I’d avoid the whole brand. I’m going to."
"I would not recommend this! We’ve had it less than a year and all of a sudden it’s shorting out, and turning on all by itself. Almost started a fire because it was empty and turned on by itself! Luckily I heard it and unplugged it. When I plug back in all the lights flash. I paid $70 for this and expected it to last longer than this!!!!!"
"Well it works very well and it is what I wanted,  But it came used… how do I know you ask. When I looked inside the pot, it hard the hard water stains that you would see after a few or many boilings of water.  So please be aware."
For several months it worked exactly as advertised and was very convenient. I liked that with the app I had a lot of options. Then after 6 months or so it started randomly turning on and heating. I have tried resetting it and I even opened up the base to make sure there were no loose contacts. Everything visually appears to be in order but the issue persists. It started randomly heating every few days or so but now it’s pretty much daily. I can’t keep the pot on the base with it randomly turning on so now the entire point of being able to use the app and wireless options are no longer applicable. I’m really frustrated and disappointed.
"So I really love this kettle, but I can only give it three stars as my kettle is leaking... Its a slow leak so it took me a few days to realize the small puddle was really the kettle.  This is why I gave it three stars - as it has only been a few weeks I have had it. Amazon is replacing it as I do love this little kettle. And I would have paid a little more for this kettle if that meant that it will last and have no leaks - as I love it that much.Otherwise I would have given this kettle five stars- its easy to use, and I love the settings, it looks nice on the counter too! I kinda wish it had a timer to turn it on in the morning but it heat so fast that I only notice this with tea, otherwise in the time it takes me to weight the coffee beans and hand grind them it is hot most of the time.  I have just switched to pour over coffee and this was a part of my setup with a Harrio V-60  - My coffee is wonderful and I doubt I can ever return to drip.I will update this review with my replacement Unit and let Ya'll know how it went."
"From what I can tell using a third-party thermostat, this kettle does well to heat water to the temperature the buttons advertise, though I do question some of the labeling for the values. If you know what temperature you're looking for, that doesn't matter, though.My two complaints are the temperature hold function and the smell.I do not know how the hold temperature function works on this thing. So you power it on, press the temp you want, and then press the hold temperature button? No, because it stops holding the temp when it gets to the proper temperature. On another attempt, I let the water get to temp, it turned off, I turn it back on, and then selected the hold temp button but it turned off moments later. So what I do now is get it to the desired temp, let it hero and turn off, I turn it back on and select my temp, and then press the hold temp button. Is that correct? Idk, and the manual doesn't explain it from what I have seen.As for the smell; it always smells like burning plastic when it heats up. I thought this would go away in time, but I've had for almost two months and I use it every day. Not sure how to fix that."
"Was a great kettle for several months, then it started making random and intermittent clicking noises, regardless of water level or temperature setting.Dealing with customer service for a warranty has been a long, drawn out process—via email only—that’s gone well into a second week. Their latest request is evidence of the cord having been severed in order to issue a replacement, which, they say, will take 1-2 weeks in processing. Grateful for that, I suppose, but in the meantime we are out a kettle which we rely on several times a day to prep pet food—a plea for which they offered no response.Just trying to provide a warning for future buyers."
Just brought in July 2024 already broke will not light up to heat .
I used this kettle for a little over year but not very often since I mostly drink coffee.  Then I got Covid a few days ago and have been drinking several cups of tea a day.  On day 4 it stopped working.  And I got rid of my stovetop tea kettle when I bought this so my only other option is a pot on the stove.  I loved the kettle but it didn't last with very limited use.  I just hope the same thing doesn't happen with the Cosori dehydrator that I recently purchased.  I would have returned it if I knew that Cosori products were so unreliable but it's too late now.
"I bought this in Nov. 2019. It didn't last the year. The heating mechanism stopped working within a year (under warranty). They replaced it, which was nice. The replacement started to fail in 2021, probably within a year of when they replaced it, so this thing is good for only about a year before it begins to malfunction.We limped along with it. You can sort of heat the water on temps other than the coffee setting, like the tea (boil). We used green tea and black tea setting, and then we'd use the microwave to heat up the coffee afterwards if it wasn't hot enough.Also, the print on the buttons wears off pretty fast.We continued to use it until 2/16/23, using the tea for heating water for coffee, so *sometimes* a bit hot for coffee, but usually not (microwave). Then on 2/16/23, the spout just dropped off. Just fell, unprovoked. Now in the market again, this must be #6 within 10 years.UPDATEOn 3/24/23, I bought another one because in some ways, I liked this. Again, within a year, at the 10.5 months point, the coffee temp failed. I tried using the higher setting, but it is also not hot enough.I presume I'll get a replacement as it's under warranty, but when that goes, I'll look at other options."
"This product has a weak point at the handle that began to show after about one year of use. The handle began to have some wiggle which is now completely loose with no accessible hardware to tighten. This is now after only three years of use. I still expect products to last longer than they do. I’ll be switching to a stove top kettle after this. Planned obsolescence, will not buy again."
I really want to like this kettle but the lid and spout are coated with a non-stick material. Pretty much all non stick is toxic and I can smell it when I open the kettle. I returned it for this reason.
"REALLY extraordinarily loud. As in I have to wear protective hearing gear, loud. It's as loud as blending up a bunch of frozen fruits and vegetables. And forbid you forget to clean it, the buildup will make it positively scream and pop, as if it being loud while it's perfectly clear wasn't bad enough, now you've practically got a cat being tortured and dying. This thing sounds positively awful, whether it's clean or not. It's just boiling water!Speaking of boiling water, a lot of times it won't beep. I'll hear it boiling, go over, pour my drink, and wait for half an hour more before it finally beeps to let you know that it's boiling. Perhaps it gets confused because I'm at an altitude in the lower 3000s? Definitely something that should be looked into. (Edit: it now never beeps. It's been months and the beeping function has stopped. I know you can turn it on and off manually but even doing that wouldn't turn it back on.)Other than those two fairly major and annoying issues, this works just fine and I appreciate having an electric gooseneck kettle that keeps it's heat; good whether I'm making coffee or tea."
"This thing worked flawlessly for seven months until it didn't. But during that time it functioned perfectly, seemed very solid, heating the water to the exact temperature, very quiet during heating and had polite, not wake the dead, beeps when done. Really liked this thing because I'm a tea aficionado, using high quality greens, blacks and oolongs, so I'm disappointed it is dead. Will have to think long and hard about getting a new one."
"The COSORI is a nice alternative to some of the more pricey goose-neck-style kettles, and the various temperature control settings make it easy to use for multiple brew types (tea vs. coffee).  However, I deducted  one and a half stars for the buggy temperature hold feature, which I found more often than not, just shuts off after reaching assigned temperature, rather than maintaining it (advertised to stay heated for 60 minutes).  I have two (2) COSORI kettles and both have this problem, so it's probably safe to say this is a design flaw vice a 1-off issue.  Another half star for the rather modest amount of water that it holds.PROs: - Price Point - Ease of pouring - Fit & FinishCONs: - Malfunctioning Temp Hold feature - Limited water capacity"
"This kettle will heat water. It heats the water to a handful of temperatures. There are two very soft beeps when the water hits the temperature, and no visual indication, so if you walk out of the room, you'll have no idea if it hit temperature when you walk back in. None of the buttons turn the heater off or the power off when it has heated the water either - only way to shut it down is by unplugging it."
"I purchased this electric tea kettle as a treat for myself because I mostly drink herbal tea and I just had a really basic electric tea kettle that only had one setting for 10+ years. I wanted to treat myself to one that had different temperature settings as I had read that could really bring out the flavors of herbal tea. I ordered this electric tea kettle in October and it is now December and the base unit no longer even turns on. The problem began as an intermittent issue and the base eventually just stopped working all together. Unfortunately, I am outside of my return window with Amazon and there's nothing anyone can do, so I got burned (pun intended :)). But this unit is too expensive to only last 2 months and have such an awful return/customer service policy. I went back to my old, trusted electric tea kettle that I've had for 10+ years that hasn't let me down. This was an expensive lesson for me so buyer beware that these kettles are cute and have some neat features, but the quality just isn't there and the company and Amazon doesn't stand behind this product either."
"I bought it August 10th and on October 31st it stopped working. Very disappointing. It seemed well made but the ectronics broke. I hadn't gotten it wet from one day to the next it quit working.Lo compré 10 de agosto y lo paró de funcionar 31 de octubre. ¡Sumamente decepcionante! Parecía bien hecho pero la electrónica se rompió. Yo no me había mojado, de un día para otro dejó de funcionar."
"I recently received this attractive teapot and was very pleased with it, other than the fact that it appears to have a defect in that the ""sound"" it is supposed to make (apparently three beeps) when the proper temperature is reached does not work.  The instruction book describes how to turn it ""off"" (apparently ""on"" is the factory default"" but nothing I try turns on the sound.  Not a show stopper, but it is an annoyance."
I bought this after a thorough product rating review on Amazon and other review sites.  It is my backup one as I was working remotely and took my other pot with me so it’s barely been used.  It’s leaking!  I’ve never had that problem before with a Cosori product.
The kettle works great most of the time and then all of a sudden all the lights on the setting buttons start flashing at the same time and the kettle won't work. It's another microchip issue. If I pull the power chord out of the wall and then plug it back in it will work again. Reboot. I shouldn't have to reboot the kettle. This is why you shouldn't buy this kettle.
"I LOVED this kettle…at first. Now…not so much. It worked perfectly for about 5 months. But it recently started sputtering as I pour over the coffee grounds. It will pour smoothly for a few seconds, then it starts bubbling out, causing splatters. It is very annoying that it is making such a mess. I have checked for obstructions in the spout (by threading a long tie wrap down it) but it seems to be perfectly clear. It’s a shame that this has become such a disappointment. It has wonderful features and seemed so well-made. Signed, Sad Coffee Maker. 😔"
"I loved the ability to have hot water ready when I woke up using the app.  When it worked, it worked great.  But after four months.  The boil-dry protection went off one day, when it was filled with water, and it has never worked again.  There is no reference anywhere to reset the boil dry and use the kettle again."
"Loved this kettle until it stopped working at 13 months. this has happened to us twice with the Cosori kettle. Now we're moving onto something that hopefully lasts a little longer...On the plus side it was a GREAT kettle until it simply stopped. This meaning the electrical panel stopped working. You push a button and nothing happens. For awhile we simply unplugged it then replugged it to get it going, but then this stopped working too. Pity!"
"This kettle functions just fine as that.  No issues with the kettle itself.  But the ""smart"" aspect was misleading. While they did not outright specify that this kettle functions with Smart Home platforms like Google Home and Alexa, it implies it ever so slightly.  But this is not a Smart Kettle, but rather a Bluetooth enabled one.  This means you can't integrate it with you other smart home devices and speakers, and your phone has to be in BT range in order to remote start it.  Very disappointed in this purchase overall, but I am giving 3-stars because it is a functional kettle."
"I have had this pot for a little over a year. I liked it initially, but realized very quickly that if you wanted to make a big pot of tea, like an 8 cup Brown Betty, this will not do. Additionally, after multiple fills, the lid became loose, and if I did not hold the lid on, when I went to pour the kettle and empty it, the lid fell out. Also, this is now November, I bought this in July of 21, the hold temperature button no longer works.  Buying a new kettle today, but it will not be this one."
"I like some of the features such as choices in heat level based on the beverage. Green tea heated at a certain temperature, versus black tea.  I like the keep warm feature.  What I don’t like about it is how little it holds, and the narrow spout. It looks nice but not practical.  Also, it does have a higher heating noise level than my previous kettle.  It is not that quiet.  I would choose a different kettle next time."
"Pouring spout is ok if a little fast. Temperature controls are marked with likely use and it's not possible to set custom temperatures, nor is there a readout display, so you are taking the manufacturer's word that the temps are accurate.Used it once. The following morning, looked forward to brewing coffee for myself and my mate, but the low-water cutoff prevented it from working, despite that there was ample water and it'd never been run to where the water level was low. I think the little sensor inside the pot, which sticks up from the bottom, must be bad.Took it apart and tried jumping that connection to no avail. Cleaning the contacts didn't help either. Problem's either in the sensor or the IC board. Gave up and ordered a different pot, and EKG copy called Poliviar, which allows custom setting of temps and has a display. Downside is they were out of the black version and the other colors are not exactly mainstream.I did appreciate the design and appeareance of the Cosori for the short time that I had it, for whatever that's worth. Lots of folks here liked it, which led me to order it in the first place, but... in the end I opted for another solution.This was to replace an Oxo kettle that stopped working after some years. That kettle was the cat's meow: poured beautifully (best I'd ever used) and heated very quickly. Unfortunately supply-chain issues mean that it's not currently (05.30.22) available. Otherwise I'd buy that one again in a heartbeat.Cheers, Netizen"
"I recently purchased this kettle, and I am thoroughly disappointed and concerned for my health. After some research and testing, I discovered that this kettle contains hazardous chemicals, including chromium and lead. These toxic substances are extremely dangerous and pose severe health risks.The fact that such harmful materials are used in a product meant for boiling water is unacceptable. It shows a complete disregard for consumer safety and health standards. I strongly advise against buying this kettle if you care about your well-being and that of your family.The manufacturer should be held accountable for this negligence and remove this product from the market immediately. Do yourself a favor and avoid this kettle at all costs."
"Used it a few times and found that it started rusting underneath the lid. Around the holes that steam comes out, rust started forming. I tried using vinegar, baking soda, etc but it's no good. It's a shame you can't order another lid."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Within three months of purchasing this item, I noticed that it had started to turn on by itself. Even when there’s no water which means that the safety feature preventing dry burn is not functioning among other things, I tried reaching out to Cosori regarding the warranty, I called and emailed multiple times no answer or reply."
Why would you make a kettle that doesn't work if a single droplet is on any of the buttons?
"I was so happy with this kettle for a week then suddenly the buttons just wouldn't respond, I unplugged it and plugged it back in, it worked for two days, then the problem came back and brought with it the Bluetooth app no longer functioning. Unplugged it, reset the connection. Next time it was a drop of water on the buttons, making them unresponsive...are you serious? This thing isn't water proof?! It stopped working, I dried it, unplugged it, plugged it back in, reset the Bluetooth and begged it for hot water to be held at 205 for coffee please, but the hold function would no longer work.That's it, if you withhold coffee from me more than three times, you're going back."
I wish it was bigger. Heats quickly.
3 of the buttons stopped working after only a couple of months. I never got water on them or anything. Don't spend the money on this!
"It boils fast, and has decent temperature control, but is absolutely ruined by a 'form over function' design:1. The capacitive touch buttons are not only unnecessary, but terribly unreliable. If even a tiny drop of water gets on any of the buttons (and, I mean, it's a water boiler- How are you going to avoid that?), the machine entirely refuses to turn on or function, and the buttons do not respond at all. I've had to unplug and replug this thing more times than I can remember, and I've only had it a few weeks. A clear example of the awful modern trend of ""putting touch controls where they don't belong"".2. The capacity is small. This might not be a big deal for most people, but I get 2-3 cups of tea out of this before needing to refill it.3. The narrow spout pours slowly, and the lid is quite loose on top, leading to once where the lid fell off and boiling water spilled everywhere. I had to bend the little metal pins on the lid to keep it on tighter.There are far better electric kettles out there. I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Just get it. I'm a coffee snob. i drink a lot of herbal tea. it's perfect in all aspects. I love it. Get it. You'll love it too.****UPDATE**** 1 MONTH LATER: The handle became loose and wobbly and is almost falling off. There is no way to tighten it that I can see. I would stay away from this kettle if you're considering it. In time, the handle will loosen.UPDATE 2: Customer service was really quick in getting back to me via email and has sent me a replacement kettle. I've updated my review to 3 stars to reflect the great customer service, and will provide another update if the replacement has a sturdier handle design.UPDATE 3: Several months later, and this one is holding up MUCH better, no play at all in the handle. The beeping stopped working, but I think that's likely my messy roommate splashing water on it when he does the dishes."
"We may have gotten a defective item, but after one use it began shooting hot water out of the spout when it was turned on. It shot out enough water that we needed to put a bowl under the spout to catch it all. It also appears the kettle is heating whenever it is plugged in, even when it is fully turned off. This is obviously a big issue since at best it's not great for the kettle to be hot when there is no water in it, and at worst it is a fire hazard. We have a little coffee & tea area and normally would leave this plugged into a dedicated outlet so that it is convenient to use, but it defeats the purpose if we have to unplug the machine whenever it is not in use. This was replacing a cheap-o electric kettle that always worked fine, so it's disappointing that this one is so dangerously defective, especially when we bought it because it had good reviews and seemed like it would last.The good news is Amazon did issue a return and refund for the item, even though we'd already opened and used it. It might be that this was a one-off issue, but it doesn't inspire confidence."
"I bought this kettle for my dad for Father's Day. I was showing him how to use it (very easy to use and I'm hoping he can figure it out himself-he's old), when I was pouring the boiling water into his cup, the water leaked from the top and burnt my hand. I think there should be a safety feature to prevent this, I can't be the only one this happened to. I sent an e-mail to the company and hopefully will hear back. Thank god my daughter wasn't standing under me or she would have gotten burnt.Please be careful if you purchase this!"
"This was a great kettle for getting hot water for tea or other drinks but I started having issues with it blinking and not letting me use it. This last time it wouldn’t go away and let me use it even after unplugging. I bought a new one but am not too happy about that since I only had the previous for 2 years. Will see if this new one lasts longer than that, if it doesn’t I’ll be moving on to something else."
"I had water leaking from somewhere.  If I poured something, water would pour out of an unknown location on the kettle every time the kettle went in an upright position.  I also kept finding a puddle of water on the base, every time I lifted the kettle up.  It had to be returned.  Other than that, I liked the way the water poured out of the kettle--effortless (not the water from the leak!).  I did not like having to push the power button and then the temperature button every time I wanted hot water.  I should be able to push the temperature button only.  The holding temperature button was useless.  It doesn't last long enough to be useable for me.  I would like to see it keep my water warm for 1-2 hours after the initial heating. I cannot drink a cup of tea in 20 minutes.  Sorry, that makes the temperature hold useless to me.  I will be getting a kettle with a similar design, but better features for me.  I do not recommend this kettle or brand."
"Temperature control is excellent- and works well.  Easy to use and very pretty as I said.  Why the modest rating?  Beep to tell you it has reached desired temp is very very low.  And now so low- it can't be heard.  In other words, stopped beeping at all after less than a month.  Other more pressing factor is that is does not hold much water.  I drink a lot of coffee and I live alone.  It doesn't make enough for me.  I can't see how it would ever make enough for more than one- so thus you will use it to make you initial pour over or french press but will have to add more water to it have enough for at least a decent size thermal pitcher.  And if you are planning to use any heated water to 'warm' up the devices- you most certainly will not have enough.  I have not had any of the scaling problems with it that others have noted.  But I always use fully filtered water."
"I am not asking for a replacement or refund because in the end, what happened is ultimately my own fault. I needed the counter space where I usually keep my kettle so I had temporarily moved it and an empty cardboard box ended up placed on it. The empty cardboard box was enough to damage the spout (it wasn't even a large or heavy box) and now it leaks! The spout must not have been very well attached in the beginning to result in this kind of damage from an empty cardboard box, which is why I am giving it 2 stars - it's very weak / delicate where it attaches and I was not expecting it to be so poorly made. But it was ultimately my fault for placing the cardboard box on top of the kettle when I wasn't paying attention - I obviously should have put the box someplace else. But lesson learned - I don't think I am interested in a gooseneck electric kettle again! If you have one/want one, just be very careful with the spout. If a cardboard box did this, accidentally banging it might do something similar or even worse!"
"Purchased this kettle thinking it was actually stainless steel, it is not. In fact, the chrome plating comes off inside the kettle and contaminates your water with metallic chrome plating. This is of course due to cheap manufacturing. Spend money on a better one, this one is better off in the trash bin."
"After receiving a new kettle, the product now works as advertised"
"I love the functionality of this device. The different temperature choices and the ability to ""hold"" it at a certain temperature are awesome.However, one of the most important reasons you would be considering a gooseneck kettle is for the ability to have fine control over the speed of pouring. You want to be able to pour very slowly for pour over coffee or more quickly for other applications. This function is where this kettle falls way short. Something about the design makes it extremely difficult to control the pour speed. And it will constantly ""blurt"" out spurts of water out of nowhere when you're pouring very slowly. For me, this tends to create a huge mess. I get water al over the place from these spurts and, even worse, it splashes coffee grounds all over my counter from the pour over cone.I really want to love this thing. There is so much to love about it. But I just don't know why the actual spout function does not work better. It's really a shame."
"I bought two of these, one for myself and one for a friend. It worked great for both of us for about 7 months before developing issues. after that mine developed a flaw where the lid would open part way through the heating cycle and wouldn't shut off. shorth after that, my friends stopped shutting off all together when it reached a boil. Mine developed the same issue shortly after. It still runs and heats water but now lacks the auto shut off safety feature."
"I personally wouldn’t purchase it again. After 1 month of having it started to form this residue, I tried to wash it of but it does not come off that simple. I have to add certain stuff to make it go away and then it’s back after 2 days. Particles started to come off now and I have to throw it away."
I really loved this kettle but overtime the bottom started to get a green rusty look to it. I think that’s a common issue with kettles. It heats water fast & the color that lights up is nice. Great kettle for its cost!
The concept of this product is good a cup of hot water quickly was exactly what I needed however the  Water Kettle leaks water . I need another Water Kettle .  I purchase this product through  Amazon
I like the blue lights but unfortunately they do not make the water boil faster.  I was very disappointed in the speed as it took over 6 minutes to come to a full boil when filled to Max.
"EDIT: 5/1/22 to “2 Stars” and an update to my review.  After posting my review  I finally received communication from the seller offering a refund or replacement. I replied either was fine and the refund appeared in my account the next day. Greatly appreciate it.I fully realize much of the merchandise on Amazon is “mass-produced” - it’s not Etsy - and you take on a bit of personal risk when you purchase a product this way; there will be flaws, there will be errors. I get that. But Amazon is meant to be easy and convenient and with all the things any one person has going on in their life, the real value in Amazon is diminished when you are unable to reach a seller within a reasonable amount of time for resolution. That’s all I take issue with.  Thanks for reading.I purchased my first kettle for my disabled dad this last Christmas. He loved it! And I loved it so much I purchased one for myself!While enjoying a cup of tea with my dad one day, he informed me his kettle was leaking. I looked at it, unplugged it, inspected it. There was water present around the kettle and on the pedestal but I found nothing obvious or remarkable so I told him I didn’t think it was a leak.Again, during another visit & cup of tea with my dad, he repeated his complaint, “the kettle has a leak”. Again, I looked at it, unplugged it, inspected it. There was quite a bit more water present around the kettle and on the pedestal but again, I found nothing obvious or remarkable. I concluded, surely, my dad was simply a little aggressive when placing the kettle back on its electric pedestal, and as a result, clearly, somehow splashing water out of the kettle. But, to make certain his twice-daily tea-time could continue without interruption & refrain from potentially insulting his intelligence, I traded him, taking his kettle and giving him mine. Besides, my use of the kettle is really limited to baking, cooking, or the “occasional” cup of tea.His kettle sat on my counter, empty, for several weeks until I filled it one evening in preparation for baking the next day.Walking into my kitchen the next morning, I was greeted by a beautiful glistening from the sun through my kitchen window as it hit the counter, where I prepped for my great grandmothers poticia & kolocky the night before, bringing a warm smile to my face. Then, startled, I realized the glistening was the sheen from a thin veil of water over my counter, and the kettle sat, innocently, with only a quarter of the amount of water remaining inside.Recipes from my great grandmother destroyed, the paper and cardboard packaging of ingredients soaked & contents spoiled.I’ll get over the pain from losing the flour, sugar, and nearly $40 in ingredients but, losing my great grandmother‘s recipes will take time; if ever.I’m fully aware that anyone reading this isn’t really going to care. And, I could easily just pick one star and a brief statement about the leak however, the Seller Information for 123 Peach Street states: (123 Peach Street) is committed to providing each customer with the highest standard of customer service.” And, “Being a part of Peach Street is about sharing, welcoming others, and spreading a smile. we hope you feel welcome in the neighborhood.”I spent nearly 2 hours searching the Amazon app, my Amazon account online, and Internet searches for “123 Peach Street” and attempt to find a very simple resolution. I even consulted with the product technical support bot Amazon offers as some kind of electronic mediator for customers with “troubled” products. All futile. Aside from an address, I have been unable to locate any contact information for 123 Peach Street, as well as any warranty information for the product, making me “feel UNwelcome in the neighborhood.”I’ve never had this much difficulty in replacing or returning an Amazon purchase. I simply wish the product be replaced or refunded. How can it be this difficult?"
"I like that it's transparent. The water gets super hot so I am hoping any bacteria dies a terrible and quick death. There are two downsides to this thing of beauty. One, I can live with: there is so much hot steam coming out of the spout while the pot is boiling that it's not a good idea to keep the pot directly under a shelf. I actually kind of like it that it turns the room a bit steamy and keep a tropical plant next to it but not too close because I figure it likes warm and moist heat.Now, the real bad thing is that sometimes the pot would NOT STOP BOILING. It seems like it happens most of the time when the pot isn't filled to capacity, but sometimes it keeps on boiling even if it's full to start with. It keep going until there's nothing left. I've learned to watch it so I turn it off manually  a little after it starts boling, but you can see how that's a hazard. I have no idea if the thing can burn or have some other issue, but I definitely don't like that I end up with no hot water unless I watch it like a hawk and turn it off before it boils all out.Now you know."
We have loved our kettle for 4 months now especially for the price. We replaced it when our last kettle that lasted a couple of years stopped working. Unfortunately it has already become temperamental. It will only turn blue and heat up when it’s set just right on the heating stand. And it will sometimes shut off mid heating. We do use it several times a day. But I thought it would last longer.
"Really nice and fast, auto shutoff was ideal until it stopped working."
less than a year after buying this it is leaking !!!
It’s a design flaw—please make the lid removable. It’s a bother to have to tilt the whole pitcher 45 degrees while trying to get your kitchen faucet to fit into the 60-degree opening between lid and rim of pitcher.That’s more math and effort than I want to expend on a lousy cup of Lipton.
We were happy with this teapot until the plastic base began to break down in under a year. Not thrilled about that. Hoping it continues to work for some time-because 8 months doesn’t seem reasonable. We’ve had these for decades in the past. Might try a different brand.
"The kettle functions, fast boil etc. I just have a couple of issues; first, the lid doesn't open wide enough for my liking, having a sink with a large spray type head means it is annoying to fill. Second, the level markers on the side are quite faint."
I bought this kettle in August 2024. It’s not even mid-October 2024 and it is BROKEN.The bottom seal is leaking water so now I need to worry about electrocution while using it. 😮‍💨Just glad I noticed it sooner than later.
"This was a wonderful teapot, while it lasted. I used it like an American aka sometimes 3x a day and sometimes I'd go weeks without touching it. It worked for just under 5 months before cracking at the bottom :("
My only issue with this is I'm trying to avoid plastics and you have to pour over a plastic piece to get your boiling water out. A simple redesign to a complete glass carafe would be ideal.
LOVE!!. Was disappointed there was rust in the bottom after water settling.  I guess I need to drain it completely!! SO fast to heat. Skip the horrible microwave!!
"This worked great until I cleaned it (boiled small amount of white vinegar), and now it doesn't shut off when the water boils. I had a Russell Hobbs for 20+ years that I had to get rid of only because the welding of the spout was going bad. Now it seems like I have to replace my electric kettle more and more frequently, and this is the latest example. I have tried several brands, so this one isn't the only offender. My advice? Buy an inexpensive model because it's likely you'll need to replace it in a short amount of time."
"But as a time went on, I had to constantly clean it out with vinegar. The plus side is that it does boil water fast."
I worked great until it didn’t. Woke up this morning it won’t turn on. Bought it this January.
I really liked the electric kettle but it stopped working after only 3 months.
"I am comparing my previous Mueller Electric Kettle to the Peach Street Electric Kettle I recently purchased. There are two things I dislike about the Peach Street Electric Kettle:1. There is constant condensation on the inside of the kettle even when cold.2.  It does not heat the water as hot as the Mueller.The Peach Street does the job, I just prefer the Mueller"
"Sometime lid pops open, risk boiling dry. The power switch is very easy to turn on so any bump and start the pot unexpectantly.When this finally breaks (nothing is made to last anymore) we will find a different design of electric kettle."
"Bought this in December of 2022 and it lasted until the September/October 2023.  When I tried to use it today (10/16), it would not start up.  I had been having problems where I'd have to rotate it once I set it on the base to finally get the blue lights to come on that it was heating, today no matter what I did it would not come on, so I ended up having to put the water in the microwave to heat it up.  :(That said, when it was working it actually was really nice.  I primarily used it for oatmeal and it made the texture so much better than how I used to just dump the water in it and throw it in the microwave.  I had planned to heat 4 cups of water for some instant potatoes tonight when it finally stopped coming on.  Not sure what's wrong, looked at the bottom of the pot and the base and I don't see anything wrong w/ the copper elements there, it just won't turn on anymore no matter how much I fiddle with it or what outlet I plug it into.  Makes me sad.So made it about 9 months, which I guess isn't bad for the price but I was hoping for a little more out of it, not something disposable.  Still gave it 3 stars because like the subject says, it worked good, until it didn't."
I am not sure if my pot was supposed arrive in pieces. The box that it was packaged in was beat up in places.
"After 14 months of operation my Peach Street Electric Kettle auto shut off stopped working.  This required monitoring to ensure the kettle did not boil dry and create a safety hazard.  After several more days of operating the kettle in this ""manual"" mode the kettle ceased working completely.  I made two attempts to contact Peach Street customer service - first on their website and providing my information and secondly via email.  The date of purchase, my order number and the issues were clearly articulated and a request for a response was made on two occasions.  Peach Street did not respond to either inquiry.  In addition to manufacturing a product that does not last and is not safe, the company is unresponsive and uninterested in their customer and apparently their reputation as well."
"It was a great price and it does exactly what it says. I love that it's simple and one-press.However, after a year of very intermittent use (Used maybe 100 times), the top pops open on its own while it's heating up and is only weakly attached when I close it again. This means two things that can be dangerous:1. When the lid is up, the unit will keep heating the water and it gets even hotter.2. When pouring, the lid can pop open and dump boiling water onto your hand.I've had similarly priced kettles last much longer. Very disappointed in the uses I got out of it. Other than this, it's a great kettle!"
"loved this kettle up until 4 weeks, then the base started to look burnt.  I thought that I would be able to clean it off.  I've tried and I can't.  it ruins the lovely look of it - and it does look great, love the blue light when it's on.  I had purchased 3 similar ones prior to this with same thing happening - this however took longer than the others so I thought this company had got it right.  they haven't.  By the way, I test my water yearly, it was tested 2 months ago (I have water purifiers) and water had not got any contaminants. missed return window by this stage"
Works as expected. Looks really nice but it is very loud
"This is a very nice looking kettle that holds a lot of water; unfortunately, it isn't what I expected.  I purchased this for my 90+ year old grandmother to replace a previous one from a different company.  I picked this specifically because it looked almost identical but I've come across two issues with the product that are frustrating.1. The base that it sits on is convex towards the middle.  This means that when the kettle is set down on the base, there is some wobble in it.  While this might not seem like a big deal, it makes my grandmother feel very uncomfortable because she thinks it could tip off the stand if she isn't judicious with how she picks up the kettle.  This is unfortunate because just making the base flat would solve this very simple issue.2. The hinged lid doesn't open as wide as it should to allow easy cleaning.She had already filled the kettle to test the functionality before we identified the issues, so unfortunately, I don't feel comfortable returning this as it is technically now a used product.  The lid hinge isn't the worst angle ever, but the unstable base is worrisome.  Wish there was a way to fix it."
"This is a nice kettle with one major design flaw: the top doesn't always stay closed, thus disabling the auto shut-off when open. This is not just an inconvenience, but a saftey issue. While I otherwise like this product, I would not buy it again for this reason."
"Used one week, no problem. Min water level about take two mins, Max level about five~seven mins.. I bought this because glass more safety than metal and plastic, no chemical contamination."
"It is a good kettle, and we have been using it for a couple of months. But it started leaking huge amounts of water from the top. I noticed that the silicone between the metal and the glass part wore off. It is not safe to use when it's leaking that much within less than 6 months. Not good value for money as there's not much I can do to fix it. Hard to contact seller here too as it takes me to a weird website with badminton products."
"It was nice at the beginning, however after about 4 months it causes electric tripping every time when use it"
"The first one I ordered rocked terribly once the water boiled which I felt was a safety hazzard.  Did return for a replacement.  I only use during colder months so has not been used much. The water boils pretty quicly so that is not an issue, but... It now does not consistently  shut off once water boils. Another safety hazzard as you can not safely leave it. Unfortunately not a very reliable brand"
"I received this product and only used it once and got some sort of buildup that looks like mold.  I’m not saying it is mold, but it looks like mold.  It could be mineral buildup.  I only used it once and this happened.  Nothing in the instructions tells you how to descale this kettle either.It heats very quickly, you just have to watch the buildup every time."
"This electric kettle was wonderful while it lasted. I bought it for an office, and it was used gently and around once a day. It lasted less than a year. While I loved it when it worked, I won't be purchasing it again, as it should have held up much longer than it did. I'll try my luck with a different brand."
"I purchased this as an alternative to a Bear kettle that’s no longer available.I’m not happy with the excessive noise while heating. A signal when ready should suffice.After decanting the hot water, returning the kettle to the base requires exact alignment. Other kettles are designed to assist with aligning the kettle to the base.I attempted to resolve my dissatisfaction, but no response was received."
I bought my kettle end of last year but have only used it several times since I rarely use it in my office. The bottom of the pot started to peel and don’t feel safe accidentally drinking the metal.I really liked its size and heated up my water pretty fast.
"Found it nice when it was working. Big size, fast heating process. I have no idea why it got cracked. Just found it leaking in the mid of boiling. Maybe it was hit during transportation and then with couple of operations appear. Reordered same model again. Will see how it goes."
"Bought this as a replacement for my previous hot water heater. (Cant remember which brand it was)  Unfortunately this one is noticeably heavier and slower to boil than my previous one.  Doesnt live up to its name ""Speed Boil""  Hopefully i will get used to that !"
"The kettle we were sent boils a little slower advertised, but not horribly. The deal breakers for us were the very short power cord (only 29”) and the unhelpful markings on the carafe. Instead of quarter liters  marks (exactly the size of our mugs) like our previous kettle had, this is marked only at .6L (the minimum amount), 1.0L and 1.7L (the maximum). How do I calculate two cups or eight cups with these measurements? Neither the cord length nor the markings were described on the website or visible on the photos.Also, as other reviewers noted, the top doesn't open very far, only to about a 50 degree angle, so it is very hard to get into the carafe to clean or dry it."
"...which will go nicely with the red lights of the fire engines when this thing malfunctions and burns down your house.The problem with mine is that the lid pops open while the water is still boiling, so the water is in danger of boiling away and then I don't even want to know what happens after that. I'm not willing to find out, either.I did reach out to the company with my concerns, and they ghosted me, so zero points for customer service."
"Its pretty and it works well, however, sometimes I have to fight to turn it on. The button won’t stay and its very annoying"
Pretty when boiling BUT does not shut off if you fill it above to 1 L - top opens but does not shut off
"Great kettle until it started leaking.While abroad in the UK I discovered the difference for My tea, between stove top kettles and electric kettles. So I ordered an electric kettle.Worked beautifully the first dozen times I used it. But then I noticed the water around the heating plate. Thinking there is no way I could have spilled water on the outside and it pooled on the plate. So I let it cool down and pour it out. I dried it completely and noticed water streaming from the power switch at the base of the kettle.While inspecting it, I noticed there was significant cracks along the glass ring on the inside right around the handle.I am honestly crushed and upset. I loved having my daily tea using this kettle. Unfortunately I am outside of the return window by a month and have only used it a handful of times. No way to contact the seller or get a refund. I am skeptical about buying another one. I would rather buy one from a local retailer with  the guarantee of some time of warranty."
"I had a different electric kettle, but I saw this one and decided to give it a try. I should have stuck with my original one (I dropped it and it cracked).This one the lid doesn't open all the way so it's hard to clean, the cord isn't that flexible so it makes placing it difficult. All in all it does the job but it isn't as efficient as I hoped it would be. There are much better ones for the same price availabe!"
"The automatic shut off valve stopped working and contacted Peachtree since there is a one year warranty but never heard back. The water boils fast, but when it gets to boiling, it doesn’t stop. It keeps boiling and creates water droplets everywhere!! it’s not safe."
"After my last Capresso died, which they eventually do, I was desperate for a tea kettle. I like glass and being a Peach Street product, I took a chance. It works; I like that I can take it off the base; the lid doesn’t open very wide and I don’t want to force it. But it’s large (larger than the Capresso) and a bit clunky. Not so attractive on my kitchen counter. I’d say it’s a bit industrial looking."
It's a lovely looking appliance in my kitchen and does the job. But it is a little annoying - the lid pops open as the water is boiling and I have to push it down several times for it to stay down otherwise the boil won't complete. The water isn't even filled to the max. It pretty much started happening right away - I was just too lazy to return or exchange it.
"The good: It has a nice design, and it boils water quickly. It's easy to clean, there are instructions in the box for cleaning.The bad: although the description says it's for coffee and tea, it really isn't. All it does is boil water. There's no tea infuser and it will not perk coffee. Although it appears you can just drop tea bags into the boiling water and let them steep.Size: It's a little larger than we (2) need, as the minimum amount of water you can put in to boil at one time is about 24 oz which prevents the ability to steep just one cup of tea.Durability: I can't speak to that as I've just received it. The last electric kettle I purchased only lasted 2 months before the selector switch stop functioning. I hope this one does better."
"If given another chance, I would not order this product. The lid does not fully open, making it difficult to fill to the top. The sediment of the hard water settles at the bottom and needs to be cleaned frequently. Dislike."
Works fine but the plastic is giving out it seems
"Forgive the lack of pictures, but this damn thing almost burned down my house. GFI tripped thank god. Product worked upon arrival. Over next few months seemed to be doing the job, then over the last few wees we began to notice a fishy odor in our kitchen. After looking, cleaning, looking more, cleaning more, wondering if something died in our walls..........we couldn't figure it out. It was intermittent. There one minute, then gone..... So now we go...... ""Oh no, is it electrical?"" Fishy odor happens from electronics breaking down under load and well.........bad news. So we start exploring my outlets..... and then I catch a wiff of Fish on my counter. My nose starts to work like a drug dog in Tijuana, and i sniff everything.....and boom there it is. The odor was coming from the base of the kettle. So I put water in it and started the unit, while remaining right near it. Sure enough the odor began to get worse. 100% from this POS.DO NOT BUY IF YOU VALUE YOUR PROPERTY AND LIFE"
"Boils water fast & the blue lights are cool.  Would be nice if the lid came off for cleaning.  Would also be nice if the heating element was in the base instead of the pot, but I expect that would result in less efficient heat transfer & slower boil.UPDATE 12/11/2024,  Pot started blowing my GFCI's (tested on two different circuits).  7 months old :-(Still works on a non-GFCI circuit."
"I purchased this item after our other water heater died. It went for a few years of daily use.I bought this one because the price was good, looked good and what most impressed me was the claim that it would heat water in 3 minutes.Well it was a good price, looks good but the 3 minute heat time hasn’t panning out. If you have a full pot it takes quite a while to heat up. Which would be OK but disappointing seeing how I bought it because I like the idea of rapid heat. I will probably enjoy the water pot for years to come but may just have to do some laundry while I I’m waiting for hot water.Over all the unit is good just disappointed it doesn’t heat in 3 minutes.Wally"
Attractive looking. Heats quickly. Difficult to Clean.
Water would leak through the spout
Bought back in March of this year and has been working perfectly. This week I noticed that there was a large pool of water on my countertop under the kettle. So after a few tests come to find out it was my kettle leaking all the water from it. Haven’t spoken to the company yet. That’ll be the next move.
"The spout has a stupid design—there is a piece of plastic inside the base of the spout that prohibits a smooth flow of water from the kettle (see first photo). I took these photos outside of my house so you can clearly see what I mean. When you tilt the kettle over to pour out the water, that piece of plastic makes the water spray out EVERYWHERE (see LIVE photos). Water is splashed into your cup but also all over the counter top!Secondly, the button on the handle that opens the lid, is another poor design. It takes several attempts every time just to pop it open. I am afraid that eventually the mechanism will fail and I won’t be able to open the lid at all!How did this design ever make it into production? They need to go back to the drawing board and redesign this kettle, fix the button that opens the lid, make the spout longer and wider, and removing that piece of plastic inside the spout. Why it is even there is baffling to me.Finally, it is NOT a “quick-boil” electric kettle—if you stand there and wait for the water to boil, you will be waiting longer than the claimed time, that’s for sure."
"Bought this kettle to use in my office for a quick cup of tea. After using it the first time, noticed some buildup of minerals where the heating element is the hottest point. Like some of the other reviews pointed out, I’m expecting this to rust like theirs and quickly based on my photos are after the second time using the kettle. I’m using filtered water in these photos, but I did my first use with distilled water to see if I would have the same problem as seen by others. You probably will, The brushed steel (if that) isn’t perfect and minerals will collect, burn and solidify around where it’s closest to the heating element under the plate. Shame because it looks great, works fast, but the speed is going to result in its failure soon. Can’t drink water from a rusting element if you want your kidneys long term."
"At 1 year it appeared that 1/3 heating coils looked copper colored and didn't seem to generate heat.  Another few weeks later it's up to 1/2 looking/acting that way.  I'm still using it, but it's been slowed to bring to boil.  Thought it was a good one, but not happy with the longevity factor."
This kettle was great and even when I bought a new coffee maker I continued using it for its ease and quickness. But it just went out on me after exactly one year of use so do with that what you will. Good until it wasn't basically.
Only down fall about this is that the lid sometimes won't close completely and when warming up the it will stay on for more then 3 mins it'll keep going till I stop it or there's no more water in it.
"My kettle will often not shut off.  What happens is sometimes the lid pops up while the water is at a rapid boil.  When this occurs, the unit will fail to turn off.  I have contacted the company by email to tell them the problem, but they think we are not pressing the lid down properly.  We are certainly pressing the lid down after we add water.This is a genuine worry as I don't know if the unit has the intelligence to turn off if there is no more water in the kettle. The auto shutoff mechanism does not work if the lid pops up during the rapid boil phase."
Glass pot was decent. Had a little dent near the top. The base had pieces of plastic broken off. I just glued them back on since i didn't want to wait for another kettle.
"First off let me begin by saying this was a fantastic product, affordable and flawlessly does what it's intended to do.However, after using this product daily since I purchased it in January, a rust stain appeared internally on the heating element, I was disappointed because I loved this product so much, naturally I have not used it since for health concerns such as tetanus. Also, before the rust burn appeared about 3 days prior I started to notice a strong chemical odor which makes you instantly nauseated. The only thing I can compare it to is burning perfume. Loved the product up until these issues came about."
"i regret to keep it instead of returning, and its heating time is slow than item from walmart. I do not know if Amazon would test and confine products selling on their website."
"It took longer than 3 minutes to boil.Glass gets very hot !For me a little heavy the kettle.But I must say it looks nice, very nice with those blue lights."
Great product. The filter ripped after a couple months of having it. Been trying to reach other to the company to get a new filter to replace the old one
"This pot it's all the check marks for a basic teapot. It does boil the water quickly. However it does not do anything beyond the medium.Fill levels are marked on only one side so that left-handers have to guess at the water line, or carry it awkwardly.The lid does not raise more than about a 40° angle so you have to be careful about filling it or you will spill a lot. The lid is also not waterproof, so when pouring out of it it is easy to spill hot water over the edges of whatever you are pouring it into."
"When we went to pour from it the first time we used it, the handle separated from the pot at the top. My husband was using it at the time and said he loved how fast you had hot water but nearly dropped it when the handle came loose. He didn't want to mess with returning it, so he tied a leather boot lace around the top through the handle to keep it in place and still be able to use it. Just doesn't look so great now. If it wasn't for the handle issue, we would have given it 5 stars."
"I rated it three stars because it does what it says it does. It’s not been so great for me personally, for the following reasons: the top does not come off, it is a flip up top, and it is hard getting my hand in it to clean it thoroughly Inside. If I fill it even half full, it is heavy enough to be cumbersome. It is rather large and takes up more space than I like on the counter. Considering the price, it is a good deal if these other points are not relevant to you."
It heats up water fast. I’ve used it for 2 months so far. The only concern I have is that the water boiler makes a crackle sound when it’s off after heating. It also makes crackle sounds if I fill it with more water after using all the hot water. It raise concerns on whether the one I have is defective or not. I don’t think it should be making any sounds. I’m scared that it’ll break. This is the 3rd water boiler I’ve owned.
Just after my return window passed the kettle started having issues.I purchased this because I like to start the water to boil in the morning while I am getting ready - and the water will be hot to make my tea when I get back to the kitchen.Well it was fine for the first 3.5 weeks - then I would come in the kitchen and the lid would have popped up and needless to say it would continue to boil.  I thought perhaps it was when I had the water level too high - but that does not seem to be the issue.Now I need to wait until I am ready to start breakfast to start the kettle - because about 40% of the time the lid pops open.I have cleaned it to check for dust and other things - I cannot seem to find the fix for this.
"I dropped my tried and true Hamilton Beach (HB)1.7L glass electric kettle.  I decided to try this one as a replacement because I preferred the aesthetic of it to the HB.  Unfortunately, it disappointed.  The water heated much more slowly than the HB.  More importantly, the kettle shook when it reached boiling and emitted a burning smell.  I worry that this kettle a fire hazard.  I have returned it."
"My biggest issue is the kettle lid. It doesn’t lock in place, and the locking mechanism doesn’t reliably hold the lid down. Twice, within the past two weeks, I turned the kettle on and left it to get ready for work. When I came back to the kitchen, the kettle lid was popped open, and the kettle was boiling dry! That’s a big safety hazard.I bought electric kettle because I didn’t want to stand and wait for my stovetop kettle to boil. And I am afraid to leave this kettle on, even filled with maximum allowed water, because it doesn’t shut off when the lid is open. And with the lid has been popping up on its own. it has always been finicky staying closed, but usually after a couple of pushes, it will lock in place. I was going to contact the manufacturer but I did not see a place in my order to do so. I bought this in October 2023. This should not be happening. The instructions state that users should unplug the kettle after each use. It adamantly states it needs to be unplugged. That was a red flag. So I do that; I unplug it. Now I’m afraid to leave it during use! I will be buying a different kettle."
"We love the looks of this pot and the speed at which it boils.  However, our first pot lost the connection between the base and pot after 2-1/2 years, now the second one has a lid that pops open and boils freely (doesn't turn off automatically).  We've had the second one for 2 only months!  We're switching to a different brand this time!"
"I guess you get what you pay for. It works ok to boil water. However, the kettle doesn't sit on the base flat and the base is way too light to feel stable. I'm not sure whether it rises to the level of a safety hazard, but the kettle feels cheaply made and I regret it buying it although I will use for now."
Was impressed initially. 4 mths into it the seam BTW the plastic and glass now leaks when I pour water... sigh... waste of money
"I was initially very pleased with this kettle. It can hold a high volume of water and boils relatively quickly. Plus, who doesn’t like the bright blue light and the clear glass body… And that’s what the good news ends. Within a month of starting to use it about twice daily, I noticed a U-shaped ring starting to appear in the bottom of the kettle. As I kept using the kettle that ring turned into a burnt area where the metal is now actively chipping off and floating in the water. Since I’m not a fan of drinking burnt metal, I absolutely cannot use this kettle. Would have done better spending a little bit more on a kettle that I can use for more than two months… Don’t buy this product. The quality is very low and it won’t last."
"Well priced and does its job. My only issue is that the spout is funny and the water doesn't pour out in a single stream. It sort of spreads out, so I have to be careful if I'm trying to pour it into a smaller opening like a water bottle. Dangerous flaw when working with hot water."
Stopped working after 6 months
Lid is faulty after a few uses. It heats up the water fast though.
It does a good job at boiling water but 3 minutes is definitely not a full pot. I put in 2 cups of water and it still took 4 minutes. 5 minutes to do just half a pot.
Pro:  Boils water in excellent time. Auto shut off. Nice design.Con:  extremely noisy to the point where I think twice before using it!  It is heavier than I expected but manageable.
This has a lot more room to use as a bottle warmer and it's fast. Cleaning it is a bit of a task. They should start sending a brush to clean with the product.
"My last one (chefman) stopped working randomly so I desperately needed a new kettle. I use it everyday so it’s a staple item in our kitchen. I decided to try a new brand and after some usage, I can say it isn’t the best but for the price, it is decent.Cons:1. I can’t fill it using water form my fridge filter since it won’t fit (chefman did) so I have to fill a cup and transfer water in - not a huge deal but it’s an extra step.2. When pouring, water spills from the edge of the closure outside of the mouth. It’s not great but my cups/bottles have a wide enough opening so it’s ok. If you plan to pour into a smaller mouth, it might spill over. I’m not sure if mine is defective but FYI.Pros:1. PriceOther than that, heating speed and product is very similar to my old Chefman."
"Works great and boils quickly.  If you want to boil water it works great. I use it to make black tea.  It buns the tea every time and leave a taste.  I have been using it, but decided to replace it with one that has a temp control.  The auto shut off works after it has a full on rolling boil for 30 seconds.  If you forget to close the lid it will not shut off and boil itself dry.Cleaning is difficult and you will never get the bottom cleaned due to the design."
This electric kettle has worked pretty well for about a year.  Unfortunately the filter is falling apart.  Does anyone know if the filter can be replaced?
"It’s okay, the water is poured a little weird front the product into the cup, it comes out from where the lid is. Maybe the lid isn’t isolated properly"
"After 3 month the lead does not close easily. I have to press it hard, otherwise it opens and cattle keeps running until it’s out of water. Unsafe."
Seal broke after less than one year of non daily use. The seal has peeled and now the kettle leaks. You get what you pay for I suppose.
The kettle works fine until the lidr pops open.  Then it does not off and keeps boiling.It happened occasionally and we thought we needed to close the lid more carefully.  Now it is happening much more frequently.The kettle is just 6 months old.
"I have had this product for approximately 8.5 months. During that time it worked great and I would have given 5 stars... But as of this morning it won't even turn on.Reached out to seller to request warranty replacement, and will advise on how that goes."
Works fine and looks nice. But after one year the shutoff broke and now it steams up the kitchen and is dangerous to operate. Will replace.
Then it quit. We used it two or three times a day for a year and it worked fine until it didn't.
Love the look and the thin spout.  Wish it were faster to heat (microwave is fast for hot water for french press) and had some kind of an audio alert when heating was complete.
"I've owned two of this kettle and both ended up leaking in about a year. This kettle has been otherwise fine - good design without ugly logo, simple and easy use, water boils quickly, and affordable. So I was trying to find ways to deal with the annoying leakage and I think I found how. The leakage seems to happen as soon as the water gets in, and not as a result of boiling. Check the leakage right after pouring water in: pour water into the kettle over the sink, see if it leaks, and if so, let the leak dripple into the sink, then boil the water. I've been testing this hack for about a week and there hasn't been any more leakage after boiling, once the initial leak check was done."
It works fine except it leaks from the bottom.
"We bought this kettle about three years ago and over the years, I’ve noticed that the paint is chipping. The chipping is mostly occurring around the point where the metal lid meets the opening where you refill the water. The paint chips must be going somewhere and I fear it is into the water that we are drinking. I would not buy this again and instead am searching for a stainless steel model without paint."
The bottom leaks and I am always paranoid it’s a fire hazard. Otherwise excellent and visually pleasing kettle. Had it for three years and finally decided to switch to another brand because the leaking is out of control
"It's an electric kettle, there isn't a whole lot to say - it boils water.  I was looking for a gooseneck design because it allows much more precise pouring for coffee or tea, liked the stainless steel, and the price was right so I gave it a shot.  I found it very difficult to locate the wattage in the product info on the listing, which was frustrating since that's kind of the most important spec for an electric kettle I can think of... Only in Amazon's similar product comparisons is the wattage listed where it shows 1500 watts.A few days after ordering, open up the package and sure enough the product sticker and all included literature clearly show 1000 watts.  I tested with a power meter and same result, 1000 watts.  So this product is FALSELY advertising itself as 50% more powerful than it actually is.  Buyer beware.Additional note of caution: because the body is uninsulated stainless steel, it gets extremely hot after a cycle, if you touch the metal cap while trying to remove it, you will burn yourself.  Wait for it to cool down before attempting to take off the cap to clean out or dump the water.At the end of the day, am I pissed I was lied to in the listing? Absolutely.  However, I think I paid around $30 and it still boils water, albeit slowly.  So I'll accept its mediocre performance and try to focus on the fact that it looks great on my countertop.  I'm writing this review to hopefully warn others of the wattage issue since I did not see anyone else mentioning it at all, which is very odd..."
"My Mom has this electric water kettle in black and I was very impressed with it so I decided to get one for my kitchen. I got mine in chrome. It heats up water super quick so no need to use the stove top or microwave to heat up water for my hot chocolate/tea. It's very well designed and looks great on the counter. The only ""criticism"" I have is that the electric cord is kind of thick and stiff, but I suppose that is for safety reasons. There is a MAX line inside the kettle so don't fill water beyond that. If you need more water, just heat up some more. It really doesn't take that long. I read a couple reviews about concerns with the cork details but so far I have not had any issues with it.UPDATED REVIEW - November 20, 2024I have owned this electric kettle for less than a year and already it is broken. VERY, VERY disappointed since I really loved its ease of use. I don't use this kettle a lot since it's mostly for heating up water for hot chocolate in the colder months. Well, I just started using it consistently again and the little pop-up button no longer pops up to stop the water from boiling. I thought it was just a fluke so the next day I used it again and the same thing happened. The water continues to boil since the button does not pop up. Grrr! And to top things off, now the kettle is leaking water from the bottom! (And no, I did not overfill the kettle). This kettle has gone from a great product to a huge disappointment and a potential safety hazard. I am way past the return window so the money I spend on this kettle is now down the drain. I am going to see if I can contact the seller but I am not holding out any hope. I have changed my star rating to 2 Stars. If I can contact the seller and get a satisfactory solution, I will change my star rating. For now I am a VERY upset and disappointed customer!!SECOND UPDATED REVIEW - November 22, 2024I was unable to contact Bodum on my own since there was not a ""Contact Seller"" option on the Amazon product description. I decided to chat with an Amazon Cust Service rep. I explained the problem with the kettle hoping for a replacement. The rep gave me the phone # and website for Bodum to get help with the kettle replacement since it is still under warranty. I called Bodum but no one was answering the phone, so I emailed them a detailed description of the kettle's malfunction. I NEVER heard back from Bodum. Not even an acknowledgement that they received my email.Today, I decided to contact Amazon Cust Service again to see if they could reach out to Bodum on my behalf. The first rep did not offer to do that for me. He transferred me to another dept. The next two reps that I chatted with abruptly left the chat due to ""technical difficulties."" The fourth and last rep I chatted with finally offered to issue me a refund/return. I really just wanted a replacement kettle but that was not an option. The rep sent me an email with the UPS QR code that stated the amount of my refund. Only after I gave the kettle to UPS to send back to Amazon, did I receive another email stating that there would be an $8 restock fee!!!!!! This was not mentioned to me by the Amazon Rep!!! My question is, why am I being charged a restock fee for an item that is clearly damaged and will not be restocked??? It is going into the landfill. I am very disappointed in Amazon for not making this fee clear, and thus reducing my refund amount. I have changed my star review from 5 stars to 1 star. Very disappointed in Bodum, and now Amazon Customer Service for not disclosing the restock fee."
"Nice design but mine started leaking within months of ownership, chucked in the trash."
"After only about a few months, it started leaking when pouring water which is dangerous because it’s hot water. Sometimes it leaks and sometimes it doesn’t leak. I’ve requested a replacement but they want a video and it’s hard to catch when it’s leaking because it’s unpredictable. It’s nice though because it’s all metal and no plastic pieces. I don’t want to be exposed to toxic hot plastic in my water."
"At first we loved this kettle. Unfortunately after about a month it started randomly tripping our breaker. Tested on several different circuits with the same result, so it seems that something inside the kettle is shorting. Since it was past the Amazon return window, I tried reaching out to Bodum directly.As others here warned, Bodum support is flat out nonexistent. After several support ticket and email requests, none of which have been answered, I will have to try going through the BBB to process a replacement or refund.It's too bad because, again, the functionality of the kettle was great while it lasted. But long-term unreliability coupled with no product support means I will be looking elsewhere for the next kettle."
"It works well and heats quickly, but has a leak around the base that has only gotten worse with time."
"The kettle worked well, especially for the price, but has a major design flaw in the handle attachment. Almost immediately, the top two welds failed, then over 6 months the next two failed. A week ago, in spectacular fashion, the last weld popped off and knock my pour over off the cup and coffee everywhere.I've emailed Bodum with no response after a week, so I figured I'd put in the review.Pros- Very easy to use (just turn it on and it stops when water is boiling- InexpensiveCons- Handle weld isn't attached strongly enough- The outside gets incredibly hot- No temperature setting, stops automatically when boilingBased on the poor customer support, I wouldn't buy this again. I'm now looking for some other options while I fall back to my stovetop kettle."
I really liked this however it started to leak after about a year then it started leaking so much it is unusable after only two years.
Not bad. Capacity is a bit small but it performed reliably for three years. I recently noticed it leaking at the spout insertion to the kettle. Never dropped it. Maybe daily heating cycles weakened the interface. Who knows. Still searching for the perfect gooseneck electric. Will try Oxo next.
"I’ve had a Bodum electric kettle for years and loved it, and decided to get a gooseneck kettle for another area of the house. It heats up faster, pours smoother - everything I anticipated from a gooseneck kettle. However, the stainless steel gets *very* hot, and the cork handles often just aren’t enough to grab onto securely. The kettle doesn’t feel as stable pouring and I question how long the handle will hold. The lid would be made 10x better if it adopted the opening of the other Bodum kettles which keeps it attached to the kettle during filling."
"My Keurig from years and years finally died. So, I started to look for options. Found the pour over method, and bought this to go along.I have been holding my review, because spots that form at the bottom of the kettle. I am worried that is mold? I am going to try a method suggested by another reviewer and see if that takes care of the spots.I have not had any leaks yet, but I have no used it that often, as the spots concerned me. They do not look like water spots.At the bottom where it meets the wall, you can see a different color, like it is beginning to rust? I cannot take good pictures to try to amplify and see if it is rust?Many reviews said that it heats up water quickly, to me this is a bit slower than an old machine that held more water. From pushing the lever to auto-shut off takes 4 min and 27 seconds in my unit.It does not hold the heat that long. So, you come back for a second cup, and now the water is not hot. You have to cycle again.It is better than a stove top, because there is no risk that you left the stop on! – that I have done at the start of my pour over experiments.It looks good on your counter.At the end I ended up buying a Keurig in a blue big box place, that have the simplest one for half the price of any other places. Does it talk to me? No, but I can get coffee quickly!"
"This kettle gets going quickly, even when filled to max. There's only the light and a quiet clicking noise to notify, and that's exactly what I want.It does slowly leak water around the seal between the heated base and the insulated carafe. This creates drips on the base that stays plugged in. I don't leave it full of water."
"Beautiful design, takes long time to boil. Very small size - can fit 2.5 glasses of teaIn case you need to fill a regular/small teapot you need to boil it a few times.The surface is made from metal and gets very hot after the first boil there is no way to open the lid without touching the lid's surface and you can get burned. All the surface gets very hot there is no insulation at all.Button line: fits for a single stylish man who prepares one or max two cups of coffee."
"There’s so much to like and a few negatives depending on your usage (potential dealbreakers).  First, it boils water FAST.  At full, it boiled in a little over 3 minutes (see timer photo).  It’s very attractive and easy to handle.  I really like the matte black.  Very simplistic in a good way.  The gooseneck spout makes pouring extremely accurate (I use mine for making coffee in a CHEMEX).  Have not had any of the issues others have complained about, just leave the plastic piece inside in place, it’s not intended to be removed (these people need to read the instructions!).  One concern, depending on your situation is power consumption.  It uses a 1000W of power.  To put that in perspective my microwave uses 1200W.  So if your in an RV or Tiny Home, you’ll obviously need a solid inverter if your off the grid.  And my personal MAJOR gripe and why I gave this 3 stars is the lack of measurement indicators inside the kettle.  This I just don’t understand AT ALL.  There is only one, the Max Fill Line.  Maybe I’m just blind and don’t see it, but I have looked everywhere inside and out and nothing.  But the instructions say it’s there so maybe I got a flawed one.  I guess If you don’t care how much water your boiling it doesn’t matter, but if your someone that is water conscious (like an RV’er) or want to boil exactly 3 cups of water,  this will be a pain.  You’ll need a measuring cup handy at all times.  I’ve since confirmed from other buyers it does not have fill lines.  If you use it in the kitchen for preparing recipes, keep a measuring cup handy.  What a colossal oversight.  Still, even with that flaw, I really like everything else about it and don’t mind the extra step of measuring the water (besides it’s too much of a pain to return it.)."
Sometimes it takes 2 minutes to heat and sometimes it takes 5-8 minutes. It also leaks around the seal towards the bottom.  I never fill above the fill thing so I’m not sure if mine is just defective or something.
"This kettle is beautiful, comfortable to pour, no plastic inside, the cork feels nice and has lasted well.  The plastic base is rather light weight and when placing the kettle upon it, it does feel a bit flimsy.  It's leaked since day one.  I've owned the kettle for over one year and the entire time I thought I could figure out the leaking problem and fix it, but to no avail.  Water leaks out between the body and the bottom.  I've tried filling it to different levels, definitely below the maximum level.  I tried tightening the 3 screws on the bottom.  Today, I unscrewed them to look inside and was very surprised to see water in there around the electrical wires.  There's no gasket in there.  It's very scary looking and no gasket to fix or replace, which is what I was expecting.  I'm throwing this out and probably buying  a Greater Goods kettle, which has no plastic inside, great reviews and is not too expensive.  What a shame."
"This kettle worked fine for two years.  Wasn't overused, always sat in the same place on the counter.  Maybe on average was used to boil a cup's worth of water everyday.  Suddenly it stopped heating past ""Luke Warm"".So i am giving it one star for each year it lasted.  I won't buy it again."
"Good working kettle for the first year, then began to leak constantly. Trying to contact support to see if there’s options for a replacement but no luck so far."
"I purchased this kettle for a vacation property after being so happy with the same kettle I have for home.  After about 6 months of sporadic use, it began to leak from the base when I poured the hot water into a mug/carafe. Not only is this messy, it's dangerous!  I am surprised and disappointed, as the other one I have has been used without problems for almost two years.  Perhaps this one has a defect, but it will make me think twice about buying it again."
I want to love this but it leaks at the bottom.  The leaking seems to be getting worse.
"It gets hot fast, looks nice and pours well but it leaks from the bottom!Started leaking after two months.  I have to tilt the whole pot to the left when I lift it, otherwise it leaks water everywhere. Buyer Beware!"
We’ve had this for 2 years. It looks nice but started leaking after a few months and now the leaking is too bad we have to throw it away and replace it
Lid seems a little flimsy. If you have bigger hands you might find the cork handle a bit small. Otherwise for the price I think it’s worth it. Again gave a 3star rating because of the strong stiff black cord.
"beautifully designed and finished was hoping to save money and resources by not wasting gas every morning heating water for coffee and tea. one problem for me... i want my water really boiling hot and this unit pops to off position on the first boil, when not all the water in it, is actually boiling hot."
"I have had my kettle days short of a year and it looks nice, heats up nice but leaks at the bottom! Disappointing!"
Since it was cheap I may not return it. If I do I will end up buying a pot for my stove. I have had six  electric pots. The two previous pour over pots had thermostatic and timer controls. They did not last long. This pot leaks if you leave the water in it. I will continue to use it and not let water sit in it.
"I love the cork handle and the top. I like the style. I like everything about this, except that when I pour out of it, water often leaks out the bottom at the seam. It's hot water and it makes a mess."
"Love the kettle, it’s the first electric kettle I purchased. Its matte finish with cork accents very sleek. I have never burned my hand. The kettle makes very little noise while boiling and release click is almost unnoticeable. The only issue I’ve experienced, and it’s intermittently, is the leaking. I have a big concern about the leaking because I wear flip flops or open toe shoes all the time, and it dripped on my toes! I have been careful to keep it over the counter now but I shouldn’t have to worry about leaking. I made sure the top is secure and never fill it above marker inside kettle."
"As far as getting water up to temperature it does a pretty good job. After a handful of uses tho, water starts to seep from the base of the kettle. It’s slightly unpleasant having to wipe up seeping water after every use."
This does an adequate job but I wish it included a bell sound when it stops boiling. It’s not a deal breaker for me because I’m in the kitchen when it’s on but it’s a bit of an inconvenience. I also took off a star because it doesn’t really reach boiling point. It gets close but it quickly loses heat too.
"It heats water as it should, and it's quiet. The shape is very awkward, though, and the electrical cord is thick, like for a power tool, and it's hard to tuck away. If I could go back, I would not have gotten it"
Looks good and functions ok (lower powered than some of the other kettles). The major complaint though is the cork top has been flimsy. It kept getting loose after every few months and after a couple of years  the cork wore out and is not fixable making the kettle  pretty much unusable.
"After receiving this kettle, well, maybe my standards are higher than other reviewers. Here are my standards for tools: it does the job well, and doesn't assault me while doing it. This watering can fell short on both of those requirements. I rarely review products, but this so thoroughly disappointed me that I felt compelled to help others avoid this incredible frustration of a kettle.Does it look like a much more expensive kettle, like, the Fellow Stagg? It does a bit! But just because this kettle is matte black, don't let it fool you. It's cheaply painted garbage. When I opened the box, I found weird discolorations in the black paint, and a chip near the lid. Not a good first impression.Then I noticed the spout was completely crooked in relation to the handle. How am I suppose to have pour over control with a kettle that doesn't pour straight? I was able to bend the spout into some kind of alignment with the handle, because yes, the metal is so thin and cheap that it can be bent with gentle force. Also watch the end of that spout, it's sharp metal that looks like it was cut with a hack saw.Then I went to wash it before boiling and attempting a brew. There is a max fill insert inside the kettle that is made of stamped metal with, again, very sharp metal edges. So sharp, it bit into my index finger and had me bleeding everywhere. What a wonderful way to start my day!But my father taught me to ""be a man"" so I stalling the bleeding with pressure and a paper towel. The kettle boiled water in a reasonable amount of time. Since the capacity is small, a fast boil was no problem. I then attempted a pour over with my injured hand. The stream is easy enough to control, but pours about as well as a garden watering can. In fact, I would prefer a garden watering can to this device. They are usually better made.So, this is Bodum's attempt at capitalizing on the trend toward pour over coffee by offering a cheaply made look-alike watering can for the masses. I've used Bodum's french presses for at least ten years, and while not fancy, they get the job done. This doesn't do any job well, and will bite you for looking at it the wrong way. Avoid!"
This item worked wonderfully for a few weeks. Then it just stopped heating.I've since decided to replace it withone from Walmart. A more expensive and different design.
"As some reviewers have noted, the bottom began to leak after only a few uses. The kettle was NOT over-filled. I'm returning this one and awaiting a replacement. It's such a lovely-to-use, high quality kettle that I wish to give it another go as not every buyer has this issue. Fingers crossed ; - )"
"I have used one of these at someone else's house and enjoyed it. When I bought my own, unfortunately it was defective. I reached out to the manufacturer, sent their requested info, and heard nothing back. I've tried to reach out about an update three times now, with no response.  It feels like they are waiting for the return window to run out. There's also no way for me to reach out to Amazon directly for a refund, so I'm stuck with a faulty product and no refund. That's bad UX and baaaaad customer service.I used to love the brand, but this poor customer support has turned me off the brand. I'll buy from somewhere else in the future."
"It looks very nice next to the rest of my coffee supplies. Very sleek. But there are three things I don't like about it.1) the lid is completely removable instead of being a thumb trigger and if you turn the picture far enough the lid completely falls off. It's fallen into my coffee grounds twice.2) it's only 0.8 liters, which I should have known when I bought it but I just assumed most kettles were 1l, so even though it was my own fault, I was still disappointed. It can only hold two cups of coffee.3) despite the fact that it's smaller than my last kettle, it takes about twice as long to heat the water."
"I love the looks of this, my only disappointment is that it dribbles water from the base when you first start to pour. I am suspecting that it’s condensation, but it is annoying. Sometimes the auto shut off seems to be delayed but eventually it turns off after boiling for a minute or two. Most the times it shuts off as soon as it reaches the boil.I am going to return it and ask for an exact replacement, because I love the looks so much."
"Purchased this adorable kettle in April of this year.  Liked the looks of it and size, and appreciate Bodem quality and reputation.  After a couple of months it started leaking when I poured from it.  Site said don't overfill the kettle and that should take care of the issue.  Now it has started leaking at the seam and from the bottom while its heating up.  Bummer.  Reached out to Bodem for product support.  Will see what happens."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Leaking after 8 months.  This product have a 2 year manufacturer warranty so I contacted the manufacturer twice and sent them a video of the product leaking and they acknowledged the email but no response in 5 weeks.  Terrible customer service and apparently they don't want to honor the warranty.
Takes forever to heat up!
would be great overall but a kettle that leaks this much is just bad.
"I got this because it looks like other gooseneck electric kettles. Overall, it doesn't really perform as well as other Bodum products I've gotten. It's thin walled so it looses heat very quickly. It only has one temp (boiling) and the handle is flimsy and bends with a full container. I'd spend a little more and get one with more functions or spend less and get a less pretty one that performs better."
"Probably like many people who bought this I was looking for something without plastic parts. This product is misleading, it's advertised as stainless steel but if you look carefully the interior base is polypropylene but made to look like stainless steel."
Nice kettle if you don't mind waiting all day to boil 27oz of water. Cheaper brands boil do the same thing in half the time.
3 months in and this thing is a mess. Drips water out of the bottom every time you pour. Constantly have to clean up water off of the base and counter.
When using the kettle for coffee in the morning I have noticed more frequently water drip out of the bottom of the kettle. This is unfortunate because up to this point it was a great kettler. The first few times I thought it had spilled down the side but now I have seen it come from a seem in the bottom. So when I make coffee now hot boiling water spills onto my desk and it is very unfortunate. It lasts a few months it would seem before breaking.
"Let's be honest, I suspect most purchased this kettle because it is the least expensive goosneck electric kettle out there.  So with that in mind. . .I did not read the reviews beforehand so did not know about the metal dohickey with the plastic thingy on the top that you see when you look inside the kettle.  Kind of wish it was not there but as other reviewers note, DO NOT remove the plastic thingy.  The top of the kettle is kind of narrow, making it a bit of a challenge to fill from a brita-type pitcher.  The kettle is also smaller than I realized, only boiling about 750-800 ml of water at a time.However, for the price I paid, the kettle works well.  Water boils fast and the goosneck spout allow us wanna be coffee expert/snobs very good control over our pours.  And honestly THAT is the reason for this product.  If you do not need precise pouring for certain coffee preparations, there is no reason to buy a gooseneck kettle, just get a regular kettle and be less cool."
"While I love the look of this kettle, unfortunately, I plan to buy a different one because this one leaks."
"I failed to review the feedback of other buyers - darn it, this water kettle leaks.  I’ve been using it for a month, and it does heat water as described, but it does leak.  As other people reported, mine also leaks a few drops, maybe 5-10 drops or as much as a spoonful, every time I pour hot water from it.  At first I was disbelieving, and I kept checking, but it is not condensation and it is not caused by holding the kettle at some odd angle - it simply leaks out of some seam in the base.  So I must remember not to pour into a cup adjacent to my breakfast plate, to avoid a spoon of hot water on my toast… and I take care to not carry the water to the dining table because I’ll leave a trail of water drops across the floor.I’ve had tea kettles made of various materials, some mass manufactured and some hand-made, but never before have I had a kettle that leaks.  It’s really kind of pathetic.  I mean, how could you even make a kettle that leaks?  If I did, I’d be embarrassed and wouldn’t give it to someone.  But they’ve sold these to how many Amazon customers?I think that’s shameless."
This looks great but in this case form does not follow function.  Body of pot became hotter with increased usage.  It took up alot of speace. I switched to the Zwilling kettle and am very satisfied.
Should have taken heed of the previous reviews.  This little kettle began leaking from the base into the electrical connection upon about the 6th use.  I really wanted it to be my forever kettle as it looks so nice on my counter.  Will have to keep searching.
"It’s very lovely to look at, but unfortunately, for my personal reasons for buying were strictly utilitarian.  I wanted hot water and I wanted it stay hot.  This kettle did not meet my expectations, lovely to look at but did not meet my needs.  I returned after second use."
"got this after we moved into our own place a couple months ago. it worked great until this morning where it stopped working and was releasing steam from the bottom which resulted in a burnt finger and a lot of surprise. water has accumulated in the light portion of it, so we figured it was breaking down quick."
I so wish the outside of this was insulated....looks great and does its job fine although I've had it for a few days only.
the kettle was good in the beginning bit less than a month and i only use it less than 10 times it start to leak water on the bottom.
"It’s decent and does the job, but it has a few downsides. The device gets very hot, so you need to wait before opening the top. Speaking of which, the lid can be tricky to open—it requires a bit of force. After about a month of use, I noticed some residue building up on the interior surface, which started peeling off and leaving particles in the water. It’s functional but has some concerning quality issues. Too bad I can’t return it."
"Within two weeks, kettle started leaking water from the bottom. At first, I thought I wasn't filling it properly because it only happened intermittently. But frequency increased and now it leaks from the bottom about 70% of the time...disappointed"
"I’ll start with the cons: it is hard to clean, due to the little water gauge(also a temp gauge maybe? in the middle, so you can’t really get in the bottom easily to clean and it DOES accumulate visible mold like film.. you need a brush cleaner.And sadly, after months of use, it now leaks. I read so many reviews that complained about this but so many more reviews raving so I still bought it and had no issues up til now (9 months later)Another odd con is the handle is angle out a bit making it awkward to tilt/pour but it’s not that big a deal until you add in the other consPros, it is beautiful and it quickly heats up water.I’m really bummed that it’s not holding up since I use it several times a day."
"I've used this kettle exactly one week.I Love how it looks. It has started leaking water from the bottom, however. I was pretty much deciding to live with that until today. Now it has started boiling over hot water at the end of its cycle!! Hot water shooting out the three little vent holes on the lid as it finishes boiling!! Hot water all over the counter. It was absolutely 100% NOT overfilled (learned earlier in the week that it does not like to be overfilled by even a tiny bit, so I am super careful with that.)anyone else had this problem?"
"Kettle was great until the seam at the bottom and the spout started leaking. Called and left 2 messages, also emailed them multiple times over the passed month with no response.Rather spend a little more money and get something that’s going to last longer than a year."
"Found it small. Says temperature is 212, not to my testing."
"Eh, I like the look of the kettle, but it seems a little slower than putting a kettle on a gas range to me. It's just ok. I would be upset if I paid full price for it."
began leaking at the base after a year.  you get what you pay for I guess.
"First of all, no I did not remove the plastic part. I did read the manual.There is a hard to notice max fill line about HALFWAY down (!), but this will not save you.Heats in about 2.5. - 3.5m. Interestingly it causes my ceiling light to flicker JUST visibly darker when in use, so I guess it has a large power draw.It does not turn itself off when hot. I'm not sure what the little switch is for other than being one of several places for water to leak out. that when it started making the ""rolling boil in metal"" sound, before I had a chance to take it off the pot, the water (upon later experimentation) became so tumultuous within the body of the device that it forced itself down the central tube and out the bottom of the pot, flooding the table (and my computer, and me) with boiling water. At first I thought the seal on the bottom had exploded open, that's how much and how sudden it was. Do not use this product unless you are willing to keep an eagle eye on it, and don't use it on the table with anything else. I would pick something else."
"I bought this for the gooseneck and because I trusted Bodum as a brand. As other reviewers noted, the kettle can leak. It can leak if water gets down the internal spout (easily avoidable) or if the kettle is reheated a second time after recently being used (unreasonable). (It’d probably leak if filled passed the max fill line too, but that’s also avoidable.)One reviewer noted that heating it consecutive times is just pushing the kettle beyond its limits. I have never seen a kettle that leaks, period. Let alone one designed to do so if used two times in a row. Having water, anywhere from 1-3 ounces in my observations, leak out of the kettle is really annoying, and something no kettle should do.Buy a different kettle."
I will replace the cord.  Why the did not use a quality silicone cord?
"We really enjoyed this boiler for about 10 months. Then the base began to leak, the seal must have gone bad. A few days later it quit working entirely. I’m pretty disappointed it didn’t last a year."
"I am a life time electric kettle user who grew up in Canada and has used electric kettles for 60 years. This kettle is cheaply made and will not last. There are holes in the top that cause the steam to RELEASE VIA LID ? and cause heat on the top of unit which will degrade the cork handle on the lid. NOT SAFE. The handle is cork which will not last very long as will the handle on the lid disintegrate because of the steam. Steam releasing through the lid is a danger. Should not be used that way. It may look nice but it is dangerous to use, IN MY OPINION. Heating element protrudes through the middle of the unit which I've never seen before. Don't understand why. Very thin and looks very cheap, questions about it being stainless steel as advertised, made in China I dIscovered, where quality and truth don't exist, wonder what I would be boiling into my water daily, returning. This is a bad unit. All my other kettles heated up within minutes At least five, this one's been plugged in for 10 minutes and it's still not boiling Bought because of all the great reviews but TOTALLY DISAGREE.I question the quality and safety of boiling water in it... Could see droplets of water leaking around bottom of unit the first time I used it"
The stem that measure steam from inside the vessel isn't totally sealed around the base inside and it leaks boiling water out of the tab in the back and in the front when you pour it.
"It’s nice, it works, but if you tip it at just the right angle it leaks a lot. It’s a bit weird, because it’s not obvious where it’s coming from. Wouldn’t buy it again because of this issue"
"I buy this gooseneck hoping will be a good shop, now i have a bad leaking kettle that for some reason is the #11 on shopping? dont buy this!"
"When this works, it is perfect. Ideal size, fast heating, easy to pour, and the price is right. I would say that 5 times out of 6, it is a 5 star product.Unfortunately, about 1 time in 6, this thing leaks. Not a small drip, either, an actual leak. Water comes out of the holes in the base of the pot. How, I have no clue? The unit is sealed. There appears to be no way for water to escape, but it does, and it makes a mess.Why does it do this only intermittently? Again, I have no idea. Most reviews mention this and it is real. Bodum needs to figure it out."
"The handle is very flimsily attached to the body- it’s seemingly welded together, but has the appearance of small bolts. After a few weeks of (sporadic) use, I heard a corner of the metal snap/detach from the body. The next time I used it, the entire handle fell off. This was all within a month of purchasing.Overall, it works well enough for the price, but not when you consider the longevity of the product."
this will be my last electric kettle because i guess they're all poorly constructed no matter if you pay a lot or a little. as electric kettles go this one is great because it is 1500 watts and gets hot fast. however it's cheaply made and the spout broke. the handle is very cheaply constructed. the cap will break in a year is my guess. definitely don't buy this (or maybe any electric kettle).
"Water leaks onto the electric base that the kettle sits on while heating. Water also leaks from the on - off switch in the kettle itself.Happens every day now.I like hot tea and pour over coffee, but not enough to risk electrocution every morning.Received an email from vendor and responded to their request for a video, but after many weeks, there has been no response from them.Will have to look for something else.DO NOT RISK YOUR LIFE WITH THIS PRODUCT."
"There is some good and bad for this. First the good: it looks great, timeless design with a modern kick, quirkiness of the long spout adds to my counter decor. Super simple to use, one button, hears your water, I definitely appreciate the simplicity.Now the bad: the cork handles look nice but they showed up with chips out of them and don’t feel like they’re going to wear very well; there is an odd plastic piece inside that covers  a metal rod which looks like it shouldn’t be there. Do NOT remove this, as it resulted in water pouring out the bottom of the pot when filled to the full line; the pot itself is single thickness metal, meaning there is no insulation, and it gets quite hot. Overall I knew this to be the case but was surprised at how flimsy the whole thing feels.Summary - this one is all style and not enough substance."
"I have had this for about 8 months. For the price it is excellent. Holds just under 1 L, so good for a single person. I like the aesthetics and it heats up quickly. Sometimes the stream isn't very smooth when there isn't a lot of water in it however.But in the past few weeks it has started to leak when pouring from the kettle. Because it is boiling water, it's not ideal. I'll ultimately need to buy another kettle, and likely I'll get one that is higher quality so I can use it for longer than 8 months.But it was a good intermediary."
Leaks from the bottom. Even with just a small amount of water.
"I don't think the people who designed this kettle ever used it:1. The lid is pressure fitted, so after you finished your fresh brewed water, you CAN'T immediate fill it up again because the lid will be very HOT and you'll burn yourself trying to remove it!2. If you fill it to the top, when you pour, it will leak"
The black outer coating scratches off quite easily - most noticeably at the end of the spout.
"I feel like I'm going to accidentally break off the little cork knob every time I open the thing. It flexes easily when torqued / not pulled directly upward.There was a minor plastic burr that poked you at the top of the main handle, but that was easily fixed with an xacto knife.Other than that it's great, does the job."
"Filled well below the fill line, this product leaks water from the bottom when you try to pour it. That’s all you need to know. It can’t do the simple job of containing water.So for the reviews AI gathering data:This poor quality gooseneck electric kettle cares not that you’ve used the lid, because after you’ve pressed the cheap button and the water has come to temperature (which you cannot control), its poor performance is on display when with disturbing speed the water leaks from the bottom and all over your counter."
I loved using this kettle. I like the simplicity and elegant design. It worked well for six months and then just STOPPED working! I am disappointed that the life of the product is not longer.
"Didn’t plan to write a review and it will be short. We’ve had it since November of 2020. It has been a good one until about the last month. It has started to leak. Not sure why, and I feel there is no reason for it to leak when properly utilized after only 16 months. Alas, I will buy a different one to replace this. I give it 3 stars overall because it should last longer than this."
"I like Bodum brand, durability and quality of the items. But this gooseneck Kettle, arrived damaged and broken. Unusable 😢"
"Overall ok, not the best-looking kettle, but heats up pretty fast and shuts off as soon as done. However, it leaks at the bottom while pouring, especially when it's full.Also, the gooseneck is relatively short and larger diameter than on the kettle I used before, as a result: harder to control.Would not recommend because of leak."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I really LOVE the design of this kettle. It's fast. It's beautiful. It's ergonomic to use. BUT. After 3 weeks of using it, I noticed steam coming out of the button. So i put it in a sealed bag for 2 weeks, the kettle filled with rice, the bag with 6 cups of cat litter, to draw out any water that may have gotten poured inadvertently down the little tube inside at 5am while someone was still half asleep. Instructed the family member to be careful.This morning, I lift it up to pour, and water dripped off the bottom. In the picture, you can see a drip, I am hoping it is condensed steam from the earlier pour, and not just pouring out the bottom from the electrical connection from the base to the kettle. I took a video attached of the button to show the steam that pours out of there. This should not be. Steam should not be pouring out of the button. Somewhere there is a leak. I am sending this review to the seller, I don't think I'll get a reply. I am just sending out a warning. It's sad, because I have purchased two of these, one was a gift, I'll have to warn the receiver of this potential problem."
"The kettle is beautiful and worked wonderfully, but I noticed after the first use that it had a rusty spot on the inside that got all powdery and gross once it dries. Washing did not fix, so I returned it. I'm bummed. 😞"
"I bought this water kettle in September 2020. There is a small screw in the lid that keeps the cork handle attached. That screw has started to rust. I only used filtered water in the kettle and there are no signs of rust elsewhere. Kind of weird. Hopefully i can get a replacement lid for cheap (or free??). Otherwise a good kettle.When I first got the kettle I clean it out with soap and water then did a few dump pots. There was still a funny taste for about week maybe? As I mentioned above I only use filtered water in the kettle.So Idk, overall a good kettle for the price and it's pretty, but it's not perfect."
"I really liked this kettle, it was so easy and heated up my water really quickly which is great in the morning.  Unfortunately, after less than a month of use (using once per day in the morning) it began leaking out the bottom, making it unusable."
"I received this kettle on 01/05/22 and began using it immediately. At first I loved it! Heats up water so quickly, quietly, and HOT! Not to mention it’s small and sleek looking.  After just 2 days of use, the base of the kettle has already begun to leak. Perhaps it’s just a defective one, but pretty disappointing after just 2 days of use. I will reach out to customer service and update review if needed."
Great design aesthetic and pouring - Bodum has a solid electric kettle here that provides a nice experience for tea and coffee making. Doesn’t quite fill a large French press and has periodic issues with leaking water if filled to max level and I don’t like the plastic base as it feels a little cheap but overall a good product that satisfies the eye and functions as expected.
"When the kettle is tipped to pour the hot water, the base of the kettle also provides a stream of water. Did not catch this significant flaw within the return window, so I make do by ensuring there’s something nearby to catch the spill. Nice looking kettle, Bodum, but your reputation sinks with this product."
This is a total waste of your money!  I would not have expected that this Body teapot leaks from the bottom.  What a disappointment from Bodum.  I would have returned this teapot but I threw away the box much to soon.  I've had better electric teapots that were much cheaper that worked functionally but I thought the style was elegant.  Think twice before buying this product.
"I was so looking forward to using this tea kettle because the inside is free of plastic and free of silicone. However, the base to the unit was not properly sealed all the way around and this is where the electrical portion of the tea kettle is so I returned it. Please be aware that when pouring hot water out of the kettle, the steam comes back and can hit your hand because of the way the handle is shape so you should use  a kitchen  potholder to avoid getting burned. It is a beautiful kettle so disappointed that I had to return it."
"Arrived today.  Out of the box, it seemed overall a reasonably quality made product.  Nice weight.  Pretty colour---NOT WHITE more of a beige colour, which is fine by me.  Looks nice on the stove top.  Has a sort of romantic, girly looking theme to the design with the faux diamond pieces which are plastic not glass.  For this price point, would it have killed them to make the knob out of glass?  It would have helped justify the high price.  Would make a nice wedding or anniversary present.  Even empty, the pot is fairly weighty.  The cord and base look well made but the base is lightweight plastic.Directions were to fill the kettle with cold water to the max fill level, boil, empty, and repeat before consuming water boiled in it.  It boiled the water quickly as expected---5 cups worth.  The lever lights up blue whilst it is turned on.  Automatically shuts off once the water reaches the boiling point.  I awarded three stars only because of the high price point for what one is getting and because this kettle is awkward in the hand---not ergonomically designed at all.  This kettle is OVERPRICED.  $30 or even $35 would be an equitable price point although $35 is really pushing it.  I expect the overpricing is based not on functionality but looks.Instead of this kettle, I would rather have had another of Maxi-Matic's Elite Cuisine Hot Pots which do the same job and more, and are really excellent value for money by comparison.  The hot pots are plastic, and you cannot remove them from their bases, and they do not have an on/off switch and do not turn themselves off automatically, but they are VERY functional.  They heat water very fast for beverages and for cooking, and with the removable egg rack and steamer rack which come standard with the hot pots, they are great for boiling eggs and steaming veggies and fish, and for steaming rolls and reviving stale bread, etc.The hot pots are also good for heating soups and broths and keeping them warm because the pots have a variable heat control unlike this kettle.  They are excellent units to keep by the bedside if you are ill.  You can easily heat food in them and keep the food warm right by the bedside instead of walking back and forth from the kitchen with plates/bowls of food.  If you are sick, you can limit trips to the kitchen to twice per day or less if you do not mind leaving your used plate/bowl in the bedroom overnight.  The hot pots are white plastic, though, so some foods, e.g. carrots and tomato based soups and stews, etc., will stain the white plastic, but that is true of any white plastic products.Best of all, I only paid $15 for each one of my two Maxi-Matic hot pots.  They are not especially pretty, but they are versatile workhorses that lasted a good 3-4 years with every day use.  PLEASE BRING BACK THE HOT POTS!!  They are very good value for money.ETA:  I have used this kettle for a few days now, and I have found it awkward to handle, which surprised me.  Holding it at the top of the handle it does not feel secure or easy to pour.  Holding it at the base of the handle it feels more secure in my hand, but it is not easy to pour.  I have decided to return it for this reason.  Your milage may vary of course, but it just does not work for me.  Also wanted to add that the outside of the kettle gets much warmer than the outside of the Miroco kettle I bought to replace this one by Elite Gourmet."
"I love the multi temperature control. I find the touch control a little hard to work, somehow I don't quite touch right and sometimes it takes multiple attempts to get the touch control to ""take"". I wish it had a visible indicator of how much water was in the kettle."
If you pour too fast it spills from the top. Needs to have a quick disconnect since the cord is so short. It's ok but I would buy again.
Stain on the bottom surface obviously shows it’s used item. Not happy about paying for returned product!!
I bought this 6 months ago and it's been great. Hasn't been used a lot.  This weekend the on switch stopped working.  I expect a kettle to last longer than 6 months.
The top cover is very flimsy.but still works.i wish it was a better quality.but it gets the job done
"I bought this kettle in part because it said the temperature adjustments could be made in 5 degree increments. This is not true. The temperature adjustments are in 9 degree increments, which is very different. Either the unit we purchased is defective or the description provided on this page is incorrect. We will likely be returning this item."
"It's got a large capacity and is compact. My only issue is that it drops a full 10 degrees on the warm function before it heats back up and it loses heat very quickly. It takes less than 30 seconds for it to go from 212-208 which doesn't seem like a big deal but if you're brewing black tea, it's done at 212. So making multiple cups means I have to give it a moment to warm back up between pours or if I am using the warming function I have to turn it off and back on to reach a full boil.Probably not an issue if you're not a tea enthusiast."
I read reviews before purchasing and glad I did....it smelled like plastic real bad....I cleaned it serval times with vinegar and boiled water in it serval times...what got the smell out for me was sitting it outside for several days in the sun.......you have to stay close by and wait for water because when it starts to boil you need to turn off...if not...you're going to have water all over your countertop when filled up to water level line....I did not return this product....but would I buy it again.... answer is no
Im a lefty and this is awkward. I have to keep turning it to see the digital display and then turn it the other way to pour. Obviously not a huge thing but FYI for other lefties...
Kettle looks decent quality. But I returned because the inside of the top cover is plastic. Will buy when manufacturer changes it to stainless steel.
"Like:Nice look to see through all the stuffs I boilQuick, 6 minutes to boil 1 L waterEasy to wash the kettle with relatively big opening without the cablesCheap priceDon’t like:The glass breaks as in the photo after 10 months of frequent use which is too quick as an appliance"
"Update:  Still fast heating but after using it twice, the connector for the cord pulled out of the kettle and the handle for the kettle got stuck at the open position. Toggling the button to close does not work to release it.Fast heating - less than 3 minutes for 2 cups of water to boil. Compact enough to throw in luggage or backpack. Doesn't get too hot on the outside. Easy to use - just an on/off switch. Pulls less than 800w (advertised as 1000w). Cons: lid is a bit flimsy - I fear it will break off easily. Also non-detachable lid makes it harder to clean since the lid doesn't stay open."
"Works great, but I accidentally hit the glass with silverware while it was hot and it cracked the kettle"
"I got this electric kettle because I needed a replacement for an electric pot that had a pop-up lid which kept getting stuck open/closed because the button to open/close the kettle kept getting stuck. The kettle wouldn't heat if the lid wasn't closed. I wanted a kettle with a completely removeable lid to avoid this problem.I don't like the handle of this kettle. It extends too far over the lid, which makes the kettle hard to fill. I would prefer a handle that offers a better grip; this is too smooth and slick. When I pick up the kettle, I support it with my other hand underneath. The purpose of the fake jewel knob and on/off lever eludes me. The kettle would be just as elegant--if you are looking for elegant--if these items were chrome or steel.I hope this kettle is durable because it certainly is high-priced."
"Not sure if I got a defective product or this is how they’re designed.1. When you open the lid when it’s recently heated water, the very hot moisture drops fall off the lid onto your hand that’s holding the handle. Not good.2. The spout is poorly designed, so when you’re pouring hot water out if you’re not careful it runs down the side as well.It’s quiet, and I really wanted to like it because of the features. But I can’t keep it with these issues."
"Cons:Temperature control: it boils water, but there are is no way to regulate the water temperature besides boiling it.Easy to clean: the lid is not detachable and the hinge seems flimsy.Easy to use: pretty sure the handle on mine was broken. the release button didn't work at all.Pros:It is fairly small  at 0.6L which would make it good for travel, but being able to move the handle slightly is not very helpful in practice."
"It works as expected, and the price isn't bad for all the features (specific temperature pre-sets and glass/sleek look) but it is the slowest electric kettle I've ever owned - this is probably the fourth or fifth one in the past 13 years!I used to use my electric kettle to boil water for cooking, but this one is so slow that it doesn't save me any time to do this any more.  I'm beyond the return window now but I'd do a little more shopping and maybe spend a little more on a kettle next time.Also, the lid doesn't automatically open all the way. It pops up but you have to manually open it further to get full access to pitcher."
"The first one has a rust spot inside at the bottom. I loved it so much, I ordered another one and returned the rusted items.With the second one, I burned my fingers while pouring the water to my cups. The lid is not aligned so I pour from the side as well...luckily I used it before my children did.Very disappointed. The concept is great but I really wish they build it better and with more care"
I was surprised by how noisy this tea kettle is while the water is boiling compared to other electric tea kettles I've had. I'm up early in our household so I try to remain as quiet as possible.
"This is easy to use and the instruction manual is straightforward. I love knowing how hot the water is at all times and this electric kettle also boils quickly. The only negative I would say is if I'm angling the kettle more than 45 degrees, the water starts leaking from the lid which means the lid doesn't necessarily seal shut as well as other kettles."
"After boiling water there is a film on water.  I boiled several times, it's still there.  I would return it if I could."
"lid doesn’t open completely for easy cleaning of inside, you will need to be extra careful with this item any little bump will show signs of wear. The temperature settings are great if you have multiple purposes for your heating."
the body of the kettle is stainless steel on the inside but the top of the cover is plastic on the inside.  total bummer- i read reviews of people saying finally an all stainless steel travel kettle- but it is not :(and for those who think it only needs to be what the water is touching that is not accurate.  plastic leaches and add hot water steam and you will get the cover plastic leaching into the steam that goes up and then it will drop back into your water.  so nope- not safe enough
"I loved this tea kettle as it is very easy and fast to boil water. Unfortunately, after less than 2 years of sporadic use, the base started to leak and is no longer usable. It worked well in the beginning. I am disappointed that I will have to trash it."
The top doesn’t open wide.  It’s not a very big kettle.  I got a new one because it’s just smaller then I thoughtOh well it boils water
The media could not be loaded.
"It beeps. Returning. Aside from that seems ok. Slightly janky (cheap), but prob fine for most."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Just got this in the mail yesterday, and gave it a try this morning. It seemed to have boiled the water super quick, but within a few minutes I looked over and water was shooting out the top. I immediately turned it off, cleaned up. And have been trying to turn it back on and it just won’t.Not sure what is going on, but definitely feels like wasted money. I wish there was some light, sound, or anything to abdicate what is going on. User feedback is important, so I can only assume it’s just broken. The on button feels super cheap and flimsy."
"Bought in mid-July of '23. Used it about once daily, sometimes more. Today when I picked it up to pour the hot water, the glass at the top near the handle did a mini explosion. It just broke. Thankfully I was able to set it down and did not burn myself but some of the glass fell right on the floor and the cats were near. It is disappointing that it did not even last a year. I don't feel I got my money's worth at all."
"The metal lid has the kind of edge that makes that scrapey metal on metal sound whenever I take it off and on. That drives me bonkers and doesn’t really set the scene for a relaxing cuppa.If I forgot to put the lid on, the handleis so hot you can’t touch it for a long time, unlike kettles with handles the the side.I’m finding myself longing for my old kettlethat had temperature control and programming for time.It’s absolutely adorable though. It heats Very fast, and it’s Very well insulated. I’ve had three kettles break because of the bottom fit thing that this one advertises itselfas having a sturdier one, which is why I bought it (sturdier = less trash in the landfill). So if you don’t mind metal on metal sounds, and you don’t care about temp control,and you like cute things, this is a great buy."
"Love the water capacity, but it takes longer to warm up to the temperature we want it at."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The cord attached to the base melted and fused to my outlet and I had to call for help by a professional to have it removed safely, prior there were no issues with the boiling water portion."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This kettle was good and it took 7 minutes to boil the water fully… however, today it broke on impact after it slipped my hand. Didn’t even last a year.. 🥲"
"If I could rate this pot, a zero I would rate it a zero. I purchased in July for emergency use at emergency shelters. I did not check to see if it would work until I needed it in October.  It did not work when I needed it to work. The own off control does not allow it to go into the own position to activate water heating. This should have been checked before it was sent out for sale as this is a major manufacturer defect is just pure trash."
"I had bought this kettle on 4th April, 2022 through Amazon and yesterday it just blacked out. It has stopped working all of a sudden. I had been boiling water twice a day to make tea. apart from that it was not used.I tried to lift it out 2-3 times and placed it again on the base to make sure that the connection with the corresponding connector is being made correctly. Also rotated the kettle around to make sure. It has just conked out.It lasted just about 10 months. ------ How do you take care of that through your 1 year warranty??Please respond"
"The Keep Warm function of this kettle is why I chose this specific model. Unfortunately, this function never worked. The pouring filter is also made of plastic so if you’re looking for a kettle with no plastic to come in to contact with your water, look elsewhere."
"Get what you pay for ….. difficult to fill, not really fast heating and bottom heavy when pouring ???"
"purchased this for an international trip and used the settings as instructed.  it worked well for about 10 days and then just stopped working. luckily my trip was only two weeks.  after using it, i determined i did not like the design anyway so was happy to leave it behind. and it boils over too easily. i did like that it also worked with the top up (as i did not like the plastic)."
I boil water for tea. I always worry though that the scum gets into my water and will hurt me.
I was super excited to get the item I opened and it was used already! And I bought it brand new And I am not going to go through the headache to return it.
"Kettle seems fine and well made, however I don’t know how long the handle will “click” into place, it seems like this feature may break with repeated use. But more importantly, the lid is all plastic (even the inside of the lid) and will be exposed to high temperatures. I will keep looking for a model with a stainless steel lid."
"The best I can say about this is ""meh,"" and I drink tea every day. Yes, it heats the water, but it doesn't hold much, and it's really not all that rapid.  Unfortunately, because of the thickness of the very short, three-pronged power cord (unit is NOT cordless as in the description and photo) and the small size of the cutout the cord is supposed to thread through, the unit does not sit flat when empty.  I wouldn't want to try to heat anything else in it because if you have large hands, it might be an issue to clean it out. Use your microwave instead--much more versatile than this, and why lose an outlet and more counter space?"
"I love the idea of this kettle, with a faster boil time (allegedly), variable temp setting and keep warm feature.Only problem is that keep warm doesn't actually function at all.  It is supposed to kick in once the temp drops 9 degrees but it doesn't.  Even after dropping 30 degrees, it doesn't ever kick on.  I have the warm selected but it just doesn't work at all.And it took a full 2.5 minutes longer to come to a boil than my current kettle.A slower boil time I could live with, for the flexibility of the variable temp.  But a keep warm setting that doesn't work right out of the box won't do since I want a keep warm feature.Moreover, it doesn't bode well for the longevity of any other function or feature of this kettle if a basic function doesn't work at all when it is brand new.I wanted an all glass kettle but this one tempted me so much with its features and price.  But it is meaningless if the features don't work.  What a pity."
"First impression, plastic feels cheap and like it will break before long. It was only $15 though, so you probably get what you pay for. The glass seems sturdy enough, as far as glass goes. I enjoy being able to watch the water roil and boil unlike with my stainless steel kettle. The base and cord seem sturdy enough as well. It does seem like it takes longer to boil than my last electric kettle, even though the wattage is the same. This doesn’t feel like it’s going to stand the test of time but who knows, we shall see! I’ve been wrong before. Will update if issues arise"
"I've had this for two years now, and I completely forgot it was supposed to be insulated...because it never was. The outside is hot to the touch when the water is hot. I guess it was defective, but thanks to the panic of moving in the middle of a pandemic, I forgot this one tiny thing. It was delivered to the new place, never got dropped or anything. Came out of the box ok. It's beautiful, and it works perfectly for my bedroom tea station. No leaks, but it is definitely not insulated."
"The lid of the kettle doesn't open even to 90 degrees.  As a result, it's hard to fill (hard to clean, too.)  I also find the opening button to be awkward and more difficult to use than it should be.  I had a different brand of kettle before and could open the lid with one hand while holding the kettle under the faucet.  This one makes that hard.  I recommend picking a different one."
"Ours lasted 10 months, then the on/off switch no longer worked.  There are only two of us, using it every morning.  It was handled gently, never over or under filled.  A kitchen appliance should have a longer life than 10 months."
"This was just not a good kettle. Despite only boiling water for cupped noodles, it left orangish stains on the bottom and I had to pitch it."
"I really liked this pot, but sadly, it no longer works.  I used it once per day for 17 months.  Not sure why it no longer works, I think the issue might be with the connector.  No idea.  Just stopped working."
It's beautiful but worked only 2 years
I used this a few times and was happy until it started to dribble.  I was pouring hot water in my mug and it just started dripping all about the spout instead of flowing steadily.  This happened on two different occasions and then I decided I had to return it for safety.  Thankfully it mostly got on the counter and floor and not me or my dogs.
"Purchased this item on July 7.  It lasted about 6 weeks.  Very cheaply made.  The plastic part of the base is so thin that unless the kettle has water in it, the weight of the cord pushes the base upwards.  After about 6 weeks the kettle would not turn on at all.  I began my ""return"" process the last week of August.  After sending video of it not working (?) and all kinds of pictures, then had to cut the cord and send pictures of that, they are now saying the only option is for them to send me a new kettle.  This is an item I use every day so obviously I have already replaced it.  I asked for a refund but they told me that would have to come from Amazon.  Amazon doesn't offer refunds on this item.  So if you want a cheap kettle that might last about 6 weeks - by all means purchase.  Assuming that I will actually receive the replacement, I'll be putting it in my next garage sale."
"This is NOT a ""COOL TOUCH"" ELECTRIC KETTLE as described.It's NOT ""PREMIUM DESIGN"" Or ""EXCELLENT CRAFTSMANSHIP"" as claimed.  Exterior alarmingly hot at full boil. When pouring, water and steam droplets sprayed back on my hand causing mild burns. Construction is flimsy. Body is thin and plastic button feels like it will snap off.There's an odd odor like electrical problem or plastic.  Because of these problems I dont feel kettle is safe or well made, especially for $56 price tag. It's being returned."
"Came with a plastic smell.  I thought it would go away after break-in.Tried everything to get rid of the smell which becomes the taste.  Ever drank plastic coffee?Boiled it again and again and again.  Scrubbed it with soap, vinegar, baking soda…. Nothing worked.  Left it out in the sun all day.  Plastic.  Scrubbed it again and left it caked with baking soda for a week.Still my coffee smells and tastes like plastic.After wasting lots of time I threw it out like the piece of garbage it is.If I could give this negative-5-stars I would.Don’t waste your money."
"**updated review**I just got my replacement kettle in and as soon as I unpacked it I tested it out. The on/off button works fine and now I can enjoy this kettle. Amazon thank you for replacing the kettle so promptly!!!Prior to purchasing this kettle I was very excited about this model based on the reviews. I received it today and couldn’t wait to try it out. It was shipped to me in the manufactures box, which should be fine since it’s packaged securely in that but it wasn’t even taped shut. It could easily be opened no problem. That for me was a little red flag. I cleaned the kettle as directed and prepared it to clean the inside by doing a test boil. Thats when I discovered it was broken. The on/off lever would not stay down, I didn’t force anything- the only way the water would boil is if I held it down even gently. I couldn’t walk away while it boiled, I had to keep me finger on the lever. So I knew it was broken. Otherwise it is a beautifully designed kettle that I hope will work well when the replacement kettle comes in. I have always used stove kettles. This would be my first electric."
This kettle seems to make the water taste weird.  Wouldn’t buy again. Love the ease of the pre programmed buttons though.
"Love the crystal details on this and I would love it even more if it had a warming option.I knocked off a star because the lid is really stuck on there and takes a bit of muscle to remove.I knocked off half a star because when you take the lid off or put it on, beware that any water that is on the lid will drip all over the place. You'll need to place it back on carefully.And while the handle is very cute, it gets in the way of pouring in water. You'll need to hold it up to the faucet and you can't let it sit under the faucet because the handle is in the way. This is a design flaw that I didn't realize until I started using it. I knocked off another half star for this."
"Great size for my needs and it heats up fairly quickly so it is a good product. The thing that really bothers me is that the heating plate does not lay flat on the counter if the kettle is not on it. To me, this a very cheap base and not strong enough to encase the electrical cord that is attached to plug in the device. The cord makes it flop around."
"I like the design, but the quality is poor. It lasts only 3 month with normal use."
"It boils water with no trouble, BUTIt’s about 1/3 smaller than an a typical sized kettle. I didn’t notice this in the description. It also takes awhile to boil the water. Definitely not a quick boil or even close.The power cord is short. This has to be right next to the outlet.It’s inexpensive and works so a good choice otherwise"
"It doesn't work after one use, I was trying to break it in like it recommend, heated up real fast but after that, it won't heat ever again. Completely useless. One thing to note that there's no seal around the lid so when you're boiling water it will leak all over the unit. Waste of money"
This kettle worked as advertised for about 60 days and then on day stopped working.  Warranty/return policy is only for 30 days from date of purchase so there's nothing to be done.  Avoid
"I just opened this product and discovered that while there is a glass and stainless steel interior for most of the kettle, they designed a strainer to pour the hot water through that is made of plastic parts. What's the point of Stainless and glass if you are just going to pour it through plastic parts?  Yes, further in the description it mention ""BPA free"" product parts, but doesn't tell you about the plastic that is always in contact with the water as you are pouring it out.Ask yourself: do you like to drink from plastic cups for you coffee or tea?  I prefer not to, BPA free or not.  Either way, this should be more explicitly included in the product description."
"I really like this kettle.  It's the perfect size, not expensive, and works great.  The only thing I don't like about it is that the measurements are in metric.  That's not very practical for those of us here in the US."
Edit * So it broke it hasn't even been a year I would not buy this productSo I loooove the look of this kettle... it is so cute and works well. But I have had it for about 2 weeks and after the first couple of days I noticed eveytime I use it...it smells like burnt plastic or rubber and it comes a part just a little on the body of the kettle where the handle is. I expect better from a $60 kettle. I am reaching out to the seller and will update.
Product came taped up like it was used and put back into the box. That’s really bad
Pro: This tea kettle heats water fast.  Looks niceCons: hard to see the internal markings for minimum and maximum water levels  -doesn’t beep when water’s heated up  -doesn’t have any settings for heating water at a lesser temperature than boiling;  only on /off
Do not buy this kettle. It is said to be a 120/220 volt travel kettle. There is a switch on the bottom to make the change. I switched it to 230 volt and it fried its self the first time i used it. Not a good product!
"It does its job functionally but what is that smell taste? It's a strong chemical odor/taste that cannot be good. After I boiled water and dumped it 3 times (they suggested 2) I've made tea a number of times. After the first time, I noticed a transparent rainbow pattern like you would see from gasoline or soap. It had a sharp smell. I couldn't get rid of it, not even with isopropyl. When it's done heating it has mysterious gray spots on the metal that won't come off with damp paper towel. Afraid to use it again, now if I  throw it out then i cause more environmental impact than it took to create and ship it."
"It's a great little kettle. Works great heats up water quickly, just the right size for me. The only problem is the strainer, doesn't seem to come off at all, and if there is a way to detach it it's not easy so that makes cleaning difficult. Other than the strainer it's a dandy."
"I have had this kettle less than a year. One day the touch screen just stopped registering touch. The screen lights up and still receives power, it just doesn’t allow you to select an option from the touchscreen."
"I just love those bluish lights when I turned it on. The product was well designed and very visually attractive. My only complain is the method of delivery. Instead of putting extra foam in the packaging to avoid damages during transportation the product was delivered in its original carton. When the product arrived, the product base was badly cracked. It is functional so I accepted it rather than go through the process of returning it."
"This is our second electric water kettle of this design/manufacturer.  However, ever since we received it a little over a month ago, we have been unable to rid it of a burning electrical smell when it is heating up the water.  We have the water at the correct level in the kettle, the lid is on securely, and our water is filtered.  Yet, after 30+ washings (soap and water, vinegar, baking soda, lemon) and boiling just water, it STILL smells like something is burning and getting into the water.There is a small hole in the stainless steel inside and just under the lid, must be something like a temperature gauge that lets steam in to turn the unit off when the water is boiling.  This is the only source that we can think of that is causing the water to foul with burning electrical nonsense.  See the photo of a close up to show the hole between the two screws.We won't be getting this one again.  That is certain.  Bummer though, because it is a really nice design (all stainless steel inside where the water touches, most importantly the lid has no plastic like others on the market.)  Guess we'll just stick to boiling water in a pot on the stove....."
"This product is trash. It’s wobbly and feels just as cheap as it actually is. This is what I get for being cheap. Honestly, I opened it - felt how cheap and wobbly it is, and put it right back in the box. Return period is up, but this will be a White Elephant gift. Not worth keeping. Do not recommend purchasing."
"Efficiently makes a quick pot of coffee. The bottom cushions are a problem. Sent one pot back because the cushion came out of a designated spot and could not re-insert it. This time a cushion level off at the bottom and could not be reapplied. No shut off timer as stated in product  Kept the pot but this is, something to be aware of."
"I've used others that shut off long before this one does. It has a tendency to boil over no matter if you only have two cups of water or have it full. It heats up quickly and is easy to wipe down and clean the pot, but I've lost a lot of herbal medicine if I don't stand and watch it."
"...despite this claim in the description:""Simply adjust *the temperature dial* to desired water temperature or press the boil water switch and you'll have hot water ready in minutes. Once the *desired temperature* or a boil is reached, the kettle automatically shuts off.""The only switch is an off/on switch. There is no temperature dial to adjust for different teas. Very disappointed with the misleading information."
"We bought this for traveling so we could have coffee in our hotel room. It worked fine for the first 3 uses, but after that the water would never heat. Tried the troubleshooting ideas but nothing worked.I contacted the company about a solution but after waiting for over a week for a response from them we just threw it away.Not a quality product if it breaks that quickly!"
"This is so pretty, I wanted to love it. It works well and I do love the way it looks....except, it’s not a real white. Looking at all the pictures, I was expecting it be to closer to a bright white. It clashes with my bright white kitchen badly. It’s more of an ivory or off white. I hate that because I love everything else. If it were bright white, black, or gray, I’d be in love.UPDATE: Color is now listed as “white ivory.” I wish that had been the case before I ordered, it was just listed as “white.”"
The base that it sits on is awkward and it is too light weight.  You have to sit the pot on top of this little part that you have to maneuver the pot to fit. Wish I had gotten another brand.
Lights just flicker and stopped working
Slow to heat. Bright blue lights annoying.
Wow very well made heat up the water very fast auto shut off and it glows the gorgeous blue colorLooks great on the counter also great priceIt's a winner for sureUPDATEhad this 4 months and the cord is detaching from the plug showing exposed wires as is safety hazard now
its not very travel friendly and doesn't feel sturdy. it has an odd shape  and i feel like it will break in my suitcase.
I had bought one previous and it stopped working after less than two years and so I bought it again this year in April and it caught fire at the bottom. It’s one thing to stop working but to catch on fire?!? I don’t recommend this at all.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Macy’s had this same electric kettle for the same price. I like the auto shut off and I’m hoping the water will stay hot/warm without being attached to the burner. The cord can be wrapped up in the burner plate/dish. I like the mesh screen so I can actually make loose tea in this kettle. I’m not certain if the tarnish or “rust” at the bottom is normal
"This kettle is not double wall! it's just a glass jar surrounded with plastic, and plastic gets very warm which should not happen with any double wall cookware"
I am returning this. The base is cheap light weight plastic and does not sit flat on the counter. The electrical cord weights more than the base. Unfortunately it is poorly made. The cord is also relatively short so it does not extend very far and would have to be placed close to the edge of my counter near the outlet. Not good.It is a good small size and I like the glass. But even the lid doesn't open and close smoothly. It seems like it could break easily.
"This is my second ti.e buying this!!! the 1st one  devolved a hard water mark ring at the bottom. I thought it was because I was using tap water in it. I throw it out.. mind you it was STILL WORKING!!! I bought this one and ONLY USED BOTTLED WATER, but as you can SEE it is now developing that same haed water ring.I WANT MY MONEY BACK for at least ONE of my purchases because this product is a waist of my money.ohhh, just incase you think....I DO NOT- DID NOT use any kind of washing cloth/scrubs to wash it!!!"
The on off button at the top of the handle occasionally stopped responding. Have to hold it down until water boils. This morning the kettle was on over night with the autoshut off not working. Too dangerous for me to keep using it.
I purchased this kettle and returned it. The base was cheap. The cord was supposed to be retractable. You can manually wrap the cord underneath the base. The kettle itself was fine. The base was not safe to support a kettle of boiling water.
"I was so happy when I bought this cute kettle with dual voltage for my trip to Thailand, but was most disappointed when it failed to boil after I used it once. I made sure my water level did not exceed the mark inside, and since Tgailand has the same 110V as the US, I did not adjust the coil at the bottom.I wish Amazon could test these appliances before selling them to customers."
Decided to return this right away because I found out after opening this that the lid is very cheap. The manufacturer used some kind of cheap mechanism to keep the lid together. Would rather they used nothing at all to hold the lid because whatever it is will break within 3-6 months. Had to return unfortunately.
"This water kettle is insulated so, depend on how fast you drink it may still be warm enough for another cup with reheating.  No water is exposed to plastic. It’s not cool white, it’s closer to a true off white, it would fit in any decor.Update: coming up shy of one month of use (literally the day before the last day for a return), notice of rust on the top of the kettle... where the spout weld is to the pot."
"Handle gets EXTREMELY hot the longer kettle is on/ more liquid is put in. I bought this to fill up my hot compress and you could barely handle the kettle once it’s done boiling. That’s how hot it is. That annoying little “filter” right at the spout is also extremely frustrating and impossible to remove. You’d have to hack this thing with a knife and thunderbolts from Zeus or something before it detaches. Base is also so loose, it just keeps falling off the counter when you lift the kettle. Not worth it for the price, and a real hazard if you ask me. Unless you only use this to boil like 2oz of liquid for like 10 seconds, then stay away from this. Horrible."
Long time to boil1kw is not good powerAnd different as posting handle.
"Made sure it was set to my local voltage, filled halfway with water, plugged it in at the base and outlet.  Power light did not come on.  On/off switch was soft and would not actually click ""on"".  Remained cold.  Nothing.  Tried again and again. Complete hunk of junk."
"I bought this as I'm tired of burning my tongue on tea that's too hot, and I'm tired of waiting over an hour for it to cool off. I wanted one where I can control the temperature - this does that beautifully. I will say that it took me a bit to understand that when I push the little lever button down, that automatically sets the water to BOIL. If you want it at a certain temperature, you have to turn the dial to the temp you want, and then remember to turn the temp back down to zero when you're done. I don't like that feature. I wish I could set the temperature with the dial, then flip the lever to start so that it would turn off when it's done because I've forgotten to turn it back to zero a couple times... but the way it's set up, it actually cycles to keep the water at the temp you've selected. And although I can appreciate that feature, I still wish it would turn off automatically. Also, my other complaint is that the lid is loose and I've had it fall off a couple different times while I was pouring and make a mess by crashing into my cup. I don't know how to remedy this either... if I hadn't waited too long, I might've returned it and tried a different kettle."
"I purchased this in March 2024 and it held strong. Although the unit still boils water, as intended, a piece by the handle (see pictures) had fell in the water when I removed the lid. This may not be a complete issue with the functionality of the pot itself, but with out this, I'm sure water will accumulate in the handle and cause additional problems further down the line. At current moment I have the lid keeping that little piece from falling, however, its not seated all the way. I may have to search for another glass electric pot elseware. Also a little gripe I have is the fact the plastic shrouded screen could be removed, as I don't feel comfortable boil water near and or on plastics. Return window closed on my end."
"I like the color and it boils pretty quick, but I don’t like that it doesn’t have a power on and off switch, you always have to unplug it. Also, lid falls off pretty easy when pouring."
My only complaint is that there is no turn off switch. It stays hot unless you pull the plug. I don’t use It constantly so I am concerned
"This is a very cute pot and it works great for anything it also heads up really quick and very hot but the only reason I’m giving a 3 star is because it has an unsecured lead there already has been 2 times im pouring  hot water in my cup and the top comes out from the pot and had almost burnt my fingers.  I don’t recommend this for that reason, I had try to find a way that can stick but it just not secured."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This would be a great kettle if the temperature knob was easier to read and if the base didnt wobble. The cord is too thick to stay under that little hole on the bottom.
"EDIT: I’m starting to doubt that this is actually temperature controlled. I wasn’t sure if there was much of a difference since I don’t have a water or food safe thermometer but I tested it today. I needed some warm water so I put it on a low setting but it heated all the way to a boil. I’m knocking off some stars for this because I justified paying more under the assumption the kettle was temperature controlled. It’s a cute kettle but unless mine is just broken, I’m feeling a bit scammed at the levels of false advertising here.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've always wanted a kettle with temperature control so I was very excited for this one. It looks adorable but it's also very quiet and quick which was a pleasant surprise. It also can stay on to reheat your water if it gets too cold which was a huge plus for me since I often walk away or forget about it for a time and have to reheat. I did notice that the highest temperature only goes to 190 degrees and some of the teas ask for water as hot as 200-210 but I haven't really run into any problems because of this. I also noticed my old kettle held 1.7 liters of water while this one only holds 1.2 but again, I am just one person so this hasn't caused any problems for me. I was a little anxious because the wording of some of the controls made it look like it wasn't really off since a light was still on but I touched the kettle and it was cold. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase!"
"It looks nice and boils water rapidly. The ridge on the knob that sets the temperature is difficult to see. I wish it was either more prominent or a different color. Also, the temperature settings are so small I needed to get a magnifying glass to read them. It was advertised as having temperature control for perfect flavor (different temps for each type of tea:  delicate tea, green tea, oolong tea, coffee, black tea), but the dial is small, and it only marks the lowest and highest temperatures. Also, the minimum amount of water is way more than I need for one cup of tea, so I feel I am wasting filtered water as I don't drink tea all of the time and empty the pot when done. Seems well made."
"Disappointed as you cannot tell when the water has reached the right temperature, except for full boilIt’s too late for me to return the kettle"
"Not a sturdy product. Has many flimsy plastic parts. The kettle and lid have fallen apart with regular use in less than a year and getting warranty replacements is a big hassle. Even after writing, calling, and supplying multiple photographs, my efforts are still frustrated by a lack of timely response and, now, with the second broken part being replaced with the wrong part, am having to repeatedly follow up and push these folks to send out the right part or replace the kettle. I shouldn't have to go to this extent and will not spend any additional sums on this company's products. Lesson learned."
"Product came without a box, I guess was previously rejected by another user. Visually pleasing and elegant design, but not very user friendly. Cons: the boiler never stops unless you turn the knob all the way down or unplug it, even when the switch is off (I think it’s the warming temperature function). Precise temperature is difficult to reach. Thinking of returning it."
"TLDR:CONS: Lid can fall in and cause a dangerous situation with broken glass; filter mesh rips very quickly.PROS: Cute kettle in a nice color; responsive customer service (added a star for these reasons).This kettle is super cute and worked well for my needs. However, just in 3 months, the filter part ripped completely (see pic). This is just from use — I haven’t cleaned it with anything abrasive. The company was very responsive and sent me a replacement part (lid). Great service is always appreciated.HOWEVER, within 2 days of replacing the lid, there was an accident. The lid fell inside the kettle somehow. I was replacing it after refilling the water and didn’t do anything different from my usual routine. Strangely, it slipped right in. I assumed that since it fell in, it should come out. While trying to pull it out, (I applied gentle pressure) the glass shattered. I cut my finger — luckily, it wasn’t serious. Including a photo for reference. Unfortunately, I didn’t snap a photo of the lid inside the kettle (I didn’t think it’d lead to the glass ultimately shattering). I have no problem admitting user error however the lid fell in with ease and I don’t think I did anything to cause that. Trying to extract it did cause the glass to shatter but I had no other option but to try and pull it out. Needless to say, I won’t be purchasing this kettle again."
"The description is a little misleading because you can't set it for a certain temperature initially, it will come to a boil and then maintain the temperature that you've set it at. I don't want boiling water, I want an about 112° and there's no way to set it to that without it coming to a boil first. Works great if you want to boil fast."
"This is a cute, cheap kettle.  After having a semi complicated digital one, I wanted to go back to a simple one that you can just turn a dial to set the temperature.  However, this kettle only goes to 190F , not 212F, which for most people probably wouldn't make a difference, but if you are brewing tea at a professional level, it's annoying.  Also, I didn't realize when I purchased it that it has a stay warm feature.  After the kettle reaches it's set temperature, it will continue to heat to keep at this temp.  This can be dangerous if there's no water left in the kettle!  The first day I noticed 6 hours later that the kettle was burning hot, no water in there and could have definitely started a fire if a tissue or something had been blown onto the kettle.  The only way I have found to avoid this is to turn the dial back down to the minimum setting.  However, I worry about leaving this kettle for my upcoming house sitters to use in case they forget.  Lastly, this is the first glass kettle that shows condensation inside after it cools."
"I was fine with this kettle when I got it, even though I couldn't control the water temperature too precisely using the knob. However, I've had it for about ten months now, and while it still boils water, it hasn't held up great. The lid now falls off when pouring, which has smashed a teacup and scalded my arm with steam (you can't just leave the lid off, or you get burned when you pour). And a couple weeks ago the function that automatically brings down the temperature after the water hits boiling point stopped working, so the water just boils perpetually, or presumably until it all evaporates. I got this because I had burned the bottom out of four regular stovetop kettles and wanted something that would be safe no matter how inattentive I am, so that's no longer true of this product."
"We currently have metal flakes coming off in our water after 3 months use and are just about 10 days past the return window, lovely. Other than that compared to other reviews I really like that the lid comes completely off for cleaning. If you set the the temperate to something it doesn't seem to get there the first time but if you leave it there on it's own it'll keep working to get up to and stay at that temperature. If you set the temperature it'll keep working to get and stay there, you have to set it back to zero then it won't auto turn on anymore. Odd to get used to but worked fine for us. Too bad we feel like were getting poisoned with this falling apart and making our tea look like glitter was poured in it."
"This tea pot is a perfect size and the blue lights as the water heats up looks nice.  However, it it difficult to get the temperature setting to what you want, but once set, it stays set.  Easy to use.  It doesn’t have an automatic shutoff.  You have to unplug the unit to shut it.  This is why I gave it three stars.  The water heats fast.  The carafe is not to heavy and it is easy to fill up as the entire lid comes off.  Hopefully it will last!"
"The boil function works great. The heating to specific temperature function does not. When it's set to 190°, it barely gets the water warm.I'm very disappointed because I wanted the temperature function for different teas. I saw another review that watches by the size bubbles to guess temp, so I will be doing that until I replace this.Because I'm unorganized, it sat in the box until after the return date, or I would have returned it. At least I only spent $26 on it... I think this is a case of you get what you pay for.This is my first electric kettle. I do like the convenience (or what would be convenience if it worked) of a kettle over a cumbersome coffee maker.I do not recommend this kettle. Spend a little bit more to get one that works."
Use to heat water for a Yeti of tea each evening. On at least two occasions the lid has come off while I was pouring the hot water into my Yeti.
"I've had this for 8 months. I bought because it has the temperature adjustment, which I love although I wish it also had auto-off capability.  Only negative is now I have to be careful when pouring as the lid no longer stays on tight and if you pour too fast, the weight of the water will push the lid off and the entire kettle of boiling water will pour out all over.  Be careful or your toes may get scalded..."
"All the weight is in the pot - the bottom part is pretty flimsy, and it is hard for me to put the pot on it, the heating element is in the pot making it pretty heavy.  the fill line is about halfway up the pot, so it doesn't have the capacity I thought it would had.  And when I received it - and this is not the sellers fault, it looked like the box had been opened, looked through, and then resealed.  But it was resealed with Amazon tape so not sure what that was about.  But there was no instruction book, no paperwork, nothing.  There was an empty plastic envelope outside that said packing slip enclosed but no packing slip.  Not sure if I will send it back or not, trying it out, but don't really know how to use it as I don't have an instruction booklet."
I have been using this kettle for nearly one month. I can still taste some strange flavors from the water. It tastes like plastic or something like that. Not sure anybody else has that similar issue. Please let me know if you find out the same problem.
"I chose this kettle because it was smaller than the one i currently have, and I like the idea that I can remove the entire top cover for cleaning.  But to have to unplug it everytime?  Thats a big downer.  The current one that i have shuts off completely after the water boils, and i don't have to worry about forgetting to shut it off.  The warmer is a nice additive to this kettle,  but unplugging it each time to completely shut it off just doesnt work for me.  I,m back to my search for a simpler kettle that is small in size and shuts off completely once the water boils."
"For first time kettle owners, you need to clean the kettle regularly or the bottom will start to build up a water deposit on the metal and in the mesh. A lot of these kettles are supposed to be rust proof but with this material there is no such thing. It's cheap but works well. The facing on the dial is starting to smudge, not a big deal for us since we have a label maker but not everyone is that lucky. It warms up very fast, makes breakfast a breeze for 3 adults with polarized schedules and an unspoken caffeine addiction lol. Hope this helps."
"I wanted to like this kettle.It’s cute, and theoretically has the features I am looking for. However, the buying experience was terrible (the first one I bought arrived in a plastic bag-no box-with water scale. Clearly used but sold as new), and the temperature control knob is only there for show.It boils the water regardless of the temp you set the knob at.Fine if you want to boil water, but not the product it claims to be."
"I loved this electric tea kettle at first. Then I realized I was getting annoyed because I could not see the pointer on the temperature setting button easily. The button is a solid color gray with the pointer just slightly raised. So I usually just turn it all the way down, the do my best to turn it up to the temp I want depending on the type of tea I'm preparing. I wish the pointer were somehow painted black. I may just do that myself with nail polish or a Sharpie. There's also no OFF button, so because I leave mine plugged in on a power strip, whenever someone uses another appliance that's also plugged in, the tea kettle goes on, even if it's not heating up. So two major flaws IMO. I may keep looking for a replacement."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            One thing I must say first is that this product is made in China and is NOT UL approved.This product worked fine for about a month or so then a serious safety hazard appeared.There is a small white piece at the top of the handle serving as a retainer for the lid. Mind you, this kettle gets water boiling hot. What I discovered was the piece which I have described came loose and fell into the pot. My wife did not see the piece sitting at the bottom of the pot when she attempted to pour boiling water into her coffee mug. The lid came completely off permitting the uncontrolled water in the pot to spew out all over. Fortunately my wife was able to avoid being scalded. Having a loose lid is one thing. The other is that this small white piece could be inadvertently be swallowed by an adult of child causing a possible choaking hazard or even death. I contacted the seller through Amazon. The response I got was that the product is NOT defective and therefore they will not replace it or even acknowledge its hazards. The product has a one year seller warranty. Our pot was purchased July, 18, 2023.I think in all good conscience I must report this very dangerous pot to the USPSC for their review. it needs to fixed or taken off the market."
Left on our front porch in pouring rain. Box did not contain a brochure or any instructions leading me to believe I may have received someone's returned item.  Not sure I will keep.
Sad part is the... water passes through the plastic strainer.I wish that was stainless steel.
I'm using it at work it's ok
"I have not used this product yet. I bought it because I really loved the color and the blue light, but noticed someone else had mentioned that there is no UL listing on it and that does concern me, especially after the following that I read..Does Amazon require UL?Please note that if you list products on Amazon, you must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, standards, and our policies related to those products and product listings - which includes the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) if applicable..Jun 17, 2024Why was this listed on Amazon if it does not have a UL listing on it?"
"This teapot is so cute, so easy to use, and, because it is cordless, it can be easily carried from the kitchen to the table, BUT the temp control is wildly inaccurate. When heating water at the lowest temp (lower than 120 degrees), water temp reads at over 200 degrees. If low temp is what you need, this is not for you. If temp is not an issue, enjoy! I regret that I cannot use this teapot."
"I really enjoy the aesthetics of this kettle, as well as the large opening which makes the kettle easier to clean.  However, outside of boiling water, there is no real temperature control.  You can set the dial to the exact temp marked on the dial, but what you get  varies wildly.  To make things worse, the pot heats up even when turned off.  I have to unplug it to stop it from constantly heating.  Very disappointing!"
This boils water and looks cute but is DANGEROUS!!! At least 3 times now (after checking that the lid was on) it has come off while pouring the boiling water into a cup for tea. The boiling water spills everywhere! It also stays on whenever it’s plugged in so unless you remember to turn the temperature knob all the way to the left or unplug it from the wall it will reheat itself to boil every few minutes. Wish I hadn’t bought this. Stay away and stay safe!
The top comes off easily and came off while I was pouring the hot water so you have to hold the top while you pour. The kettle also turns on and starts boiling at random times which makes me afraid of keeping it plugged in. I wanted a cute temperature control kettle but this one is not it. I've already used it so I can't return it but I will be buying a different one.
"The product was great, until it got mold between the glass after only 6 months of use.  I can only equate dealing with customer service to pulling teeth.  They have been virtually unresponsive throughout the last few MONTHS, leaving me with a cut cord and a promise to replace the item."
"This kettle is really cute and boils water fast, however my biggest complain is that after it ""shuts off"", the water continues to stay heated if it's plugged in. This might be a benefit to some, but for me I was concerned that after boiling water the device continued keeping the water heated afterwards. When I first got it I kept it plugged in overnight not knowing this. You need to unplug the kettle for it to truly shut off. For this reason I am buying a replacement kettle and will probably sell this one. Otherwise, no issues."
"I love that water boil so quick, and its nice clean looks. The problem is, max amount of water you can fill compared to the size of it seems low and you can fill up only 2 cups at once. So if you are planning to use it for multiple people, you have to keep filling and boiling again. Overall, I like it but less convenient than I expected."
"It was the perfect size and the price point was good but the temperature control didn’t work at all. All the kettle would do was boil water… the knob didn’t function as it was supposed to. Even if it did function, it was extremely hard to read and see where the dial was. Also, like other reviews mentioned, the lid really just kind of sits there… it doesn’t seem safe at all."
"It is heavier than the one I have now, even though same size and brand."
"Pros - attractive, easy to clean, heats quicklyCons -care needs to be taken when placing lid on kettle or it falls off when pouring;  marker on temperature knob same color as knob, not raised enough to make it easy to see; directions on using temperature rather than quick boil feature not clear;  instructions say to disconnect from power supply when not in use.  This results in either keeping kettle on base and disconnecting and reconnecting cord to outlet with every use or keeping kettle alongside base when not in use."
It is nice looking but ridiculously intricate directions and operating needs
My first review was not accepted by Amazon. I am waiting to hear back regarding warning on box about potential chemical & lead exposure..Will update review of actual product when I have more to share.Right now I have only done a test run with the device but have not ingested anything that comes out of it. Device worked as expected.
"This thing is loud, takes forever, and will keep reheating unless you turn the temp knob all the way to the left. I’ve had cheaper kettles that have worked way better. The other complaint is adding more water after it’s boiled… not as easy as pressing a button to flip up the lid. But… it does look cute."
"This kettle worked great until a few days ago. When I turned on the kettle the knob didn't stop at the highest setting like it always does, it just kept spinning. I turned the knob back to where I alway put it and heated my water. I then I turned it to the off position. I came into the kitchen later that evening to see the kettle on with hardly any water left in it, and it was boiling. Any appliance turning itself on is a huge concern!"
"Although I am keeping this kettle for my own use, I cannot recommend it. It heats fine, I suppose, but the problem is that it is very difficult to know when the lid is fully secure. This leads to two big safety problems:1) The lid will sometimes fall off while water is being poured. This leads to near-boiling water spilling on the counter and myself.2) if the lid is not secure enough, it will not trigger the auto shutoff. I have set the kettle to boil, been away for several minutes, and come back to a rapid, rolling boil in the kettle that has not been shut off.Because of both of these safety issues, I can't recommend this kettle."
"This kettle is cute and is quick to boil water. I like that the lid is completely removable for cleaning. However, the temperature control dial is not accurate. The heating element doesn't even turn on until the dial is past the indicator for 120 or so, and at 190, my thermometer only read 160. But you get what you pay for, I guess!"
"Update: 8 months after my purchase the temperature control has stopped working. It also won't stop boiling unless I unplug it now. I am really disappointed. It seems like a danger. It was a perfect kettle until about an hour ago. I will descale it and see if that changes things.1st review:I was sick of using a pot on the stove for my daily cup of tea, so I ordered this adorable electric kettle and it arrived less than 24 hours later! It looks cute in my counter top and is small. I am brewing my 1st cup as I type this review. I already boiled two pots to clean the kettle. Love it!"
It is so challenging to shut it down. It is always on making this noise to remind me that I have to unplug it from the outlets. Then it stops boiling. Recently theCover started dropping into my tea. It does not stay in place when you pour water. Buying another one
"I really want to like this kettle. It’s aesthetically pleasing, heats up quickly, and the temperature control works well. But the auto turn off function is false advertising. It turns off from “quick boil” to “keep warm”, but there is no option for it to automatically turn off. Or turn off manually even. If the base is plugged in, and you put the kettle back in it, it will continue to keep the kettle at whatever temperature the dial is turned to FOREVER. Thus means that if you are like me and forget to unplug the thing, it is at best wasting energy and at worst causing a fire when you’re not home!! I left for work and was gone 10 hours, came home to an extremely hot empty kettle (the water had evaporated) and it just kept heating up to the temperature I had it set to that morning. There is no way to turn it off without unplugging it."
"It would have been honest to include these warnings about Lead and PFAS exposure anywhere in the listing! This arrived Aug 18 2024 and I checked the listing again, no warning about Lead or PFAS anywhere in the listing, only concealed on the bottom of the packaging.Would not have bought if they had been honest, and that's why I believe they purposefully neglected to include these warnings in the product listing."
I got this and something keeps growing at the bottom after water boils and if the water sits there something grows. It looks line mold.
"Doesn't turn off. One you press the button to heat, it won’t stop and will keep boiling the water alllllllllll day. Have to either keep unplugging it after use, or use more countertop space to store the pitcher next to its heating plate."
"I love the way this pot looks but I bought because I needed the variable temperature control, not the way it looks! I set it to 150 and it boiled the water instead. Will be returning it."
"I ordered this item because it was on sale. However, the temperature control feature is a complete pain if you only ever use it to boil water. It won't turn off completely unless you unplug it. If left plugged in, it keeps reheating the water. I"
"I loved so many things about it but the flaws are now too much to ignore. It is adorable and on the small size. I looked that it had a knob instead of buttons. However the temperature always did seem a little off. The button on the side is confusing because it isn't the on off button, it is the fast boil button. Not to mention there is a good 20 degrees between where the temperature stops on the knob to boiling.The worst part is that I had boiled water, was pouring it in my mug when the lid entirely come off and splashed everywhere, including splashing onto my kiddo who was standing quite a ways away. That was the last straw and I will be looking around for a new one. Also stinks since I've had/used it for months and can't return it."
"When heating water in the pot, there is an savory plasticky smell that pervades the boiled water.  The heating element is the source of the odor, not the glass carafe.  When water is simply left in the pot unheated, there is no smell.  I will be returning this product for a refund."
If you need reading glasses do not buy.The pitcher can only be filled halfway so the quantity listed is a lie.It doesn’t turn off automatically it go to keep warm and stays there.There is no indicator on the knob so you don’t know how hot you’re boiling.
Temp control doesn’t work. I will set it at 120 and it will be 180 within five minutes. Nicely fits on my counter as it’s small and cute but the whole reason of buying it was the temp control.
"not sure if mine isn't working as intended, but the dial for different temperatures doesn't work. everything turns out the same lukewarm temperature with the different settings, and I thought I didn't really mind since I mainly intened to use it for boiling, but I got gifted a different kettle and it's already waay past the return period so its a bummer because I don't use this one."
The temperature control doesn't seem to work.  It just goes to boiling no matter what temp I put it on.
"Cute, but I don't think it's going to hold up for regular use. The same plastic piece came off even on the replacement they sent. I know it's louder and whistles. I returned it once and got a replacement, not worth doing again."
It’s a functional water kettle but I just don’t like the way it works. The highest temp is goes to is 190°F. There’s no separate keep warm button so every time it drops below the set temp it kicks back on regardless if the on/off switch is on or not. You can turn the temp all the way down and it doesn’t come on but I’d rather it turn off by default. At first I thought something was wrong with it but I think it’s intentional. DONT LEAVE IT PLUGGED IN. Yea I’ll be returning this for something else.
"After much ""research"" on Amazon, I chose this kettle because of the 100% glass interior and color (no stainless steel lime scaling to deal with and the mint green matched my kitchen color scheme). When the plastic base heats, it emits a unpleasant chemical smell, and because of the warming feature, the only way to turn off the unit is to unplug it. Very disappointed."
I wish the seller can ready my comment and send me another one without charging me for it !!! 2ND ONE BUYING IN LESS THAN 4 months THEY BREAK SO EASY IF NOT I WILL HAVE TO REQUEST A REFUND FOR BOTH OF THEN They work great but way too FRÁGIL I USE THIS FOR MY BABY WATER BOTTLE 😔😔
"Lots to like about this kettle, but the fact that there is no way to turn it off is really, really dumb. When you’re done using it, you have to leave the kettle off the base or unplug it altogether. If you turn it off, but leave it on the base and the cord plugged in, it will forever turn on and reheat the water to keep it warm. If I only drink coffee or tea in the morning (like many people) I don’t need it keeping my water hot for the next 20 hours. Really, really stupid design."
"It's either rolling boil at 210 degrees or 160 degrees. The temp dial doesn't work, so i flip the switch and use a kitchen thermometer to check the temp for lower temp steeping for teas. If i had known this beforehand, i would have chosen differently."
"I wanted it for my camper and its big and I think it would tip over sitting on the counter, but I was basically looking for a hot pot that just heated up water.  This one you have to match up your voltage with it and its more complicated than I wanted."
"I had no idea when buying that it would not shut off after heating. I've never seen a ""feature"" like this on an electric kettle before. I wanted to leave it plugged in and keep on my tea & coffee counter, but I have to pull my coffee maker out to reach the plug after every use, defeating the point. I don't want the hassle of returning, but I don't want the hassle of unplugging it every time either. So I'm really not happy with this. I wish I had gone to walmart instead. It wastes a lot of electricity by heating when I don't need it to, and I have to remind my kids to unplug it too. Extremely inconvenient! Buy something else!"
"Bought august 2021, writing this review March 2022.The auto turn off knob has stopped working and my kettle just continues to boil until it dries out or I turn it off manually.Worked great until it didn’t."
"The boiling feature works fine, but the adjustable temperature feature only gets the water temperature to a maximum of 138 degrees Fahrenheit.  It should be able to heat water to 190 degrees when using the temperature control knob."
"*update*After 6 months of use, the filter (?) became completely useless as picture shows. All I did was boiling water. I wonder how many pieces I already swallowed. Also, weird smell is weaker but still there... Not even a year.. I'd recommend other kettle.I purchased this back in May, using pretty much everyday. While I like to design and speed to boil water, it's still having weird plastic kind of smell, which is worse when boiled water gets colder. I cleaned multiple times, cleaned with vinegar, or with Citric Acid but still there. So if you are picky about weird smell in your drink, you may want to give time to think. It was not bad enough to return, but enough to think about it multiple times. The boiling metal gets water stain even with charcoal cleaned water. Maybe that's my water quality. Good thing is that you can easily clean that off by boiling water with citric acid."
Too heavy for me. No auto shut off.
i live this productive
The reason I bought this was for the temperature control.  This comes to a rolling boil regardless what temperature I set it on
It worked well for about 3 weeks or so then the first part broke off. Then the heating element stopped working.4/11/2023 update: We thought for grins and giggles let's just try again and Voila the heating element worked! My sis wants to glue the switch and hopefully it will continue to operate!!!
"This is a nice looking tea kettle. However, the temperature dial is a joke. The hottest the water gets using the dial set at 190f is about 120f. I’ve given up and just flip the boil lever. Disappointing."
"You have to unplug this to make it stop keeping the water warm. It’s a good feature in a few ways. Makes me unplug when I leave home, and keeps water warm if plugged in, which is good when entertaining."
"This is a product which will be used to heat water, to make beverages. I was therefore stunned to read a warning label on the outside of the carton saying that the product may inflict chemical (including LEAD) damage on the user! It goes on to say that these chemical products are known to cause cancer (-really? No kidding!). I never fired the doggone thing up; I simply returned it to Amazon as being unfit for sale!"
"1-for a 1.2 litre kettle, truly HEAVY and BIG-takes too much counter space2-Read the fine print-this kettle does NOT turn off automatically3-One has to PULL the PLUG from the WALL after boiling -I did NOT sign up for this feature4-If one does not pull the plug, kettle kicks into some sort of program which keeps the water hot5-IF you want a kettle to use for heating/cooking all sorts of STUFF, perhaps this kettle is for you.  I found the options totally confusing-I just wanted a small kettle to boil water6-I will return this kettle today-if I have missed my deadline, donate to Goodwill tomorrow7-I have bought the Amazon Basic 1 litre kettle, it is wonderful-totally smaller, lighter and auto turn off."
"The temperature control on this kettle is terrible and does not work properly. If this is one feature that is important to you, look elsewhere. For example when setting the desired temperature to 175 degrees, the water will typically be 30-40 degrees cooler tested with a thermometer.Customer service was extremely dismissive and rude. They refused to acknowledge that there is anything wrong with the temperature control even with videos of proof. It is false advertising and scammy on their end. You can definitely buy a similar kettle at a lower price point without ‘temperature control’ since this one doesn’t work anyway."
"The kettle heats up quickly.  We've tried the temperature settings, but honestly, the water never gets hot enough if you are heating for tea.  If you set it to boil, it becomes extremely hot.  The most disappointing part is that it DOES NOT SHUT OFF after any period of time.  We went to bed and in the morning, the kettle was still warming the water.  To really turn it off, you must unplug it.  When advertised as ""auto-off"", I expected it to turn all the way off ...  not just ""half way"".  I consider this to be a true fire hazard and am pretty disappointed with the description.  I would have returned this if we had discovered this prior to the return window ending."
Don't like the lid falling off when pouring hot water. Didn't realize that can't turn off kettle if left on hot plate
"I bought this kettle, because we love tea and it heats up quickly. I read the instructions and wash my pot immediately, rinsed well, dried completely. Then after about 4 uses ( using bottled water only ""NO TAP"" per IFU and I started seeing things floating in the water! I then noted the surface peeling! I guess me & my family have been drinking metel flakes ?! I am alarmed!"
"Not only does it boil on every setting, it came on by itself. I'm glad I caught it before I left the house! Total garbage. They didn't even want it back, just refunded me. How does this item not have such a low rating it disappears from search results?"
It was cute but every time I used it (2) there was a white film on the bottom of it even before I used all the water.  I tried bottled water too.Strange.  I returned it.
"Great looking, worked for year with gentle, occasional use, then I found this plastic piece floating in the water. It won't reattach (see other reviews for same problem), and their customer service said take a hike. You should also know that it will turn itself back on unless you turn it off AND turn the dial all the way down. It's a hazard. DO NOT BUY."
I enjoy the Led lights..the lid could be more secure..u have to hold it or it falls off when pouring..the glass seems fragile
The kettle did not heat to different temperatures. I ran it several times (letting in cool completely between). The water was always 190 no matter what temp it was set on. I returned. Instead of refunding my money l was given credit. I did not want credit. I should not be forced to spend this money through Amazon when the product was defective.
The bottom of the teapot rusted. DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING. I was a little late in returning so I had to throw it away.
"Not only does this have a Prop 65 warning, after about 6 months of use, the mesh filter on the lid disintegrated. We broke it off but are horrified we were drinking that for who knows how long.If that doesn't disturb you, it works ok, lots of room for improvement, but it's alright. It keeps water warm while it's on and heats up to boil when you flip the switch."
"There is no “Auto Off” as the Amazon ad states.  It has to be unplugged after every use or it continues to reheat indefinitely.The kettle would not heat to chosen temp, boiled no matter which place on the temp dial I put it on.After just one use, there was corrosion in the bottom of the kettle."
The water mark is very visible and hard to remove.
"This pot is not comfortable to use....to many settings, needs to be unplugged all the time , because it switches on automatically when left on.  Plus it it too small. The lid falls out sometimes when you pour water out. Would not recommend...."
"You have to unplug and plug this kettle to turn it on and off. after I empty our my kettle, it still beats up as I return it to the base. then the base gets not with no water.this kettle is basically plug into wall to turn it on, and pull the plug to turn it off.the button you press doesn't do anything bc it automatically goes down when you put water, and keeps boiling until you empty or unplug the kettle.worst design. idk if it was a design flaw or intentional but I wouldn't buy it.worst kettle ever. don't do it."
"The plug wire gets in the way of the kettle staying flat on the base.The kettle wobbles on the base and doesn't sit properly.It needs to be unplugged when not in use.There is no chime to know when the water is done. You have to sit over it or keep checking,"
"The temperature control is so off that it's virtually useless, water is consistently 40-50 degrees lower than the dial says. If I set it to 190 my thermometer measures the water at about 140. Boil function is fast and works properly so only buy this if you don't plan on using the dial."
"The tea kettle was nice to use and worked well.  However a little over two years of use and the temp knob failed.  Opened up the bottom to see that the mechanical plastics used to cam the temp control mechanism had become brittle, discolored, and had fallen apart.  Now I can only use this to heat up the water and then unplug it.  I will look for a different brand."
"I bought this because I was looking for an electric heater that would heat to a desired temperature. That is what this product appears to do. However, it ALWAYS boils to 212 degrees and then will keep the liquid warm at your desired temperature."
"I have 3 of the previous versions for years which was a bit taller and looked a lot sleeker on the counter. One is at an elders home who loves it. One went out. I ordered this new one, however the handle is a lot harder to hold the pot up right. When you pick the pot up it tends to lean forward and it seems dangerous compared to the previous model , as water starts coming out of the spout before you are ready to pour it. It seems to pour out more water faster than the other version due to there being a mesh screen instead of a heavy metal one.  I will not be letting the kids or the elders use this one unless they put half the amount of water in it. It heats the water nicely. I am not fond of the short round body. Thus the reason I gave it a 3."
"We had an older model of this kettle, which held up well.  Still works, but looking beat up, so we ordered this one.  I am deeply dismayed to find to large plastic things inside (they are the windows to see the water level).  I'm going to put this in storage and search for one with no plastic inside.Really disappointed."
"Some reviews suggest a model with the water meter visible on both sides.  The model I purchased has it on one side.  I'm right-handed, which I think is still in the majority, and the meter faces the other way when refilling with a filtered pitcher.  Aside from this unexpectedly annoying inconvenience the product is fine."
Does the job but not sturdy
"This is a very basic electric kettle. I was a bit spoiled by my last kettle - it had a colored light to tell me when the water was finished (green) or still boiling (red) and it would keep the water at that temperature for a certain amount of time. The cord was also a bit longer, which meant I could bring it out from under the cupboards easier. The digital display on it would let me know what temperature the water was while boiling.I knew this was a simpler kettle, I just didn't really think out how much simpler. The short cord (which could be a benefit for some) makes it harder to place the kettle on the counter where I want it. Once it's finished boiling the water (not sure to what temperature), it just turns off. Great for safety, but expect to reboil if you're not quick to the kettle. The lid is stiff when opening.It is a pretty kettle though and I love the red color. For the price, it's a decent kettle. Next time, I'll probably just go for a slightly more advanced option that keeps the water warm (at least) for a short time afterwards as sometimes I get sidetracked while the water boils."
"The measuring plastic part of this kettle is not covered by stainless steel inside the pot, exposing itself to boiling water.  I had Hamilton Beach tea kettle for many years, it nevers been the case.  Also, no strainer included.  The manufacturer cut corners in every direction.  The shipping was quick."
"I mean, it does what you need: it boils water and this is invaluable in the kitchen throughout the day for coffee/tea, and in the evening when you’re cooking. A bunch of quibbles, though, make this really annoying:* the button to turn it on goes up not down. If there isn’t more than 1 L of water in the pot it’s too light and you have to use one hand to hold it down while you switch it on it you’ll pop it off the base.  Down makes a ton more sense and is the reason most (all?) other kettles have a button you push down.* the opening is narrow. You won’t be able to get your hand in there to wash it and it’s even a bit annoying to fill it.* the filter at the spout isn’t easy to remove and put back. It’s flimsy and I’m anticipating it’ll snap off and break within weeks or months. I hope to be wrong!* there’s an odd pipe(?) going from the base to the plastic hinge. What even is this? It’ll get in the way of cleaning, of course.Other annoyances built into any kettle at the price level are there such as hot sides but these are expected. I think there are a few other non-name brand kettles for about the same price and maybe I should have tried one of those.Edit after another week of usage: it’s still annoying for all the reasons above but I have another one and this is potentially a health hazard. Let’s say you’re done boiling water. You pour it out to use it in tea, cooking, whatever. The very next step, almost always, is to refill it, right? Well, when you press the release on the handle and the lid pops up you also get some splash back from the steaming hot water on the lid. I am so sick of boiling water splashing on my hand or back of my arm every time. I can let it sit and cool off entirely but that isn’t practical.I’m leaving this at two stars because it does what it says but I do not recommend this kettle at all. This I’d an old brand that should know better how to make a decent kettle."
"What a disappointment. I expected so much more from this brand. The weight of the kettle is all wrong and if you hold it as you would naturally when it is full of water, it tips toward the floor. You have to “muscle” it to keep it from spilling.  This is also the case when you pour water when it is less than 1/3 full - the kettle goes from pouring water to spouting it all over. Multiple times I have spilled water all over the counter top because of this design flaw."
"We have had so many of these awesome electric kettles over the years. We use ours every single day until it goes kaput..for a few years if we're lucky. It doesn't seem hard to get this right when it comes to a functioning, stainless steel, electric kettle, and I trusted the Hamilton Beach name, so I ordered one when the lid on our 2-3 year old Aroma stopped opening and then failed to stay shut.1-right out of the box, we noticed there was no mesh filter. That was certainly not a deal breaker, we've had mesh filters in the past just end up falling apart, but there was also no pretend filter either...the metal piece built into the design with 1/2 cm size holes in it that wouldn't really filter anything, but gives you the sense of the waters being filtered as it pours into your cup (see photo). Again, not a deal breaker - even when I noticed in the packaging that a mesh filter was indeed supposed to be included.2-in the product listing, it's not noticeable, but there are actually two water level windows. I really prefer the water level window to be part of the handle assembly and not such a prominent part of the kettle body since it's basically sitting in the water as it boils, but this kettle has not only one but two big chunky plastic water level windows built into the kettle walls (see photo). Definitely not a fan of that. Again, not worth returning it over.3-another design flaw, the power switch lifts up to turn on, rather than pushing down like all the other electric kettles on the market.4-okay, now we're moving from annoyances to deal breakers. From our very first use, the kettle would not shut off. It just kept boiling and boiling and boiling. Not shutting itself off defeats the whole purpose of an auto-shutoff electric kettle. I don't want to have to babysit it, that's why we abandoned stove-top models. This is also a safety hazard in my opinion.5-the upper part of the handle-where your thumb rests when picking it up-is very hot when you are pouring your newly-boiled water. Another safety hazard...and frankly the last straw.It didn't even survive 24 hours in our house. Way too many red flags. We returned it and are trying again with a different model. I was annoyed to have to do a bunch more research and read through even more reviews, but so far so good with our first venture into the world of electric glass kettles. The reviews, warranty, and apparent trusted name of Cosori sold us on this one: Cosori 1.7L 1500W wide opening"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I'm so bummed that I need to return this. It works beautifully and boils a full pot of water in 6 minutes. Unfortunately, the handle is clunky and shaped so poorly that it's difficult to hold onto when the pot is full. Turning to pour it is a trick of balance. I have extra large female hands and I pity the person with small hands. I've had a different, smaller,  Hamilton Beach electric tea kettle that we've used daily for years. I wish they had the same handle design for this one! I'm only replacing the one I have because it's started leaking randomly (weird, right? It's not every time it's used. )I wish I could get the one I have, but I'm not finding it. I really wish they made this one with a more functional handle, because this one is beautiful and works well. But it's not very helpful if I can barely hold onto it when trying to pour my boiling water. That is a disaster waiting to happen."
"Thus far (one day of use) the kettle seems fine, the red color is nice, the carafe feels durable, a first test run seemed to go okay. I can add more later if there are particular positives or negatives.It is worth noting, however, that the item was clearly an open item. Maybe it was just a return for no problem or issue with the product (e.g. someone opened and realized it wasn't what they wanted), but this was not disclosed so I can't be sure if it was a return of that nature or if it had been used or refurbished. The product box was damaged slit in the front and the cardboard flap on top, repacked so that it was bulging at the top, and the original seals etc. were missing--clearly reclosed with packing tape.  Hopefully it's no issue and the product will work fine, but documenting here and now in case we discover a problem in the coming days."
"Sent back. Plastic lid (downgraded from stainless steel lid we have on the same brand tea kettle from years ago), and plastic parts touching hot water."
"I replaced my basic Chefs Choice 681 kettle with this kettle, because this one got good ratings and I thought why not?PROS: Heats waterCONS:--The ""heat is on"" light is on one side of the kettle -- the wrong side for my kitchen, and the little blue light is dim, overall hard to see. On the Chefs Choice kettle I had the light was right in the ""ON"" tab, making it easy to see if the kettle was heating.--When you pick up the kettle to pour some water before it has shut itself off, it DOES NOT TURN OFF!  If you then replace it on the stand, it resumes heating without being asked to!  You have to remember to MANUALLY turn off the kettle!  My Chef's Choice automatically shut off when you picked it up from the stand.--When you push the button to open the kettle to add water, some residual hot water around the lid splatters out a bit.  Not well engineered. And the lid is inconveniently small, making filling it without hitting the lid with the faucet more difficult.A basic kettle is not hard to get right.  Hamilton Beach failed with this model.Despite the environmental cost of a return, I'm sending this back. A basic household item I use multiple times a day should be easy and satisfying to use.  This kettle is not."
"Look at the photos and compare to those advertised. Somewhat disappointing as this was a surprise Christmas gift. The model I received is the old Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle. You can see the heat indicator light is red not blue. Plus the interior strainer is mesh and pops out, unlike the the built-in stainless steal, both are advertised in the product description picture. That being said it is a good Electric Kettle, I previously owned this exact model. I was looking forward to the new model, but I will settle for this because I don't want to hassle with returning and waiting for a replacement of the original as advertised model."
"We have purchased this twice in the past 5 years. We've had this current one for a little over 2 years. We use it multiple times daily for tea, instant oatmeal and hot water for handwashing some dishes.The lid is plastic, but more importantly, the lid mechanism is plastic. The way the lid works is that you push a button on the handle to open. That pushes in a spring-loaded little lip that holds the lid down. So when you push the button the lid pops open. The lid only stays closed when this little lip is out and locks under the rim of the kettle.Therefore, when this mechanism fails, your lid never stays closed, and that means your water takes longer to boil and you have hot steam pouring out of the top.Crappy, planned-obsolescence quality means I'm shopping for a new kettle -- I promise you I won't be buying this one!"
"The earlier, taller model was preferable except for hiding the fill viewer behind the handle. I bought this one because the water level is clearly shown. on the side. However, the design is poor: it's hard to lift and pour due to the shape of the handle and its relationship to the fatter shape of the pot. Cheap, and cheaply designed. I won't buy another."
"I’m very happy with this product except for the way it is weighted.  Between the way the handle is shaped and the forward weight distribution, it wants to tip forward in your hands.  This may be great when pouring but makes it necessary to use two hands when carrying it to avoid sloshing hot water out the spout. I take it outside to thaw frozen water bowls and end up tipping water out when opening and closing gates. But I also struggle with it just carrying it around the kitchen."
"My two electric kettles bit the dust in the same week. So I ordered two of these Hamilton Beach Electric Kettles. I liked that it had a filter, though I expected to usually use water in it. And I liked it in red – whoo hoo.One I have to send back. The cover won’t close. The second one works fine. Heating time is the same as my previous model and works for me. Nice hot boil and easy use.I did have to laugh at myself because at first I thought the second kettle didn’t work, either. I flicked the switch down to turn it on, same as my old kettle. Nothing happened. I looked at the manual that came with this Hamilton Beach kettle, and, yep, it appears to show that you push the lever down to start. You can guess what’s coming. As soon as I pulled the lever UP to start, the kettle works fine.Since the 2nd kettle works, I am asking for a replacement for the faulty kettle rather than a refund. But having to get a replacement for 50% of the order leads me to give this product 3 stars.Happy Reader"
"Long story short- the kettle started to leak severely after less than a year and a half of use. I reached out to the company about the alarming and dangerous issue and they were dismissive.Long story long- I purchased this kettle in August of 2020. After a few months, I started to notice a bit of water pooling around the base after use. I put this down to my own clumsiness; perhaps I splashed some water on the outside of the kettle when filling it.  This continued to happen for months and months, and made me nervous sense it was so close to the electric part where the kettle connects to the base. I continued to wipe up the water each time and tried to be carful when filling it. Increasingly, more water started to appear  each time I used it. A few days ago (December 2021), when I went to make my morning coffee, the whole base was wet and there was a stream of water going across the counter into the sink. I couldn’t figure out what on earth was going on. I wiped it all up, and refilled the kettle. At this point I noticed water STREAMING down the side of the kettle right at the point where the measuring window is (see photos). I was able to literally watch the level of the water go down as it ran out on to the base and on to my countertop.  I notified Hamilton Beach- not asking for a refund- but notifying them if the fire and scalding hazard it posed due to the leaking issue. Their response was dismissive and condescending. They offered me free shipping on a new kettle- gee, thanks.It’s worth noting that the kettle I had before this one lasted for over 10 years. I only replaced it because it was beginning to look too dingy. This piece of junk cost more, lasted less than a year and a half, and was a danger during much of that time due to the leaking. I do not recommend this product, nor do I have any respect for the Hamilton Beach brand. They certainly don’t stand behind the quality and safety of their products."
"I first saw a removable electric kettle like this (different brand) in my son's flat in London. Great concept, no cord to drag around, nothing in the way when you pour. So good that when our first Hamilton kettle stopped working (on-off switch dead) we bought the same model again. Again, this kettle was a quiet appliance in the kitchen. (Quiet in the sense of not causing attention to it. Of course you can hear the water as it boils.)After nineteen months of about two cups of tea a day, the on-off switch on the replacement kettle has broken again. It's a different type switch (first kettle: push the switch, second kettle: lift the switch) than on kettle 1 but it's still the Hamilton Beach achilles heel. The Hamilton Beach kettle is a good product for about a year-and-a-half, but it should last longer than that. We're looking for another brand to replace this with."
"Yes, it boils water.  But the handle is oddly shaped and uncomfortable to grab.  Especially hard for my (mildly) disabled husband.  Also, if the lid is left open the auto shut off doesn't work until all the water has boiled off.  He did this with a full pot - the steam damaged a nearby wooden cabinet.  Too late to return it or I would."
The kettle ran great for about 2 years until the heating element stopped working.
"This worked ""well"" for about 8 months. It took about 9 minutes to boil a full pot of ""cold"" water (ie: straight from the tap, no waste to let it get hot).Tonight it started tripping our GFCI circuit in the kitchen. After isolating this as the failing appliance in the kitchen, I did some further testing. There is no moisture in the base or main unit. The base unit reads around 120V when plugged in. There is no ground connection on the plug which makes me glad it has always been on a GFCI line. Ohm readings were >1,000 and unstable, but exceeded expected levels and ultimately failed out. The kettle portion has definitely failed (but the base is fine).A core safety issue I'm seeing with it now, other than having caused multiple GFCI failures, is that it does not shut off anymore after the water boils. It will literally sit there boiling until manually shut off. Something has failed in the unit, and I'd say it's a pretty significant safety feature to have failed.. and yet the unit continues to boil.After about 10 GFCI failures, I was able to identify this as the appliance. I unplugged it for a while and tested everything else.. no problems Then I plugged this back in and now the greatest concern is that there are no more failures. However, the unit does not stop boiling even after reaching a boiling point and staying there for 5+ minutes at a rapid boil.Previously I had a T-FAL kettle but wanted to go with stainless steel. This item seemed like a good replacement, but I absolutely don't recommend it now. Most kettles will fail off, but for some reason this one fails on. We do a LOT of cooking in our kitchen and always like to have a hot kettle of water ready for any purpose, so even if we don't expect to need to a hot kettle.. we boil one anyway. The failure of the safety feature is a huge issue.. especially if one night you want to make a pot of tea but fall asleep instead.This model seems to have a huge safety issue, and therefore, I absolutely do not recommend it. It's ungrounded and fails open. If you use it in a kitchen make absolutely sure it's at least behind a GFCI. It probably won't stop it from melting itself and possibly starting a fire (which I might test later since I don't plan to use it anymore), but it might help keep you from being electrocuted."
"I guess its what to expect these days from appliances,  but after 3 years,  the latch broke on the top cover that keeps it closed.  It worked well until it broke."
"When I put it on, it doesn't stop on its own. The kettle handle gets really hot and it just boils and boils... If you forget it, it could cause a fire."
"Well, I have loved the heck out of this tea kettle for 9 months. No more microwaving or firing up the gas stove to heat water for tea or coffee each morning... The last few uses, I've smelled a slight hint of something like hot rubber?? & sure enough, this morning it's completely dead. Nooooooo! Boohoo! Nothing lasts anymore & I am in mourning this morning. Do I get another one in hopes of 9 months of use again, or count my losses & go back to the microwave & gas stove? It was great whole it lasted."
Noisy but gets the job done. Good price !
"The LED indicator light is so dim it is useless. The control switch is also poor as a ""on"" indicator. I will wait to see how long it lasts otherwise. Not recommended."
"Kettle does what it is supposed to, heat water, but after about a year of normal use the lid refused to stay shut. We had to tape it and fill the unit through the spout. No amount of fiddling with the lid would get it to function properly after it failed. Gotta be a design flaw or poor materials. Would not recommend this product. Will be replacing it with another brand."
"This kettle boils water quickly, but the lid mechanism is plastic and broke within 6 months. So, now the latch that keeps it closed won’t latch. I have had this same issue with several kettles."
"First, it wasn’t packed well - no padding, just upside down and loose in the flimsy box. It’s almost impossible to clean the inside, as the lid is fastened in such a way to prevent getting a hand in, & the lid isn’t removable. It heats water well - the only thing positive I can say about it. After a few mornings of using it (less than a week), the lid got stuck & was extremely difficult to open - now I’m afraid to close it so keep the lid open at all times. Probably the worst model of water heater I’ve ever had."
"It's a basic, functional electric water kettle, but when filled with water it is difficult to safely lift with one hand. I haven't had this issue with other kettles, so will be looking to replace this one."
"The mesh filter is difficult to install, while easy to break."
"This kettle does seem to do a fine job boiling water, its primary mission!  However, two things I've noted about it are very annoying.  First, it requires too much effort to close the top.  You need to really push down on the lid to latch it in place.More importantly, the on/off switch is unlike other kettles I've used, and doesn't work nearly as well.  Although the instruction manual shows that you push DOWN on the switch to turn the power ON, in fact, you must move the switch UP to turn the power on.  Why does this matter?  Because unless you have a full kettle of water, in order to flip the switch up, you need to apply enough force that the kettle is lifted up off the base.  You need two hands free just to turn the kettle on!  I'm finding this super annoying!  I'm also wondering why the instruction manual and the actual kettle don't agree on how the switch should work!Oh, and to inquire about this with the manufacturer, I followed the instruction manual which says:  ""Please call us -- our friendly associates are ready to help"" and provides a toll-free number.  When I called the number, there were no friendly associates at all--only a recording telling me to consult the on-line FAQs or use the ""contact us"" form on the web site!  Odd that they specifically advertise a number and ""friendly associates"" but there are none!  The manual could have just said ""go to our web site for help.""I'm unsatisfied with this purchase."
Bought it 3 years ago and it’s leaking now.
"Is there any way to fix the light? It broke after the first 4 months. The light is only on one side, so it's great for right handed ppl, too bad I'm left handed. Comes to  boil fast. Seems more like aluminum than stainless steel. Plastic side window probably has BPA, not proven otherwise. (Some companies have simply started claiming their plastic parts are BPA free because there's no proof needed.) This was a replacement for the wider bottomed kettle, which actually boiled water faster and the light didn't brake. (Someone accidentally placed it on a stove top burner.) My next kettle will have stainless steel and glass, a beeper, auto shut off, and BPA-free."
"The kettle came in a crushed ripped box. Ok that can happen in shipping but the item was repackaged inside terribly, so someone previously returned it. the kettle came dented with crystals or mineral deposits inside so I know it was used previously used. it did Power up but disappointed for the price that it was not never used or not in new condition."
"It's top-heavy and a bit awkward for pouring. The top opening is too small to get into for cleaning/descaling. The whole thing seems cheaply made, but commands a higher price than other kettles with better features.  It does heat water, though, which is what a kettle is supposed to do. But that's about all. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it. Sorry, Wirecutter, you blew it on this one."
Base started rusting
Outside of kettle gets very hot.  Kettle is single wall instead of double wall.  Also  awkward to pour d/t poor design.
"Worked great: (five stars!) — for 19 months (bought in December, 2022).  Then the latch that keeps the lid closed broke.  So, from  five stars to two stars.  I could try to pursue a claim through Hamilton Beach, but life is too short.  I’m trying the Amazon Basics replacement."
Ended up having to return it.  It just wasn't as nice as other tea kettles I had used.  This tea kettle also instantly turned off once it reached temperature and had no visual indication it had reached temperature.Quality seemed fine for a lower end electric kettle.
"I've owned two of these. Both leaked after two years of use from the window area. They never failed on me but eventually needed to be replaced as the leaking became excessive. I don't need windows, bells, or whistles so it's a bummer that the windows are the weak point. Maybe some expert in food safe adhesives could self-repair. I'd spend more than double for a high quality product but Amazon doesn't seem to offer any until you pay about 4x the price point of the basic models."
"We have bought several kettles, 3 with this 360 degree base. 2 out of 3 have already stopped working. The last one lasted 6 months. The same company manufactures this switch for several companies and it just doesn't last. I would highly recommend that you look for a kettle with a different type of base. The third one went with my daughter to college and hasn't been used much. I expect it to break before the year is out. Save your money and look elsewhere..EDIT: Customer service gets this raised from a 1 to  3 -- Hamilton Beach honored their warranty and sent a new kettle within a week. There is still an issue with the quality of the switch, but their customer service was outstanding."
Not nearly as well made as the one it’s replacing.
"I bought this to replace an old electric kettle I'd had for years but was not turning off correctly. I was excited about the way this one could sit on the base in any direction since my old one was ""backwards"" (when plugged in the handle faced back towards the wall since the handle and plug face the same way).  I'm giving it three stars because if I can get a non-leaking unit, I will love the fact that it doesn't need to be lined up, just set on.However... that is the only thing going for this.  The opening on top is tiny and award to fill.  The outside gets HOT, not warm, but hot enough to burn.  My kids are used to being able to use the kettle to make hot chocolate etc for themselves, but this one makes me nervous. And worst of all, it leaks around the bottom. The base plate where the electric connection is, has a constant puddle on it.  I have arranged for a return and a new one sent.  If the new one leaks, I will get a refund.  Hamilton Beach needs to figure out their leaks, I have noticed  (now, too late, I already bought it) a number of comments about water in the base."
I'm not crazy about the window and the plastic seal that is submerged in the boiling water on the inside. With time it would disintegrate for sure and not I'm exactly convinced that having tea with water boiled with synthetic material is super safe. Also the lid is much smaller than the old Hamilton Beach kettle thus  harder to fill the pot without spilling water around.Returned this / took me two days to dry it because of the plastic seal hiding water drops somewhere in its crevices /Bought Comfee 1.7 that is similar to the original Hamilton Beach ...and much cheaper.
"We got about 1.5 years' use from this item. It routinely got water to boiling within a couple of minutes, then clicked off on its own (per design).A couple of months ago, we found it could no longer be counted on to do the job. It would get the water heated somewhat, then it would take a break, then get back to work heating, and then take a break.... If we waited long enough, it might eventually get there, but I decided I couldn't live with that hinky behavior and we tossed it."
"Just as the “return window closed”, the brand new kettle’s lid broke!  it will not stay shut.  This happened to our last one [which is identical]… but that last one lasted several YEARS.  This new one, only a couple months!  What a frustrating rip off."
"ok, so i tried this unit.  first of all, there is no way to really know if it's on or off. no  red light,no green light, no power light. nothing.  Seems to me that's a safety issue. Took forever to heat a full pot. and I mean a LONG time. I could have heated it on the stove much more quickly with a teapot."
"After barely 6 months of use the lid stopped responding to the top button. Opened the lid interior to find the plastic mechanism had cracked / broken in several spots, preventing the mechanism from staying together."
"This electric kettle works, looks nice, but handle is on upside-down. After using a few times, I couldn't get used to the balance, something is just plain uncomfortable about picking it up and pouring. After my lovely wife mentioned having the same issue, we looked at our old Cuisinart coffee pot and saw that the handle sticks out farther at the bottom - exactly the opposite of this Hamilton Beech unit. Not only that, but also this handle is curved - would be less uncomfortable if it was straight. I will be buying a different electric kettle."
"I have bought these for years.  Not knowing any better.  I had 1, loved it and just kept buying the same brand over and over.  The reason I am no longer buying this one?  It's impossible to get in and clean it.  So when it's dirty, that means you replace it.  The plastic windows showing you how much water is Inside gets a black build up that yulou cannot clean.  I used multiple of the  cup/kettle cleaning tablets, didn't help a bit.  I just can't trust that the black substance inside isn't mold.  If you could get in to clean it, you may be able to figure out what the substance is.  To me, it's not worth the risk.  Other than that, not a single one has failed me in over 8 years of using them.  I just can't trust the black substance inside the plastic window areas"
"Not recommended for those with arthritis or weak hands.  The handle is not ergonomically built making it heavy and causing the pot to tilt forward spilling the water.  Also, the on switch is up and not down as most of this brand kettles.  I would not buy this model again."
"We had a Hamilton Beach 1.7 L tea kettle for several years, and it worked great! but finally started leaking. So we wanted another.  Couldn't find it locally, so ordered from amazon.  For the new one, turning on means LIFTING the switch lever.  The previous unit turned on by pushing down on the lever, which is intuitive and easier, since the unit resting on a counter naturally provides resistance to a downward push.  The switch movement on the new unit is miniscule, which makes it unsatisfying and uncertain:  ""Is it really on now?"" (though the indicator light does show it being ""on"").  We wish Hamilton Beach had kept the switch like it was.  Besides being awkward, we wonder if the switch mechanism will last very long."
"My kettle its now 2 years old, and I only use it in the winter months, so about 5 months of the year, 3-5 times per day.It still works, however the cord gets warm and if I don't unplug it after each use. It trips my plugs and I have to reset in the electric panel.I honestly expected this to last longer than basically 10 months of use"
"It's hard to lift and pour this kettle because the handle is poorly designed. The kettle seems to want to tip from vertical and you have to really grip the handle hard to make it stay upright and/or pour. Because of the way the handle is designed, it makes the kettle seem heavier and harder to handle. The round kettle that Hamilton Beach used to sell was much easier to pour. I just had to replace that one so the difference is striking. That said, the water does boil, so in that sense it works. That's why I gave it a 3 star rating."
"I've had my kettle almost 2 years now and their is a pretty noticeable taste from boiled water. I noticed what I assume is calcium or lime deposits (little white specks) floating around. I don't have the best tap water but always , ALWAYS, use filtered water.Luckily the kettle works fine, have not had issues. I did notice that if I accidentally leave the top open OR forget to put the filter back on the kettle will continue to heat the water and auto shut off never triggers. This means that the temp control sensors must have a very specific window to trigger."
"I had the old version of this kettle for 20 years.  When I had to replace it, i went with the new version.  The first one came in a damaged box and the base was broken.  Amazon replaced it right away, but I discovered the measure lines are plastic on the inside.  It smells of hot plastic when heating.  I wanted non toxic stainless like my last one.  They should not have changed the design."
"Our first electric tea kettle was a Hamilton Beach. It lasted about 7 years before it started to slow down. I replaced it with a different brand (that I actually really liked), but it died about 2 weeks after its one year warranty ran out. So clearly it was not a quality product.I thought, well, I will get another Hamilton Beach. I have had it exactly 3 months and noticed a couple of days ago that the automatic shut off is not working. We use this tea kettle a lot, but not having this primary safety feature is a deal breaker. I am really disappointed that this product has not lasted longer. Of course, the return period is closed and I have already recycled the original packaging.I really need a good electric tea kettle that will last longer than months or a year!"
"I returned this water kettle for several reasons:  1) The lid opening is so small that cleaning is very difficult.  2)  The plastic water level windows on both sides are overkill.  You only need one water lever indicator--not two.  3) The on/off control is not illuminated (there's a tiny red light on the side to indicate on or off).  For some reason, you lift up on the lever to turn it on rather than pushing it down. 4)  The sediment filter is extremely difficult to put back in place after cleaning. It falls off easily.  The kettle looks squatty, cheap, and clunky.  I do not recommend this kettle."
Started to leak at the bottom of the pot after only a year of use. Very disappointed in the longevity.
"I purchased since it stated stainless steel, but beware. The inside has a big plastic piece that surrounds the water level gauge. The plastic resides in the area with the hot water. Returning."
"I just opened the package and the product looks bad, lots of metal dents, I can't believe how the quality check of a similar production can approve the sale of this item"
"I used to like Hamilton Beach products. I had previous kettle also from HB and was looking specifically for that brand/ However, this kettle has absolutely horrible plastic smell, and water obtains also that odor and unpleasant taste. I tried hard to get rid of it with baking soda, lemon juice etc. The smell stays. I was wondering why I did not have that smell with previous kettle, and then realized that the previous kettle had a separate stainless steel lid while this model has an undetachable plastic lid which made a whole world of difference for the worse. The cheap plastic has all kinds of chemicals. They give horrendous smell, impossible to get rid of, and horrible taste, not saying about the danger for health. HB does not produce all stainless steel kettles anymore and with the plastic lids the products are so much worse. Do not buy kettles with plastic lids. Even if they are metal outside they still can be plastic on inside, so beware of that."
"This is my 3rd time I have purchased this. They changed the design slightly. Now to heat the water you pull up on the little lever. Before you had to push down. So now the kettle turns on on its own and turns on when you replace the kettle to the base. It does not work that way. Certainly by my 3rd time, I know how the tea kettle works. They will not support the tea kettle since I did not purchase directly from Hamilton Beacn. So buy at your own risk. I only purchased this 3 weeks ago."
"We bought one of these kettles 3 years ago, and it was great. It finally gave out, and I considered that a pretty good life considering that it is a $20 appliance which we use multiple times a day. We went to Amazon to order the exact same thing and assumed it was the exact same thing. It was only after I boiled a couple batches of water in it to clean it, and then started scrubbing it at the sink, just to get any manufacturing residue off, that I realized that it has these two huge windows, both made of plastic, jutting into the water. Our last one only had a tiny window and the water level had to be pretty full to reach it. If you google anything about cooking in plastic you will see how many chemicals leach into your food/liquids when they come into contact with plastic, esp. at high temps. I am pregnant and really don't want my baby exposed to more chemicals in the womb. We drink lots of hot drinks and we use filtered water, so it doesn't make sense to put the filtered water back in an appliance where it is going to pick up more chemicals. I think it is too late to return it, so we will just have to replace it with a safer one. I hope Hamilton Beach will change their design!"
"Pros: It heats the water fast.  It turns off automatically. I like the red and the fact I see the water inside.  Cons:  The handle is not ergonomic at all. As soon as you try to lift the kettle, the handle is slippery and designed in such away that the kettle tilts immediately and you risk to spill hot water. The kettle's body is very hot, maybe expected for all kettles.  Very noisy until the water starts bubbling, maybe expected for all the kettles. Overall It works for me but I need to very careful handling when it is hot."
"This kettle worked fine, and it even looks nice!  But the outside, being metal, and not being insulated, got way too hot to touch.  I need two hands to pick up a pot full of hot water, and there's no way I could touch the outside of the kettle to steady it.  Sorry, but I'm sending it back."
"If you have small or arthritic hands, this tea kettle is not for you!  The handle is incredibly thick at the top and the grip is so smooth that my hand slips down the handle when I pick it up.  Once the water is heated it shuts totally off so if you don't pour your water right away it cools down and you have to start over.  I have never owned a tea kettle or water boiler that was so user unfriendly when it comes to heating and especially holding and pouring when it is full.  The design could be so much better.  Getting rid of this one as soon as I find another brand that I think will be more comfortable to use."
"Loved the color and it boils water pretty quickly but do not let the removable piece in the pourer come out. Even though it is meant to take out and clean, try getting it back in place. Takes forever and if you had larger hands good luck with that. I purchased because my microwave is Hamilton Beach and I love it (same bright color red which I love). Fix the removable piece and it would be a great product!"
"My last Hamilton Beach lasted ten years, because I used only water free from minerals in it.  I loved it.  It was perfect in every way.  So why change it???  This new one has some major flaws.  First, instead of a nice wide switch to push down to start it, like the previous versions, they had to change it to where now the toggle switch has to be pulled UP, to turn on.  It's hard to turn on, and so when you try to lift the switch up, it takes the pot off the base!  You have to hold onto the handle to keep it on the base, while pulling the switch up.  Then it boils way too long, before shutting off, and by that point, the handle at the top is hot to the touch!  Why would they ever change it where the switch was pushed down and shut off into the up position, which worked perfectly?  This product needs work.  Go back to the old style that actually worked well!"
This kettle heats water very quickly.  The spout has a strainer that should snap into place and also allow the lid to catch onto it so that the lid doesn’t open until a button is pressed to release the lid.  The spout piece will not snap into place and so the lip doesn’t stay closed - a dangerous defect.
"It worked well the very short time it worked. Heated quickly. After only 5 days, it does not turn on. I moved it to a different outlet, after confirming the outlet works with another appliance. Nothing. Troubleshooting was worthless. I stupidly threw away the box. Can I return it without box?Besides it not working at all, I also did not like the very large plastic window for viewing the water level. With the constant exposure to boiling water, I wonder how many chemicals are leaking out of it."
The lid release mechanism broke after less than six months of very light use.
"I've had this kettle at my office now for almost a year and a half. It gets used 2-5 times per week, more in winter, less in summer. It has worked flawlessly during this period. It gets pretty loud as the water nears fully heated but that is expected. The reason I'm rating it only 3 stars is the the big plastic window in the side kind of negates my purpose in purchasing a stainless steel kettle. Heating water in plastic is not a great idea because the plastic is more likely to leach chemicals into the water when heated. (I don't even like to drink water that has been sitting in plastic at room temp.) If I had it to do over, I might get the Secura kettle my husband bought for home, because it has no plastic at all in the part of the kettle that gets filled with water."
"I needed to replace a smaller older e-kettle. Loved the look, capacity, and design of this model, was not disappointed. I use it 3+ times a day and other family members use it a couple of times a day as well, so it really is getting a work out here. I have zero complaints on its functionality, easy to fill, pour, see the amount left, heats up super fast, auto shut-off (no boiling all the water away and ruining the appliance or worse), and it was red (my preferred color for kitchen appliances ;) ) . So I was a happy tea making camper. Fast forward 6 months and the only thing that has happened is the spring opening lid no longer opens when you press the button. It still functions perfectly but it makes filling/cleaning a little more effort than necessary. Overall happy (would have been a 5 star rating) but wish it would have been 100%working for longer."
"The kettle itself is fine, but not perfect. It’s noisy as it heats up and then it gets very hot to the touch. Warning if you have small kids or sensory issues.But I almost returned it because the product came in its own box. The box itself was quite damaged, ripped and dirty. I assumed the kettle would be damaged as well. I opened the box and the kettle was okay. But seriously, Amazon, have a bit more pride in your products."
"I like this kettle.  It does what it's intended to do, boils water.  The outside of the kettle does get hot, but the handle stays cool.  I would have selected a different one in retrospect because steam comes out of the always open pour spout.  This means that I can't use it under my upper cabinets as planned, I have to pull it out on the counter to prevent long term steam damage. I would definately return it if I still had the box because of this.  It is also difficult to clean inside the pot.  The lid blocks the opening into the kettle so that I can't get my hand inside."
The tea kettle worked fine for a few months then started erupting with water surging and spraying my cabinets.  Can’t use it now.
Not happy about this at all. I have just used this product twice to make tea and it is now not working. Not recommended!
We bought it from Amazon two years ago almost to the day. Used at least once per day. On the side there is a clear plastic window to show the water level in the kettle. We just noticed water is leaking from the bottom of the plastic.
"I had a 10-year old Krups kettle that I had to retire, but it was a sturdy reliable friend. This had good scores on Amazon and Wirecutter... why? This takes twice as long and I can barely get my relatively small hand inside to clean it! In addition, all the little interior grooves and cubbys for the display are very hard to get to. The high rankings confound me. Look for another one that is easier to clean and that can boil faster than a pot on on the stove."
"The product is fine. However, for some reason, Amazon won't deliver this product. I ordered this twice. I never came either time."
"VERY disappointed to see changes to these kettles.UPDATE: STOPPED WORKING JANUARY 22, 2024. PURCHASED JULY 2023....5 MOS. !!MY PREVOIUS VERSION HB ELECTRIC LASTED 10 YEARS.....********""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I had purchased one of these at COSTCO 10 years ago and the water level gauge used to part of the handle. This lasted ABOUT 10 YEARS!....Purchased this model reluctantly because we needed a new one...Mistake! Why?This model is failing already within a few months.The water doesn't completely boil. The power indicator light flickers on and off.And does not switch off when reaching boiling temperature.I was dismayed that this had such a small switch that you push up instead of down to power on....And the water Level indicators are on the sides of the kettle. Who wants all this plastic in our water?I wanted a faster heating unit so compromised by purchasing this one...sorry I did"
"We've used Hamilton Beach product before, so I'm quite surprised at the poor design and quality of this kettle.Note that we use tea bags, not loose tea.Reasons for bad review:1. The max fill level indicates 1.7L; filling to this level results in a LOT of boiling water overflowing.  We found that we had to fill BELOW the 1.5L level to prevent boiling water overflowing.2.  The handle becomes too hot after the tea kettle stops heating the water; not hot enough to cause injury, but definitely too hot.3.  The opening is too small to extract the tea bags by hand; you have to dump the entire contents.  Not a showstopper, but not what we're accustomed to doing.4.  After less than two weeks of use, the lid no longer stays down.  Until this last problem, we had planned on donating the kettle and buying something else.  But now that the lid won't stay down, we'll throw it away.We paid just over $30 for this kettle; not enough to deal with hassles of returning/replacement, but definitely enough to write a review to warn others."
"Things I don't like about this kettle:1. The hideaway cord base feature is misleading. There is no easy way that the cord can be wrapped underneath the base.2. The kettle does not sit flat on the base unless there is water in it to hold it down.3. The water takes longer to boil than my previous kettle.Things I like:The unit does what it's suppose to do: heat water.Summary: This is a very basic kettle and ""ok"" for an economical price."
I loved this electric kettle UNTIL the auto shut off broke only six months after purchase.
"I returned this item. I was trying to replace the discontinued smaller version of this kettle. This size was too large and the handle on this kettle combined with the weight when full makes it so difficult to grip and pour, making it pretty dangerous for me to pour boiled water."
Cleaning is difficult. White substance like powder is always seen after water is heated.
"purchased in dec 2019. Overall, it works fine - it boils water. The auto shut off stopped working after about a year. No big deal if you *always* remember you put the kettle on. I do not always remember. I hate making landfill trash, but it's a safety hazard at this point."
"This little pot was cute and easy to setup, but the use did not match the description. It was corroded after my first use.  It also boiled over after I tried to heat up again after it was completely cold, very dangerous."
I love the color but the cord is unwieldy! It annoys me every day because it’s hard to wrap up. Also annoying that it doesn’t have an auto stop and will just keep on boiling-seems dangerous.
"Our last kettle (also a Hamilton Beach) served us well for almost 15 years, so when it was time for a replacement we figured we’d go for the same brand – mistake.We didn’t even get to filling the kettle with water stage before packing it up for return.1. The handle is woefully unbalanced when empty (I can’t even imagine how difficult this is to hold when full)2. It wobbles on its base, like a crazy amount. The wobble also makes it very confusing to know if you’ve placed the kettle on the base properly3. The materials feel cheap, really a “they don’t make them like they used to” momentReally confused how this product is so highly rated."
"This kettle worked great, but as an older person living alone it really was too big for my needs and counter top. I returned and exchanged it for one that was smaller and am much happier."
"I like most of the features of this kettle but I will be returning it because I can't get past the way it pours.  When it's full, water gushes from the spout no matter how slowly you try to pour.  My wife burned her hand pouring a cup of tea with it for the first time. When it's low, you have to tip the kettle so far that water leaks from under the lid."
I used this kettle once every day and it only lasted 7 months.  It did heat water quickly but I found out that touching any part but the handle resulted in a burn.  Ok but wouldn't buy again.
"The on switch seems to go the wrong direction, but I guess you can get used to that. It is very very slow. I got this to replace an older kettle I have, but after using this one 4 or 5 times, I’m going back to the old one. You could boil water from scratch faster I think. Horrible piece of work idk. Sad really, to think they messed up something so basic."
"A couple of issues I have with it.  The first is that the fine filter is held in place by plastic, so the hot water goes over plastic into your cup.  The other is that when you press the button to open the top, hot water that has condensed on the inside of the lid flows on the outside of the kettle with the potential to burn you.  It would be great if these were not so."
"If all you want is something to boil water, COMFEE is fine. As long as you know how long it will take to boil. The beep when the water has reached desired temperature is not loud. If you're standing next to the kettle, you can hear it but that's it. It's nice that the display shows you the water temperature but it's a red LED against a black background so hard to read. I'll keep it and use a kitchen timer to remind me my hot water should be ready."
"Yes, it heated the water but it’s definitely not boiling or hot enough to make a good cup of tea or soften instant noodles. Huge waste of money"
Very easy to use. But very hard to clean.  Only takes a minute to get hot.
Only 9 months and stop working for no reason
Concerns about plastic leaching into water. Seemed a bit flimsy. Cord did not wrap around bottom creating unsteady function..
"This kettle works well and has a good size. My biggest problem with it is that there is no protection or insulation on the outside so if you accidentally touch it or brush your arm against it, it causes a burn. It would be especially dangerous to use with children around."
"This kettle works great and I’ve been very happy with it for the past year+ I’ve been using it. However, recently the inside coating is flaking off and showing up in the water, so I can no longer use it. We have hard water where I live, which could be the cause but it’s a little disappointing that I’ll have to get a new kettle."
"This was cheap garbage. I used it for a week and loathed it. The mouth doesn't open wide enough to refill unless you are holding it right under the faucet. Difficult to clean with that narrow opening too.  The base is so light, cheap & flimsy it comes up with the kettle when you are pouring.When I put it back in its box to return it I noticed it says right on the box that it's for OCCASIONAL USE ONLY!*  Had I noticed that when it arrived I would have sent straight back unopened. I use my kettle all day every day.It does boil water, so 2 stars for that I guess.*I would have included a pic but I'm not comfortable giving access."
Those dots popped up after one use….i am not sure what they are…
"Use with caution, the stainless steel areas are hot to the touch when the water boils. I have a different brand and that is not the case."
I would give them 5 stars but the lid can't be removed to wash it or to refill it with water.
"I am not enjoying my new upgraded teapot. It is larger than expected & feels “chunky,” & “clunky”. Does not feel “balanced”.  When holding  it your thumb opens the top—- but the top opens very slowly & only half way. That may be good for pouring hot water,  but it is not good for removing all the water when finished using it. I have very hard water & would like to dry the inside after it cools. CAN’T DO! The lid does not open enough to Easily dry the bottom & sides - inside the pot.I would have preferred a sleeker model with a removable lid! I do not leave water sitting in it, but my hard water made a watermark inside - (because I could dry the bottom) - with just a few uses, so I could not return it!"
"I ordered this kettle as my old one hit the dustSturdy, inside is all stainless steel (great!), boils water in a reasonable amount of time depending on how high you fillDrawback: I get burned by water every single time I open the lid to empty the kettle to have remaining heat dry it  ! There’s NO rim to catch the hot water to flow back into the kettle"
"Bought this Nov 2023, then after a few months rush started to develop at the bottom of the kettle. Wish I knew this before purchasing. Too late for return. Glass is always better option."
There are other kettles in the market.  You get what you pay for.
"I like it. But it doesn’t work for everyone in the house. We have some avid tea drinkers and they like being able to boil water at the different temps. This does one setting, boiling hot. Which is fine.. but it takes forever to boil. With my ADHD by the time it finishes I’ve lost all interest in the cup of whatever I was wanting. It got 3 stars from me because if all you want is hot boiling water and want to set and forget about it for 5-8 minutes then it’s great. But I’m not a fan. I want more heat settings and I’m face palming myself for not looking at that before I purchased."
"I compared this to our existing kettle which is a Cosori.  Pros: Quieter.  Cons: Slightly longer to boil; the cord is thin like a lamp cord whereas the Cosori has a thicker three pronged cord; the lid opens by pushing the button on both, but this one felt clunkier and lower quality.  Overall, this Comfee was approximately 10 or 15 dollars cheaper than the Cosori, which is why I chose it because it will not be our main kettle.  I would recommend a better quality kettle for every day use at home, but for a less used kettle it would be fine."
"I gave it 2 stars instead of one because when it worked, it was good. But it only worked fine for months and then started leaking. I purchased it in August and it was leaking by October."
"due to metal , I feel water is having some odour after heating."
I've been loving this pot for my daily tea. But I've only had it 1 month and the automatic shut off stop working! It will boil all of my water out if I don't check it! Just missed the return date by 2 days. 😢
"The product is not insulated well... Water doesn't stay hot for very long. Switch is in the wrong place, will break off easily."
"Boiling hot water steam would drip down along the handle and burns your hand when opening the lid. The under surface of the lid has a flat design and has no place to trap the boiling hot water that has been collected underneath the lid.And since there is no visible way to see how much water there is, unless one opens the lid, the risk to be burned by boiling water is not insignificant.I have owned other Comfee models and they had a lip design that would trap the underneath the lid when open. Unfortunately the flat lid design of this model, while modern looking, is a complete failure."
"It does a great job at heating water to a boil in a respectable amount of time. The drawbacks for me are how very loud it is and how hot the exterior gets. Seriously, if you touch the outside of the kettle even after a half hour of using it you WILL burn yourself. If your in an environment where these things aren't a problem then it's a solid find for the price."
"Just felt cheaper, but it works."
"Worked well until it died 10 months later.  Company warranty requires prepaid postage, which will cost about the same as buying a new one."
Nothing much to add. The only benefit is that there is a full metal option with no plastic. But it doesn't auto shut off.
"This is used to boil hot water, but it is very busy and the heat is not enough. It is very hot outside and can easily burn your hands. It does not feel very useful and the water is not kept warm. I am not very satisfied with it."
"This is not as advertised. It is not cordless and there is no way to charge that I've found. The one I got was obviously used though I ordered brand new. It does boil water quickly and is fairly quiet, but it's not what I thought I was ordering so I'll return and buy elsewhere"
"I had one in glass before this one. Do not like this one compared to the glass one. 1st when you pour the hot water out, if your hand is not very low on the handle you get burnt . 2nd You can’t tell when it needs cleaned because you can not see into the water. 3rd The spout on the end does not clean when I do A vinegar wash. ( my glass one the spout cleaned when I pored the vinegar out ) 4 th When you take it off the base with it still heating it will not shut off unless you push the one-off lever. A lot of times I pour the water before it clicks off. When I did this with my glass one it was off and did not come back on when returning it to the base, I like my water to be very hot so I will leave the lid open so it boils A little longer. One positive is it heats up faster than my glass model.Adding to my original review. Was burnt again today on this unit. This is not A safe unit to use. Do not have this in your home if you have small children."
Rust formed within two weeks of use
Low Quality Kettle.
Cheap. Heats up. Crapshoot if it dies.
Good design but not stable. it wobbles a lot. would recommend buying a heavier kettle that has a solid base
"While the outside and inside walls are stainless steel, the inside bottom is not and will eventually rust.  Easy test is to take a magnet to all the steel parts.  If it does NOT stick/attract then it IS stainless steel.  If it DOES stick/attract then it is NOT good stainless steel."
Works fine as a kettle. Only thing is that the outside gets too hot (you burn yourself if you touch it after boiling water).
Problem was with the lid leaking steam that it would not turn off automatically. Hope no one else has this problem as otherwise it worked well.
"The kettle is as described, works well, looks pretty, good capacity. However, we have been using it for two weeks and the lid already broke. I tried to glue it back but there is a broken piece missing so the lid doesn't snap back on."
I have had other kettles and they were not as noisy and the outside of the kettle is HOT to the touch.I bought this to match my new kitchen but I should’ve kept my other one for better functionality.
"I'm very disappointed in this kettle. I've never really loved it because my initial thought upon purchasing how loud it was and it also takes longer to boil. However, I just couldn't be bothered to return.  I had a different  brand for a few yrs but gave it up only because it was very small, it never rusted. I wanted a larger size and went with this brand based on the reviews. I was shocked to see it forming rust spots as you can see in photos. Please take a look on the inside if you own this brand because I only just discovered this today after inspecting inside. It's not durable"
"The pot works well as far as boiling water. However, the outside remains hot for a very long time .  It could be dangerous if someone forgets even though it’s unplugged it’s still very hot."
"So, I have a different Tea Kettle.  Once that one starts boiling and you pour your first cup, the unit stays HOT for up to 2 hours.  THIS ONE DOES NOT.  Once this one reaches correct temperature, THEN you take your first hot cup of water then come back 20 minutes later, you have to RE PUSH on switch to start heating up remaining water in unit.  I probably will return and get the other one?"
"After a month use, lid does not close properly and because of that it does not automatically turn off when heated"
"I liked this coffee maker enough to keep it but wasn’t thrilled. We had a different brand, same style that was better but I thought I’d try a different brand with great ratings when we had to replace the old one. The button to open the lid is stiff on this new one. I dealt with that. This morning I went to turn on the coffee pot, nothing. Checked the outlet, the cord, the base, contacts…all intact. Switched outlets to a completely different wall. Still wouldn’t work. The site to order replacement parts uses “cookies” without the option to decline any part. I called their number and it kept going in a loop without actually reaching anyone.  I would not recommend this brand.  I’m breaking out our camping French Press until a new and different brand arrives."
I’m a little concerned this could be a fire hazard. As soon as I plugged it in it started getting hot without even pushing the little button to start it. Seems it needs to be unplugged when not it use vs being able to be plugged in but off. It’s not a huge deal but I want a kettle I can just leave on the counter and turn on when I need to.
It is very loud
"This kettle functions fine - boils quickly and does the job. However - one reason I got this one when our glass one died was the ""insulation"" that it boasts, to keep the water warm longer. First of all, aluminum is NOT an insulative material. Second of all, that's all it is - thin walled aluminum with zero ""insulation"" at all. The last glass one kept the water hot much longer! I will not buy this again because of that, when it dies. Otherwise, functions fine, but that's a feature that matters in my family!"
This kettle is dangerous as it get so hot if you should touch the outer side of the kettle.  It is very noisy and takes a long time to boil
This kettle is so loud when it’s boiling that you can’t even hear yourself think?  Not sure if it was just the unit I had or if it’s all of them like this. I returned it.
"I purchased this kettle in September, initially I didn’t like that the lid doesn’t open far enough so it’s slightly irritating to get the water into it but for the price of the kettle, I didn’t care too much about that. It is now November and the auto shut off has stopped working so it continues to boil forever which overheats the wiring and is a fire hazard. Be careful!!"
It has become louder than it was originally and I also dislike that it doesn’t have a temperature control adjustment.
"So this pot heats up quicker than my previous one however the rate limiting issue is they put all the Control buttons on the handle, in order to pick up the handle to pour you can't help but press other buttons Which is problematic when you want to keep the heat button on or the specific temperature you've chosen.Bad design it's going back"
I cut my finger removing the product from the box. Extremely sharp pouring spout!Spent my work day in the ER because I take aspirin and could not get it to stop bleeding.Lost a days pay. This item is poorly designed and  is dangerous! DO NOT BUY!
"No longer works, lasted 4 months. Very disappointed"
"This kettle was working fine for a month or two, but it began to trip the circuit breaker on my house every time I used it, cutting off my houses power. Probably a shorted hearing element. Based on this experience, I do not recommend this product."
I have had this tea kettle for 4 months. It works fine so far. I don't leave water sitting in and it's already stained inside. I have super clean water that does not leave stains or residue on anything else in our house. Is it rusting already?! big disappointment.
Durability-0The auto off switch stopped working at 3 months. And the lid won't close anymore. Spend the extra $ for a product that lasts
"This boiler was only used a couple of times, and it generated a short circuit in my house. It is a hazardous product because the electrical short circuit damaged my air fryer, and it could have been worse. I'm returning it and do not recommend buying it. The plug is not grounded; I think that has something to do with it."
"Boiled water just fine.  But so so incredibly loud.  So loud that while the water is boiling sounds like a very loud engine almost like a jet flying overhead.  My husband who was upstairs in the master bedroom actually came downstairs asking what the heck that noise was, a plane?  Lol.  No way I could it keep it since our kitchen is next to the TV viewing room.  Also, the pot itself is very flimsy a cheap metal not solid.  Maybe that’s why it’s so noisy just cheap materials.  RETURNED!!!!"
"It is not working properly. After I put water and turn it on it satrted to boil and it never turn itself off. I think the one they send me has issue, not working properly"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            At the first, Light is not turned on. So It is a little bit uncomfortable. But technically working so I will use it. U.U"
Get what you pay for.  Not even 2 yrs and already leaking from the bottom.  Counters get flooded.
"hard to get the camera down it there. Do not know if it is a poorly used return. We washed and dried it, those are not water spots. Yes, Stainless steel will corrode if treated poorly. Returning this kettle. Can not address its function or longevity, though corrosion in a brand new item does encourge me.Support, what little exposure I had to it, seems rather lame. They clearly do not read what you tell them, based on the questions they asked in response to my initial complaint. When I answered their email pointing out some the requested info they already had, I also informed them I was returning the item. Their answer to that? We are happy we were able to assist you. HA!!! I have purchased a replacement kettle, NOT from Comfee. It is a name I will not forgot as I contemplate future purchases."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The auto shut off function stopped working after a week. The water will remains boiling until I shut the kettle off manually. Contacted with COMFEE official customer service and being told there is no RMA or anything can be provided even it's under ""one year warranty"". Just FUNNY and RIDICULOUS that something won't help at all can be called as ""warranty"" after product defective being found by customers.SAVE YOUR MONEY, TIME AND GO WITH OTHERS!!!"
"regardless of the auto shutoff not working after 1 month of use, i still love this kettle. i just need to manually shut it off once at rapid boil. cleaning is easy, rubbing inside surface with a paper towel works well."
"Great water heater. It boils the full 1.6L very fast...Only issue was that I assumed that it was an insulated water heater & when I grabbed the body of the container instead of the handle to move it around, it ended up burning my hands.This is literally a pot of boiling water in cup form. You can't touch anything else besides the plastic handle during/after the boiling has just finished. Beware the non-insulated stainless steel body of fire"
"I don't know what's wrong with mine - even though it says fast boiling and 1500W, it takes forever to boil my water. It's also extremely loud which creates a disturbance in my entire living room. I didn't realize this wasn't normal until couple of guests pointed it out. Hoping to receive a resolution with the company. Meanwhile, I would skip on this for sure."
"Are you serious? It was 13,280 stars on this product! Hey people stop lying. I just opened the box and saw the kettle was used before. The bottom is badly rubbed, see photos! Before I tried to boil water, it doesn’t boil fast enough. Sorry, returning, not recommending."
"Generally alright, but don't expect much, given the price.Pros:- rather fast- big opening at the top for easy filling- sounds like a freight train and your favorite iron when it's warming up- little light in the switch is convenient- plastic + metal mesh filter is removableCons:- it gets very hot on the outside, unlike some other insulated kettles, watch your fingers for accidental touches- the stand is very, very flimsy. Kettle rotates on it super-easily and everything feels like it'll have connection problems soon- awkwardly placed plastic ""on"" switch ""stick"" at the bottom is awkward- top is plastic (so if someone is sensitive about plastic touching their boiling water -- it'll condense on the cover and fall back down, so you're out of luck)"
Got this on a prime deal. Worked great for a month or so before then automatic turn off stopped working. Now the heat and steam make them handle too hot and smells like plastic. Too late to return for refund.
Stopped working after 1 month.  Hardly used and then just no power.  My daughter has a different brand that has been working for years.  This product is a big disappointment.  Now I have to buy another one.
I was going to give one star but the fact that this kettle will rust after 8 months and the company will not replace it under a 12 month warranty. BEWERE I do not recommend to buy this brand
"It works great, it is just super loud when heating up. Had I known that I would have gone a different direction. Everything else is great, looks good, heats great, its just loud - not good for a home office set up."
Works fine but easy to burn yourself as there's no insulation between boiling water and the thin stainless steel sides so be careful!
"Not a good quality, the cover broke after two mounts and wasn't closing. I contacted customer service and even tried to contact them through Amazon customer service but we got no response. not happy"
"Basic kettle, simple and easy to use. Love the auto shut off feature and base. Wish the cord was longer, maybe 18-24 in cord. Makes things difficult if you don't have access to counter top plug. The cord would not reach from table-top to plug in wall. Only gripe, but not an issue for me. Could be a big issue for others. Buyer beware, other than that, the unit works as it should with no issues. Very cheap and thin metal, but the construction seems fine. Would let unit cool down, if doing two boils back to back."
"I loved this kettle until this morning it was on fire! I was doing my routine boil in the morning. Left the kitchen for three minutes, the kettle was on fire. It was surely a scary moment! We were able to put off the fire but the surface where the kettle sit was ruined and the house is full of smoke.Please don’t leave it unattended when it’s in use!!!"
"Even after washing and discarding the first several boiled kettle of water, there was still a very heavy metallic taste. I tried cleaning the kettle with vinegar, and it got better, but there's still a lingering taste that makes me gag, rendering this unusable. Very likely NOT food grade stainless steel."
"Kettle is advertised to have a steel filter, but it has ordinary plastic filter.Plastic filters usually break within couple of months."
boiled several pots of water but still getting a strong metallic smell/taste in the water. kettle is fine otherwise but i can't overlook this and have to return.
makes loud noise when you boil your tea
There is no temperature control.  That's idiotic.  Many teas and coffees don't need boiling hot water. I don't want to have to keep checking the temperature of the water before brewing. I'll keep it as a backup but will probably never use it.
Bought 2 of these. Same issue. They start leaking along the bottom edge.
"I was shocked to see that this product is not grounded! Do not be fooled by its small size. At 1500w, this thing is probably more powerful than your microwave.There is no way I am using this thing, especially considering that it holds water and, therefore, has an increased risk of electrocution if there is a spill!"
"After only a month, the lid of the kettle won't close, so it can't turn off the heat on its own, which is dangerous"
"The aluminum body of this electric kettle gets very very hot, so you have to be careful to touch only the handle. However, it’s quick, efficient, and turns itself off when the water boils. Very reasonably priced, but definitely a higher risk product to have in your kitchen if you have kids, pets who jump on counters etc."
"Good points: it gets hot reasonably quickly; it's convenient.Glad point:  there's no temperature range control...either tap water or boiling....nothing in between.  In retrospect I wouldn't buy it again.  I thought I was replacing one with at temp control dial, but was wrong. Never again.  It's worth the extra $$ to get the ones that adjust."
As the title suggests the kettle does a good job of boiling water in good time but it's noisy while doing so. It either rumbles or whistles or both during the heating phase.I got it because the opening was large enough for cleaning by hand or brush.
Nozzle is just glued onto the body. Fell off within two years of using.
"Advertised as 1500W, but is only 1250W max. I tested when filled to max capacity and directly plugged into an outlet measured with a Killawatt. It never went above 1250W, while my other 1500W kettles get to 1450+W."
This kettle delivered black water despite multiple washing. It cannot be safe!
"Very cheaply made. It was leaking within nine months, and I had to throw it out. I don't understand all of the high ratings."
Price was good but it is a cheap looking product that i dont want on my counter. Ill keep looking. i have no idea if it works or how  long it will work for or if it leaks. the window up the side has ne guessing it could leak from this area like my old one did.
"At first, it worked out well, but after some days, It didn't. As it has a warranty, I contacted the seller and they issued a refund for that. Maybe it was a faulty unit."
"The plastic view window is in contact with the water, which obviously gets heated up along with the water. There have been countless studies on the horrible effects from consuming heated micro plastics."
Great when not boiling over and making a mess on my counter
"I'm sick of products that are made with only right-handed people in mind, and this is just one more example. The water level reader is only visible if it's turned the way a right-handed person would pick it up? Does this make the kettle work any less well? No. Is it obnoxious? Yes."
"The switch doesn't automatically turn off when you take the kettle off its base, so if you take it off when the water is almost boiling but not quite, and forgot to turn off the switch yourself, it resumes heating. When it's heating with very little to no water, it doesn't notice that it's hot and just keeps on working. Also, the switch is quite sensitive and in an outward-facing placement, so you might accidentally switch it on when moving around in the kitchen."
Doesn’t stay hot for long I like my coffee very hot this does not do that
"Wanted to love this kettle but after only 3 months we noticed what I thought was loose tea from a broken bag. When it appeared again a day later after having been wiped out, I quickly realized that it was metal fragments from somewhere under the heating plate that were somehow getting into the kettle.When I bought the kettle I completed the info to receive a 1-year warranty. So today, I reached out to the manufacturer via chat. Over the course of about 90 minutes (yes, 90 minutes!) they tried to blame the fragments it on water quality/ hard water / build up and ultimately suggested I use vinegar to remove any build up. There was no build up because 1. we have a whole house filter and only use reverse osmosis water in the kettle, 2. I regularly cleaned the kettle with vinegar, 3. We don't have hard water - I've had it tested. We wipe the kettle out on a regular basis AND isn't build up from water usually white, not reddish brown.Next they repeatedly told me that their customer support only provides replacement parts and troubleshooting help but is not for warranty service. Then they informed me that since the kettle was sold by Amazon Services, they are responsible for honoring the 1-year warranty. Sounded like BS but I did as they asked and called Amazon who then called the manufacturer and confirmed that the manufacturer, MegaWise is responsible for warranty service. Amazon only covers the first 30 days. The Amazon rep tried to connected me with the rep at MegaWise and when Amazon disconnected the call, so did the MegaWise rep. Meanwhile, I still had the chat open from MegaWise customer support - the one who told me Amazon was responsible, so I filled her in on what happened and she reluctantly offered a one-time replacement. At that point, I was on my second call to Amazon. The Amazon rep, after hearing what I'd done to try and resolve the issue, immediately offered me a refund and apologized for the ridiculous inconvenience. At that point I declined the offer of a ""one-time replacement"" from the Live Chat rep at MegaWise and mentioned that I'd be sure to leave a detailed review of my experience with both the product and customer service.Check out the pictures, the kettle has a big design and or manufacturing flaw that doesn't properly seal the glass and metal together. The water gets trapped in the metal base of the kettle  causing it to corrode and allowing metal flakes back into the kettle each time it boils. Dangerous.And why would you buy anything from a company that boast a 1-year warranty they never had any intention of honoring. They claim they ""want you to be happy"" It's even printed on the bottom edge of the kettle. However, it took me 90 minutes of live chat, and two calls to Amazon to get this resolved.Don't just stay away from this kettle, stay away from the company!"
Popped after two minutes. Replacement being sent. We have a unit exactly like this that works very well after two months.
"I owned several electric kettles in the past, so I know what is good - this one is ok, not superb.  For the price I think I could have found a better one. It takes a while to reach boiling point and takes a while too before it shuts after boiling. Am I happy with my purchase, its ok as spare but not for daily use."
"This kettle was great in that it heats water so quickly, I’d say  little under 2 minutes. It also has this cool blue light that turns on when it’s heating up the water, once it’s done it’ll turn off on its own. I’d give the performance a 9/10. However I can’t give this product 5 stars because after only 3 weeks the inside of the kettle is already rusted and I can count how many times I’ve used it on 1 hand. I’m nervous about continuing to use it if it’s already rusty."
"I've used this kettle every day for over 2 years. It has served me pretty well. But today, it has died. Just refuses to turn on. I am devastated and bereft. And going to buy a different brand that will hopefully last longer"
"I've had this kettle for about 3 years and we use it lots of times daily.  The kettle looks and works great, and is pretty durable.  However, after 3 years of constant use, the lid won't close all the way down, and as a result the kettle won't turn off on its own (since it seems to be some kind of pressure sensor to detect if its boiling).  So YMMV but if you're looking for a durability review, here's one data point."
"Broke within a year. It works fine, gets water boiling very quick. The issue is that it didn't last as long as I wanted it to. While I did manage to get it repaired, it just shows this wasn't built to last. Not good value for money."
"I like the look of This electric kettle, That was also indicated to be energy-friendly. So I ordered two, One for home and one for work. It took a little time to arrive about a week. I was largely okay with that. I wasn’t in any rush, per se. However, the handle of one of the kettles has a piece missing out of it. I was very disappointed to see this damage, as it was presumably new out of the box. So, durability does not appear to be the best.I am not sure how the company will respond? The other kettle appears to be intact/fine. At the moment, I am roughly 50% pleased, 50% disappointed regarding this purchase."
Idk if there’s a sensor or something but it takes 1-2 extra minutes after the water is boiling…like really going at it. Eventually it does turn off.
"I purchased this as a replacement for my kettle that  stopped working. This kettle gets the job done. However, I don’t like the quality of the glass. It seems thin, but that explains the $20 price. Also, I prefer a strainer at the spout; but the area where the water pours out is open."
"Would not recommend this product. Looks nice, but broke as soon as warranty expired! The company will not replace. This kettle started leaking after 1 year of using. A waste of money. Our previous kettle(different brand) lasted about 9 years."
"It’s okay, but a bit too loud. I mean it doesn’t its job, but I would not say it has the best quality."
"Nice sleek design with tempered glass and easy buttons to start and stop.  It does take quite a while for it to boil or even get hot enough just for tea at the 1 L mark. Then when it does boil it boils for quite a while, so I wouldn’t say the safety is the best if you have small or curious children who may reach for it before it turns off."
The company doesn't have a warranty longer than the 30 day Amazon return policy.  I bought this as a used like new and tested it when I got it.  Everything seemed to work.  I tried it out a few months after as my 7 year old Kettle is beginning to fail.  Half full water is boiling almost out of the kettle and a clicking noise but no instant shut off.  I turned it off at the switch which had steam escaping from the top.  Noticed a electrical smell too.  Wish I never bought it and now it's too late to send back.  It wasn't a deal but a steal.  Zero stars and five thumbs down...
"At first I liked it...well, sort of. I was disappointed that it did not have a ""keep warm"" feature, also that the lid was not removable. I did like the larger capacity of 1.8 liters & that it heated the water quite quickly.But after a few days/uses I noticed some drip marks down lower edge between the glass container & onto  the metal heating part. I didn't think to take pics at the time & I've already returned it.  Then a couple days later I'd heated some water in mid-morning,(water filled to only the 1.5 liter level), then was busy around the house. Later I returned to the kitchen to discover water all over the counter top. Luckily our counter tops have a very slight slant toward the backsplash, so the any liquid accumulation runs there, rather than over the edge&  onto the floor.  And it was then I looked at this electric kettle....& there was only about 1/2 inch of water left in the very bottom of the kettle!  YIKES!So even tho several highlighted the company's excellent customer service, I was not interested in a replacement.."
"I bought this in April 2021 and it's broken by March 2023. I think a kettle should last at least 5 years.UPDATE August 2023: The company contacted me on their own and sent me a new kettle, which they said has an improved design.I've had it a week and so far it seems great. I like it way more than the kettle I replaced it with. This one is larger (than the one I bought from another company), heats up faster, and is easier to fill because the lid stays up and out of the way while you fill it. I agree with others that it's easy to accidentally leave it on. Idk about durability yet, but unless you see another update from me saying it didn't last, you can assume I'm still happily using it.Btw, I think the ""free gift"" people are saying they didn't receive is actually the pink sponge on a handle to clean the kettle with. Not sure everyone's realizing that that's the gift. I personally don't like it when manufacturers add stuff that I didn't order — it just adds clutter that I need to deal with — but this sponge is pretty handy. I remember from my first purchase that you can't press on it too hard, though. It's not for heavy-duty cleaning."
I love everything about this product except how long it takes. It is not a fast boil. The slowest one I've ever had actually. It took 9 minutes at 3/4 full
"The quality of the MegaWise electric kettle seemed pretty good, although the glass did seem fairly thin.  However, my biggest issue with it is that it took much longer than I expected to boil water.  After it cooled, I turned over both the kettle and the base that plugs into the wall.  Both state 1000 watts, NOT 1500 watts!  The box itself does not say the wattage, but the title of the product states 1500 watts, as does the description and tech specs!  Please see photos, which clearly show the 1000W and the CX-817 product number.  Apparently, they have also been having some issues with returns (I wonder why?), as their instruction booklet states ""Sometimes Amazon might have repackaged returned units as new.  If you purchased a new unit but received the product used, please contact MegaWise Live Chat support.""  I did not contact MegaWise as they cannot ""fix"" a product that doesn't have the specs they advertise.  I returned it a week and a half ago and made sure Amazon knew that it was used and that it did not match the product description, but the description still falsely states 1500 watts!"
"After using this for 5 days, the light in it popped the breaker and burnt out. But does heat water okay, for now."
I opened it but did not use it. There is a silicone ring inside the bottom that comes in contact with the water. I have sensitivities and It was not listed on the materials. Returned it.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Purchased this for my father so that he could turn on and forget it (unlike boiling water on the stovetop) but it does not shut off and the handle gets so hot that I can’t even take it off the base. I’ve trouble shooter it several times now but the blue light will not turn off as long as the kettle is plugged into an outlet.  I’ve had my electric water boiler (a different maker) for 6 plus years and it’s been amazing so this is definitely not normal wear and tear. This product does not reflect all the reviews and videos posted.
I bought this because while moving I broke the previous one that I had. Not sure if it was the same brand because it was a gift. Just started using this one and it’s so LOUD. The other one I had was no way this loud. As the water heats up it gets quieter. Not sure if it is a defect. Other than that it is good. The Loudness is a blower for me.
looks like not using quality stainless steel that's why rust builds up at bottom.
The LED light has already died RIP
If this wasn’t the second one I owned I would’ve given it one star. We recently moved and left our first kettle with my in laws and bought ourself a new one. I plugged it in and walked out it the kitchen. Came back a minute later to a horrible plastic smell. I unplugged the kettle and picked it up from the base and the kettle had melted to the base. I could see the wires inside the kettle part. I purposely bought the same brand we had used before so I knew it was reliable. This must be a a one off bc I didn’t see any reviews with this happening to anyone else. I cant ask for a refund yet because my full order hasn’t come in yet but I’m hoping they give me a refund or replacement.
"Work beautifully for 9 months and then the switch failed. After initially having some trouble with providing C.S. with needed photos and videos of the problem, I tried again today and was successful. I spoke with Manny at Magawise Support and he was understanding, professional, and competent. I again sent the requested photos and he provided me with a replacement. Based on this interaction I would give Magawise C.S. 5 Stars."
"The ""Manual"" that came with the product said on the first page that if you register within a week of delivery, you get a 5 year Warranty. I took a picture of the QR Code with my phone but it took me to FB Messenger for Megawise, that is all. When I went to the website listed in the booklet, I registered online & it said I get 1-year additional Warranty ...that's all! I don't even know what the original warranty is, but it isn't what they promised.They also promised a Free Gift, which I wasn't truly interested in but was curious. Total SCAM. Nothing about a Gift.Just now I clicked on Customer Support & Nicco answered but when I listed my concerns, he exited the Chat. Very Rude!With this kind of behavior on behalf of the Company, once wonders just what kind of business this really is. I know that the Chinese have a different culture than we do, but it is NOT ok to lie to people and then act like you never said it in the first place.The Manual is terrible, by the way. There is no detail on cleaning other than to ""wipe the outside with a damp cloth."" Seriously??? Then there are pages on troubleshooting problems. That implies to me that there WILL BE PROBLEMS.This is supposed to be a simple, straight-forward product, but there isn't even information about de-scaling. I didn't think I wouldn need it this soon, only 5 days after it was delivered and maybe 5 times I've used it. Already I see little spots on the metal at the bottom, I'm thinking it's hard water stains. Our water isn't even very hard."
"FIRE HAZARD. DO NOT BUY! Used it three times and the cord melted and burned the outlet, wiring and electrical box in the wall. Could've burned down our house. Contacted the seller, told them & they just said contact Amazon for a return/refund. Didn't have the box and outside return window. Had to call an electrician and that set me back more than $200 for a $20 kettle. You get what you pay for or in this case a whole more than you bargained for. Never heard back from the seller which told me they were looking into it.  MegaWize is Mega horrible!  DANGER!!"
No way this kettle is not 1 kW !!! I've  waited 10 minutes for water to boil.Then I checked watt-meter and says ~ 300 watt when plugged kettle in.
After using for a few months pot shattered while we were heating it. Would not replace with this one again.
"the product arrived, but it doesn't work well when the water heats up, the off button doesn't work"
"I had another glass kettle since 2020 and after it dropped and shattered I purchased this as a replacement. Unfortunately the light already stopped working but while moving it I saw the light flash and believe the power cord may be the issue. The kettle's base has always had its spot in the kitchen and never gets moved around, the power cord connecting to that base decided to stop working randomly."
"I received my teapot and when I turned it on, it’s blue light was broken. Not only that, but the switch would not turn off when the tea is done. It just keeps boiling until I manually turn it off. I am getting a replacement, but it’s going to take long. I ordered it online to get it quickly, and now I have to go back and waste time to return it. I’m very unhappy with my purchase - they should have inspected the kettle before sending it out to me with two different flaws."
I purchased this because my other kettle of another brand had broken down after two years. So I’m kind of comparing this to my older kettle. This kettle is super light. Feels like it would break if I hit it too hard on the tap. Also the stream comes out from the power button and all sides of the lid not just the pourer. Which I found strange. It also had an initial smell when I started using it. Other than that… it keeps water hot after a while after boiling.
"I would not buy this. Unfortunately the flaking began literally a could have days after the return window had closed. I will contact Amazon as this is a health hazard, refund or not."
"This kettle is easy to use and clean and has not broken on me but this morning (5am) I noticed a major fire hazard flaw. If you pick up the kettle before it auto “clicks off” / FULLY boils, and put it back on the base, it will continue to boil, apparently without stopping.I used all the hot water I had boiling last night before the kettle switched itself off, the kettle was empty, and it continued “boiling” all night because the switch never switched off. I noticed early this morning in my dark studio that the blue light on it was turning on. I went to investigate to realize it was “boiling” all night and the base was very hot. So glad I noticed before I also left to work for the day with my kitty alone.Now I miss the less attractive steel kettles with the flip switch at the base to turn on/off. The moment you pick those up, the switch shuts off. Throwing this kettle away, sadly. I don’t trust it."
"I really enjoyed the speed that this hot heat up water. However, some water ran down the outside, not underneath just on top, and now the LED lights don’t work. There is also a black liquid that drips out from under the band around the base. The part still works, however I am doubtful it will last."
After a month or so lid does not snug in place and boiling water does not stop automatically. Worst functioning as you have to watch to stop it.
"Product was awesome, led lights when warming up water, quickly boils the water & very easy to use. Cleaning is a bit of a hassle. Had to return it because after 2 uses it begun to buildup white like stains at the bottom of the kettle’s interior."
"First of all when filled together top it's really heavy. I have used this sort of water heater for years this one is very noisy, it's annoying.I really should have exchanged it!"
"It is a great kettle, the only thing I would change is where the on/off button is placed. It is where you would naturally place your hand to pick up the kettle. But that is a personal preference thing and would not remove any stars. Love the way it looks!UPDATE: after a couple months of use, started to give a weird plasticky smell and taste in water. Washed it and ran with vinegar to try to clean it. Nothing helped and had to toss it."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I am writing this to serve as a warning to others who are thinking of doing business with MegaWise. Stay very far away. I recently purchased the electric kettle for my mother. Upon receipt of the “brand-new” item, I noticed a great deal of water spots. Not wanting to go through the trouble of returning it, I washed it and it seemed fine. A minor side note to this is that I was supposed to receive a free gift with purchase. I did not. After three short weeks, I noticed some rust spots and decided to contact MegaWise. At the same time, I mentioned the missing gift. They provided cleaning instructions as well as the offer of a gift card. I followed the cleaning instructions, and it seemed to work. As for the gift card, they never followed through. I had to contact them again and they finally sent it.The rusting returned a short 2-3 months later. I felt this was unsafe and unsanitary for my elderly mother. So, I contacted MegaWise again. They offered to send me a replacement. I contacted them after a week to inquire about the shipping status of the replacement. They have not responded. It’s been about two weeks now. I have no confidence that I will ever hear from them."
"This kettle is very easy to use and it boils water quickly. My only complaint and the reason I returned it was that after the very first use it began corroding. I do not have any problems with hard water either. If it weren’t for that, I’d have kept it in a heartbeat."
"I really liked this kettle, but expect it to last longer than 1 1/2 years. I Unfortunately, after about 18 months, the electric element burned out. This kettle was used to heat water once or twice a day."
"I searched far and wide for a glass kettle so that I would not be consuming water that was boiled in plastic. This kettle is well constructed with glass and metal where the water is contained but the glass seems cheap and the kettle smells strongly of plastic when the water is boiled for too long, possibly from the steam touching the plastic top of the lid?  Otherwise, the kettle boils water fast and is affordable and I have had no problems with rust. The lights are also a nice touch"
"Everything was good the first couple of weeks and suddenly it started to be super noisy when heating, you can't hear anything else than the kettle, really annoying. Of course return window has passed and can't get my money back."
"We use this product sparingly, didn't last very long jar cracked this morning spilling water on counter"
"I hardly ever use it and didn't notice the first time that it leaks. Now that I have decided to return, the return date just closed. I'm going to see if I could contact the seller directly. Would not recommend."
"Was such a waste of my time and fuel to buy this piece of junk and drove to UPS to return this garbage.Every time you boiled water, it will overflow all over. I returned it and brought something different, and I’m so pleased."
"The kettle heats up great, however, the light only seems to work 10% of the time. I was reallylooking forward to a visual clue that the water is done from the other room, but since it almost never comes on I have to stay in the kitchen to keep an eye on it. My intention was to switch out the noise of a stovetop kettle for the lighting indicator of this electric one. Bummer.Update—to say the light works 10% of the time is now a little too generous. It stopped working altogether and I’ve only used it a few times. Truly disappointing."
"Just recieved today 7/3/24. Not a sure how this kettle would have worked for me because it is used, so i will be packing it back up immediately to return it. So disappointing"
"Takes longer to heat up than advertised if full but does work well. Unfortunately it only lasted 6 months as part of the lid (the part that holds the lid on) broke so it won't close. It was also little hard to lift one handed and no ""cool spots"" on other side to be able to use both hands to steady it."
Bought in JulyStopped working in 5 October!Waisted money!
Started leaking within months of use
"Disaster , while it was boiling the lidd came off , not even a month i have been using"
"Loved this kettle and used it daily for about 6 months.  That is when the glass broke while I was washing it.  It wasn't hot and I wasn't aggressive, just using the dish brush on the inside like I've done countless times and heard a cracking sound.  Disappointed that it didn't hold up better."
"After using this product 1-2 times a day, after less than two months it just stopped turning on. I tried changing outlets, resetting my outlets, checking/cleaning the base and the pot for debris that could potentially interrupt connection, but nothing I did could make the pot turn on.Megawise contacted me and sent a replacement, however it also did not hold up more than two months or so before it no longer turned on. I wrote my initial review in July of 2021 - it is now November of 2022 and the company has sent me incessant monthly emails begging for me to change my Amazon review. I have moved their emails to spam, blocked the email address, however their nonstop messages continue. I will not be changing my review - especially after a year and a half of harassment from the company to do so. Save yourself the hassle and do not purchase from this company."
Broke down next day
"I read a lot of reviews before buying the kettle and I even saw the pictures people posted about the residue. I was very skeptical  but decided to give it a chance. Within  two days of using it this  disgusting residue was at the bottom. I was going to return it within the 30 day window, but life caught up and I forgot.  I regret this purchase, and I wish I could’ve just returned it the same week I received it. Nothing will get rid of this residue."
Looks good and heats the water BUT it just doesn't stay hot for very long. I like go to go back and fill my tea cup and typically it needs to be re-heated before i can do so after even just 30 min.
"I absolutely loved this electric kettle! It heated up super fast and the blue lights were a nice touch. However, after a little more than 6 months of use, the bottom part started melting and you can see the wires inside which seems like a hazard."
I bought this less than 3 months ago. The top hinge has popped out and no longer opens with the button. Lame
Disliked the whistle which you cannot hear in the next room.
I have tried using filtered water in the kettle because I thought it would make easiest for cleaning but bacteria collects really quickly. The bottom turns a pale white color and it makes it hard to clean because you really have to scrub.
The product broke down in 2 months.
Perfect
"Hello, I was very excited to try this product, however, it was received with a broken handle. I will exchange it and look forward to using the product."
"I cleaned it twice like the instructions said, and now after my official first cup of tea, I noticed the spots on the metal part. I washed it and used the sponge that comes with it, but still the rust spots remain. I can’t believe I’ve only used it once officially and it already had many spots. I will return it"
It frequently does not turn of when placed on a plugged plate. One has to move it and push to find right position.
"This kettle is very slow to heat - 1.5 minutes longer than Breville (9.5 vs. 8 minutes for 1.7L, and it took longer to turn off once boiling (1.5 minutes longer). It doesn't turn off if you lift the kettle mid cycle. It doesn't have a heating element all the way around the bottom (maybe this accounts for the slow boil).  It doesn't have a filter (which I knew when purchasing it), it overboils the spout when it's full, and it smells as it is heating up. The only redeeming feature is that it holds 1.8L and the blue glow is nice.  We have several kettles including the Breville 1.7L, the Hamilton Beach large and small glass.  They are all superior for my purposes."
"Received the kettle today, and when I opened the Amazon box this is what I was sent. In opening the damaged box, the kettle seems to be in one piece. I will give it a try tomorrow. I didn’t order this particular one for a gift, but had I, how’d I gift it?Shut off doesn’t work. Sending back. I will say it boiled the water very fast though."
"Looks nice, design seems solid, but... First, I filled it at the max level of 1.8 Liters with cold filtered tap water.  10 min and 52 seconds to Boil.  Next i did the same thing but also put my gas stove kettle on at exactly the same time.  It only beat it by 10 seconds. this time, 11 min, 05 sec.I want a kettle that beats the stove. This one is not it. Also very loud."
The kettle abruptly stopped turning on 5 days after the return window closed. I had used it a total of 4 times.I tried all of the troubleshooting with no luck. Now I’m stuck with a non-functioning kettle. Very disappointing.
"Extremely disappointed. It’s falsely advertised to be 1500 watt. In actuality it’s 1200 watt. I could’ve gotten something much cheaper for other 1200 watt kettles. The only reason i ordered it is because of the 1500 watt advertisement.It’s poorly made with cheap plastic. The finish is not good. The glass is thinner than my last kettle (2.5 years old, still works. Only replacing due to scratch on the lid from regular use).DO BETTER AMAZON. These false advertisements should be vetted and fined!!!"
"Why there's no ZERO or MINUS star??Bought this item was ONLY because the description says, ""this electric tea kettle can help you quickly boil your water in the busy morning in less than 3 minutes. This process is quicker...""Excited receiving it and tried it immediately, but found It took 12 minutes to boil 1/3 of pot from cold water to hot, NOT 3 minutes (needless to say ""less than 3 minutes"")! So tired of those false advertisements/descriptions. It's not the way doing business at all.Really wanted to return it but I can't because I have to use this slow-boiling pot the next day for an important tea demonstration at Zoom. Ugh."
"Customer service is good, Leah is very helpful. I am very satisfied.Thank you"
"We used this teakettle every single day and the handle fell off and the glass cracked after very little time, this was not excessive or harsh use just normal every day usage. This is the first teakettle we had that’s broken apart this way over many years of using them. We still have our oldest one that the electronics broke but the glass kettle never did. This is not safe product and I would not recommend at all"
"I bought one for me and one for my parents. Theirs died in a few months of light use. It just stopped turning on. I used mine for about a year and the cap broke suddenly with gentle handling. Once the door came off, I noticed the springs are very thin and they must have just lost their tension with a year of light use."
Takes forever to boil... sooooo slowWould not buy again
"It boils fast, wouldn't recommend putting a metal defuser ball for tea in it. The led lights attract kids attention, which isn't welcomed. Hold so much water and the company megawise seems gracious.Update co tried bribing me for  better rating, exterior lid is plastic and is warping from water vapors"
I am disappointed in a pot thatDOES NOT TURN OFF BY ITSELF!
"This kettle looks nice enough, but it takes nearly 10 minutes to boil at full capacity.  It's noticeably slower to boil than any other kettle I've ever used.  According to the product description, it should take about 3 minutes to boil at full capacity.  Also, the top of the handle gets quite hot once the kettle boils, making it quite easy to burn oneself.  Twice I've tried contacting customer service about the slow boiling, but I have never received a response.  So disappointing."
Takes very long to boil water. Also the handle is so hot afterwards making it hard to pour. Insulation isnt great
I just purchased this item months ago and use it about 5 times a week. Recently started smelling a electric burning smell after it is done boiling water. Very concerning.
I got this back in October and it stopped working a couple months ago. I’d say proceed with caution with this product. It only lasted a few months for me.
Had a funny taste for a couple of weeks. The open switch seems flimsy but with a 2 year warranty that is tolerable. Good value for the money all in all.After a few months the light burned out.After 7 months the auto shutoff stopped working and boiled all the water out of the pot and stayed hot until I unplugged it.Don’t suggest you risk it.
Indicator light went out. I never know when it’s ready
"Besides these spots on the bottom after using it for a few days it caused electrical shortage and shut down half of the house, this thing is dangerous. Now it’s stoped working at all."
The top part of the handle is super hot after boiling the water. It's dangerous to hold it to pour the water. It burned my fingers. Please be aware of this safety issue. I hope just this item is a defect.
"ordered couple of weeks ago very slow heating..It took like around 3 mins to heat one cup of water. Company logo on kettle was discolored, looked like it was used before"
Opted for an expensive one and it only lasted 18 months. Do not recommend.
"I used this several times a day for a month or two before having to buy another product. The hot coils at the bottom burned through and resulted in the kettle ultimately sticking to the base. I was hoping for a sleek-looking, low-cost option for my office, but opted to upgrade after this."
"After 3 months of use, there is some kind of clear coating on the bottom of the kettle that is flaking off. I stopped using it because it puts tons of that into the water, you see it floating around after a boil.So this thing is going right in the trash after 3 months. Super disappointing."
"Prepping to use my first time, I carefully followed instructions. However,  once the pot reaches boiling, water began to gush through the spout all over the counter. It was frightening.  I emptied and tries lowering the amount, but at boiling point, it became violent.  I am returning the item.Nice looking  but doesn't act nice🤭"
"Literally 1 month on the day, so I can no longer return, the water boiler just stops working. Was working fine and then it just stopped turning on."
"Too big for our needs. Be sure you see return policy. Was difficult to get refund even though it was a present. Opened after return date, 30 days. Then got referred to manufacturers and they would only give partial refund. Sold myself rather than return."
Loved it but after 7 months it just stopped working. Bummer!
Enjoyed using this until the auto shutoff stopped working intermittently.Company responded by saying they were busy. Maybe they’ll get back with me maybe not
"I’ve been using this for almost 2 years now. It works well boil water just fine. I’m finally gonna buy a new one though because the lid is frustrating. It’s hard to close it and it also doesn’t stay open very well unless you pull it all the way back and it clicks but when you do that, it feels like it’s gonna break. Anyway the lid is got to the point where it’s frustrating enough. I’m just gonna buy a new one. Other than the lid it worked pretty well. Some people said it wobbles on the base and I would say yeah it does wobble a little bit, but never really bothered me."
"This is the second identical kettle that I bought from this company. The first one lasted four years, and I use it many times per day. This one only lasted four months before the lime filter just fell out of where it’s supposed to stay. By that time, of course I couldn’t return it to Amazon, but I got in touch with Hamilton Beach so that they could replace the kettle through the warranty, which is still intact for another 8 months or more. I sent them all the pictures I needed to send them and explained what happened and then they told me that they would only replace the kettle and would only pay for shipping if I sent a picture of the kettle with the plug cut off, as if I’m some weird tea kettle thief. 👀 The kettle was under warranty. This is how they treat their customers who contact them to simply replace their broken product. The problem with this is that I need to use the kettle about 10 times a day and they told me that they couldn’t send the replacement kettle until I sent them a picture proving that I destroyed the old kettle (they want a picture of the plug cut off) therefore I’m not going to have a kettle for three weeks, until my replacement arrives. Which means I had to buy another kettle anyway. Totally misses the point. I won’t be buying any more items from this company after I use this replacement. I don’t like being treated like a thief when I’m actually a loyal customer."
The amount of water is not enough
"Pros: It boils water fast and seeing it through the glass is cool and it’s easy to cleanCons: 1) due to its design, if you don’t hold the very bottom part of the handle near the base, the steam that comes out when you pour water out of it will burn your hand. 2) less than 1 year later, the auto shut no longer work."
"Compared to Capresso, which I owned two of, this set up feels like the handle and other plastic parts are thinner. Some love the blue light, but to me it is overly gaudy! Neon! The warnings and markings appear on the front of the glass! (right-handed user) Unbelievable poor planning.The glass carafe is overly large. You are expected to fill only half way.  Overall, it works okay. The styling should be improved. My Capresso never lived long - two years. Well tended, but short life span. with Capresso."
"I bought this to replace an identical one that I broke. I was so happy when I got it. No more microwave water.After I washed it and put it on the base, I noticed that it was wobbly sitting on the base. I put it on the old base and it is still wobbly. Works great, but wobbles. Not a good feeling with boiling water."
"Pro's: kettle is the perfect size, I really like the click in lid with the filter. I was so excited to make some tea! The packaging was really good, kettle was placed in center with lots of space in between to avoid being broken.Con's: Product is not able to be used due to a Y shaped crack close to the handle. Unfortunately looks like a manufacturers mistake. Will be returning."
"I don't know how to feel about this kettle tbh...I accidentally broke my Hamilton Beach and decided to replace it with this Amazon purchase but this one feels alot...cheaper...than the one I originally had. Not to mention it does not sit comfortably on the bottom piece with the cord, there is this weird uneven gap and it just wobbles....I'm not satisfied."
"Works nicely so far, but I’m concerned about some particles that appeared to be in the water after three or four uses? Appears to be coming from the bottom of the kettle surface. Maybe this is normal. Researching and hoping for the best because everything else is solid, boiling speed, design and size is great."
"This glass kettle seems less user friendly than the kettle it replaced. Gets very hot and transfers heat to users hand, making it unsafe potentially. Gets hot fast."
"Most of these reviews say “Wow! It’s. Amazing! This thing boils water AND THEN SHUTS OFF SO IT DOESN'T BOIL DRY AND SET YOUR HOUSE ALIGHT! “. Yes - it’s a kettle, a modern automatic kettle but one which is so badly designed I would send it back if I hadn’t thrown the box away. First, be careful not to get burned. The lid is so poorly designed it leaks steam and you really are at risk of burns, especially if you only boil a small amount of water and have to tip it well over to empty it. Second, I just find it really irritating that you can’t open the lid from the handle, which is a basic feature on almost every automatic kettle, even those cheap Walmart ones students buy for their dorms. I wish I had seen a review like this before I bought it (and threw the box away thinking - c’mon- who could eff up a kettle these days?”)."
"The tea kettle does have the stay open feature for the lid when adding water, so you don’t have to stand there and “babysit” the kettle while filling.  The kettle says that it has an automatic shut off….but it doesn’t work.  If I turn the kettle on and walk away to do something else, when I return there are large puddles of water everywhere….every time.It doesn’t detect that the water has reached boiling temperature and shut the kettle off.It also has hard water build up that I haven’t been able to get off.This product does not function as advertised.  I would not recommend spending your good money and then need a replacement in a couple months afterwards.I am once again in the market for a kettle:("
"In April 2024, I purchased the following product from Amazon:Hamilton Beach Glass Electric Tea Kettle, Water Boiler & Heater, 1 Liter, 1500 Watts for Fast, BPA Free, Cordless Serving, Auto-Shutoff & Boil-Dry Protection, Soft Blue LED (40930)By October 2024, I was no longer able to use the kettle due to the deterioration of the kettle’s interior base.Amazon directed me to contact Hamilton Beach Customer Service which I did. I requested that the kettle be replaced as it did not live up to the quality standards that Hamilton Beach products are supposedly known for. The attached picture shows the kettle’s deterioration after 6 months. Hamilton Beach’s Customer Service required me to jump through numerous hoops and finally agreed to replace the poor quality kettle only if I was willing to pay a $12.49 shipping fee. They provided a defective product and I’m supposed to pay for their poor quality???  Save your money and buy from a quality manufacturer who stands by their product and takes responsibility when they make a defective product."
"I have always been a fan of Hamilton Beach products. This one has me a little put off. It boils water quickly: about three minutes to boil a liter. However, the auto shutoff feature doesn't always work. The first time it happened, I started hearing terrible noises from this thing. And when i went to see what was going on, the kettle was still at full boil, and the water was almost gone. I'm terrified this thing might start a fire or something. Not sure if I got a defective unit, but its unreliability makes me want to order a different one altogether. I can't return it, and I don't like having to force it to shut off. I'm disappointed."
"I bought this to replace one I broke that I was very happy with. When I rinsed it prior to first use, the filter on the pouring spout broke off without much manipulation. The base also does not fit without wobbling. It’s very frustrating to see how cheaply made things are these days. I will keep it, but seriously disappointed in the junk factor!!"
"I used to own the larger version of this kettle for years, and over time I noticed a faint brownish ring forming on the metal base, inside where the water is placed.  I tried to scrub it out but to no avail and it got wider & darker over time.  When I learned about this smaller one, I ordered it since my place is so small and it's just me using it for coffee, tea, soup or whatever else needs boiling water.  I've had it since February of this year and I'm starting to see that same, faint brownish ring forming inside on the metal base again.  My guess is it's rust since when I rub it with a damp magic eraser, it gets a brown color on it but I can never remove all of the stain.  So, don't know why this is happening since I empty and dry the pot every day after use.  I will likely have to start looking for another brand as I'm not comfortable feeling like this thing is rusting into my hot water every time I use it."
"With the lid down and the mesh cover in place, this kettle DOES NOT shut itself off. I do not recommend buying this product if you want automatic shut-off.  I have followed the directions, and still boils away and must be shut off manually."
"I ordered this item last October, in winter it was very good,  but after some months it stoped working can find any warranty or support from the company also"
Purchased this kettle for my elderly mother to replace an older hamilton beach kettle that was no longer shutting off. When we received it we realized the lid is opened by pressing 2 buttons on the lid. The lid also doesnt stay open without holding it. We have returned this as we would (1) prefer the lid opening mechanism to be on the handle to avoid any risk of my mother being scalded by hot steam and (2) prefer a kettle where the button on the handle keeps the lid open for refilling. We did not use the kettle so cannot say whether it performs as expected.
"I rarely write reviews but we recieved a totally defective product. When we opened it to test out it did not sit flat on the electric pad but we figured we could live with a little wobble. We use it mainly for heating water for baby bottles, oatmeal and tea. Shortly after the return window the light stopped working, again thought we could live with it. Shortly after that it stopped turning off on its own after the water was boiled and we had to manually turn it off to stop boil. All in all this was a terrible purchase for us and we will not be buying another Hamilton beach appliance. Lasted less than 4 months!"
Does not sit on the base.  Appears cheaply made.
"Water boiled in kettle often tasted like plastic, especially if you re-boiled water left in the kettle. At 24 inches, the cord was short and ultimately led to kettle falling off the table. Not getting this one again."
"This is something I use every day all day; particularly first thing in the morning when I don't need any BS! This thing will steam burn you if you grab the handle too high up so you learn to grasp it at the lowest extremity of it's handle. The release for opening the lid requires two hands to use instead of a proper thumb button which other units have. I wanted all glass, no metal touching the water but this has a metal bottom. I wanted a smaller capacity which this does have but it weighs the same as my last one which had a higher capacity. Not easy on Grandma who lives with us. The last one we bought of a different brand didn't last a year before it refused to turn on. I'm spending $ to keep replacing these. I would pay a lot for the perfect lasting water kettle but have never found it. I also use a Whistler all glass kettle but it takes forever to heat water on my electric stove and is quite hard to clean the inside. I'm waiting for someone to design and manufacture a better glass or ceramic water kettle that lasts. The plastic screen at the pour spout is for WHAT? I was able to remove the toxic little screen easily on this model. The last model was nearly impossible to remove it. Good luck shoppers, I'm tryin' to help but it's a jungle of crap out there!"
So be careful with cleaning this product as that may contribute to the seal going bad. I'm not sure why the seal on my ruptured actually but it could've just been defective or gone bad over time. I will tell you though to follow the instructions for cleaning that when you clean it use tartar 1/2 teaspoon and the container half full with water then it the tab on the kettle to boil. Let it cool and then rinse it several times with water.If I were you though I would just by a tea kettle that is a solid piece with no water seal (so metal kettle & metal bottom or glass kettle & glass bottom. Avoid the issue of the seal busting on you completely. I'm actually lucky in my case because I didn't know the seal was busted but my brother used it right after me and told me. I would've drank that water otherwise and who know how many toxins that I would've consumed...
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this couple of weeks ago and today it stopped working . In the video i show that it does not turn on at all. In the video i show that my old electric kettle plugged in the same outlet works perfectly , but my new less than two weeks old kettle next to it is not turning on at all.  I have thrown out the original packaging it came in with , so i cant return it .  If i knew this kettle would stop working in two weeks i would have not thrown the packaging out. This is obviously not fair to the customer .Update: i contacted Amazon and they said it can be returned in any box that would fit. So, I did return it , and got my refund.Thank you Amazon."
"We've had two of these in two years.  Worked great when we first got them, but the first just stopped working for no obvious reason after a year.  The second one actually began rusting on the so-called stainless steel bottom.  I could clean it away completely with RustOut, but the rust quickly came back.  It would leave the water rusty after boiling, which while apparently won't hurt you, it does make you go hmmmm.  The kettle ultimately developed a leak from pinholes rusted through the bottom and we discarded it.  Customer service told me this was a lime scale deposit, but when I sent them a picture of the obvious rusting, they then said it was over a year old (we'd had it for 13 months...), and so the warranty had expired.  It's not that they are very expensive, but it's disheartening to send all of these resources into the waste cycle just because they are constructed poorly with inferior materials (stainless steel of even reasonable quality should never rust like this).  I'm going to try a different brand."
"This is my 2nd Hamilton Beach tea kettle. The first one lasted over 2 years...but i used it daily countless times.  It finally gave out.  I Liked it sooo much that i replaced it with another just like it. Just the right size for 1 person. Not so large that it takes up a lot of counter space. UPDATE. 1st one had a cracked glass kettle. Sent replacement in 3 days but it must have been a return because the lid is wobbly and when you pour the hot water in your cup it comes out everywhere. So, i have to sit my cup in the sink to fill with HOT water out of the kettle. Throwing it in the trash and going to Wal-Mart to buy a different brand this time. MAD."
Might seem silly but I totally missed that it doesn’t have a button for your thumb to open. I found it annoying to have to use two hands to hold the lid open while trying to fill it.
Great Kettle.  Next time I Definitely would get one with a bell letting you know it's done heating.
"When pouring water into tea cup immediately after water boils (doesn’t seem an unusual thing to do) the steam flows out from pour notch and up directly onto hand Golding and pouring the kettle. It appears that if the holding handle had been designed so as to prevent you from gripping in the top third this could have been prevented or minimized.  To be fair this is not a “requires medical attention” burn but does feel somewhat serious. I consider my hands fairly “tough”  from cooking, work etc. It doesn’t happen after the kettle cools for a few minutes but hey sometimes we want it now."
"I became disappointed in this kettle. For the first 2 weeks it was great: heats water quickly, had pretty lights. But after just 2 weeks using it 2x/day the blue lights started to blink, and now the lights don't come on at all.  The kettle also does NOT turn itself off now after it starts boiling, so it has to be watched closely or it will boil itself dry: the auto-off feature has already failed.  If you have hard water, the kettle can be fairly loud -- I wipe out all the hard water residue every time I fill it; mineral deposits clean up pretty easily. Interestingly, for the first boil on a new fill of water, the kettle is quiet boiling fresh water while it's still clean. But if you leave hot water in it then boil the same water again later for another cup of tea, it makes a really loud rumbly whooshing sound which seems to be from mineral deposits on the bottom from the prior boil. The noise didn't bother me too much, but if you're in a super quiet office it could be disruptive. The  interior bottom is metal, so there is metal and plastic (lid) touching the water.  I was pretty happy with it at first, but unfortunately this one has to go back."
"Boils fast, very handy since the base stays put with the cord when you take out the kettle to refill or pour. I have found 2 faults with the product, 1 which is easily solvable.The kettle switch CAN get stuck under the cord or if something is above it, making it boil; not sure if it will automatically turn off when the kettle turns dry, did not attempt. Just make sure the area around the switch is free from obstruction.The other, more important fault is the plastic on the lid wearing down. In the first product image (on Amazon), you can zoom in to see the switch/lock below the middle of the lid, sitting inside the glass kettle. It will wear off and discolor over time, and also leave tiny specks of the black plastic. You might be able to see those sitting around the white ring on the bottom or floating in the water or on top of water. These particles will stick onto other vessels that you pour water into. Can also see them by pouring water through a coffee filter, paper towel etc.The kettle that I have has its hinges cracking after a few months use. Other than that, it's pretty good for the price I paid for."
"I read the one star reviews and I agree, it feels cheap. On the very first try: it wobbles on its burner, the lid feels like it's about to come off - flimsy!  I won't be returning it, 'cause it does boil water, but the price is double of what the kettle should be for how it's made. I bought another one at the same time, even though it sort of wobbles also, Hamilton's feel of the kettle is as cheap as it gets."
"I had to replace the kettle I had because the bottom was rusting, and rust particles were plainly visible in the water. I ordered this kettle because a user had stated that the bottom was glass, sitting on the metal. This is not true! It's the identical metal base, and the same thing will happen with this one. But unlike my previous kettle, this has markings only on one side - the wrong one for someone who's right-handed, since I fill the kettle using a measuring cup after taking the filtered water from my refrigerator. In order to pour it in, the markings are on the opposite side; the condensation never clears, and it's difficult to see them. I'm forced to pour the water with my left hand. But the opening isn't big enough, and it's a mess. If you're filling it straight from the tap, it won't pose the same problem. The lid requires two fingers to raise, then another motion with my other hand to open it fully. The previous kettle had a simple push button to open. Both the lid and the on/off switch are flimsy, and I have no doubt that they will break - probably right after the warranty expires. I'm very disappointed. The only reason I'm not returning it is that there aren't a whole lot of all-glass kettles to choose from, and all seem to have that metal inside on the bottom. This is a very shoddy product."
Kettle operates but the scale filter is unuseable because it’s broken and the 2 little latches that lock the top are all gouged looking…. I feel like I should get half of my money back.
"It does what it's supposed to do.....boils water, however I do have a few issues. It's noisier than others I have purchased in the past, and boils way longer than it needs to before shutting off. Once it reaches a fast boil, stop! Also the little filter at the spout causes the hot water to go everywhere....except in the cup. Fortunately it's easy to remove, which I did. Overall it's just ""ok""."
"This kettle boils water as it should, but it does not sit entirely flat and firmly on its base when empty and has a slight wobble. The plastic parts are very lightweight and the kettle seems cheaply made. Although this does not affect its function of boiling water, I find it annoying because I like well designed and well made products, which this is definitely not. I'm trying to decide whether to ignore this and use it anyway or go to the trouble of returning it and looking for a better one. Trying to find anything that is well built these days is an ordeal."
I have had this kettle for less than a year and it is already broken. I am very disappointed by this! It also takes so long to auto shut off and most of the time I have to wait by the kettle to shut it off manually.
"So disappointed!!! Stopped working right when warranty expired. Contacted manufacturer and they weren’t much help. Offered a 15% coupon, but I felt they should replace it. Think the kettle should definitely last longer than a year. They should have stood by their product!! Very disappointing!!!"
Does not stay firm on its base
"Pros:  Heated water quickly the one time I used it.Cons: Glass carafe cracked on first heating/cooling cycle.  Crack is on the back of carafe, so I didn't see it until I went to fill it to use it again.  Called the Hamilton Beach 800 number, and hold times were 35 minutes.  Submitted a report through their online system on Friday, March 1.  They responded Monday March 4 asking for the receipt and the series number.Pro Tip - the series number isn't on the label where it says ""series number"", followed by a big blank.  It's molded into the plastic of the unit and hard to read.I responded with the series number and invoice within an hour of them asking.  I haven't heard anything in the four business days since then.I have had it for 17 days, and have spent ten of them waiting to find out if Hamilton Beach will replace the defective carafe.  I have a couple more days leeway within the return policy, but I will return it to Amazon for a refund and buy something else if Hamilton Beach doesn't do the right things very soon.Update: March 12 - Finally received a response, I was told to cut the cord off the appliance, email a photo proving I did that, and after 3-4 days processing for the email/photo, I will receive a new unit within two weeks.  They generously waived the shipping and handling charge for the warranty replacement.   The wait continues."
I expected to purchase a new product but this kettle had been used before based on water stains on the base and instruction manual.  It works fine so I will keep it
"This kettle wobbled when set on the base. It must have been defective, I sent it back."
"It heats up quick, that’s a plus. However after it reaches the boiling point, it doesn’t shut off. It rapid boils for 15 seconds or more. Kinda a waste of energy."
Had one  for a few years and finally broke it by accident.  Ordered a new one in May and it developed a leak at the bottom where the glass is sealed to the metal by July  only 3 months later.  Thought it was a fluke and bought another in July and by early August it had developed the same leak and it was one day past the return date!  So I contacted Hamilton Beach customer support to get a refund (only asking for a refund on the second purchase) and I have not heard back from them.  Very disappointed.
"I choose this kettle because my DIL has the metal version and I love it. I don't know if mine has a flaw but my kettle releases a great deal of steam which causes condensation on all the cabinets around it, and yes I pull it out from underneath the upper cupboard. The biggest problem is that when I pour the water my hand gets steamed and it is painful even when I wait for the boiling to stop. It's to bad because otherwise it's a nice little machine. After several months of trying to come up with a work around I need to purchase a different one."
"My only qualm is that the max level for water is lower than other electric kettles out there. I wish I knew this before purchasing. It does it’s job well, but if we want a second cup each we have to refill the whole thing as the max line allows the kettle to barely make two cup’s worth."
"Original rating 1 star.  Strong smell of hot plastic when turned on.  Thought the smell would go away, but it didn't.  Used this item four or five times a day for the last 5 days.  Every time, it smells like hot plastic.  TBH, I'm afraid to use it.  Will be returning.Update:  Returned this pot and purchased another similar tea kettle (different brand).  New pot smelled same hot plastic, but not as strong as this one.  So I washed outside with soapy cloth, and smell eventually went away.  I think the problem with this pot may have been an overly heavy oil coating on outside of pot, but not sure.  So I've changed my rating to a 3 star, giving them benefit of a doubt as far as operation goes."
"This morning I filled up the kettle to the max level and turned it on, but ended up caught up in a work call. Every now and then I registered it was boiling and expected it to turn off but it didn't. When my call was over I realized it was it was still boiling and about half (maybe a bit more) of the water had evaporated... I've also noticed constant condensation on the inside of pitcher but didn't give it much mind up until this point.I bought this kettle because my in laws had one and as avid tea drinkers it served them really well over the pandemic.Honestly I'm not angry, just really disappointed."
"Considering it is a Hamilton Beach, I assumed it would last years, but it didn't....bought June 20, 2023, died May 4, 2024, so disappointed - not even a year."
I LOVE electric tea kettles. Use boiling several times during the day for all kinds of concoctions.  This one has a very small capacity (my fault for not realizing HOW small the amount was). But it is a pain in the neck to fill- you have to pinch the lid to open it; not just use one finger to flip open.  It does not STAY open easily either.  So only ** for that.  The water boils quickly enough- but it takes too long to automatically shut off.  I usually hear it boiling - several seconds later it’s STILL boiling!?!  I frequently pick it up before it has shut off.  Strange.  No.  Wouldn’t recommend this product.  I have had several of these in my life- 8-10? and this is my LEAST favorite.  If I hadn’t just moved - expenses! - i would replace.
"I liked the compact design, but the kettle drips from the bottom while pouring and the condensation inside does not evaporate even after hours of standing empty."
"It really heats the water to very hot, and quickly, which is good.  But I don't like that you can't open the top to refill with a button on the handle like my previous ones.  You need to squeeze a button on top to LIFT up the top, and your hand is dangerously close to any rising steam coming from the pot.  So, I have to always wait for it to cool first before refilling it.There is some staining on the inside bottom but I've not attempted to clean it.  It's only been filled with 100% clean water so it must just be the minerals in the water leaving the stains."
This is a great kettle. It heats up very fast and I love the automatic shut off. I used it  3-5 times a week so it only lasted 1 year before the metal coating started to break off into the water. Yuck. So it was no longer safe to drink.I think this is a great product if you do not use it everyday.
"I have owned at least 4 electric kettles over the past decade. I have given away or discarded kettles when they no longer look clean inside (cannot remove scaling) or just needed upgrade. But I was always concerned that I could not see inside the kettle, so decided to get this glass kettle. This Hamilton Beach kettle satisfies the ""see inside"" requirement for sure. However, it is ever so awkward to handle. I would have liked to be able to pick up kettle with my right hand and use the other hand to open spout to fill. No! Filling necessitates pressing 2 little buttons - pinches fingers - and a precise pulling back of the cover. Quite often, it just flops close before it can be filled. I also am not a fan of the plastic lever for starting the boil. So, this will not be a repeat purchase."
"I read some reviews of this product but I refused to believe some of the complains such as the top being hot or the plastic giving off a smell. I was always a lifelong Hamilton Beach fan, and I use their coffee makers but this is very flawed and disappointing. Once the water boils not only is the glass HOT, which will burn you badly upon touching it but the top of the unit can also burn you with the steam when pouring. The design is flawed and does not take into account that when you turn the unit sideways the steam will ntravel the opposite way toward your hand through the openings in the lid. If you hold the hand too high toward the top you will get burned by the steam and you need to make sure that you hold the kettle toward the bottom on the handle. I would never buy this unit again because it is too dangerous to use, especially if you have kids. The plastic does give a gassing off chemical smell from the lid but I'm not sure if that will go away over time. Buy something else, this is not a quality product, the aesthetic is clean but that's about it."
"I have enjoyed this electric kettle for 2.5 years. I was giving it a scrub this morning since we have heavy minerals in our water and the glass broke. Keep in mind I do not scrub regularly, just once I’m a blue moon. So I am super disappointed :("
"Design: It’s quite pretty.Quality: The auto shut-off on my kettle was broken out of the box (yes, the lid was fully closed). Overall the material quality seems like it would hold up for maybe a couple of years.Safety: When water is boiling, the whole kettle shakes around on the base, which is not something I’ve experienced with any other kettle and is unsettling, especially since it is made of glass. The carafe itself is not solid glass, so boiling water touches whatever adhesive and (plastic? silicone?) o-ring the manufacturer used to fuse the stainless steel heating plate and the glass.Usability:  The opening is big enough that getting a hand inside the kettle to clean it should be no problem for most people. The spout is small compared to other kettles and does not pour quickly or well. It is also quite close to the plastic lid so it is hard to avoid exposing water to plastic when pouring, even with the plastic mesh filter removed. The lid design, which requires squeezing both sides in order to open the lid, is surprisingly annoying. Other kettles I have owned either had a spring-loaded button or a one-finger pull tab for the lid.Other: The manufacturer put a hard-to-remove sticker advertising the blue LEDs on the kettle. You can’t see this until you buy a kettle and remove it from the box so I am not sure to whom it’s supposed to be advertising. I feel like this demonstrates the overall level of thought and care that the manufacturer gave to this product."
"I've had this for about a month. It looks nice with the stainless steel base offsetting the black handle and lid. And it brings water to a boil quick, it takes about 2-3 minutes. However the longevity and quality are lacking. There are blue LED's that light in a circle around the base of the glass container. After about a month of use, half of the lights no longer light or they may flicker on momentarily and stay off. The other half of the lights stay on solid as they should. The worst part and this is a safety issue, is that by severely burning my thumb, I realized that the steam generated from the boiling water has started to escape from a seam in the plastic handle. Imagine griping the handle with your right hand. Right about where your thumb would wrap around the handle is a seam. I think that the steam travels through the inside of the handle with enough pressure to finally shut off the auto shut off tab located at the bottom of the handle.  Anyway, the steam started escaping through a seam in the handle and burnt my thumb badly. I don't recommend this kettle."
Auto-shutoff stopped working after 3 months
The product works well in terms of heating water quickly. But there are flaws in the design: if you wish to make a second pot of hot water the lid heats up and makes it easy for you to burn your fingers when you open it to add more water. It takes up more counterspace than my previous cattle. And the capacity is only half of the size of the kettle with markings about halfway up the side indicating the maximum amount of water you can put in it. I bought it because I thought the glass kettle and the blue light that illuminates when it’s working was kind of cool. My previous kettle which was stainless steel lasted over 10 years. There are aspects of the construction of this kettle that make me feel it won’t last as long. These design issues caused my three star rating.
Like: The blue glow from the LED’s when heating the water.  Dislike: The steam rising and burning my hand when I pour boiling water out of it.  Did the manufacturer not test this?  They must’ve know this but continued with its manufacture anyway.  Simple solution would’ve been to place the handle further down the kettle.  Dislike #2: It takes two hands to open the top of the kettle.  Another major flaw.  Dislike #3: The auto shutoff feature does not work less than two months after use.  Major fire hazard.  Yesterday I got distracted by a chore while water was being heated.  When I returned the water had boiled out of it yet it was still heating.  This is unacceptable.
"On November 14, 2023, we ordered the Hamilton Beach 1 Liter Glass Electric Tea Kettle.  It arrived some days later and worked fine for four months, then stopped working.  No heat, no lighted base, nothing.  I checked all external connections to make sure it wasn't an problem with the electrical outlet.  The kettle is at fault.  can't give a good rating to its features (temperature, safety, heat output) because after 4 months of occasional daily use, it just quit.  It looks nice, but had a very limited life span.  Waste of money.  Very disappointed in Hamilton Beach for such a shoddy product that didn't last even 6 months."
For once Hamilton Beach failed me.  Worked once and then wouldn't even get warm.  Was a waste of time and money.  Just couldn't get going.
"Bought this for my mother as a safer alternative to boiling water.  I liked the idea of the BLUE LIGHT so you would know when it was done. Unfortunately, it didn't work out of the box.  When pressing the very cheap clear plastic Power ON lever, it immediately returned to OFF position.  It didn't stay down.  So the blue light and power would remain ON if I stayed there holding the lever down.  Returned as defective item.I would try another one because of the blue light feature, but I found pouring the water OUT of the glass pitcher to be sub par.  They made the carafe spout very small and it makes for a messy pour, especially when trying to pour out the very end of the water.  Also, did not like that you had to use two fingers simultaneously to open the lid.  It was just awkward.  The unit in general was kind of cheapish feeling.See Colin S review a few days before mine.  It was spot on with everything I found too.Great idea -- blue light.  Bad implementation on this one."
"I use this very day and it works great, but the cover doesn’t close easily. The button on the side that you use to push in to open and close the cover get suck."
"1) Yes, it works. It heats water. But it doesn't KEEP it warm. It just heats and shuts off.2) It is designed without thought to left-handed people. The markings on the carafe are only on one side, with the handle to the right. If you're left-handed you have to turn it around to see the markings.3) The markings are white over clear. Very hard to see. A black background for the text would have been helpful - or use a more distinctive color, like red.4) After just a few months of use, the buttons to release the lid have started binding. Very poor design or materials."
The first use the aluminum looks rusty
"This pot does its job, it heats water up and it does it quickly. Easy to open, fill, and clean. The only problem is that the handle gets SUPER hot. If you poor the water as soon as it's done boiling (which I imagine most people do) the steam coming out of it goes right up the handle. I've had to put it down and pick it up again because it gets too hot to hold."
"I really like the convenience and ease of this electric glass kettle. I wanted glass so it stayed sanitary and not have any chemical leakage. However, after using this product for about a year now it has a white build up on the inside bottom metal part that is getting into my water. I use bottled water only and not sure where the white build up is coming from. I've tried scrubbing it out with the rough part of the sponge with no avail. Not sure what it is but I no longer want to use the product because the water doesn't look safe to drink as the white residue is thick and chunks off."
keeps moisture inside kiloreig did not  top on it did not like  next time i would definetly buy the original keurig it was much better and much easier i chose the cheaper and got what i asked for.
"I liked that this item boiled water very quickly, and it isn't that loud. The blue lights are nice, as well. However, it leaks when pouring about half the time, and I can't figure out why. Then I'm left to clean up spilled water. The base also doesn't stay hot for very long after the water is boiled and while it's still plugged in. So, once it's boiled, that's pretty much it and you'll need to re-boil if you want to top off your water. I relegated it to my office where it gets only occasional use. Good thing I didn't get rid of my old one at home."
The tea kettle stopped turing off automatically.
I purchased this product in December 2022; had physical problems and did not use until after the date of return had passed. I am totally disappointed in the kettle; the button you push to turn on will not stay down. Even trying up to 25 times. To get water to boil I have to sit and hold the button until it boils. I am sorry I made this purchase; Hamilton Beach has other products I have purchased and enjoy using but I do not think anyone should purchase this tea kettle.
"I have been using Hamilton Beach electric kettles for years now. My stainless 1 ltr kettle had an issue after a year or two with the auto shut off so I went looking for a replacement. I found this one, a little different, but its pretty and it does the trick. However, after just 3 or 4 weeks, the auto shut off stopped working reliably and the kettle could boil dry. Its a safety issue, so I contacted Hamilton Beach about the issue. I got a terse response to handle it through the retailer, which was Amazon. I am so unhappy now that I think I will stop buying Hamilton Beach products altogether. With 2 issues on the auto shut off, I think there is a safety issue/defect and apparently Hamilton Beach isnt interested in the feedback. I would steer clear of this brand, unless you are okay with shoddy workmanship. Its too bad, we had the 1st kettle for several years, the 2nd for a couple of years and this one for 4 weeks. Hoping to find another brand that is of better quality."
I’m upset because I paid for the new item and was sent a used one instead. The item was dirty. Although it’s hard to tell from the pictures there were a lot of little black dots inside the kettle which tells me it’s probably coffee grounds. Disgusting! I want a refund!
"Nice design, functional. But it didn't last long. In 4 months, the lid started leaking. The tea kettle stopped working in 7 months, not turning on. Throwing it away."
"I've had this kettle for about a year.  There is weird flaking happening and even some of it is black and I have repeated bought cleaners to get this gunk out and it keeps happening, so that's not good.  I make tea several times a day so I do use it a lot.  The blue light has been out for some months, which is disappointing.  I expected more from this brand and will likely have to buy a new one soon sadly.  I would not recommend this one."
"After 11 months, this water heater will no longer ""sense"" when the water is boiling. It will continue to boil the water until it is evaporated. Very unsafe!"
"I purchased this kettle approximately a year ago.For the past few weeks, whenever I use it, it reeks of burning plastic / metal. Doesn’t feel safe to use anymore and I’m scared to drink from it.I wouldn’t suggest purchasing this if you plan on using long term.Update- this did die. Stopped turning on. Horrible smell of burning electrical. Buyer beware"
"The product is fast, efficient, easy to clean, pours water good enough.  Okay product for price. But…Received it Febuary 2. It leaked and burned out June 18—four months, two weeks, two days. Poof…Created enough ozone to set off kitchen fire detector. No fire. Lots of ozone.  One can tell by the ozone smell.Poor durability."
"First time using a glass kettle. It is fast enough, 500ml boils in 2 minutes, the automatic shut of happens in 2 1/2 minutes.I did however find its shape a bit inconvenient. You have to bend your elbow quite a bit to be able to pour it and it feels very heavy in your hand while you do it, it is just awkward. Also the top opening is too small in comparison to the body, so when you need to wash the kettle it is pretty burdensome.Good enough, but would not buy it again."
"Bought this product and after a month it would sometimes turn off on its own or stay own continuously until there was no water in it, then after owning it for 3 months, it started leaking from somewhere in the bottom. I would not purchase this. The company warranty says you're responsible for shipping both ways if you want them to fix or replace it. For this price, I rather purchase a new one from one of their competitors and never buy a Hamilton Beach product ever again. This product is a fire and/or electrical hazard. Leaking water where the product connects to its electrical base."
"I had this kettle for 6 months and used it about once a week. It’s now stopped working and won’t turn on. I’ve contacted Hamilton in hopes of replacing it. I really loved it, so I’m hoping it was just a fluke. I always unplugged it and took care of it."
"For the price, this is a good value water boiler (no multi-temp settings).  It's reasonably quick and quiet.  Doesn't take up too much counter space.  Requires more ""minimum"" water than we'd like.  Lid a bit awkward to open/keep open.  All this might have been 4 stars, but we're rating 3 stars because we don't like the way steam hits your hand as you pour the boiled water, though this can be ""managed"" if you hold the handle on low end (further away from the lid) to pour."
"I gotta stop going by the reviews. This takes hours to boil, in comparison to my metal kettle. The only reason I got it was because I I couldn’t properly clean my other one. But this retains water marks and the plate needs to be scrub after every use too. Always the way you open the top is awkward af. Does spring open you have to secure it. Ugh"
It does what is supposed to do.
"Unlike previous kettles I've used you need to put your hands directly over the lid to open it.  If you are re-filling the kettle after using then the steam from the kettle will hit your fingers.  In all cases opening the lid needs two hands, one to hold the kettle, one to open the clasp.  Get a kettle where the lib controls are thumb operated while your hand is on the handle.Also, the min water fill is large, the max is small, but the footprint of the kettle overall is large.  Not really happy with this purchase, but at least it does not leak.Note: like most other kettles this one is high wattage.  If in the same plug with anything else (toaster, coffee maker) do not operate at the same time or you will pop the breaker.  My previous kettle was 700W, that would work at the same time as one other appliance."
"Great pot, but would have liked better if cover opened more to clean"
"The maximum and minimum fill lines are safety features. But, rather than spend the money to print the max and min fill lines on both sides of the kettle, it’s only printed on the side you can view while holding the kettle in your right hand. Left handed people need to fill, then set the kettle down and rotate it to see the max and min fill lines. This is frustrating enough that I bothered to write this review."
"Bad point #1: To open this kettle and put water into it, you use a metal latch set into the lid. Most kettles have the opening-mechanism on the handle, to avoid burning your fingers if you want to add more water when the kettle is already hot.Bad point #2: Most kettles have a lid that flips wide open and stays open until you close it. This makes it easy to fill the kettle. This kettle's lid when opened just flops down, unless you pull it all the way open so that it catches. Not a huge deal but somewhat annoying.Bad point #3: An important safety feature of most kettles is automatic power shutoff. This kettle's instructions say that the shutoff works only if you have the kettle lid firmly closed and also have its little mesh strainer in place."
"This product heats up the water well, just as I need it to, but it just feels cheap. This one will go in my camper for occasional use, and it’ll be fine for that, but for daily use, I’m glad I have another one that I like better."
"Love this product...fast, easy to see, led is cool.Purchased Nov. 2019, dead Mar. 2022.  Out of factory warranty.  They did offer 10% discount if I purchased directly from manufacturer.  Rarely buy extended warranty, in this case $4  for 4 years would have been worth it."
I had one of these before so ordering another was an easy decision.  The old one lasted a long time and finally reached its last days of life.  The new one I ordered unfortunately was half the size.  I didn’t do a good job of looking into details like size when purchasing so that’s my fault although what I don’t understand is why the max size for the fill line is half of the already small kettle.  The old kettle max line was 3/4 the size of the kettle.
Heats water fast! But the power cord also gets hot. I just missed the return/exchange time period on Amazon. But I can still get in touch with the manufacture.
The only issue is that we have hard water in my building and it stained the metal bottom of the teapot.
"The auto turn off stopped working after a couple of weeks, though sometimes it works. This can be dangerous. I have had similar kettles for years and never had the problem.  Packaging when shipped was also not good.  Box dented.  Would not recommend. Will keep an eye on this one and if turn off does not work into the trash it goes."
"No cause for impatience; this thing starts bubbling cold water just a second after I touch that button, and it is lovely to watch.  I do like this provider of hot water, but I haven't had it long. It might not last, but for low cost it is attractive enough, and so fast I can't complain.  It is not a premium kettle; the plastic is thin, cheap looking and smells sweetly toxic to me (tried to boil that out).  Unlike the picture, the copper is way darker; more like a penny than a bronze statue. The blue light is bright. Its pretty to me, and very low cost. Should have got one years ago; I got hot water now!"
The look is great. but since the bottom of the kettle is wobbly I just return it.
"It’s not fast, I don’t like the way that I need to take really care because it can be broke or it’s can just don’t work and heat. So I just think it’s not a good cost for it"
"📃✍🏻Update:I purchased another different water boiler, and it arrived today.  But that brand has a thin cord.  This particular boiler has a thick and firm cord.  So after comparing cords, they both have the same wattage and voltage, and both connect the same way to the heating elements...I decided to switch cords.  When I opened the round base of this water boiler, I discovered the inside of the base is charred and melted, and the clip where the wire is connected to the element, AND the element connection are both  charred black  The OUTSIDE of the base, however, doesn't appear melted.  I inspect it every time I use it; especially since I have to squeegee all the water off the countertop into the sink, anyway.  So this heating element actually presented as a fire hazard without my knowledge; would I had not considered switching cords, I would've never known how dangerous it was.  Thank goodness the lid did break, because it could've caught my house on fire, AND the two houses on either side, which are only a few feet away.I don't know if it's because the water leaked so much, or because the black (live) wire appears to be pinched and perhaps created a short, ... or maybe it's a combination of both.  But something caused the wire to overheat and plastic to melt.  This also explains why it's tripped my GFCI outlet a few times. I just assumed it was caused by an overload of power, even though the only other working device on that line of outlets is the garbage disposal, which wasn't running at the time.The reason the wire is so thick is because it includes a green grounding wire, which my new water boiler cord does not include.  I don't know if I should be thankful this one had a grounding wire, or if I should be suspicious about why they included a grounding wire, in the first place..  I've read other reviews complaining about their leaking water boiler; but at the time, I shrugged it off, assuming they were occasional mishaps possibly caused by mishandle of use.When I initially purchased this boiler, they contacted me several times via email asking me to leave a review.  I have to wonder if their eagerness for a review was generated by the fact that this is a great water boiler starting out.  But as time passes, the boiler begins to leak and presents as a fire hazard.Buyer, beware!  Even if you think it's safe, it could be hiding a very serious fire hazard!📜✍🏻Older review:I've had this water boiler a little over a year.  It's been slowly leaking little by little until now there's a puddle of about three tablespoons every time I boil water.  The handle came loose.  The top button stopped working, so I have to stick a butter knife in, and push back on, the white clip holding it shut each time I want to open the lid.  I'm now searching for a new water boiler.  Instinct tells me ""Buy the same one and use parts of the old one when the new one breaks"".  Common sense tells me, ""Buy one that won't break, and you won't need to hoard the old broken pot pieces"".  I should listen to common sense this time."
"Bought this to make pour over coffee and stop heating water in my plastic coffee maker.The glass is nice to see the water level, and you can see when the water is simmering if you don't need a full boil. The LED lights are nice to tell that it is on or off.The opening is big enough to reach inside to clean. I like that the pot can swivel on the base so you can set it on from any direction.The listing states ""The water will only touch with the stainless steel. So no worries about melting plastic or chemicals leaching into your hot drinks"". This is not entirely true for the glass version. There is a ring of white glue or silicone or something where the metal base attaches to the glass and the hot water touches it. You can squish it with your fingernail."
"1) I was looking for 1500W kettle (and paid more).  The description says 1500W.  On the kettle it says 1000-1200W.  I boiled the same amount of water with my old 1500W kettle and it took 2 minutes.  With this kettle it took 2 and a half.  Not a big deal, but I don't like being misled.2) I did not want the plastic to have any contact with the hot water or vapor.  So, I was looking for a glass/metal kettle.  This kettle still had some plastic in direct contact with vapor.3) The plastic handle was getting somewhere between warm and hot.  And that was the last straw."
"So from my cold water tap to boiling it takes exactly 7 minutes for a full pot. That’s the good.I purchased this 7/2024 and after about a month it started getting these little weird black dots below the glass where the heating element part is, which increasingly got worse. I’m extremely vigilant about never getting it wet on the outside and only cleaning the inside with a brand new magic sponge.So because the Azeus company doesn’t have 24/7 live chat despite what the photo in the listing says, I was forced to do an unsupervised deep dive to see if I was being poisoned or was in any danger... The answer is no, borosilicate glass does not leach chemicals (this is made of borosilicate glass), making it considered very safe for storing food and beverages as it is highly resistant to chemical reactions and has a very low level of solubility, meaning IT DOES NOT EASILY RELEASE SUBSTANCES INTO LIQUID IT CONTAINS; this is why it's often used in laboratory settings and for storing sensitive materials like nuclear waste!So all in all it looks like s*+#  but it works and hasn’t killed me… yet. I’ll replace it soon because I have no idea if one of these days the heating element will just break through and burn my house down."
Very quick to boil. Glass and handle seem safe and sturdy. Auto shut off located in lid is unreliable and boils very hard for a long while before shutting off. I kept it though.
"Nice looking but slow to boil and the only way around that is to not put a lot of water in it. Wish I had bought a better one, though did not return."
Gets real hot.Takes longer than other brands. Feels thin and cheap. Has crackling sounds during and after it heats. So far it works fine. The base is wobbly.Delivery took long and it was tossed over our fence with box damaged. Deliveries normally get put on our porch.
I always use kettle to boil water so I know how long it takes. This one takes a bit longer than my old one.
"When the water boils, you need to open manually the lid to pour the water"
If you have traveled to Europe and used their plug in water pot you will be disappointed with this product. Does it boil water?  Yes. Is it fast? No.
Still smells funny after washing multiple times. Heats fast and super convenient.
"I bought this a month ago and used it for the first time yesterday. Today when I go to use it there’s no blue light showing it’s on. I thought that it had stopped working. My plastic one has worked for years with no issues. I wanted a bigger, glass one and this is what I get."
"I purchased this kettle for $20, expecting at least basic functionality, but I’m incredibly disappointed. The button to pop open the lid completely broke after just four months (see photo, I am applying all the force I can muster and the lid would not nudge at all!!!). For comparison, I’ve owned second-hand kettles that cost $15 and have lasted over two years without any issues—even the button for lid on those is still working fine!This kettle has no alternative handle or dent to help open the lid if the button fails, which means if the button stops working (which it will), you’re forced to pry open the lid with your bare hands, risking burns from the steam. I’ve used kettles from various countries, and this is one of the worst designs I've ever seen.Adding to the frustration, it was outside the return window by the time it broke, so I’m stuck with this useless product. Buyers, beware—this kettle is not worth the price, and I regret every dollar spent."
quite heavy to lift.  Does not shut off unless if has been boiling for long time.  Handle becomes hot.
Specified quiet in the write up but its very noisy
"Wonder if this is normal for this electric kettle. I used this to boil water at least once a day. I found that after the 3rd or 4th boil, water would change taste to kind of like stale grease (almost like dirty kitchen cloth). I thought may be I accidentally dropped something unclean in there. So I washed it with vinegar. After that, water would taste fine until the  3rd or 4th boil, the stale taste came back. This morning was the third time I am cleaning it with vinegar. There is a small mineral built up at the stainless steel bottom plate. At least it is not rust.  I am curious what the reason is for the strange taste since it repeats around every 4th use."
"Purchased Sept 29, 2024. loved this kettle, at first. It was reliable, worked like it should, and then yesterday December 7, 2024, it short circuited causing my main breaker to flip. After resetting the breaker, it worked again. This morning, December 8, 2024, I went to make my morning coffee & the kettle was off, but the plate and wire was warm. I reset my GFI that it was plugged in to, and tried to turn on the kettle… to no avail. The kettle is done. No longer works, and surely was a fire risk due to the the 48 hrs of events. I don’t know how to reach out to the seller… it only leads me to their website, which is a products website. So, I’m here to warn everyone of the potential fire risk of this kettle.I’m glad I caught it before something more serious happened."
Lid is very carefully fitted . Value for money. It’s look nice. I bought this for my daughter. I have a good experience of my one .
"I’m giving this three stars for 2 main reasons. First, I was not impressed with how I heard something inside the kettle move around while I was unboxing the kettle. It sounded like a little plastic thing was trapped between the two walls. I believe this is a defect because I have had numerous water kettles that lasted at least five years (I sold or gave mine away because I moved around a lot) but never had something that made noise when I move the kettle to either wash or fill it. I’ve always had kettles that felt solid at the base, with no rattles. Second, the base lacks traction to keep it in place. The base itself is very lightweight, so if you were to rotate the kettle after placing it in the base, the base moved with the kettle. Needless to say, the kettle is excellent for the sole purpose it is made to do, boil water. I like how the water doesn’t touch any plastic and the body itself is cool, making it a safer choice for usage. However, I doubt the longevity of this product based on the construction feel, the defect that I mentioned earlier, and the sound at the onset of turning on the kettle. The noise level is a bit louder than other models I have used, and also the sound runs much longer since it starts a few seconds after you start the kettle. All in all, I am still contemplating whether or not to return it since there are so few choices out there for kettles like this one."
"For historical purposes this was my original review:""  It's super quick and doesn't beep!  Simple, light, easy to use, ""plug and play.""  However, after one full week of use, there already was some signs of unremovable oxidation/rust(see attached image).  So I'm docking two stars from 5 down to three.""They did send a replacement within a week after I posted that review.  However, not without some haggling, where they requested that I up it to five stars for the great customer service.  The review has to encapsulate both the product and service(if applicable), so I didn't budge.  And why do they have so many reviews?  Because they lure you in by promising free gifts and such.  Because I never gave them 5 stars, and they did send me a replacement unit without requiring me to mail back the original, I never did get that elusive 'free gift.'  No matter, but the point is that the reason they have so many positive reviews is because of this semi-bribery.Since then, we have used it close to ten times a day(we do use it heavily), and this unit also suffered from the same rusting in the exact area depicted by the photo, which leads me to believe that they are all like this.  It has been less than four months, and today it wouldn't boil.  The blue LED came on, but nothing else happened.  I dug back out the original from storage and plopped it back in, and it worked.  So the bottom piece that plugs into the electrical outlet is fine; it is the top pot holding the water that is broken.  I plan to use this second unit until it breaks, but I am not expecting it to last much more than three months given recent experience.When it works, it's great and heats water faster than a powerful gas stove.  However, if you want something that lasts, research some more, and pony up a few more dollars for something of higher quality, because this ain't it."
"The kettle works, and I tested the safety features, which is what I wanted most, and those worked. However, I noticed that it took longer than I expected to boil water, so I turned the kettle over and noticed the sticker on the bottom. This is not a 1500W kettle as advertised. This is a 1000W kettle. That explains it. I can't give more than 3 stars to a product that was falsely advertised."
"It takes longer than I would expect, to heat the water to a boil, even 2/3 full."
"My previous electric kettle just died after nearly a decade, so I've been searching for a new one.  I wanted something that was only stainless steel and it seems that they are more difficult to come by than I would have thought.  Ordered this one because I liked the shape even though the size overall is bigger than I would have wanted.  But, it is wobbly when it sits on the counter, so I'm not sure if it's the base that's the problem or the kettle itself.  I tried shifting both around, but to no avail.  I've used it only once but have already processed a return label - while I may have been able to live with the wobble, it also leaks from the bottom and there was water on my counter.  There's definitely not a big hole or anything and the base was definitely dry when I started the process, so I can't figure out what's happening.  I'll stick with the other one I bought - don't love the shape of that one as much but at least it doesn't leak.  Also to take note of: the button to open the lid is on the very top, so you have to have it sitting on something to open it or use two hands.  It doesn't sound like a big deal but it is a bit of an annoyance.  I may have gotten use to it over time, but with wobbles and leaks already no chance to try that.  I gave it two stars just because it does actually heat up water like it says so that's something..."
I’m so frustrated with AZEUS. I purchased this a while back and finally was able to unbox and put it to use. The charging part from the kettle was not working whatsoever!! I contacted Amazon because Azeus response team for customer service is so hard to get in touch with. Amazon was able to connect me and even still the issue is unresolved. I am unable to receive a confirmed replacement and they ask for the most!! Save your coin and buy a nicer electric kettle!! You get what you pay for :/
"I absolutely love this electric kettle.  The water really does heat up faster than a microwave can.  And I always fill it up to capacity.  It’s well insulated; I don’t worry about burnt fingers.  It’s stable and not easily tipped.  Why did I wait so long to buy it, it’s amazingly useful.Three month update: The kettle just stopped working.  Worked fine night before but now it’s not working.I contacted their chat line on the Azeus product warranty registration site.  They were very helpful and said they would send me a replacement.  Customer service definitely gets 5 stars, at least until the end of the chat.  They started pressuring me into leaving a better star rating.  Kept typing that it would affect their score and couldn’t I do better to help them out. 😳  I leave a honest review and I feel it’s really unprofessional to try to manipulate me thru guilt into a better star rating.So yeah they are sending a replacement, hopefully."
"This is leaking. I plug it and once the water starts to boil, it stats leaking. I'm not going to return because I don't have that kind of time, I just put a towel under it and wait till it boil and turn it off but it over flows and leaks a lot, there was water running on my counter and it was a lot like a cup full. So I sit next to it and wait til it boil and turn it off. Not safe around kids."
"I really like this kettle however, the power base connector is faulty. Within 30 days of my first purchase it began, having to maneuver the kettle around on the base to try to turn it on. So I was able to exchange it for another one. Now less than eight months into using it every day, sometimes 2x a day, the base connection is faulty. I do eventually get it working by moving it around the base until the lights come on showing that it's on. There is a reason it's always on sale for $22. The electric kettle I bought from Costco 10 years ago still works, just not as pretty a design."
Seems to have thrown a switch
The light of the kettle doesn’t function after 1 time use
"I’ve used many electric kettles in the past, and this one started off well. However, within a week, the electrical housing shorted out with a huge spark. Fortunately, there was no fire, but it did produce some smoke. I’ve never had issues with other appliances using the same socket, so it’s clear this product had faulty electrical wiring. I cannot recommend it."
"The kettle looked nice. On day 3, as soon as I started to heat water for my tea, the kettle made a loud sound ( like an explosion) and stopped working. Azeus support service recommended that I contact Amazon directly because Amazon is a seller."
"Product itself it great.Well packaged and easy too use.However, there is a horrible rotten egg smell when the water boils. I have tried every trick of the trade--filling with water and lemon juice and bringing boil; repeat 3 timesfilling with vinegar and water and bringing to a boil; repeat 3 timesfilling with water, vinegar, bring to boil, then adding rice and switching around; repeat 3 timesI have tried tap water, bottled water, tap water boiled on stove and cooled and then reboiled in kettle...Still every single time I boil water, there is the rotten egg smell. And what is worse, is it permeates the room.Other than that, this is a really good product. Quick boil, easy to pour, easy to clean.Just wish it didn't smell. Haven't a a cup of tea in weeks."
"It boils as fast as they say, 6.5 minutes for full pot. Looks and feels good. But it pours out uncleanly, not smooth flowing, multiple directions. It will barely pour into a mug without spilling. And the cord is stiffer then my outdoor power tool extension cords, but yet is normal 16 gauge wire. The cord knocks over other stuff on counter, and base will move on its own without the pot on it. A window AC unit with three wire plug is more flexible. Can I return it when it technically works as advertised, but usability is soso?UPDATE: Azeus contacted me and gave me a gift card and even offered refund for my troubles. Decided not to waste ecology and not throw out pot since it is usable. And since they contacted me on their own at least customer service is very good. And the pot still looks good and boils well after 3 months daily use."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Not sure how I feel about this kettle. I’ve been on the hunt for a SAFE to use electric kettle. One that is food safe, BPA free and does NOT touch plastic. This kettle claims all these things and I was very excited to receive it.In the product images, the latch on the lid is clearly stainless steel. The product I received does not have that... it is plastic. Although it is “BPA free”, for peace of mind, I really wanted it all to be stainless steel. See images. This claims that no plastic touches the water but it clearly does every time you use it.Also, the material seems cheap. The lid is slightly crooked on top and the base isn’t stable, it wobbles. Water goes through the edges of lid when pouring.I just got it today and I’ll use it for a few more days and see if I change my mind. But as of now, I’m pretty disappointed and leaning towards returning and getting issued a refund."
This kettle made a loud popping sound while in use and the indicator light no longer works. I think maybe a fuse blew? I have had the kettle for less than a month. I would get a kettle that has a 3 prong plug instead of this one that only has 2.
"I wish I had spent a little more and gotten a nicer version. The water does not heat quickly and there’s no screen or seal around the spout. It cools off quickly. Also, didn’t fit smoothly on the base. I have to “fiddle” with it everyone to make sure it’s seated correctly. Probably take it to goodwill. I use my kettle continuously throughout the day for individual hot tea and coffee, so it’s ease of use and quality is important to me. I guess one kettle is NOT just as good as any other. If none of that stuff bothers you, it’s probably fine."
"I've used a lot of different water kettles and this one is the worst by far. It takes a few minutes to boil just a cup or two of water and often I find it's boiling for significantly longer before the release stop it. The glass exterior also means that the water will cool faster if you forget to use your water immediately, meaning you'll have to reheat again."
"Pros: stylish, ergonomic, modern look and feel, very fast boiling, and quiet.Cons: it heats up on the surface and can scald you. This is important information that should also be on the Amazon website instead of the manual and experiencing it with use!Inside the kettle, the bottom seem to be 2 seperate pieces attached with an all round groove. That my friend will be the source of rusting, and germ accumulation when not in us.Also, when pouring, some hot water will flow down the lid to your hand.Initially, I gave this kettle five stars upon receipt, but after use, am giving it only 3-stars due to excellent customer service by Gerald.The  cons negate the looks and service.Sorry."
"The product is sleek in style, though I’d rather had a different color. White shows stains too easily. The instructions were very easy to understand and I followed what it said for starting use.It heats the water quickly, and allows you to do other things. I also like how it frees up other kitchen items that I might have used to boil water.After four uses, the bottom of the kettle has started to separate from the rest (second picture). I’m not sure how this will effect future uses, but it could be dangerous depending on if it continues to separate.Otherwise, it’s a useful kettle that will get lots of use in my home. The break could be a fluke with my unit."
"Overall this kettle does a fine job but due to the fact that the manufacturer neglected to put a fine mesh screen on the spout to keep the little bits of scale that flake-off the bottom when water is being poured out of the kettle. The cheapest little kettle that this one replaced had one and I never knew just how important these gizmoz were. I know have to pour the hot water now has to be poured through a mesh strainer to keep said scale from getting into whatever water is being poured into. How much could have this screen cost?... $0.03?? 🤔 Buuut, I guess if you have a top-end water softening system... I guess you're in the clear!! 👍"
"I don't even know where to start...1. The bottom of the inner chamber connecting to the sides is not one piece. There will be build up of sediment regardless of using vinegar over time and your hand a toothpick, whatever you use will not be able to get to it. 2. There is ridge between the lip from the chamber to the spout again there will be sediment, crud, something build up over time and the way the spout is designed you will not be able to get to it. 3. Plastic doesn't come into contact with water, false. When you open the lid there are two screws and an open area that condensation will leak into your water/inner chamber. I know there were more issues but I believe you get my point. Really disappointed as I researched electric kettles for days but the one good thing is after receiving this one I see these same issues with some many others. I'll stick with a glass teapot in the microwave/stove top at this point."
Will not buy again as it was acting fickle since the beginning of 2024 and has quit working after only 27 months of use.  Will go back to my old kettle that I can heat on the kitchen stove.
"Update*** I really don't like the fact that it splashes when you pour. It gets the countertop dirty, the top of the lid dirty and water also runs down the side of the container. It's a real pain in the @ss. Can't make a pour over with out making a mess. It always makes a mess every single time I use it. I have tried different amounts of water and varying the speed with which I pour. Still a mess. I have had this for about a month.  It's sleek and looks great.  But really looks don't matter, it's how fast it heats up the water and it is fast!  I am really happy with this hot water boiler.  The only con is that when I am pouring water into my French press, it splashes.  I get dots of coffee on the lid and on the counter top.  I am not sure why it pours so hard but it does.  Besides that its pretty great.  Does what it is supposed to do fast. I haven't had any issue with scaling on the heating element as some reviewers have had.  Even if I did I would not be concerned about it.  Its normal for this to happen with water in different areas around the country."
It only worked for a month and the manufacturer provided terrible (or nonexistent) customer service.
"Threw this piece of garbage away after 2 months!  Tried calling customer service to get a replacement.  They said they would issue one, but then I never heard from them again.  Just gave up and bought a new one from Costco."
"Water heats up fine. The base is a little unstable, but fine. A few issues: If I take I’m the kettle off the base before it’s done boiling, it doesn’t automatically turn off. The spout isn’t the best design, water ends up coming through the top of the lid and sometimes drips along the side, so I have to pour with caution and sometimes with the lid open. I can live with this because the price is good, it works and it’s cute."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It has a nice design. It's powerful enough. You can't see the level of the water inside but I was ok with it. I had to return it because of the safety reasons. The bottom of the kettle doesn't have a nonslip coat at all which makes it very slippery and the kettle glides on kitchen counter surfaces and even tables. It's unsafe to have kids and a kettle with hot water gliding around.
"It works as other water kettle i have had before. The reason i bought this one because I dropped the one i had before and it was made with glass. So I decided to get a stainless steel to avoid the same mistake.Pro: it holds the temperature and no worry about breaking it.Con: the lid is poorly designed. It jammed when opening, and water leaking when pouring. Imagine the burning hot water dripping on your foot.For the safty, i gave it a 2 stars, bur I am way passing returning period. Looking for another one soon."
"This device turns on and off by itself. There is a blue light when heating, and when in another room,it turned itself on. When I felt it, it was hot. It is a fire hazard."
"I replaced an old Oster brand kettle that heated water super fast to boiling. This kettle is much prettier, and it is just as easy to use as my old one. plug in the base, set kettle on it, push button and water heats up but....it takes a really long time to actually get to boiling. That’s why I gave it three stars. Putting a pot of water on the stove would probably take the same time."
The boiler worked for a little less than 2 months. It just cut off with a spark one morning and stopped working altogether. I need to look for another now. Waste of money!
"Pros:- boils water quite rapidly- is large to serve more than 7 cups of teaCons:- of filled more than half Way the water starts spilling through the nose of the pot- it’s too rapid, for those who like to boil their tea slowly for that strong flavor, this doesn’t work like that, you may have to boil a few more times with the risk of spilling out a little."
"The first one of this model that I bought gushed out boiling water right as it shut off every time I used it. I exchanged it for another of the same model thinking it was a fluke because almost no one was mentioning this problem in the reviews.  The second kettle I received has the same problem.  Even if the kettle is only filled 1/3 full, it gushes out a lot of water at the point of shutting off. I guess this one is going back, too."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This product so nice and beautiful, but inside couple of water bottles, it developed some kind rust. If we clean it again forms. I don't know whether it is Water issue or something else."
"The kettle boils water quickly, and is far easier to fill with water than my past couple of kettles. I love the ergonomic handle. The outside is easy to clean. This was a good choice, and better than my last kettle which was a different brand.  The price is a great for the quality.Follow-up:  After several weeks I followup with my review.  The lid of the pot does not close easily, and unless you have a full pot of water the sound is very loud when the kettle is boiling. In addition, I had to initiate a chat with Azeus to try to get my $10 Amazon card for registering the warranty, going through hoops to again show the purchase and claim the gift card and still have not received it."
Completely quit working.  Shorted out my circuit panel.
"I purchased this less than 2 years ago, now plastic rim is coming off and water leaking out, please help!!!Can't reach customer service, supposed to be guaranteed for five years, but not being able to get help is clearly a problem. C. Simonson"
"After 7 months the unit sparked at the base and smoked and caused an outage in my kitchen. I contacted the seller and they say Dont worry will replace. Contacted Annie Collection 3x and all they want is a Good review from me. Still no new unit. I called therr company explaining. They said ""Dont worry dear we send you new and take care of you"" and begging for good reviews. I contacted them 3 times in 2 weeks thrt keep saying dont worry dear we take care of you!  3 weeks later nothing from them. Obviously I needed a kettle so I  had to buy one. Dont trust this COMPANY!"
"Love the looks of it! Clean aesthetics, probably the most beautiful lines of all the kettles on the market. But, it's SO noisy. It's a trade off: you want a beautiful appliance, or you want a quiet one. Tough. Another small thing: the spout is a bit clumsily designed so when you pour the water it kind of flows all over. Hence, 3 stars."
"I used the first one for approx. 45 days before the lid broke at the hinge.  The customer service area sent a second one that is working well but I have only had it for about 2 weeks.  If this one holds up, I would give it another star.  It heats well, stops once hot, and looks nice."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            When it did work,  was very very loud."
After starting boiling it leaks from top to bottom and I am going to return it soon.
"I found this tea pot to be a little noisy when heating water.  Because it holds a lot of water, it's noisy for quite a while.  I'd give it a C+ for style - it's just a large plastic kitchen appliance.  The cord looks like it would run the clothes dryer.  I returned mine for a smaller stainless steel KitchenAid, which I love."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It just stopped working. I did all of the trouble shooting and it still doesn't work.
"I'm British, I drink a lot of tea. I've had a lot of kettles. I've never had a kettle that doesn't have something to indicate how full the kettle is. I also didn't realize that the plug is three prong, not two, so I had to buy an adapter to plug it in. Other than that, it works fine and looks fine."
Can't have anything exalting a mythological god in my house.
"CAUTION!!!!!!!!!BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN HAND WASHING THE METAL PART, WHERE YOU WILL SEE HOLES, AT THE SPOUT WHERE YOU POUR.  THIS METAL LEDGE AND AROUND THE HOLES ARE EXTREMELY SHARP.  MY HUSBAND WAS HAND WASHING FOR THE FIRST TIME AND HIS HAND AND FINGER WAS CUT BY THE METAL.the good:This kettle gets water boiling quickly when I add enough water for a couple cups of tea and super simple to use.  I like that it doesn't get hot on the outside and doesn't take up a lot of space."
"The very thick black cord is unsightly, very hard to maneuver, unnecessary long ...a white more flexible smaller chord would have been easier to maneuver & would disappear instead of stand out.  This cord looks like it should be attached to an industrial refrigerator."
"The rounded spout is a poor industrial design.  If you try to fill a single cup, it dribbles down the side if you don't pour fast enough.  Compared to the last insulated electric kettle that I owned (got lost in a move), it heats about as quickly, is a bit noisier, but the bad design of the spout makes it a pain to use.  Two stars for a really bad spout design."
Seems like the water comes out scalding hot. Have to let it cool for a while or it burns your mouth. I never had an electric kettle before do I don’t know if this is normal or not. Otherwise it’s a nice design.
It didn’t arrive at my house on Friday. They never went to my house to drop it off. I had to do pick it up four days later five days. UPS Poor service
"The kettle quaility was fine, the lid base and lever were poor quaility. Returned."
i like the unit but it only made it 9 months and the wire shorted out under and started to smell of hot plastic. I am going to try another one to see if it will last longer.
The style and the double wall are great.  Doesn't pour well and stopped working after one year due to the contacts wearing out between the base and the kettle.  Doesn't reset the on-off switch when removed from the base so continues to heat up when replaced on base.
Ordered April 11 and no longer turning on by July 11.
Nice looking. Boils fast. Economical. Leaves drips when pour water out. Bottom gets water marks very quickly. Have to boil with vinegar weekly to keep bottom clear from water stain. Have sign of rust after less than 2 weeks of purchase. Considering return.
Won’t turn on
"I ordered this kettle because it listed the kettle to be 1500Watts. When I received the kettle, it was the correct Model number listed, but only 1000Watts! This was the main reason I had ordered this kettle specifically.BUYER BEWARE!"
"Once I attempted to finally open the box, I noticed that it was recently opened. As expected, USED AND REPACKAGE WITH DRY FLUID ALL OVER THE GLASS. Finger prints and all which is a hazard for me to even touch. YUCK YUCK YUCK AND YUCK. I most definitely returned."
"The description does not match reality. The seller misleads customers. It is claimed to have a power of 1500W, but in reality, it has a power of 1000W. Takes more than 10 minutes to heat up."
"Lid jams and will not pop openSmells like burning plastic when boilingHas to be positioned just right on base for LED light to come on and boilPour spout is messy spilling water everywhereOnly great thing is double wallWe had 2 of the exact same Breville kettles for 15 years, very high daily use on bothSpend $100 for something that lasts 10+ years instead of $40 for only 6 months!"
"This kettles spout is terrible. It's made in such a way that makes the pouring of water very awkward but if you're looking to keep your water temperature controlled, then this is the product for you"
"My water kettle has broken. It will no longer turn on or work at all. I bought it in July and it had stopped working by May. Thats not even an entire year. I'm disappointed, and I would not recommend buying this."
Good capacity for water and sleek design.  It is just incredibly LOUD
Took almost 10 minutes to boil and shut off
Stopped working after 4 months. This is not a quality product and was a waste of money.
Hard to open
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Ordered kettle May 6, received it shortly thereafter. On June 2nd this hot water kettle caught fire in our kitchen. Luckily someone was in the kitchen and we had a fire extinguisher nearby. Electrician came and inspected the GFCI outlet and stated the outlet was in perfect working order, we just got a defective kettle.To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. I'm not sure what legal recourse there is, but at the very least I can pass on my story to other potential customers: buyer beware of this product."
"One of the first times I tried to use it, despite filling the kettle up below the max line, the kettle started spraying water out all over my countertop (think geyser, not sprinkler). The lid is also difficult to open (you push a button, but it didn't open every time), and while the tea kettle is lightweight, it feels cheap.  I ended up returning it."
I like the kettle but the button that opens it to add water only worked properly for about two weeks. Now it is nearly impossible to open. I have to hit it continuously in different spots with differing levels of force and cross my fingers. Very disappointing
This kettle always required a little shifting to get a good connection but after almost two years it trips the ground fault circuit every time I try to turn it on. I think this is a safety issue with this product.
"+Not so loud. Good capacity 1,8L. Power 1500W. Boiling fast. Works fine.-Bad quality made case. Bad quality inside bottom.Plastic locking mechanism on top. Plastic mechanism on/off."
"it stoped working after a year and half of intermittent use. Looks good but very poor quality, to be considered as a disposable kettle. A total waste compared to the previous brand I had that lasted 8 years!"
"It was good for a year, but stopped working suddenly"
Works as intended but it’s sooo loud when the water is boiling. The light on the switch no longer works after 2 months of usage. I’m very disappointed and I cannot return this item.
Had all good reviews so was hoping this one was better than the others I have bought but not in the inside. Only used it once and noticed the finish on the bottom coming off...don't really wanting that in my hot water. So disappointed and missed my return window by one day :(
A max-level pot of water from the tap takes over eight minutes to boil. The potwill continue to boil until the kettle is about 1/3 full before shutting off. It is easy to clean and my Wife likes the way it looks.
"Last 10 month. Can not find contact for seller. Total waste of money. In reality does not look as nice as on the picture. Looks pretty cheap, the cover won't open more than 45 degrees. When it came it looked like opened package. I was thinking to return it right away but unfortunately did not do that"
It's was super easy and convenient to use until it broke after only 9 months. Get one of the coverage plans.
"I think it’s a cute kettle and it boils quickly, but after only about 4 uses, there’s already these dark spots at the bottom of the kettle. There’s  also a darker spot in between the crevice at the bottom and I hope it’s not rust. I will be retuning it. I wanted this kettle for the aesthetic."
I got this product. It looked like it was a regular size teapot. I made that same mistake that we’ve all done and not measured it or check the measurements because when it arrived it’s small you can only put in about 2 cups worth of water and that’s it at a time had I known that I would not have bought this would I buy it again? Maybe if I was wanted something for traveling but for every day use it’s too small and I’m sad I get rid of my old one now in place of this.
The pot is beautiful for my Tea but after3 daysThe inside starts getting Rusty.  I’m very disappointed.
Not insulated and gets hot to the touch. Heats up fast.
Purchased this lovely copper kettle in June 2024. Yesterday the auto shut off failed. Tried to use again today  just to be sure and it has absolutely failed. I really liked it when it worked. Sad that it only lasted 5 months.
Brand new and has something at bottom of kettle that cannot be removed- concerns me that when it heats up we'd be ingesting something non edible
"This worked well at first.  It’s stylish, looks good on the counter and heats up well.  But eventually mold grew in it which doesn’t make sense to me since only water was ever put into it and it’s boiled.  The problem is that there is no good way to clean it. There is a heating element inside that you can’t clean behind, and it’s also impossible to thoroughly clean the spout as it’s blocked off from the inside. There are only a bunch of little holes that are too small to push a brush through.  I think if this had been an open hole where you could push a cleaning brush all the way down the spout and into the kettle it would have been fine, but the way it’s made I don’t trust that I can ever get the spout truly clean and I can’t even see if mold is growing inside of it. I bought a different one where I can see what’s going on inside and there are no dark areas that I can’t reach with a brush or sponge. It gives me peace of mind that I can get it properly clean. I can’t recommend this kettle, unfortunately."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            What is this white stuff? Does this happen with all of them??
"It worked well for a year, then died."
"I loved this kettle! Used it for about a year with no issues, but recently rust started to form on the bottom. Too bad because I loved this design and got tons of compliments on it."
"The photos must be enhanced because the “copper” is not copper colored at all, it’s dull, brown plastic. I understand that certain parts  have to be plastic and not metal for a reason but the photos were very misleading. I would suggest getting a different color like black or white because the copper is UGLY. But it works just like any other electric kettle."
"3.5 This works great, but there’s a small leak where the spout meets the base. I have a feeling I can repair it with an online search. Otherwise everything works as it should, and I love the look of it."
"This is my SECOND time purchasing this kettle. The first time it conked out I thought ok, maybe it was faulty, maybe I did something - who knows. But I loved the look so much I ordered again.And Lo and behold: it conked out again. It warns you too - that it’s about to die. It starts “huffing and puffing” steam escaping from the top lid, switch being finicky.I thought I could deal with that if it kept chugging, but it didn’t.For the price of two of these I could have invested in a much better kettle that I would still have around. With better functions. Needless to say I’m disappointed and won’t be ordering this style ever again"
"This was an awesome product for the first six months. Then the auto shut-off failed (hello, fire hazard!) and then it stopped working entirely."
"I bought this in 2022 and used it happily for years - it was only when a friend mentioned testing her own kettle for lead that I figured I'd pick up a testing kit. Tested this kettle twice and got a positive both times - thought it might be false positive so I tested other things (metal, plastic, etc) and nothing else tested positive."
"This is such a cute kettle. It heats up water quickly and looks great. I was excited about the copper color because it goes with the deocrating scheme in my kitchen. The top knob is plastic, but since the whole lid is metal you had to be very careful or you might burn yourself when taking off the lid to refill after boiling.The kettle would get scale deposits from time to time and i would heat up a full pot with 50% white vinegar to remove it all. Easy peasy. However, after just one year of daily use it is starting to rust at the bottom! There is a little circle of rust that is slowly growing everyday. I thought this pot was made of stainless steel throughout, which shouldn't rust after just one year of use. I have to question the quality of the metal one year is just not that long for this kettle to start to fail. I am disspointed with this kettle. My past kettles have lasted 3-10 years with similar daily use and cleaning habits."
Color of the handle does not match the other plastic parts. It does feel light and cheap compared to my Hamilton Beach that still works but looks old after 8 years of daily use.
"This is a beautiful, elegant kettle, but just after the warranty was out the top lost its color and the automatic cut off stopped working, so it keeps boiling unless I stand there and watch it and turn it off myself."
"I loved the way this looked, but it had definite drawbacks in design. The top you have to manually take on & off to fill versus others that are on a hinge, which I didn’t think of when purchasing. Also because of the gooseneck it pours slowly which is easy enough to get used to, but if you tip it too far forward & the lid isn’t lined up a certain way boiling water spills out the top. All of that was okay after getting used to it- but then it stopped working suddenly after only a month of use."
"If you’re a seasoned tea drinker, you know that water temperature (or lack of boiling points)  make a difference on whether the tea steeps well. After just a month and a half, the water boils, but definitely not hot enough for some of the better teas I have, and I taste the difference. It’s not as strong, for example. This has been a problem in the past for me when water kettles are older and not boiling as well (electric). I will adjust my review once the company emails me back to see if they can replace the product. But can’t give it higher at the moment."
"EDIT: Customer Service reached out to me unsolicited and offered a refund which is impressive. So 5 stars on their Customer Service.It's such a bummer because the stainless steel part that's green is really nice. It's a pretty green. The quality of the green compared to the brown/""copper"" plastic makes the whole thing look cheap though. It heated the water up quickly. It's small."
"I chose this kettle mainly because it had a nice gooseneck and the color looked great in my kitchen. I am giving it 2 stars because it worked well for almost 2 years heating quickly and then started to slow down about a month ago. it continued to heat water, although at a slower rate and then finally, today, has quit heating completely. I was surprised and so moved it to another wall socket but no, it has completely died and will not heat water. No noise, no heating whatsoever. I am disappointed because I was hoping for having this kettle for more than a little over 2 years. I don't want to have to keep ordering every 2 years so now I am searching for a new kettle."
"I liked the look of this kettle but it is small. Also because of the gooseneck spout, it pours very slowly. I don’t mind cuz it forces me to slow down for a few seconds as I make my highly caffeinated tea 😂. I’d buy a different kettle in the future, larger without the gooseneck."
"After a few months of use, it's clear that this thing is glitchy af. Half the time it'll keep boiling even though the light is off. Also the lever to turn the kettle on and off is really cheaply made, and it doesn't even seem to work sometimes. I don't understand how this has such high reviews but they must be fake or from people who used it once and immediately left a review."
This item was received and worked for a couple of days and then stopped working.  Poor form.
"This was our household’s introduction to electric kettles, and the hub and I enjoyed its ease a great deal. I noticed a plastic taste some months in, but my taste buds aren’t what they used to be and my man didn’t complain. One big flaw that may have led to its eventual demise is that the kettle can be turned on when there’s no water in it, which shouldn’t be possible. Obviously, turning it on without water in it isn’t smart, but mistakes happen—a safety detector of some sort internally is needed. And then it takes a while to realize what’s happening/overheat itself and click off. Immediately afterward, despite adding water, it would take a while to recover. It eventually got to the point where we would turn it on with water in it, and it would begin to heat up, then sort of fall asleep, then sort of wake up and begin to heat up again, and in the end would produce either warm water or hot water, unpredictably, and with no satisfying clicking off of the lever, indicating it was hot. There’s no reason this kettle should’ve lasted only seven months… More cheap crap from [fill in the blank]."
"I really liked this kettle until it just stopped turning on 3 months after purchase, sad"
