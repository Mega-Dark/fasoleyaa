"if you get them on a deal and want something mediocre, they are OK"
An electrical short on power cable melted housing and was fire hazard.
You get what you pay for. Noise cancellation not all that good.
"If you are smaller than average person, these headphones may be too big for your head. They are fine if you are stationary, however because they are way too big for my head they are constantly slipping off while I am at the gym. They will slide and slip off my head when I’m doing pull-ups. I wouldn’t recommend for women."
"The sound was decent, but it hurt my ear so bad and caused them to sweat."
"For the price they’re pretty decent but theydon’t get very loud for music. For audible they are great and would give 5/5! For music 2.5/5. Some songs are good while others, especially Metal, are extremely lacking and dull sounding. You can also hear outside noise with sound all the way up which isn’t ideal for running or working out."
"I like most about them except that I travel a lot and while in the airport trying to make calls, my call recipients say that my background noise is Unbearable.  This is disappointing to say the least. I got these to use in this way and they were advertised to be competent about this. Unfortunately not so"
"I have a lot of Anker products.  Love the cables and battery banks.  I took a chance on this and have used them practically every day.  From January 6th, 2024 to November 24th, 2024.  Incredibly comfortable, I often forget they're on.  Great for normal house chores or flying.  Noise canceling is superb even when using a steam surface cleaning machine.However, the right side has died.  Never dropped, however I do often bump them on things as I forget they are there when cleaning.  But there are no marks, scratches, scuffs, mars, or any other marks. I noticed it when I was chewing, I could hear popping and the sound would drop out.  Or if I walked, every step would induce audio degradation.  Very much like a wire has come loose.  I thought maybe it needed a charge, so I charged it over night.  Now the right side is completely dead, no audio.  I hear crackling and popping when I move my head but no other audio.It's a real shame, and I wish I knew what happened.  I'm afraid that if I try to open them they'll be destroyed (as is how most things are manufactured these days)."
"I bought these flash sale for $41 versus the list price of 59.99 and compared it to the Raycon every day headphones which listed for 99.99 and I got through Black Friday sale for 69.99 and found the Raycons Had a better feel. The Life Q 20s had to be played with full volume on the phone did not connect automatically to Bluetooth like the Raycon did and they were not water resistant like the Raycons were. The Raycons had a more in-depth base about it and I liked the way the Raycons Told you that it was connected to the Bluetooth when you first put them over your ears.  I could feel the sound better with the Raycons. The soundcore, Life Q 20s did not connect automatically and just gave you a series of bleeps to let you know it was connected. So construction wise and convenience wise and sound wise I found the Raycons better.  I then compared the Raycons to a pair of beats solo3 which listed for 199 and you can get them at Costco in black for $99 which is what I paid for them in an Amazon cyber Monday sale. The sound quality of the beats solo3 was by comparison Superior  to even the Raycons. If you set your phone volume to high, you can still adjust the beats up or down without it affecting the volume on your phone, whereas both the Raycon and the soundcore when you increase or decrease the volume it would increase or decrease it on your phone . I returned this product and spent the little extra money for the beats solo3 and am happy. But if you’re looking for a good sound for under 50 bucks the soundcore life Q20 is very good. For a price between 50 and 100 the Raycon fit the category and was great, and if you’re not afraid to spend the extra bucks, the beats solo3 is the best."
"I am honestly so disappointed with these, because I got them to replace my current headphones that I wear most days for sound reduction, which are starting to go out after a couple of years of wear (and are no longer being made).While the sound quality is good, the ANC is basically standard, and its BaseUp mode is pretty interesting, the fit is just appallingly bad. For being ""over ear"" headphones, they simply do not fit over my ears. Compared to my current pair, the holes for your ears are noticeably less wide, and a small bit shorter. I don't have big ears, I'm a five-foot-something young person.But that isn't the only issue with their fit: rather than the earpieces being able to swivel so that you can position them in a way that would both be comfortable for your ears and have the headband piece in its most secure position on your head, this pair instead has only a joint on the headband directly above the earpieces which allows them to be rotated horizontally. Which is intended to be for storage purposes, and does not aid in fit. This means that if you want the earpieces to be at the right angle, the headband part may very well be in a poor position to even keep them on.I will likely return them and search for better. Even more disappointed after all the comments about how comfortable they are."
"I really wanted to like these headphones, but they do not adjust to a smaller size. I do not even have a small head. I probably have an exactly average sized head, but they are too big and there’s no good place to find a set them on top of my head as well as even though they’re over the ear when you’re moving around like when I’m mowing the lawn, the edges are so big that they will pop open on the side and let sound and mess up the music you’re listening To. I waited too long so I cannot return them, but I really wish I would have do not recommend unless you have a very large head. They are also pretty heavy and give me a headache. UPDATE: Anker offered me a partial refund because I cannot return them, it was a really good experience with their customer service. I appreciate it."
"Unlike most, i have to go to phone settings every single time to tell phone to connect to these headphones, not sure why. AND when its dead, there's no warning, no signal, no phone alert, it just stops carrying sound. Video keeps playing; no sound. So weird. They fit, feel comfy, but not worth keeping. Return."
"Noise cancelling is great, but if I even slightly move my head, these fall right off. I have since gotten the in ear noise cancelling earbuds (spacecore 40, I think) from the same brand and they work great! However, if you don't mind headphones that fall off constantly, these do have good noise cancelling and amazing battery life."
Update: downgraded from 5 to 3.  I use this mostly with my computer. The Bluetooth drops and I have to go through a few steps to get it to reconnect.  Sometimes a few times. I am numbed because using it with my workstation is my primary reason for purchasing.Old review:Awesome sound.  I wasn't expecting much because of the low price.  I have to say I have spent $350 on headphones that did not sound near as good.  Active noise cancelation works great too.  Very happy with this purchase.  Easy connectivity. Fits my noggin perfect. Blue color looks great.
"Update -Lemons happen.  That's why customer service is so important.  I was contacted by Anker's customer service and we are working to resolve the problem.  They gave me a set of hacks to try, including resetting the headphones, which I didn't know you could do.  None of them worked.  The headphones won't charge.  So far, customer service has been great.This is my third set of headphones (Bose for my wife and me) and these because I wanted to leave my Bose at the cabin.These pair easily and sound pretty good, but the noise cancellation is not as good as the (much more expensive) Bose,  which is to be expected.The problem is that I bought them in August (7 months ago) and they won't accept and hold a charge.  The battery level is always noted as ""low.""  My Bose are seven years old.I'm 70 and use them gently when I work outdoors on the lawn, don't want to hear my wife's TV when I'm reading, or when I don't want to hear my wife.The battery has never run down completely, but I also don't recharge it too much - I'm aware of how to treat rechargeable electronics batteries.I do not recommend this product.  I'm going to contact customer service and will update this review if they are responsive to this issue.  Regardless, 7 months is unacceptable."
Received a refurbished/previously returned product with visible usage/scratch etc!
Like; it really blocks out noiseDislike: static
"Not 5 star by any means but here is the reality about these headphones. First of all I’m not going to overly elaborate like some others who seem to enjoy making rave reviews. This is specifically whether these are a value for $50. Let me start with the Cons but be known that this is also based on my expectation from other reviews and my personal opinion how they work for me. Anyone else may have a different experience based on previous products they’ve owned. Far as the 5 star reviews go these are not 5 star headphones however....Pros and Cons:1.) limited Bluetooth signal distance for 5.0 I had expected more from them. Compared to a pair of Bluetooth 4.2 these cut out at the exact same distance so I highly doubt these offer true to signal Bluetooth 5.0.I do use these at work in a 3,000 sqft building with brick walls and steel roof. The headphones will work from one end to the other but stop immediately when I walk out to toss the trash. My bludio victory headphones actually make it the extra 20 feet with Bluetooth 4.2 but my Bludio ufo set stops working before I get halfway through the building. The Pro is that the headphones auto connect when you walk back in and my Bludio victory set would require physical reconnection.2.) ANC noise canceling. Far as noise canceling it’s not perfect but it does work. For the price range it probably works better than others I’ve used even slightly more expensive headphones. While it is still only 3 stars I’ve had $100 sets that didn’t get 1 star.The noise canceling around cnc machinery gets rid of all the low bass hum. It will not do anything for fan noise or higher pitches so be aware it’s focus is on the sounds that drive you nuts after awhile or give a migraine.3.) The build quality is ok but I suspect they won’t last longer than a year. Sound is good but in no way are these as good as some boast about. Night high resolution and likely use a mid size driver so bass suffers along with the varying degree of frequencies commonly heard through a quality set like nose. ive had $30 headphones that sounded better. That said they’re not bad and the other features balance it enough for my needs these are a good headphone at work. Going back to the anc certain things will trigger added static noise and they are succumb to static or emf frequencies so keep in mind if they crackle or hiss you may have to shut noise cancelling off.Overall I give these 3.5 stars. The volume is a Big plus and they get plenty loud for my environment while the distance usage is perfect for my environment. The sound is not overly muddled so it’s not annoying to listen through.and comfort enough to wear for a 12 hour shift. I think they are exactly what you pay for and nothing more so don’t let your expectations be too high and realize these are not as amazing as others claim. A good overall headphone for work, exercise, lawn mowing, or flying. If you’re an audiophile spend at least $150 and you will be much happier."
These are just ok. The color's gorgeous and pretty true to the picture and decent sound quality but they stick out to the side more than I'd like and the power button is on the bottom so I constantly push it/turn off when I'm trying to adjust them
The headset falls off if doing aerobics or laying down.It has decent base
"I’m here writing this review because I am on the hunt for noise cancelling headphones for the third time in just over 7 months and, unfortunately, will not be rebuying these and cannot recommend them for new purchase.I’ve always loved Anker products so, when I saw these at such a great price, I was thrilled. Initially, the noise cancellation, sound quality, call quality, and battery made these feel like daylight robbery compared to the $300 other options.As it turns out, the build quality, while obviously nothing super nice in the first place, is where both Anker and I apparently saved all that cash. On my first pair, which I used somewhere around 10-15 hours a week, the plastics started to crack after a couple of months and eventually all fell off piece by foot stabbing piece to expose the metal skeleton underneath the size adjusters. Second, and this progressed in frequency of issue throughout time, there are pretty aggravating connectivity problems. Quite randomly and without any sensible explanation I can find, the headphones will just disconnect from Bluetooth or turn off altogether. Annoying if consuming media, sure, but outright infuriating when on an important call or video conference. Finally, after these started falling apart and having connectivity issues, I bought another pair in a different color because I thought they were still a great deal (I mean, $60 really is fantastic in this product field) and wanted to further patronize Anker for their work. I used those officially 3-4 times, as they arrived with a battery that wouldn’t charge. The good news is that the plastic on those never disintegrated in their new memorialized position as a “never use, but still can’t bring myself to throw away 60 bucks” shiny showpiece on my bookshelf. Connectivity seemed to be fine before they, you know, departed for Valhalla after perishing quickly in the price versus quality wars. I went on trying to use the disintegrating pair for the last few months but they, too, now need to be laid to rest.All in all, and I must emphasize this last point, I am a long time buyer of cheaper costing *and* quality things if the trade offs are worth the lesser bang for the lesser buck. That said, after having two pairs of these plagued with quality issues in just over 7 months, I now could only recommend them with a little too much hesitation and will not be taking a risk myself a third time. On to find a truly good budget buy for the day."
"These headphones were affordable so I adjusted my expectations accordingly. For the money you get a decent sound quality that was much better than I expected. The best feature is the noise canceling that comes handy on any flight. I barely hear the airplane noise. The battery lasts quite long. I did not time it but it lasted through overseas flights.Now the con's: It would be great if the charging cable would be a more commonly used type (e.g. USB-C). If you loose the cable good luck finding a compatible one. The ear pads were okay, pretty soft but not thick enough. My ears constantly touching the hard plastic inside the pad and my ears start hurting after a while. The tension of the headset is pretty high. It keeps it snug on your head but after a while presses on my ears.The pads started falling apart after two years so I replaced them for $15 or so. I thought they were pretty expensive comparably to the head set. Now after 2.5 years the headset padding starts to fall apart. In both cases the surface peels off. There is no replacement for that so I have to figure something out. Otherwise it works as originally so it would be a waste to throw it away."
"Sound quality and battery life are great, but these things are far too small and hurt to wear for extended periods of time. They also slip off easily because the ear covers are too small to fit over my ears."
"I was very excited to receive these, based on previous reviews. These are inexpensive - so I don't think I have unfair expectations.Firstly, the noise reduction is very bad. I was sitting next to a small fan, and ""wind noise"" was being broadcast into my ears. It sounded like a microphone in the wind. It was so bad, I thought that maybe the settings were backwards, but I quadruple checked and the wind noise only happened when noise reduction was on.Sound quality without noise reduction was pretty good - 8.5/10 - and better than most inexpensive headphones.Sound quality with noise reduction was simply bad - 2/10 - and unacceptable. It almost sounded like the NR was reducing the sound of the music. Bass basically went away, and there was a no depth to the music.These feel good on the ears, and are light, so that's a positive.A negative is the charging - it's micro USB and not USB-C, which tells me these were designed several years ago and never updated.Unfortunately, I'm going to return these - it was an honest attempt to get suitable NR headphones at an inexpensive cost.. but I think I'm going to spend more money on a better option."
"I've had 5 pairs of these headphones over the years and after my last set, I've decided it's time to move on.The first 2 pair lasted about 18 months each and I retired them since they were getting a bit worn around the edges of the cups and it was starting to affect the sound. I lost the third pair while on vacation, but it's the last 2 pair that have made me decided to move on to a different brand.Each of the last 2 pair have lasted less than 6 months each. Both have run into the same issue of refusing to take a charge. I only use the charging cable that is provided with the headphones at the time of purchase but for some reason the cable starts to damage the charging port inside the right ear cup to the point that it will refuse to accept a charge. I don't treat my headphones with kid gloves, but I also don't abuse them. Seems that a small piece is breaking off inside the earpiece which is why it won't charge.I've decided to try out the Jlab Jbuds Lux this time since they are at a similar price point. Hopefully the quality is better than these...."
"I ordered the Life Q20's mainly for the ANC. I didn't want to spend 300 dollars for a pair of Bose, or even 350 for the new 700s, so I knew there would be sacrifices at this price point. It was really between these and the Mpow H12's with Hybrid Noice Cancellation, which are also 60 dollars (but on sale for 40 right now). Really the only reason I picked these was because they work with Google Assistant, look slightly nicer, and because I know Anker's earpads are really comfortable, but didn't know how the Mpow's felt.FEEL:That said, these are really comfortable headphones.I used to own a pair of the Crusher Wireless's from Skullcandy and these are wayyy more comfortable. The memory foam is superb and the headband doesn't crush at all. The biggest issue with the cuffs is they get hot. Now I do sweat more than an average person but these get a little too hot. If I'm walking it's not to the point where I'll sweat, but it gets near that tipping point.ANC:The ANC on these isn't bad. It obviously doesn't compare to Bose's ANC, but honestly, when you're already listening to music, you can't really hear much. I play football and there's a huge speaker in the room where the team plays music. If I turn on the ANC and turn the volume up, I really can't hear it that well, if at all. I can't say how they perform on flights, as I'm not going to be on one any time soon, but if I do fly I will update for sure.FLAW (ANC):One big complaint (and, unless returning wasn't a hassle, would be a deal breaker for me), is that there is an issue with wind. When it's windy outside and the ANC is on, the Mics will pick up the sound of the wind and try to counter it, which makes a windy noise on the inside. It's not extremely loud but it's loud enough to notice, and it's also simply not acceptable from a company like Anker, at a price point of 60 dollars. It's not a big gripe but it's one that simply shouldn't exist for a pair of headphones at this price point.SOUND QUALITY:I'm not really an audiophile, and I do like bass so I am slightly biased, but these aren't bad. The soundstage is lacking, and the bass is heavily lacking in the bass up feature (honestly it just seems to muddle the treble and mids). It's good for anybody who just listens to music for chilling and fun. If you're an audiophile I'm sure there are issues with it.FLAW (SOUND QUALITY):One huge flaw with these headphones is how they sound wired! Goodness it's incredible how they go from $60-$100 sounding headphones straight down to $15-$20 headphones. You HAVE to turn ANC on in order for the headphones to sound how they would with Bluetooth on. Without the ANC (and a charge for it) they sound awful, which is a major flaw because the whole point of a cable is to use it without draining the battery...All of that in perspective, I would probably recommend the Mpow H12's over these. Those have incredible reviews and I haven't seen anything about the wind issue (which again, is basically a deal breaker. It definitely would have been if I'd known beforehand). The only issue is those don't have any support for Google Assistant or Siri or Alexa."
"This is heavenly as we have several fans going due to heat and can’t hear the tv unless we turn it up, which sounds travels.  This was the best and very comfortable and does a great job."
The price is goog but neck and ears ache after wearing this some uncomfortable feel is mainly there. I.wish I can return these since they ve been not used and my ears do  hurt and ache
"Was excited about the custom sound mixing in the sound core app, but these are not supported like my liberty 4 earbuds are.That's disappointing, but otherwise they are very good considering the low low price."
These headphones are an incredible value to be clear. The sound quality is great -for the price- and the noise cancellation is more that okay -for the price-. However a huge annoyance is that the headphones automatically turn off when an aux cord is plugged in and the noise cancellation is unavailable. The headphones and noise cancellation cannot be enabled again until you unplug the aux. This is extremely unfortunate if you planned to use these to watch movies on planes for example. I don’t know why they don’t make this more clear in the listing but it’s a giant oversight. If it weren’t for that I’d recommend these headphones wholeheartedly.
"I bought these to wear in airplanes and yesterday was my test. I had a 4-hour flight and that's when I found out what how bad these headphone are. There are several problems that should have been fixed before they ever went into production:1) When you power on the bluetooth, it does NOT automatically connect to your phone. Instead, after turning on bluetooth, you have to get your phone out of your pocket, then go into your phone's connection options, then look through your list of available devices, and then manually connect to the headphones. Every time. Why doesn't it just remember and connect automatically, like all other bluetooth devices in the world do?2) You cannot just turn on the noise-canceling function unless you first turn on the bluetooth function. Why is that? Why can't you just cancel loud droning noise (such as in an airplane) without needing to turn on the bluetooth function, too? They are two separate buttons. This poor design drains the battery faster, by forcing the bluetooth option to start sending out a signal when all you want to do is cancel the airplane noise.3) When you DO turn on just the noise-canceling option, it works, but only for about 5 minutes and then it turns itself off! It was really annoying to have the engine noise come back into my ears every 5 minutes. Want to sleep? No! The airplane noise will wake you up every 5 minutes so you can turn on the noise-canceling again and try to go back to sleep.4) I'm still not sure exactly how the noise-canceling button works. The directions that came with this mostly tell how to adjust the volume and pause the music, which we could have figured out on our own. But they don't say why sometimes when you push the noise-cancel button, there's a short beep in the headphones, sometimes there isn't, sometimes you can hear the outside hum go away, sometimes you hear static, sometimes you hear the outside noise come back... Really confusing, especially with no instructions! It should just be really simple: ""push once to turn on noise-canceling and push again to turn off noise-canceling"".5) My long flight yesterday had the screen on the back of the seat in front of me for watching movies. But as soon as I plugged in the wire to connect my headphones to that screen, the sound-canceling shut off! You cannot use sound-canceling with the wire plugged in.It never occurred to the designers that somebody might buy noise-canceling headphones in order to use them in an airplane!"
"This is a good headset if all you care about is sound quality.  The noise cancellation is fantastic, I can't hear anything around me.  The ear cups are very comfortable and the fit around the ear is such that even without noise cancellation turned on, the ear cups do a good job of keeping out most noise.  The bass boost also works well, and really brings out the rich lower frequencies in rock and pop music.  The battery life is phenomenal, and I can use these without charging on several international flights if I want before the headphone requires a recharge.  The headset is a little heavy and slightly larger than I prefer for my head size, but overall, it is a winner in these respects.But the headset fails on several crucial aspects, and is going back to Amazon for these reasons.The biggest problem is that the charging cord is not USB-C as advertised.  It is actually micro-usb.  Just when I am trying to get all my charging cords for my various gadgets into one standard so that I don't have to carry around an assortment of different cords, this one attempts to set me back by 5 years.  Why would any company make anything with a charger port that is not USB-C?  It is inexplicable and stupid.  And the charging cord is extremely short, so finding a good way to charge it without the headset dangling off the charging cord is difficult and tricky.The user interface is horrendous, to put it mildly.  The headset is huge and has enough real estate on it to put a hundred different buttons on it.  But instead Anker chose to put just 4 buttons on the headset, and overloaded each of the buttons with different functions depending on how long your press them, whether you press them once or double-press them, etc., etc.  You need a memory like an elephant or constantly need to carry around the manual with you to understand and use all the features of the headset effectively.  And the buttons are in places where you are very likely to hit them accidentally when you hold the cups to put the headset on and/or take it off.The sound engineers gave it their all and came up with what I would consider a winner.  But the design team decided to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by coming up with the most asinine user interface and charge port decisions.  Oh well, you win some, you lose some.  I will restart my search for better headphones, and will probably stick with a brand other than Anker."
"I have used these for a while now, during everyday use and also when I work out. The audio quality is good enough, the bass is a bit heavy for me, but that seems to be all that's available anymore that isn't cheap garbage.The fit is okay, but they are somehow too tight and loose when I work out. They will slide down over my head very easily if I work up some sweat, and if I lean forward at all. At the same time, they can be grating to wear for a long time, more than an hour or two and taking them off you feel the difference.The controls are very silly as well. Turning these on, they always start on noise canceling mode, which I do not use except for during workouts. They also play a stupid little noise to indicate what mode you are in, even though its always the same on startup, every time you change it. The noises last about 5 seconds and are always louder than what's playing, throwing you out of it. If you're going to make an idiotic design choice, just make one. Lose the mode change sound and stick to a constant mode rotation, it'll be leagues better.The buttons are very awkward to use for pausing or playing as well, as the angle is just enough to be annoying, combined with the reverse swiveling where they tilt so that the inside of the cups faces you when you take them off makes for a poor experience overall.Overall I didn't see many good options for what I prefer, so this was the best of the limited number. If you can, go for a different set."
"Bottom Line==========Don't buy this here. It might be an acceptable product, but the first one I ordered was audibly damaged. The replacement still had issues that could have been from damage. Amazon did not pack this electronic device with any kind of cushioning the first time, and the second time (pictured) was insufficient to meaningfully protect it. The shipping box used doesn't leave enough room for it.The problems===========Turning noise cancellation off caused a buzzing sound in the left ear any time the audio would go silent (either when audio source cut, like at the end of an audio/video track, OR when an active audio source went silent). This kind of issue could be either poorly isolated electronics or damage to the device.Additionally, and worse, both headsets would cause acute pain in my left ear, seemingly at random. In the couple days where I tested them I could sometimes listen for an hour or two with no issue, but then suddenly it would become painful. It's the kind of pain you experience with excessive volume, although it would happen even with the volume low and not playing a remotely loud audio source. A few of the times this happened it seemed to be in response to the audio source clipping (exceeding the maximum signal volume in the audio source). That was an issue even when the headphone volume was low enough it shouldn't have mattered.  In combination with the buzzing, I suspect electrical interference with the speaker was causing high-volume sound outside the range of audible frequencies. It seems like the headset either lacks functioning features to regulate or contain the electrical signal, either due to design or damage. Testing with an aux cord (which includes a ground wire to disperse excess charge) supports this, since it mostly negated any issues.The product itself might be alright otherwise, but I can't be sure it wasn't damaged in the shipping process.The product itself==============Audio quality overall is what I would expect for $60 wireless headphones. Testing with the aux cord showed that the speakers themselves work fine (at least when they are grounded).Noise cancellation works, but it significantly degrades the overall audio quality. It seems to just be soft noise played in the background instead of anything more sophisticated or effective. You lose a very noticeable amount of clarity if you switch back and forth. Some audio even sounds like it's coming from another room. Anything below the volume level of the ambient noise cancelling sound comes through indistinct or not at all. It also makes the audio source seem quieter. You have to turn the volume up a few notches for it to sound as loud as it does with NC off. You won't be bothered by external audio, though, which is the point. Unfortunately, and probably a deal breaker for some, the noise cancellation is only available when using bluetooth. If you plug in the headphones with an aux cord, they automatically turn off and only run on the power of the audio signal coming through the aux cord. This also means the other controls (volume, play/pause, call answer, etc) do not work when using the aux cord.I could not notice any difference at all between the bass booster being on or off. The bass was pretty unimpressive in general, especially considering it's supposed to be a selling point. The button presses to switch it on and off also only worked about 10% of the time (at least as far as the headset playing the ""on"" or ""off"" cue), so I suspect something involving the bass was broken as well."
"Good: They have great sound and last a bit after charging. I like the notification through the earpieces that tell you the charge level. Not so good: If you ever replace the earpieces, the noise cancellation also works poorly. And you will have to replace the earpieces as they will only last a year or so with continuous use. Next, the plastic parts start to break and crack along the sides of the head strap. Out of the box, they are a five, but over time, they are a 3+, as you will have to replace them when they get too bad to wear."
"I can’t buy into the hype around these ‘phones. Yes, they are comfortable. Yes, in certain situations there is a lot of bass. And yes, as of October 2024, they only cost about $40.However… overall the sound is poor. Very bad midrange, limited highs, odd soundstage. There seems to be a lot of digital sound processing going on, which might be in order to pump up the bass, but it’s at the expense of everything else. I didn’t try the noise cancellation out.For the price, probably good if you want some enclosed cans with noise cancellation, but they are not hi-fi."
"I don’t always do this, write reviews. I just don’t buy from you or your products anymore.My only issue is with the cushions, but I think I know why. I have these on almost 24/7.They’re still work, easy to connect, hold charge for days, and even if it says low on battery, don’t worry you’ll still get a good 1-2 days of use. Hold once to turn them off and on.Please make the cushions last longer!!I honestly love them and ordering another pair.I give it 3 stars because of the cushions.Thanks!"
"If you have a smaller head, this isn't for you. I have no issue with the sound, but I'm unable to make the band any smaller and sound isn't blocked completely."
"I bought 3 of these for my family, because we air travel and live overseas. I had no way of trying the cable out before we left the states, believing the noise canceling would work on the plane, as similar models did. It didn't. It works great with Bluetooth, but when watching movies on the overseas flights, the NC option DOES NOT work when you use the cable. Unfortunately, I can not return them in the country we live in. So, do not buy these if you plan to watch movies on the plane, with NC."
"So short version: don't buy these if you want them to work for longer than a few months but if you don't care about a short lifespan, these are a decent choice.Long version: I bought these in November of 2021 and have been using them for about 7 months now. Sound quality wise, these are honestly great. Audio is clear and crisp, good quality bass, and the noise canceling is super effective. Actual product quality wise, these things might as well be made of paper maché and dreams.I loved my first pair pretty much instantly but did notice that the plastic parts felt light and cheaper than even some 20 dollar headphones I've had in the past. And this was highlighted when I accidentally knocked them off my bed while getting ready for work and a two foot fall onto a carpeted floor was enough to shatter the headband part in two. Pretty disappointing. But then I reached out to Anker about what happened and in less than 24 hours, they shipped me a identical replacement pair.The 2nd pair I received was equally great sound wise. After the incident with the first pair, I was careful to really baby the 2nd pair. I'm talking making sure to never drop them, never using them outside of my office, only using the included cord to charge, making sure they weren't overcharging or left on when not in use but after just a few weeks of use, it became really apparent that the battery life was steadily dropping. A full charge went from lasting 3 or 4 days, to 2 days, to a day, to about 12 hours of use. Not insurmountable but then the noise canceling feature started turning itself on and off whenever I used them. I cleaned the buttons with a little compressed air and that just made the issue worse. And then the power button finally just stopped responding at all. If I plug them in, I can see them charging but I just literally can't turn them on.So while these sound great and Anker has great customer service, these are truly of you get what you pay for quality. I don't want to rate them 1 star because while they were working I loved them but seriously be aware that you'll probably have issues with them sometime after purchase and while you can easily get a replacement, what good is a replacement that also kicks the bucket?"
"Nice foldable headphones, but the noise canceling feature is disappointingly weak. My old Taotronics headphones were much more effective.  Stereo sound is good, but not outstanding."
"For headphones under $100, the sound quality is decent. I have had worse in this price range, but it's nothing to recommend to serious audiophiles. If you want to get a decent pair of headphones to listen to casual music or podcasts, this will deliver good results. I would give the sound quality a soild B grade.Noise cancellation also gets a solid B grade. I've had better with similar headphones from other brands with better noise cancellation. There's better noise cancellation headphones out there but these do a fair job.Where these headphones fail, I have used a half dozen other blue tooth head phones with my TV and the TV keeps them in its memory. When I turn on the headphones, it automatically connects. These headphones do not automatically connect and I frequently have to pair them again. I don't believe it's a fault of my TV, as I don't have that experience with other brands of headphones.Another issue I had once in a while, when I use them for a very long time (for most of the day) after several hours of use I hear static in the right ear. Turning them off and recharging them fixes the issue, but it is still a concern. Usually issues like this get worse with time, not better.If you want a cheap pair of disposable headphones to listen to podcasts from time to time and don't mind the pairing issues then go for these. The sound quality is fair for the price. But if I were to buy another pair of headphones, I would go with another brand."
"I’ve had them for about two months now.The sound is decent and the fit is very comfortableMy issues with them are: it’s now started not automatically connecting when I turn them on. I have to manually connect them through settings. Riding in a bus is shaky, which audibly rattles the components Inside and makes the sound cut in and out. These are $50 headphones so I feel like it shouldn’t do that. At this point I would rather save up and get a better pair from a different brand unfortunately."
"Good quality for the price, no a fan of the way the ear  pieces spin and buttons on sides are to close together"
"Pretty good sound and comfortable fit.  Some noise cancellation but nothing like Bose.  That's all about what I expected (you get what you pay for).  However, they slide out of place on my ears quite easily.  Great for sitting in a recliner or at my desk, but even walking around the house they sometimes slid off my ears.  Totally unusable at the gym when sweat is added to the equation - they slide off every time I lean over to grab weights."
"I was very sad to see these headphones die, but on ordering a different brand and experiencing how quickly that set connects to my blue tooth - I am no longer sad. From the very beginning I had difficulties with connectivity, with my new set it just happens. With this set it often took multiple tries and the headphones had to be on before the laptop or I had to reboot to connect.  It was weird.The band was loose (and not to brag or nothing but I have a big head for a gal so I was surprised at how often they fell off) even on the tightest setting - resulting in the headphones hitting the ground a lot. I bought these to garden in so my neighbors wouldn't be annoyed by my music selection. This is likely why they lasted less than a year.While they worked the sound quality was very good, and the padding was the best I've experienced. Or maybe it just felt that way because they were loose?"
"I’m not an audiophile, but I do use earphones intensively. I work full time, study part time and I’m also a weekend hobbyist (furniture making, etc). I use headphones when I’m doing all three. I also wear headphones when jogging. I bought these because my previous headphones (Klipextreme) simply stopped playing after about 3 years of intense use. I bought these because of the supposed comfort - important for me because I wear them for sometimes 6 hrs in a day. They certainly are not as comfortable as my previous headphones - they are fairly tight around the ears and press down more than I care for. Not unwearable tight and most users may not have a problem with it especially if you are wearing it intermittently for the occasional power walk, Zoom mtg or YouTube binging session. However, if you are gonna be in these for long - more than 5 hrs or so - it’s something to note.I also find that they are not as great in terms of sound quality as my previous headphones - which were fairly inexpensive. But I’m not a purist when it comes to sound, so I don’t make many complaints in that area. The noise cancellation is great though - very effective, if not a little spooky. Family and neighbors have crept up on me on many Saturdays when I’m outside wearing these. Didn’t notice them until they are jabbing me in the back annoyed by my non-response. I wear them when I use saws, sanders and routers and they do an excellent job of blocking out sound.The buttons are cool, though it’s taking me time to adjust to buttons on both cups. Apparently, the buttons are multi-function - single tap does one thing, double tap another  and long press, something else. All very high tech; all very ignorable - unless, if course you are into gadgety stuff. Truth is, the settings right out the box are more than fine for me, so I’ve had no reason to adjust. Also, I use my watch to control most of my audio, so I don’t have much reason to explore the headphones. But functionalities are there for you to explore if you are so inclined.It’s not as attractive, I think and it’s more bulky than I care for. It’s band tend to bulge off your head a little more than it had to, and it’s cups are fairly forgettable visually. Doesn’t feel or look cheap though, but no one will think they are premium headphones.A final, odd challenge I’m having is that when I jog in these headphones, I get a tinny, rattilng sound whenever my feet land. Every jolt of my landing feet creates the sound and it really is annoying to use for Audible when jogging.All in all, I was expecting more from these when I bought them, but they will do."
"Update 2/16/2024:  Just wanted to try and keep my warning about this horribly dishonest company visible.  DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES!!  These are the OLD OUTDATED MODEL!!  They are selling these for more than the newer model, the Q20i. The newer model has multi device connection, better battery life, and USB-C charge and app support!!!Avoid Anker/Soundcore products, but at the very least don't buy these old and outdated model of headphones they are trying to push.  They don't care they are selling you the old model for more than the new model. I wish I could rate this negative stars and have some flashing beacon to warn others!!  I'm writing this review in hopes it saves someone else from the absolutely HORRIBLE customer service experience I had with Anker/Soundcore.  I feel they are being deliberately deceptive with these Q20 headphones.  Read on to see why.Did you know there are 2 (TWO!!!) newer versions of the ""Q"" headphones??  The Q20+ and the Q20I.  But you would never know that from this ad would you?  No, the ""newer version of this model"" they advertise is the ""H30I"".  Well, the H30I is NOT THE SAME MODEL and does not have ANC...so it really shouldn't be consider the newer version should it?Did you know there is an App that provides additonal functionality for your Soundcore headphones?  Works with the Q20+ and the Q20I.......but not the normal Q20.  Seems like something that should be mentioned in the advertisement for the Q20 doesn't it?  But hey okay Anker....I'll take the blame for that one.  I should've read about the App closer and noticed it didn't work with Q20 (though if you are glancing at stuff and see that it works with the Q20+ and Q20I...I don't think it's a big leap to assume it worked with the Q20 as well...but whatever).So there are 2 newer versions, both new versions work with the App, both have USB C charging which is an upgrade, both new versions feature multipoint connections which is also an upgrade.  So why don't you see those listed under the ""newer version of this model""?  Because either pair of the newer versions cost LESS than these outdated Q20 headphones.  You can find the Q20+ for $39.99 on Amazon and the Q20I for $44.99, as opposed to $49 for the old Q20's.  But everyone sees the Q20 and 72k ratings and 10k sold in the last month.....so it seems like a good deal unless you actually look.  They must have a huge backstock of old Q20's they are trying to move, otherwise why would you not hype you newer/better version?So warn your friends, tell your family, do your research.  Anker/Soundcore are only out for profit, their advertising is 'shady' at best, and their customer service is horrible.Edit 1/17/2024: Now the ""newer model"" being promoted are the Space One's.  This company.....I swear!!  Look, if you're thinking about the Q20's.....DO NOT BUY!!!  If you want budget headphones from this company look at the Q20+ or the Q20i.......both have USB-C charging, can connect to 2 devices at once, and ARE CHEAPER THAN THE Q20.  But I would say skip Anker/Soundcore completely and go with TaoTronics.  Same budget headphones, but better and more honest company."
"They fit well, but the ear cups run a bit on the small side. If you wear big earrings or have large ears these might not work well for you. They are kind of heavy, so I find myself adjusting the padded headband periodically. They sound good, but I've had issues with them getting staticky and distorted on zoom calls. My computer had them listed as a phone/mic device and a stereo device - I switched to stereo and it seemed to fix it. I've had better noise cancelling from cheaper headphones, but as long as it blocks out the loud guy in the office next door I'm golden. The sound is good, but I'm not an audiophile who is really picky. I do wish they were able to be adjusted or had an equalizer though. Good battery life - they last all day at work. Wish they were USB C adapter too so I don't have to carry another cord around. I'm keeping them, but I wouldn't buy them again."
"Really like these headphones, sound quality is really good as well as noise cancellation but the bummer is they often shut off while in bluetooth and/or noise cancellation mode, even when fully charged and phone is in my hand. Hate to be petty but I often use them for sleep at night, listening to meditations and just when I'm lulling off to sleep the ""I'm shutting off"" indicator sound will wake me back up... not good, sending  back. :("
LIKE THE STYLE AND THE EASY TO USEBUT I DO NOT HEAR THE SUPER GREAT SOUND AND NOISE CANCELLING
"Overall these have good sound quality and are comfortable. The charge doesn’t last very long. Mine held a charge for maybe 10hours? The adjustable feature of them is also too big. They are fine if you are 100% upright, but if you leave down or lay down they fall off. There’s also no where to see how much charge is left, so they just died in the middle of a meeting with no heads up they were low battery."
"I've had these headphones for just over a year, and I love the sound I get from them. The active noise cancellation works pretty well, although it does tend to change the sound of the music when it's on. I usually have the active noise cancellation off, unless it's particularly noisy near me at the time.The bass is punchy and deep. The highs are crisp and clear. And the mids are also very clear, bringing out details you would usually miss in similarly priced headphones. All-in-all, the overall sound is much clearer than any other headphones I've tried in this price range, and with most music I found that the volume can get uncomfortably loud before distorting.Those were the good things I liked about these headphones. Now comes the bad. The Bass Boost is useless. With it on, bass hits lower the volume of the rest of the music, and will often distort, even at low volume. Don't bother ever using it. The low end is plentiful enough without it.I like the fact that these use a metal band over the top to help with flexibility and strength, however, the physical design of the headphones still has a fatal flaw. Each earpiece is held onto the head strap just above the swivel by a single metal rod through plastic. Just the action of taking them on and off weakens the plastic. Eventually it will crack and the earpiece will become separated from the headband. Since every other headphone in this price range also seems to have similar plasticky bits that will break with repeated use, I rated these higher than I would have otherwise.If it wasn't for the physical failure with just over a year of almost daily use, these headphones would've scored higher. As it is, they get a 3...out of 5.UPDATE: I thought I would give Soundcore another chance to redeem themselves, so I've moved up to the Q35s. At first glance, everything is better. The sound quality is better. The ANC is better (barely changes the tone of the music at all). These are also able to take advantage of a minimal EQ in the Soundcore Android app. It appears that the physical design of the product is also better. I've only had them for about a month at this point, so time will tell. I will update this review and add a full review to the Q35s once I'm beyond a year of use to let you know how it fared in comparison to the Q20s."
"When connected with a wire, they're great and I have no complaints. The noise cancelling is decent. But when wireless, if there's no sound for ~15 seconds and I play sound again, it makes a loud popping noise and plays static for 5 seconds. Sometimes this just happens randomly in periods of silence, without me even trying to play sound.  The wireless delay is also very noticeable. This makes them nearly unusable as wireless for me."
"These headphones worked great up until about about a week ago, when a persistent buzzing noise started in the right headphone every time the letter ""S"" was spoken in whatever I was listening.  Only happening on one side, so obviously something has gone awry.  Oh well, these were very cheap headphones, so I guess you get what you pay for. Guess I'll have to purchase some better quality headphones for a couple hundred bucks."
Sound good. Not small enough in the head brace length to be comfortable for me though.
Great price for headphones and they work good. After reading a bunch of the reviews I was expecting them to be louder and when using the bass boost be able to feel the bad. I was disappointed when I found that neither of those were true. The noise cancelling works for the most part. They will get me through until I can get the ones I want just disappointed I guess
I very much enjoyed the comfort and the quality of these headphones. My exasperating problem was trying to get them to be turned on for the phone. I kept on using the iron button but it did not seem to connect. So that meant I always had to go into my phone and look for it and your Bluetooth to get it connected. It was just too much work.
Lasted about 3 months then stopped working. Don't waste your time or money.
Functionally they work fine. But I’m self conscious about how I look and I’d be too embarrassed to wear these in public due to the shape of it - It doesn’t lie flat on the head.And I have a sensitive scalp so the pressure of the top part of the head piece pushes too hard down even when I adjusted it looser.
"I love JBL. We have 3 speakers of varying sizes and rave about them all so these headphones seemed like a no-brainer. I wanted them for work from home, over the ear and for the noise cancelling when I take walks. Awesome for the first. Call quality top notch. Great range for answering calls when my phone was on another level of my home. Loved all the sound settings and the talk through feature. It's not as noise cancelling as a high end pair I have used but did the job. Downsides, after wearing for about an hour, my skin under the ear pieces was soaked with sweat. I also had tenderness where my glasses sat. They would not have worked for a full 8 hour day. I also experienced an annoying base thudding sound with each step when I was walking. Tried various settings with no resolution. Returned."
"I got these headphones as an upgrade for my previous pair which cost about $70 when I bought them over a year ago. I was upgrading specifically because I need the noise cancelling and passthrough a lot more now than I did previously. I thought I was choosing the highest-end headphones JBL offered in this category. Unfortunately, the noise cancelling in these headphones was not an improvement in any way. It did help to reduce the sound of the air conditioner, at least, but did very little to block other repetitive, mechanical sounds, let alone incidental noises or voices. The passthrough, on the other hand, amplified the air conditioner and other mechanical noise so much that it was impossible to hear someone talking. Ultimately, I was better off just having neither on in both scenarios than using the headphones actual functions. It is a shame because the audio quality is quite good and they have a number of quality of life features that I did appreciate, which is why I don’t rate lower. Ultimately switched to a different pair costing only about $30 more than these and both noise cancelling and passthrough work exactly as I need them to. Honestly the difference is so dramatic that I returned these headphones as defective, because I have to believe that something was just not working properly."
These headphones sound great and can be customized to your liking with the phone app. Like many over the ear headphones these become uncomfortable to wear. I tried to purchase after market replacement cushions. There are many for the JBL Tune 770 but none for the JBL Live 770.  The mounting clips are different. If you have experienced uncomfortable headphones in the past these will also cause you discomfort. Read the others' reviews about noise cancelling options.
"They're advertised as over ear. As far as I know all over ear head phones are big, even in the pictures these look like they engulf your ears. Absolutely not true. They're tiny for over ear. Didn't bother trying out the sound but I'm sure they're good since it's jbl."
"They sound good, really like the nosie canceling. I really wish they were a little louder and more bass. But overall they are good. Had no problem with connectivity."
"I’m surprised. JBL headphones have never done me wrong, but these missed the mark. Visually the headphones are almost square on your head and feels awkward. There is cloth on the band that attracts lent.Feature wise, they're not very loud compared to my other sets (beats, soundcore, apple wired). The noise canceling is not as good as other less expensive brands. I dislike the side button that toggles to ambient. It’s too sensitive — I also have never needed to use this feature. The battery life goes quicker than any Bluetooth headphone set I’ve ever owned. The reason I’m writing this write now is because last night they just stopped connecting to my phone all together.I’m seeking to rerun these and try another brand."
"Really not that impressed with the sound quality, but otherwise everything is very good, e.g. comfortable, noise cancelling works well"
Not really impressed with bass but perhaps that’s me. The material for the ear piece does not breath so makes wearing them uncomfortable.  Again. As a child of the 70s I expected more comfort and breathability.  The bass seems artificial.  Not sure if that makes any sense but that’s what it seems like to me. Technology trying to make me think there’s bass. Probably a stupid thing to say.  They did pair up easily enough. I thought these could multi pair but that didn’t happen the one time i tried.
"Okay so I bought my first ever pair of wireless over the head headphones for 2 reasons: Sound Quality and Noise Cancellation. After reading a billion reviews on different top options, this seemed like the best for the cost. I was SHOCKED by how sleek the box I opened these in compared to how junky they looked! It says they adjust - true but not to my head or ears. The noise cancellation feature is worse than putting your fingers in your ears (I could hear my dad eating 3 rooms and 2 doors away)! Seriously…it’s really bad. And if I’m using these to watch tv while my dad across the room watches a video on his computer- I can turn the volume all the way up and it’s still bad sound quality and I can still hear everything else in the room. I don’t even have a soundbar for my TV but THAT sound quality is WAY better than these. The outside of the earphones cheap plastic, and if you move your hand anywhere close to the right earphone it triggers a sensor that turns everything off. So forget about laying down with them in, and the adjustments slide off all the time. It takes like 6hours to charge them too. I’m returning these - I gave them a shot but they’re just getting worse and I swear these are used!"
"There's good base, and the app is good especially the hearing/tuning. The Bluetooth is snappy and connected to everything from Xbox, lg tv, windows, and android.Sound issues occurred, intermittent drop out from connections. There's an odd echo especially with the ANC on.The build feels very cheap and flimsy and for 200 Dollars I expect more, I had better constricted head phones in the 90s. The ear cups are shallow as well, and narrow. The head cushion could be better but the discomfort comes from the ear area."
"These are great headphones with great sound... When it comes to bass heavy songs. They have a weird ""echo"" in the background, like I'm sometimes in a bare room with nothing but walls. Even the clickity clack sound from typing this sounds like that. This headset is not ideal for a wide range of genres. It's best for things like EDM, Dubstep, Rap, etc. Genres that have heavy bass. I don't like a ton of bass in Metal, but if I don't have it, some of the music is hard to listen to. Aside from this, they're great. The battery life is amazing. I spent 3 hours at 80% charge. It was wild."
"Sound was not there. I sent them back, it takes almost a month to get a refund.  They expect payment right away, but takes a long time to get refunded."
It was not loud enough for me I tried them for about 5 minutes put them back in box and took them back to return them the next day . It’s been a week now and I still haven’t received my money back ! It’s never happened before it’s taking way too much time and I need my money .
I've owned these headphones before they have good quality sound but they do not have any volume whatsoever and the folding ability is awful that joint or that elbow will break soon but I couldn't find another over the ear headphones that were any better so I went back to my original jbl's.. don't like the price though
"(UPDATE):A couple weeks ago, between my workout sets, I placed paused the music and placed the headphones down on my backpack to study. When I was ready to start my workout again, I looked at my phone sitting near my bag and apparently it had FaceTime called some former co-worker from years ago. In another workout session the headphones was trying to access Siri on my phone. I also forgot to mention in my original review that I can't use these headphones to make calls. No one can hear me at all with these headphones.  Finally, and unfortunately, I got caught in the rain riding my bike wearing these headphones for a couple miles. The headphones completely stopped working as soon as the rain started and are now will turn off moments after turning them on and will not hold a charge.  I know they are not rated as waterproof, but I have been caught in the rain with my SONY WH headphones at least half a dozen times and they work perfectly fine. So, a disappointment. Haven't even had these headphones for more than a couple months.______________________________________________________________________The audio is ok but often sounds like I’m listening from a metal can.There’s barely any padding for top of head.I had to turn off the feature whereby the music pauses if you take off the headphones because it kept pausing music WHILE I was wearing the headphones.Someone decided it was more important to have the JBL indent on the side of the headphones instead of making it smooth so the touch function can work better. See Sony WXM design. As a result, I find it very frustrating trying to pause music, fast forward/behind etc.It’s not a bad product. It’s just unfortunate it wasn’t designed by more competent people."
Whe walking I heard popping noise and any movement true the loose plastic
"But didn't fit well slid off my head when moving, and the hinges creaked a lot.  The pass through non noise canceling was annoying and really amplified outside sound in poor quality."
Music and noise cancelling sound good but I went with a different brand that had the same quality but for literally half the price
"Perhaps I got a ""bunk"" pair but there is zero noise cancellation beyond a slight muffling effect that is common of having head phones on."
I have bought them one time and had to get a replacement because of the left side being wobbly and then now the rights side is. Also the first ones didn’t want to get out of being in noise canceling
"Too bad they hurt my ears, because they had good noise cancelling, close to my Apple headset."
"The sound on these headphones was incredible. Crisp, clear, great bass and mid tones, good comfortable fit, etc. Unfortunately, after 6 weeks I don't know what sound I am going to get when I turn them on. Sometimes extreme bass, extreme treble, no bass, muffled mid tones, volume normal, other times drops by 30-40%, once in a great while the sound is normal as when I bought them. I constantly have to mess with the equalizer every time I use them. Very frustrating. Guess I should have bought the warranty. I was looking at buying a JBL blue tooth speaker, not sure now after this experience."
"Appeared to be of good quality when opened. I have had other JBL products in the past and they have always been good. However, one of the ear speakers (the side with the controls) stopped working very soon after I tried them and I could not get the headset to work properly. I had to return for a refund."
The volume only goes so far on these and its low. SUPER disappointed.
"They worked initially and seemed to work great! I was pleased with these for gaming and listening to music. Now? I will spend time troubleshooting my sound instead of jumping into a game with my friends. NOT COOL! Wish I could return these, but of course, I am about a month too late! I'd love to get rid off all 3 of these -- yep, bought two for my kids as well."
Unit worked fine for 2 weeks. After that the bluetooth link become spotty and unreliable. 4 weeks later the headset won't even pair with any bluetooth device! Horrible product!
It’s great sound. But didn’t fit the head right
"It is not a good article because it does not comply with the description. They have bad sound and it does not work at all. Noise cancellation seems to me that it is a very bad product for such a high price. If you have another option, take it, it is surely better than this one. It is a total deception that does not comply with the requirements of the product description."
"Touch control on outside of headphones too sensitive and constantly causes accidental pauses, accidental phone dialing, etc. Sound quality also not vastly better than JBL Tune 600. Would not recommend to buy"
"My Bose QC-15's were getting old, over 10+ years 9f service.JBL has a decent name, price was cheaper than the Bose - give em a shot.Received, put them on and my jaw dropped. I thought I was listening through a pillow. No thanks."
"The JBL Live 770NC impresses in part with truly exceptional battery life that is providing me with uninterrupted listening sessions that outlast many competitors.Comfort-wise, they also hold their own against other top noise-canceling headphones, ensuring long-term wear without discomfort, again, impressive. However, the sound quality is straight up disappointing, characterized by overpowering bass and a lack of refinement, detracting from the overall listening experience to the point where I want to reach for other headphones.  This is truly the most disappointing area for me, as the boomy bloated bass just trounces the sound, and it just isn't done well.  I will update this review if these headphones require a ""break-in"" as the sound may improve over time with some use.Additionally, the overly sensitive touch controls, particularly the personal assistant button on the outside of the right earcup, is prone to accidental activation, posing an inconvenience. Despite its remarkable battery life and lasting comfort, JBL's Live 770 NC falls short in delivering a balanced sound profile and user-friendly touch controls, making it difficult to fully endorse, and a real disappointment for me."
"updated review:In 7 months, the right speaker developed a persistent static noise.  This is likely due to some frayed wire or bad components.  I never use these outdoors, and use them at night in bed listening to tv shows.  Really disappointed, but I will contact support for warranty repair.original review:I've been using these the past 3 months to replace my cheap wireless (BT) over the ear headphones -- the JBL Tune 510BT.  I figured these would be a much better headphone and audio experience.  So far, here are my thoughts:Compared to the JBL Tune 510BT, the audio is subjectively better, but to my ears, it's not 10x better, especially considering the price: $30 vs $200.  I would say the audio quality for most people would be roughly the same.  Compared to the Sennheiser open back headphones, the default audio quality when listening to a variety of genres of music is just not there.  However, you can adjust the audio EQ and settings to really come close.  Regardless, for the average person, the audio should be fine.  But, here's where these headphones shine:1) Overall quality and finish is superb.  These feel like high end, high quality headphones.  They are substantially better than the JBL Tune 510BT, and I would say feel even more solid than the Sennheisers.2) The fit on these are much better than the cheap JBL Tunes.  These feel nice over my ears, and are not overly snug over my head.  The ear cups are larger and fit over my ears better than the Tunes, but it's not as open or wide as the Sennheisers.  The Sennheisers definitely feel more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time.  However, I do love how these ear cups can rotate out by 100 degrees.  It helps with the fitment over the ears, and also makes it easier to stow away.3) The ANC and ambient noise features are really good.  In fact, with ANC, I almost cannot hear my husband unless he touches me to get my attention.4) The software controls from the app are great.  It allows for a bunch of customization and updates.5) Finally, the battery life on these are AMAZING.  Hands down, the best feature of these.  There are times when I go almost a month without charging them.  I use these almost every night in bed for an hour or so watching anime.  They also charge REALLY fast, and I can get enough charge to last me the night in just several minutes.Lastly, I do love the ability to plug these into an audio jack.  Why you would do that, I don't know.  I would give these a 5 star rating, but really, it comes to value.  And, that's a harder proposition.  My Tunes were much cheaper than these, and worked fine for the most part."
"I purchased the JBL Live 770NC headphones after reading all the reviews because I needed a pair of noise-canceling headphones. They're decent, but they definitely are NOT noise-canceling. After using them for just over a week, I’ve noticed that when my husband watches TV while I’m working on my laptop and listening to music, I can still hear the TV—even though the volume isn’t very high. Unfortunately, I will be returning them."
"Unless you have JBL app installed you'll ether have a headache from the Noise cancelling or have to listen to white-noise (ambient aware feature) The only way to turn off ambient aware is by installing an JBL app on your phone. There is not function to turn off white-noise from the headphones numerous buttons.Long pressing ANC button does not turn off ""ambient sound control"", long pressing multi-function does not turn off ""ambient sound control""Do not get headphones with ""ambient aware""One start because at this price, I'd expect headphones without white noise"
The build quality is much better than its sound. They are very far from Sony XM1000 series in sound quality.
The On-button light is too bright for bed-time use.The head-band padding on top of head is not comfortable due to no ergonomic curve of the inside bar.
"Hi, i received the headphone with bad quality even with the bad used quality. Quality is not as expected."
"I've owned the Sony 1000XM3, H900N, and the Bose QC35 II.  I couldn't wait for the XM4 to come out because of the multipoint Bluetooth (I'll get to that a little later).  The sound is great once it's been adjusted, and the noise cancelling in the XM4 is better than both the XM3 and the QC35 II.  However, there are quite a few things that are very poorly implemented and basically unusable.Sound: A-First off the XM4, XM3, and H900N all have better and brighter sound than the QC35 II.  Out of the box, the sound is a little dull and the mids / vocals are a little mushy.  With the XM4, I needed to tweak it in the Headphones app using the EQ to get it to the place that I wanted it, but once it was there, it was great.  A small but pleasing improvement in the XM4 is that the headphone voice announcements are at a much higher quality.  The XM3 announcements are low fidelity and low bandwidth whereas the XM4 headphone voice is very crisp and hi-fi.  Sony also replaced the high-pitched beep with a slightly longer but more pleasant sounding bell for feedback.  However, I actually prefer the beep because it's faster.Noise cancelling: A-When I first put on the XM4 and turned them on, I was surprised by the audible hiss from the noise cancelling.  It wasn't present with the XM3.  I think this is because they have cranked up the noise cancelling in the XM4.  I have air purifiers running in my house, and the XM4 does a better job of cancelling out the noise almost completely.  The XM3 still has some leakage.  The XM3 is just as good as the Bose in noise cancellation, and the XM4, though a little hissy and is a slightly bit better.  The drawback to this is that it can feel like it's creating a slight pressure in my head that increases over time.Multipoint Bluetooth: FThis was the feature I had been waiting for.  The awesome noise cancellation and sound of the XM3, but with the ability to stream two devices at once.  FAIL!  I had been eagerly anticipating this and checking daily for the release of the XM4.  I was so excited to get them...only to be sorely disappointed.  Though the device will connect to two devices simultaneously, it actually DISCONNECTS when one of the two devices is activated.  So it's not true multipoint Bluetooth.  Sony advertises that the multipoint Bluetooth is seamless.  This is true if they mean you don't have to press any buttons to disconnect from a device.  However, the way it manages connections is very poor.  I have to put the XM4 into pairing mode if I've connected to my phone in order for it to play audio from my computer.  If I don't do this, it doesn't recognize that my computer is playing sound, and then doesn't stream the sound.  Even though it shows on my computer as connected, it doesn't show up in my sound options as a device that I can use for audio.  I have to turn them off, put them into pairing mode, and then reconnect in order to get the sound to play.  If a call comes in on my phone, the headphones actually disconnect from the computer to switch to the call - and the headphone voice announces that they have disconnected, super annoying and not seamless.  With the QC35 II, I could use both at the same time, with the phone being connected at the low-quality voice mode and my computer at the high quality music mode.  They had 2 years to get the multipoint Bluetooth right and they totally failed.  So it ends up that I have to turn the XM4 off and re-pair them just like I had to with the XM3.  I've had to do this a number of times, and I haven't quite figured out all the exact situations where I have to re-pair them.  With the XM3, I knew if I wanted to switch devices, I would have to do it.  But with the XM4, I haven't put my finger on all of them just yet.  At any rate, the switching of devices is very clunky and definitely not worth upgrading for.  I have $40 headphones that implement multipoint Bluetooth better than the XM4. I'm stunned and disappointed that Sony hasn't been able to get multipoint Bluetooth to work right.Comfort: ACompared to the XM3, the XM4 are slightly softer and a bit more comfortable right when I put them on.  The XM3 are still pretty comfortable, but the earpads are definitely firmer and a little tighter.Controls: BI totally prefer the actual buttons on the QC35 II to the touch controls.  Sometimes if I want to change the volume and I slide my finger at a slightly off-angle, it will skip tracks instead.  It's a small annoyance.  On the plus side, the physical buttons do make a fairly audible click that travels through the headphone, whereas the touch controls are a little quieter.In-call: DOne thing the Bose QC35 II does is that when I'm on a call, it knows to automatically turn on ambient sound mode so I can hear myself talking.  Neither the XM3 nor the XM4 figured out that this is a useful and great feature, so they don't do it.  If I want it, I have to press the button to switch to it, listen to the announcement, and then it comes on.  Then when I'm done, I have to press the button and wait for it to go into NC off, ambient sound off, and then press the button again and wait for the announcement that the NC is once again activated.  Super slow and awkward and unusable.  So instead, I pull one of the earcups off my ear so I can hear myself speak.  When I first was using the Sony's for calls, I was finding that my voice was tired and my throat sore at the end of the day.  Someone told me that I talked really loud when I was on the phone.  I didn't even know this because the headphones do a really great job of keeping outside sound out, so I was talking at a level so I could hear myself when I was wearing them.  I asked Sony support about this, and the headphones just don't do this.  Fail.Auto-mute: FSony created a feature where the headphones will automatically mute the audio source if it detects that you're talking.  Nice in concept - terrible in practice.  I just turned it off and left it off.  If I'm listening to music and sneeze or make a noise, the headphones will interrupt what I'm listening to and mute it for the amount of time I've specified in the app - 15 seconds is the shortest amount of time.  So I have to wait for it to unmute so that I can continue listening.  What's even more annoying is when I'm using the auxiliary cable in wired mode - again, this is because the multipoint Bluetooth implementation is such a pain and sucks, if I'm on a video conference and I have the headphones on to use the noise cancelling, if I talk, it mutes the audio stream for 15 seconds so I can't hear what anyone in the conference is saying.  So I then have to turn the headphones off in order to interact with the conference in any meaningful way.Miscellaneous:I don't understand why Sony doesn't just include a headphone cable with a microphone.  With all the video-conferencing I do, and the terrible multipoint Bluetooth implementation, I end up using the auxiliary headphone cable a lot.  It's much faster and convenient for me to switch the plug from my computer to my phone rather than dealing with the horrible Bluetooth switching.  The auxiliary cable Sony provides doesn't have a microphone, so I have to hold my phone close to my mouth if I'm using the cable.  I ended up buying an auxiliary cable with a microphone and some playback controls on it and it works great.  Here's another really poorly thought-out thing: upon pairing the new XM4 with the app, it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on the headphones.  This is only upon the initial startup of the headphones.  How on earth can I give meaningful feedback about the headphones on my first use?  It took me to Sony's site to do the survey, and I decided I would complete it later, only to discover that it had timed out, and now I'm not able to provide feedback through that mechanism.Conclusion:All the hype about multipoint Bluetooth is a big letdown with the real product.  If that's the reason you're thinking about upgrading, don't do it.  The rest of it is pretty similar to the XM3.  Some nice little features added, but nothing earth shattering.  The new features on paper were everything that I wanted that was missing from the XM3.  In practice, the XM4 implementation of these things just did not hit the mark.  I soooo wanted to love these headphones, so that I could stop looking for headphones.  As it stands, they totally weren't worth the upgrade and I will most likely be sending these back.  Sadly, they are not as advertised."
"I spent more on these headphones than I ever have on a pair of headphones before, so I was hoping that on top of the normal duties of a pair of headphones, that they would also wash my dishes and walk my dog for me ect. To be fair, they are probably the best headphones I've ever owned (which they should be as they're like double the price of the last 'expensive' pair I bought), but they didn't really wow me either.The noise cancelling and sound quality is generally fine. I'm a bassist, so if the bass is emphasized, I'm happy. I don't really notice the bass to be particularly heavy. I can usually distinctly hear bass lines if I make a conscious effot, but they don't tend to overpower (which I prefer, but I know a lot of people don't). I haven't messed around with the equalizer much so I can't speak to that. My issue with the sound quality is in the ambient sound mode. The ambient sound mode makes the ambient sounds sound horrible. This is largely my first experience with noise cancelling, so I don't have anything to compare it to, maybe we just don't have the tech yet to amplify sounds and not make them sound tinney and horrible. But yeah, it legit sounds like I'm listening to the world through a tin can. As a result I rarely use the ambient sound mode (this mode has noise cancelling but allows for some noises to come through) and rather just use the noise cancelling mode when I want to be aware of my surroundings.These headphones have several annoying features that if I knew I'd dislike so much I would've gone for another pair of headphones. First, the touch controls. Apparently there are some people out there who like the touch controls, but are they really necessary when buttons exist? Touch controls only make sense when there is a screen you can look at or at least some sort of tactile cue that reassures you that you're doing the thing you want to be doing. The two most important functions (on/off, and sound cancelling level) are controlled by real buttons, but pause, skip, and volume are all controlled by touch controls on the outside surface of the right headphone. Unless you are sitting perfectly still these are pretty much impossible to use and can result in unwanted pauses and skips. The #1 time I wear these is when I walk/run my dog. I cannot use the touch controls when I'm running and can occasionally use them while I'm walking, but they tend to be very imprecise. So to turn up the volume I have to do the motion like 3 times until I accidentally skip the song instead. This isn't a rare problem where most of the time I can use them fine. This happens the vast majority of times I try to use the touch controls when I'm moving - I'm actually pleasantly surprised if I can do the correct gesture while walking. Some people may argue that I have failed to learn how to use the touch controls (I've had these headphones for 6+ months), but there really shouldn't be a learning curve for being able to pause music - this is a design failure.I also wear these to the gym quite often. The other problem that I have with the touch controls is that I cannot do any sort of exercise with my arms overhead (pull ups, overhead press, ect.) with these on because my shoulder will touch the outside surface and pause or skip. I usually end up taking them off for my set.So, if you're the least bit hesitant about the touch controls, I'd say check out your other options because if I knew they'd be this frustrating I would've bought different headphones.The second overall problem I have with these headphones is how much talking they do. So you'd think, turn them on and play music, right? No, its turn them on, it says ""Power on"". Then it tells you ""Bluetooth connected"" - cool, good to know I can now turn on my music and listen... Unless I have a second device nearby and it says ""Bluetooth second device connected"". Then (because I'm walking my dog away from my second device) it plays a sound to tell me that device has been disconnected. Then I change the noise cancelling level... ""Ambient sound"" which sounds bad so I press the button again... ""Ambient Sound control off"". The robot talks so damn slow, it's literally like a minute of messing around before I can just listen to my music. Y'all really couldn't abbreviate any of this or make it talk faster? And if I want to change the noise cancelling level while listening to music or a podcast I best pause the song otherwise I'll miss half of it listening to the robot tell me what I know I'm doing and can hear the difference between. This is all a bit of an exaggeration, but it's enough to frustrate me. For a $300 pair of headphones I think I have the right to be impatient.Another minor thing that might not actually be the fault of the headphones is they have trouble with certain apps. Sometimes I'll press play on my phone but it won't play through the headphones for like 10 seconds or sometimes more (which is enough time to make me think something is wrong). Again, the headphones could be innocent here - they tend to work fine with the Apple Music app, but not the Apple Podcast app. I'm leaning towards blaming the app.Also the headphones generally comfy to wear. I have a small head, and they can fall off if I'm laying down but its not a huge issue.Overall, these are good headphones, but they have some design choices that make the headphones annoying to use which is frustrating for the price. If these break I won't buy another pair and would likely look for ones that don't have touch control, but I didn't think these issues were enough of a problem to get a refund or anything."
"I have owned the Bose QC 35 series I (the originals) for four years now, and just recently replaced the ear pads since they finally deteriorated. I figured after four years there has to be some serious improvements in noise cancelling technology, and since the WH-1000XM3 model got so many good reviews I figured these would be awesome. So I pre-ordered them.I pulled them out of the box and followed the very quick connect process of downloading the app and using it to pair to my phone. It downloaded a firmware update automatically while I fiddled around with some settings briefly and listened to some music. Super easy, awesome.The sound is very impressive. Punchy kick drum (I listen mostly to rock/metal) and nice bright sound. I quickly settled on a slightly customized version of the included Bright preset.But things quickly went downhill from there.After using the headphones for a bit, the touch controls became frankly annoying and easily susceptible to mistakes (I triggered track skips multiple times just by removing and putting the headphones back on). The volume adjustment is especially tedious...if you want to raise or lower the volume significantly you have to swipe it up or down a large number of times because the volume adjustment is done in small increments. With the Bose QC 35 and its dedicated buttons, you just quickly push the buttons. Simple.I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to pair the headphones with my laptop, reading the guide in the app and doing some web searching, thinking it must be provided by one of the two dedicated buttons like on the Bose QE 35s. Nope. It must be done with the app. In fact, everything has to be done with the app except whatever you have the custom button configured to do, and the power. On the Bose I just have to slide the power button, and it goes into pairing mode. Simple.The above are honestly smaller issues that you could probably put up with since the sound these produce is so good. However, the deal breaker for me was when I connected them with the included wire to the controller on my Roku Ultra to enjoy some TV time after a long day. I always watch movies and TV with headphones. To my horror they produced a clearly audible hissing sound that is incredibly distracting. I turned them off and on again, disconnected and reconnected the cable. No change, still the hissing sound. My Bose don't produce this sound. Ugh.After listening to them for a couple hours I had a slight headache and felt fatigued, almost nauseous. I know some people are affected differently by the noise cancelling technology, but I don't get this from my Bose, even after listening to them all day.Additionally, speaking of noise cancelling, I compared my Bose QC 35s to these, and I couldn't tell the difference between the noise cancelling. They sound the same to me. :shrug: I'm sure you could tell the difference with laboratory equipment though.All-in-all the sound these produce is really good, and the noise cancelling is great (although I can't tell the difference from my Bose QC 35 Series I). But they have 1) lots of annoyances in the touch controls instead of dedicated buttons, 2) the fact that the app is required to do everything (including pairing) except turning them off and activating the custom button, 3) the hissing on the wired connection to my Roku Ultra, and 4) the fatiguing after listening to them.I'll be returning them."
"Because I do so many meetings over Teams (I'm a professional software trainer), I thought it would be time to finally invest in a really good headset. Up until now, I'd been using a $50 over-ear set by MPOW with a really nice boom mic. It was great, but it wasn't wireless, certainly wasn't portable, and didn't have the audio quality I'd want when listening to music.I thought that by splurging more than $300 on a Sony product I'd get something that was beyond all of my expectations. I was almost right, but so very wrong in other ways.CASE: Let's start here. The case is as slim as can be, very high-quality build, looks nice, feels nice, keeps everything protected. Excellent design here with one flaw: you can't really charge the headphones while they're snug in the case; they don't fold up the right way.APP: To use most of the features, Sony requires you to download an app to your smartphone. That wasn't a big deal and the app was easy to figure out. It crashed twice on me (once during the first setup, again the next day). It offered some location-based services but I declined and it never asked me again. It wanted me to sign up for a free trial of some 360° music service -- not sure what that is, but I skipped it. I was disappointed that there wasn't a PC version of the app. For example, if I needed to switch which device the headphones were connected to, I can only do that from my phone -- that means my phone always has to be one of the two devices. There's no way to control the advanced features, or the equalizer, from the PC.PAIRING: Bluetooth pairing was hit or miss, over and over again. If I were only pairing to my phone, I think it would be fine. But I wanted to also pair it to my desktop and laptop. The device supports pairing to two devices at the same time -- which was great -- but nearly every time I wanted to switch devices I had to literally turn off bluetooth so the headset would ""let go"". Other times, upon reconnecting, the mic wouldn't work. Once, which turned out to be the final straw for me, was when I could not get the headset to work in Teams no matter what I tried, even though it worked fine a few hours earlier. (For context: I literally train employees and other trainers on how to use Teams, so I very much know what I'm doing.)SOUND QUALITY: Let me say that the sound quality IS exceptional. I had a blast listening to all my favorite songs streaming from my phone or laptop. I really can't understate the quality, base and treble. And the ANC (active noise cancelling) was AMAZING. I could be sitting right next to a whole house fan and not hear it. I was blown away.RANGE: Twice during the day I tried walking around while on a call. It wasn't until I went downstairs that anyone said the quality of my voice had dropped. If I was less than 25 feet from the device, everything was great.BATTERY LIFE: After a day of use it was down to about 50% and that impressed me. Then I watched TV and ate dinner and later that evening I put on the headphones and realized that the battery dropped to 10%. I thought the system had an auto-off feature but something didn't quite work.CHARGING: So after my surprise drop in battery, I plugged it into my desktop with a USB C cable I already had. A little light on the headset turned red. When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to learn that the headphones were still at 10%. Apparently the USB C cable I use to charge my mouse won't charge the headphones. I guess you need to use the cable it ships with? I'm not sure what the deal was here, but that was pretty annoying.CONTROLS: I found the touch/gesture controls to be mostly intuitive. Pro Tip: If you swipe up and hold your finger, the volume slowly increments up. Once, however, I accidentally hung up a Teams call when I was trying to adjust the volume. I love the feature that let's me hear ambient sound by cupping my hear -- super cool. Tap the power button to hear the battery level -- very nice touch! However, there's one extremely important flaw in the controls that I was shocked to discover. THERE IS NO MUTE BUTTON. The ONLY way to mute your mic during a call (Teams, phone, Zoom, etc) is to use the mute button on the desktop/phone. The headset, whose very first bullet is ""clear hands-free calling"", has five built-in microphones, and a dedicated gesture to use Alexa... doesn't have a damn mute button. Sadly, the successor to this (the 1000XM5) has the same flaw.Individually, the issues I raised wouldn't be enough for me to return the headset or give it a low rating. But for a $350 purchase, I expect it to be able to do what it says correctly. I expect a mute button. I expect it to power off when not in use. I expect any generic USB cable to work. I expect to be able to join a meeting without fussing with bluetooth.I'd totally keep this if all I wanted it for was to listen to music."
"...but I didn't. I have the previous model WH-1000XM3’s and I compared these side by side. For weeks I went back and forth with fit, sound, and some of the features, but at the end of the day, the cons outweighed the pros for me. Bottom line up front…if you can get a hold of the XM3’s for the low, I suggest getting them over the XM4’s; but if you care to read my review, by all means!First the fit--the headband and the ear cups seem to have a tad bit less material for the headphones to sit comfortably on my head. They felt loose, and I felt like I was constantly trying to find that sweet spot on my head. Now, I will say that I do not think this would be a problem for folks who have larger heads; however, I don't have a big head so I felt like with any slight movement the headphones would move out of place. As such, I was constantly adjusting the headphones. This is unlike the XM3’s which felt nice and snug on my head--they hugged my head.Second, the sound--ABSOLUTELY amazing! These headphones sound great...BUT...they aren't as good as my XM3’s. They have a more neutral sound, with a slight loss in mids and highs as compared to the XM3's. I'm not a bass head, so I don't desire in your face (ear) bass. I like to listen for mids and highs, as well as instrument separation--basically how big is the soundstage?! I would constantly switch between the XM3’s and the XM4’s to compare the sound quality, and while there is slightly more bass with the XM4's, I would have to turn the headphones up more to hear all of the instrumentation. When I immediately switched to the XM3’s I would have to turn the volume down. Keep this in mind…I have the XM3’s so I have something to compare it to; If I didn’t, I would probably think the XM4’s sound absolutely amazing. But since I do, I still give the overall sound quality to the XM3’s.Third, the features--first off, the noise cancellation is absolutely amazing! I don’t have anything else to compare it to, aside from the MX3’s, but just put it this way…I felt horrible when my 6 year old was calling for me for about 5 minutes at bedtime—yeah I thought he was asleep! Even within close distance I can’t hear people talking to me or noises until I activate the ambient sound our speak-to-chat enables. I wouldn’t say they’re a vast improvement over the MX3’s…as a matter of fact I want to say they perform slightly (and veery slightly at that) worse than the MX3’s. BUT…they’re still great! I would NOT let this sway you from getting the MX4’s.I thought the new features were great at first. Aside from all the customizations, the main selling point for me was the multi(2)-device connection ability with the updated Bluetooth profile, as well as the speak-to-chat  feature. I thought I would like the multi-device connection, however at the end of the day I mainly stuck to my phone. I actually had issues with toggling between my computer and my phone because I have studio monitors connected to my M-Audio Air controller to my computer. This required me to change the audio output preference on my computer in order to take advantage of the multipoint connection. Granted, this is just my setup. Others probably won’t have this issue. So, with that, the multi-device connection would be ideal for someone who will be listening to music on their laptop, and taking calls on their phone.The speak-to-chat feature…this one is tough. While I love the fact that I can just start talking and it mutes my music/video as well as turn the ambient sound on immediately, I hated the fact that I if I coughed or made some other noise it would automatically trigger the mute and ambient sound. So, for those that love to sing or hum along with their tracks you’ll want to leave this feature off. Overall, I’m pretty sure most people will leave this feature off, so there’s really no point in having it. Once muted, the music/video does not resume, even after being silent for a period of time. You have to double tap the ear cup in order to restart the music/video.While I know there are a lot more features for these headphones, I did not spend the time to really dive into the other features. The mentioned three points were the main things I was looking for in these headphones.Opinions are subjective. You definitely need to consider your wants/needs from these headphones. That said…these are awesome headphones, but for me, the cons outweighed the pros."
"I've owned a lot of headphones over the years; most of them wired, without any noise cancellation. I think ANC is a great innovation, though, and my first pair of noise canceling headphones were the Sony MDR10RNC's back in 2015. These didn't sound all that great, but I only bought them for use on airplanes, and they looked and felt really nice. That combined with the noise canceling made up for the lack of sound quality. I actually loved these headphones for what they were, which was a way for me to feel less fatigued after a very long flight, while also allowing me to enjoy the on-board IFE.Fast forward to today, and I've just spent $350 on a new pair of Sony wireless noise canceling headphones. With five more years of R&D under Sony's belt, a much higher price tag than I paid for my MDR10's (they were about $140) and great reviews around the net, I had high expectations. For this kind of money, I expected not just a set of cans I could use on a plane but some everyday hi-fi headphones for music too. Unfortunately, they just don't sound very good, even with noise canceling off. I've tried them wired, wireless, on and off (you can use them turned off when wired), with noise canceling on and off, and using both AAC and LDAC codecs. The problem seems to be the headphone drivers, which is fundamental to the hardware.I probably should have known better. These are mass market headphones, and even at fairly high prices like this, people today don't seem to be looking for accurate sound reproduction; they're looking for a lot of bass. These have that; I wish I'd seen this before buying but headphones.com (no affiliation!) tested their frequency response and found a ""v-shaped"" curve that emphasizes bass and to a certain extent treble. Unfortunately, the mid-range is where most of the music is, so really good-sounding mid-range and flat frequency response is the sign of a good headphone. These do have a cell phone app where you can set a custom EQ, and I did that. Unfortunately, the mid-range reproduction in these headphones just isn't very good - it sounds tinny and harsh, so the flatter you make the frequency response, the worse it sounds. These just aren't very good headphones in terms of sound quality, and I expected a lot better for $350.In fact, I also own a pair of Cowin E7 Pro's, which are $60 Chinese wireless ANC headphones, and they sound almost as good as these. I had bought those literally the day before a flight because I found out I wasn't going to be able to plug in my headphones to an IFE system, and they were cheap enough to be an impulse buy. But they're totally fine for that price; they don't sound great but they're not absolutely awful either, they also have a ton of bass and their noise cancellation is adequate. For almost six times the price, I would expect these Sonys to sound a lot better, and they just don't. I was trying to upgrade and I'm not sure I really have.As for the active noise canceling itself, yes, it's pretty good. My MDR10's noise canceling was pretty good too, five years ago. So are the Cowin's. Maybe I'm just more picky in terms of sound quality than noise canceling, but I feel like every ANC headphone cancels noise pretty well, though not perfectly - these are still tuned mostly for jet engines, and you're still going to hear stuff in higher registers. The WH-1000XM4's do have a slight hiss in ANC mode that means you probably won't want to use ANC at home. I noticed this right away and tested my other headphones to see if they did the same thing, since I hadn't noticed it before. And they do, but the frequency of the hiss on the 1000XM4's is a bit higher. It's not louder, just higher, so that's probably why I immediately noticed it.Lastly, I am not a fan of the build quality of these, especially compared to my MDR10's - which, again, are also Sony ANC headphones and were much cheaper. The MDR10's look and feel premium, even today. The 1000XM4's look and feel like cheap headphones. They're all black plastic and just don't have the premium look or feel that I'd expect from a $350 set of headphones. They also seem to have a higher clamping force that makes them a little uncomfortable after an hour or two of listening. It's not noticeable at first but becomes noticeable pretty quickly.If these cost $150, I'd say they were worth it. I do not think they are for $350.I am seriously considering returning mine."
"++++++++++++++++EDIT/UPDATE 2:++++++++++++++++The left earcup housing broke today (on Black Friday 2021 too, lol), and I've had these pair for ONLY about 11 months. For this price I expected much MUCH better durability! :/ See pics for reference.I dont know if this is related to the hardware issues posted in EDIT 1 below. The original Review was 4 stars. now its down to 1. Sigh.Probably I'm NOT going to buy these back again now. Might go for the Bose Quit Comfort ones... Which sucks, I loved most of the UX of these while they worked.++++++++++++++++Back to original review+edits:++++++++++++++++*************************EDIT/UPDATE:*************************After more than 6 months, a few issues have cropped up:1. Sometimes, the touch interface controls dont respond at all - the volume or skip forward/back for several seconds and then it comes back. When this happens, sometimes the little beep is there and sometimes not, but in either case, the actual volume or skip action doesnt get performed. This is not a thing that happens with my $25 earphones ever on the same exact devices.2. Sometimes it randomly disconnects from my PC or phone for a few seconds and then almost immediately reconnects. Its intermittent and hopefully, it wont keep happening. Havent found a common circumstance.3. The Speak-to-chat randomly re-enables itself even though I have it permanently disabled via the app. Super annoying to have to disable it every few weeks.4. The volume beeps and the ""Your device is connected/disconnected"" audio notifs are QUITE annoying and there's no way to permanently turn them off. Thanks Sony! Now whenever I move out of range of my phone/tablet/PC and it gets disconnected and then reconnected (which is frequent for my office use), I have to listen to those annoying messages EVERY SINGLE TIME!! Super annoying. Many have requested this feature in forums, but Sony doesnt respond, because who cares!All these annoyances have made me take off a star. Might take off another if the hardware issues continue to pile up.***************Back to original review:***************I am not that nit picky about sound quality, but, 2020 being what it was, I found myself at home all the time and needing a really good pair of headphones. Normally, I wouldnt go for a $278 pair of headphones, but after using these for about 45 days, I'd say they're definitely worth every penny.So, here's my list of things I care about, in the order that I care about them and the performance of these headphones on those (keep in mind these are my first ""high-end"" i.e. > $100 headphones):1. COMFORT: Pretty good. While they arent ultra-light, and they don't ""disappear"" from your head, the overall comfort is great. The cup pressure around the ears is uniformly distributed and just enough to not 'pinch' any part of the head too much. The amount of weight carried by the top band isnt so much that you feel it after just couple of hours. Yes, after 3 or so hours, you definitely want to 'free' your ears for a few minutes but that's about it. Ear cup pads are soft and comfortable, but not exactly luxurious, which I expect in this price range to be honest. The top band's padding is good enough at least for now, I hope it remains so 6 months from now too. Will update if necessary.  ---------8/10---------2. SOUND QUALITY: Pretty good again. I'm no audiophile, but I didnt notice any glaring problems with the sound. I listen to all kinds of music, but mainly instrumentals while WFH, podcasts while doing chores and Netflix to unwind, and I like the clarity that they provide for that kind of broad general use. The Sony app also has some great options for the EQ - one of the best I've seen.  ---------8/10---------4. WIRELESS OPERATION: Absolutely LOVE the fact that it can support two devices simultaneously. This - if not supported - is *almost* a deal breaker for me. I need to be able to take calls and listen to music from my phone but also take Zoom calls on my computer without having to disconnect and reconnect. Connecting/disconnecting is easy and not annoying. Signal strength is pretty good, could be better - sometimes I lose the signal in the kitchen which is only ~20 feet and 2 walls away.  ---------9/10---------3. NOISE CANCELLATION: Very good. Both the passive and active are good, but what makes it great is the app control where you can set all sorts of options like ambient noise level to keep, speak-to-chat etc. It has many more options that I dont use, but more optionality = always good. 90% of the time I am just using the passive since its good enough, but I've had some very loud construction or traffic noises in my vicinity and the ANC is pretty good - it takes what would have been almost unbearable to barely and annoyance level.  ---------9/10---------4. CONTROL INTERFACES (BUTTONS) AND APP: This is quite important for daily use obviously, and they've made the right decisions IMO in terms of how complicated the button and touch interface is on the physical headphones and how much there is to control through the Sony app. There are two physical buttons on the left cup for Power and Custom and the right one has a touch interface for skip fwd/bkwd and volume up/down. Minimal and functional. The Sony app on the other hand is chock full of fancy options and customizable control settings. I dont use most of these yet, but love the fact that these exist. If one day we can all hang out together in public once again, I'm sure the map feature where it remembers your level of Ambient sound to let through depending on location would be a great option to program and use.  ---------8/10---------5. BATTERY LIFE: I have used it heavily for more than a day many times without needing to recharge. It also charges up relatively fast. I with the charging cable was longer though. USB-C is a definite plus though.6. CASE: I dont care about the case too much (again, 2020), but it's fine and does its job. Its not ugly or anything. And is just small enough to not be an annoyance.Overall, are they worth the hype and the price tag? So far yes, but they better last for over a year of continued daily use for me to really think that they're worth this. But yes for now, definitely so."
"For summary, I don’t think this device deserves $350. I am not angry with SONY but a bit unimpressed. MX4 is not far away from MX3. If you are an average consumer like me, an $130 AirPods or $150 another NC headphones will be a similar experience. I am still debating if I want to keep MX4 or return it. It’s just not good enough.Well, here we go.Since I was 5 I’ve had tons of Sony products. I remember trying to put a cassette into my father’s old Walkman with my tiny hands. Then when I was old enough to hold a controller we got a Sony PlayStation 1. It was amazing to play Crash Bandicoot, Tekken, Rayman and so much more! Then I had a Sony DVD player that I used for decades. There is a big SONY music player that my dad had from the ’80s and it still works well…Why I opened this review with my past is because I’ve always had amazing experiences with Sony. Now when I watched some reviews on YouTube, MX4 looked really appealing with new NC technology, pairing with two devices, approximate sensor, enchanted touch sensor, thicker padding, etc.But the reality is a bit different, which I’ll explain it furthermore.I want to start with things that make me want to return the MX4:1. Touch sensor is unreliable. When I want to quickly reduce the volume, it skips like 5 songs and I’m not even exaggerating. Volume control is off-grade.2. In the Sony app, there is no option that says “turn off the NC”. Instead of that it says “Ambient Sound Control” ?? I’m not really a tech ignorant, but it was a bit weird for me to not being able to turn NC off/on easily.3. When NC is on it produces white noise. Maybe it’s how it works on this new tech but I didn’t like it. I have SENNHEISER HD 4.5 NC headphones that I bought 2 years ago. When I turn on NC on those headphones I never hear any kind of noise.4. Again with NC, with SENNHEISER it doesn’t give me dizziness, but somehow with SONY, NC makes me dizzy.5. Turning on MX4 takes you 2 seconds, starting to listening music is like 10 seconds with connecting and starting to playing music, this may sound like a first world problem but why turning on a headphone is not just a click? Or even when you pick up your device from the case and put it on your head won’t make turn it on? Is it really a hard feature to put on headphones that costs $350?6. I also use Apple AirPods on a daily basis, I paid $130. It’s lighter and more portable. Gives almost the same quality of sound. You can work-out with AirPods, they won’t slide off of your head. I found myself using them more than a new pair of MX4. I also consider the environment that I live is not being really loud, and I don’t fly often, so I believe cutting edge NC tech is not what I was looking for -I guess-. So paying new headphones $350 and not getting something new, disappointed me.7. This is a SONY product right. You’d expect it to work with PlayStation 4, but guess what? No, it does not! PS says it doesn’t support MX4. Like a JOKE.8. I know if SONY makes a product, it will stay for decades. But when you want to change the ear cups, you can’t. They are not changeable. Wow. So after you use your MX4 for couple years I guess you’ll just buy another MX5 because your ear cups wore off.9. USB-C cable that comes with MX4 is REALLY short, it’s not a deal-breaker but c’mon, $350.10. If I'm outside and I'm on the phone, It gives a bit of wind noise to the other party and the person on the other side says you sound like you are away from the mic. So the phone call quality is not really good. -for a device that you pay $350-11. Hover your hand to talk or speak to stop the music is just useless features. If I wanna talk or hear my surroundings, I just take headphones off my head.And of course, give the devil it’s due:1. Pairing with 2 devices works well. I’ve tried it and it’s pretty handy.2. Proximity sensor works most of the time. 4 out of 5 times.3. Battery life is amazing. I don’t think there is much to say to that. Just so good.4. Bluetooth works well too, I’ve never experienced any connectivity issues.5. MX4’s case is sleek and has a charger brick designed for airplanes. That’s thought well."
"Here's my honest review. I apologize if it's going to be long, or if I offend your own opinions.First, I'm not an audiophile. I usually listen to YouTube and Spotify on my Windows computer through a $50 pair of headphones. But I do know what excellent sound should sound like. My dad taught me that when I was young.Second, I never thought I would ever spend $350 on a pair of headphones. But with COVID-19 forcing me to work from home, I just can't function with the noise from the neighbor's landscapers (two neighbors, two interruptions per week) and another neighbor's yard construction going on. I stumbled upon multiple reviewers practically wetting their pants over how fantastic the NR in these headphones was. And since I'm always getting the headphone cord tangled up in my chair, I though I would go for high-end Bluetooth headphones.My review:These headphones are very comfortable. I don't understand how anyone could wear them for eight hours, and they're not as easy to wear as my $50 Plantronics headsets. But they are very lightweight for cans. I can wear these for 1-2 hours.I plugged them in with the uselessly short wire included in the box. That wasn't going to work. Then I added a 4"" extension cord. The sound, even through my Dell laptop or my HP tower was very good. They don't have the powerful bass that my $50 inside-the-ear-canal ear buds have. But for over-the-ear cans, they're pretty good.Next, I tried the noise reduction. After reading some of the glowing reviews I expected I would hear nothing but my heart beating. Sorry to disappoint you. The NR is very good. The NR is much better than the $300 Bose 3 headphones I tried 15 years ago and immediately returned for a refund. It does completely block out my neighbor's landscapers (yeah!) and my neighbor's construction (workers). And they even block out the annoying hum from my overhead lights and the annoying noise from my laptop fan. That was a pleasant surprise. But the reason I bought them for to block out the landscapers, so I am keeping them. But do they match the glowing reviews I read before I ordered them? No. They do not block out people's voices, of the TV set downstairs. I was hoping to use these when flying, instead of my inside-ear-canal ear buds. No chance. If you don't like to listen to people on your airplane yapping, stick with inexpensive ear buds.Last, I disconnected the wired connection and tried Bluetooth. It connected easily to my iPod, my Windows 10 PC, and my Windows 10 laptop. With Bluetooth, at best the sound quality is mediocre. It's about on-par with my $30 Plantronics headset when they are wired (although the Plantronics headset doesn't have NR). At worst, the sound with Bluetooth and Windows 10 is terrible. Sometimes it sounds like it coming through a flanger. The sound volume phases through either the volume swaying up and down, or the bass/treble is swaying up and down. I have not experienced this problem when connected through BT to my iPod. I saw on Reddit this is a known problem due to the limited CODEC's supported on Windows 10. The Reddit poster suggested plugging them back in through the wired connection. I did that, and they sound very good.So, my conclusion:For comfort I'd give them 8/10. For the price I expected them to be a bit more comfortable.Noise reduction: If you're sitting at your desk they're excellent at blocking out office/house noises: 10/10. But if you're on an airplane and want to block out people yapping away, or if you want to block out your coworkers yapping in the office, you might be disappointed: 3/10.Bluetooth connectivity. We expect it to be easy. That's the purpose of BT. 10/10Bluetooth sound quality with Windows 10. This is where they disappoint. I give them 4/10. And don't throw away the 1/8"" plug that comes in the box.  You will need it. You might not have this problem with an iPod, but there's no way I'm going to fiddle with a tiny iPod when I'm sitting at a desk.Value for the money: 8/10. They are very good (with a wired connection). But they do not live up the glowing reviews I read on the internet (yeah, what was I thinking).Andy FrazerI stand by everything I wrote here. Feel free to tell me if you disagree. I know I'm right :-)"
"I've had these for about a year now so think I've experienced the majority of the good and bad of these headphones.The tl;dr is do not buy these if you wanted to use them for headphones AND for calls/meetings; only buy these if you intend to use for music only.Comfort:I wear these for hours straight and haven't found them uncomfortable or heavy.Connectivity:Generally it's fine, for the first couple of years I didn't have connection issues. Recently however, having owned them for 2 years now, it will constantly, and I mean constantly, drop the Bluetooth connection (makes a ""Bluetooth connection dropped"" sound) and then reconnects with a ""Bluetooth connected"" sound immediately after. This occurs if there is no sound actively playing; it's incredibly annoying. This only occurs with my computer but no other Bluetooth device (including headphones) has this problem.Software Support:Not terrible but not great. For some reason, the ""Headphone Connect"" app (which is used to more finely control and configure these headphones) is only available on your phone; there is no desktop version. Within the app you can change the equalization profile, change what the general purpose button does (Google Assistant or Noise Cancellation mode), and update the firmware (UI for doing this isn't straightforward and buggy).Gesture Use:Tends to be stable. Every now and then double tapping doesn't play/pause as it's supposed to but usually it works. Taking off/putting on the headphones correctly pauses/resumes music. Swiping the right cup correctly moves songs forwards/backwards and adjusts music. Holding my hand to the right cup lowers volumes and disables noise cancellation to hear the outside environment.Music:- I'm not an audiophile but the sound quality seems good to me. These get plenty loud if you like your music loud (as I do).- The bass is good and very noticeable; it won't shake the headphones but you'll hear it and it feels balanced.- The noise cancellation is pretty good. On a plane I'd say it gets rid of 60%-70% of the noise of the plane, and that's before actually playing music.- Like most on-ear and over-the-ear headphones, these are basically speakers, not headphones. Unless you're in a loud place, everyone will easily hear your music, even with the volume fairly low. These shouldn't be used anywhere semi-quiet (such as an office) unless the volume is kept extremely low.Mic/CallsSorry to say, but there's literally nothing good about these with calls and meetings.- There's no dedicated ""Mute"" button on something that's intended to be used for calls and meetings. It is incredibly annoying to have to manually mute/unmute yourself in Teams instead of just pressing a button on the headphones. This is an oversight and can't even be fixed by assigning that functionality to the general purpose button.- Randomly people tell me I sound far away or they can barely hear me; disconnecting and reconnecting may or may not solve the problem for them. This particular issue is usually problematic in phone calls (Phone, Messenger and WhatsApp) rather than meetings (Zoom and Teams).- About 60% of the time people can't hear me at all, whether the device is connected to my computer or my phone. Like the bad quality issue, disconnect/reconnect doesn't usually fix it and I end up giving up and just using the device speakers.- There's a bug in these where if I'm connected to two devices simultaneously and utilizing the call functionality on one of the devices, everything is fine for a few minutes and then voices in calls/meetings become evenly ""choppy""; there's a complete break in call sound every 1 second. So it sou...nds lik...e ho...w I'm typi...ng thi...s, and it does not stop until I disconnect the headphones from the other device. This reproduces almost 100% of the time.So all in all, they're good headphones with various pitfalls but the major one is using these for calls and meetings. As long as you're using them just as headphones, they should be a good fit."
"The headphones are pretty good themselves, but having to install a phone app to do basic things is not something I expected. You also get a ""BEEP"" for every volume level you go up or down if you use the touchpad. Every. Single. Time.There is no way to disable the beeping for touchpad controls. Buyers have found a way to disable it by opening up the headphones and disconnecting a wire, but this should be an option on the app that they make you download.They do allow some customization in the app for sound levels. Overall they're ok, but I think for the price that they should have figured out a way to add in a toggle to disable touchpad beeping."
"Would be 5 stars if they didn't have all these gimmick ""features"" like pausing or lowering the volume of your audio when you're talking. I turned it off, but it keeps turning itself back on.After a year, my pair started making a horrid screeching sound after turning them on, making them unusable. I own the XM3 as well and those are perfect. I wonder if this screeching comes from the added microphone that detects if you're speaking. However, the relation is pure conjecture.Overall, these headphones leave me feeling frustrated that Sony can't just stick to making good headphones and instead insist on adding all these gimmicks. They would literally be perfect, otherwise."
"We have owned two of this model (one for four years, the other for two years), with one set being used with our home theatre and the other with tv & receiver in game room. The noise cancellation is excellent, even compared with three Bose models I’ve owned for many years. The sound is very good, good balance, bass, clarity. And, comfort is excellent - even watching one or more movies in theatre over several hours - with light weight, good cushioning and adjustable headset.BUT (A BIG BUT), the connectivity is terrible - worse than any other Bluetooth device (mult iPads, iOS and Android devices, earbuds and headphones, several TVs and sound systems).  Once paired, every few weeks either / both headphones lose connection and must be re-paired. Pairing is a nightmare, not simply blind pairing, but it inevitably takes repeated (10, 20, 30 or more) attempts before the headphones will find the transmitter. All other devices in the room (theatre or game room) and any adjacent rooms must be off and/or Bluetooth disabled. Following the same prescribed and typical pairing steps (as with any device), it will simply fail to connect over and over and over until (with no change insteps) it finally connects - and then works well until it loses / forgets connection in a few weeks. Both headsets, different rooms and equipment consistently exhibit the poor connectivity. And, we are using in very basic mode _ each is connected to one and only one device.If I could go back I would have purchased another product / mfr / model. A shame this really sours an otherwise great product. I would not recommend the product."
Coming from the air pods pro second gen this sound overage at best before I bought them I was going for the air pod max but I watch some YouTube reviews and I’m talking about the famous YouTubers that you probably watch too and read some reviews here so I don’t own the AirPod max just the pro second gen I was exited to be honest I got them today try them on the soon I turn on the music I was like nah 😅 is no way this sound better then the AirPods Pro second gen no way  let me describe the sound on the AirPods Pro sound like you have the music right in your ear the base is deep sound clear in this it sounds like your neighbor has music and you don’t feel the bass you just don’t feel it the voice isn’t as clear like in the AirPods Pro is not some reviews said that the AirPods Max sound like the pro. Well I want them now because I do not like the sound of this instead of an upgrade it feels like a downgrade and yes I have the app and yes I know you can mess around with the sound I did and I can’t find the quality of the AirPods Pro are this bad? Yes and no if you own AirPods Pro 2 gen they will sound bad but if you don’t own the AirPods Pro this will sound good the only reason ima keep them is because I get diálisis and I need something like this I drop my AirPods Pro when I fall sleep but those YouTubers and some reviews on here must be on something to say this sound better no way no way I’m super picky with my products the only good thing about this headphones is that they are super light and confortable with a overage sound that’s all so that’s why they getting 3 stars and I think even too generous if the dripped are better then this I guess the AirPods Max are lights years better
"Positives:I do believe these headphones have incredible noise cancelling technology. They manage to make virtually every low-pitched sound (train engines, washing machines, etc.) non-existent and seriously reduce the sound of high-pitched sounds like talking, loud typing, clapping, etc. I'm a bit familiar with what's behind ANC and I can see both the internal and external microphones on the unit. Having ANC tech that adapts to both is what adds to a lot of the cost in high-end ANC headphones. These are certainly state of the art in that respect.I expected the audio quality to be more amazing. It really is no better than the iPhone's included headphones or even the very cheap (but highly rated) Panasonic earbuds. However, adding ANC to playing sound is a tradeoff. Other, cheaper ANC headphones are far worse and wind up fighting with the music instead of letting you enjoy it. It could be that Sony is simply balancing ANC with sound quality and it can't get better than it is.30 hours of battery life is awesome. It's literally 10 times more than AirPods. The low battery life of Apple's devices is why I avoided them.Negatives:These headphones are big and clumsy. As light and padded they are, they are still large, uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour, and take up a lot of space in a backpack. This isn't really Sony's fault; all over-ear headphones are going to take up X amount of volume because of the size and location of human ears. But due their size and weight, I am finding myself more and more often just using my cheap wired earbuds, even when the Sonys are sitting right there on my desk and ready to go. Do I choose ANC and excellent sound, but pain and discomfort? Or good enough sound, no ANC, wires that don't let me walk around, but no pain? I think you can understand the dilemma.The gesture-based controls are nearly useless. I have heard from others that they don't work outdoors on very cold days, but that's not my issue. I only used the headphones in a climate controlled house. The touch controls are simply cumbersome to use. Either they will not trigger when I want them to, so I have to try it several times before they work. They also trigger when I don't want them to, such as when I pull up the top of my hoodie, move them aside to redistribute the pressure pain caused by the pads, or raise my arms to stretch. I would really prefer physical buttons, or even a way to turn off the sensor.The headphones cannot be used while charging. They cannot be turned on while plugged in, and if turned on when plugging in the power cable, they immediately turn off. This is surprising behavior considering that Sony located the power port on the right side facing down, where it is most conveniently hanging while plugged in and being worn. After all, if you were on an airplane and just wanted silence, but were running low on battery, wouldn't you want to plug it in so that you continue to have silence for the duration of your trip? My iPhone and Macbook pro continue to operate while plugged in and charging, as does another pair of noise-cancelling (corded) earbuds I use. I can't think of any charging device that does not do this, so I don't understand how this could have been missed.Another annoyance is that when paired with a MacOS laptop, every time they activate after turning on, MacOS will automatically launch the Music app and begin playing the first song. By ""activate,"" this could mean moving aside the left headphone to speak with someone, then putting it right back on. The Mac will start playing music even when something else is playing sound, such as VLC playing a movie. There seems to be no reliable way to turn this off and it's incredibly annoying.After nearly 20 years of Bluetooth technology development, I really expected something simple like headphones to be a smoother experience. Remember when you could just plug in the headphones to your phone when you take a call? Pairing these Sonys is a huge time-consuming headache. Just switching between my Mac and iPhone is a chore. It takes a long time to re-pair the headphones to a different device, even if you were hooked up to them earlier. If a call comes in, I need a good 30 seconds or longer before it the sound is established. I have missed calls because of this. To the caller, it sounds like I don't know how to use a phone. Yes, the headphones do work with a phone, and the other side hears me well. But due to this pairing delay, I just use the corded earbuds and not the Sonys.To paraphrase Chase Jarvis, your best headphones are the ones you have with you... and start working as soon as you put them on, let you answer calls right away, don't interfere with your listening enjoyment, don't cause your head to hurt, etc. By that measure, $10 cabled earbuds are my best headphones, and these Sony headphones are down at the bottom of the list. Low tech easily wins over a kitchen sink of advanced features."
"Good sound quality and comfortable headphones. However the touch interface makes using it very annoying. It will often get tapped when it's paused around my shoulders and I'll find out later that that unpaused it and played for some unknown length of time. Or sometimes I'll hit speak to chat turned on which makes watching anything awful.It has also had issues where it stops playing sound until restarted. It will be still connected to the device and be able to pause/play and change volume, but no sound will come out until turned off and back on.Also has had an issue where it just doesn't turn on for some time. I hold the power button and check devices, but nothing is responding. No workaround found for this, but if I just listen without it for a while and come back to it later, it's usually working. This issue is more rare than the other."
I bought these because I hoped that they would block out background noise when I'm on the phone or listening to music. I still hear everything and so does my caller. Also they are little too big as I can't adjust them to sit flush with my ears.
"The sound is amazing, if you put your head back at all these will slide off the back of your head - impossible to bench without them falling off its rediculous $300 for something they must have never tested more than sitting at a desk"
"Connectivity is frustrating, the app is horribly designed, and frankly the audio quality is nothing to write home about either. The build quality, battery life, and noise cancelling are good, but at this price point it probably makes senes to get something else."
"I have been on the hunt for a proper fitting pair of over the ear headphones for a year or more.I’ve tried JBL, Anker, a few pair of Sony, they’re all way too big. Including this pair.I put them on, lean forward to write or draw, and the headband slides immediately to my forehead.The bottom of the ear cups rest on the top of my jaw, and the tops sit directly on the top of my ear, so that’s really uncomfortable.I don’t have a small head. I always thought I had a big head. I’m even a little chonky. I thought for sure these would fit because of the price — surely they’ll be small and then I’ll have to adjust them down.Never in a million years would I have thought that headphones in this price range, in such a small case,  would start out too big on the smallest adjustment!Sound wise — I’m sorry but $40 Anker headphones sound better. The equalizer isn’t great. There is a weird digital sounding crackle when you turn noise cancelling off. You can also hear them pretty clearly when they’re on someone’s head. My husband tried them out and I could easily hear exactly what he was listening to. So that’s annoying.Overall quality is not worth full price or sale price. I’m sorry — the ear cushions flatten out in seconds. They don’t breathe so after about 2 minutes you just become very aware that there’s some sticky pleather on your face. The headband cushion shouldn’t be called a cushion. It’s supposed to buffer your head but, in this case, it squashes down to nothing immediately because the headphones are too big.The app: it’s annoying. I don’t want to make an account just to be able to get full use out of my headphones. That’s such a weird invasion of privacy. I give you money, you give me headphones. Why do you need my name and email for that unless you’re scamming people into giving personal info so you can sell their data and spam them? It’s headphones, man. Turn them on, put them on, enjoy. That should be the end of it.But nope, if you want to use all of the features you have to set an account up. I can’t get behind that at all.TL;DR : cheap, poor quality cushions, underwhelming digital sound, not worth the money."
"In June 2023 I was gifted these Sony WH1000XM4 headphones by my mother (the owner of this account). I wanted them because I noticed that I would get overwhelmed in loud environments. A friend of mine recommended them because of how good the noise canceling was and the pressure from the earpieces also helped with overstimulation.When I got these headphones, I loved them. They arrived quickly and the set up was easy. I wore them everyday and I took care of them. They were great for listening to music and they were great for keeping the outside world a little quieter when it got to be too loud.One day, in early December 2023 (a little less than 6 months after I had received the headphones) they broke. I was putting them on like normal and something snapped off and the right earpiece was left hanging by its wire.I was initially very upset and confused because I knew I had taken care of these headphones. I would store them properly, I would charge them, etc. and they just broke in my hands.I know that I’m still under warranty, so I call Sony Customer Support and they tell me that because the damage was “physical damage” they would not replace my headphones. My dad has the case escalated and they tell us the same thing.I call Customer Support again and they give me a number for the only authorized repair service in the United States. I call the number and it’s defunct, but it gives me a new number to call. I call that number and the AT&T jingle plays, the automated voice asks if I’m calling about a repair and I say yes. The system then gives me another number to call, the AT&T jingle plays again. The new automated voice asks if I’m trying to repair a receiver and I realize this is not what I’m looking for at all, so I hang up.I call Sony Customer Service again and after waiting on hold for about 20 minutes I tell them that the number they gave me doesn’t work and the associate gives me the website of the repair company that I learned is called United Radio at this point.I find United Radio’s contact and I email them telling them about what happened to my headphones and that I want them repaired. They tell me that the cost of the repair would be the part they need to use to repair the headphones + the labor cost ($90) + shipping. They also informed me that no fees would be waived even though I was under warranty because Sony would’ve just replaced the headphones if my problem was under warranty.I try looking for the part that would be needed to repair my hanging earpiece and I found it on a couple websites ranging from $15-$40, so I go ahead and and send my headphones to United Radio.About 2 weeks pass and I get a call from United Radio. The associate tells me that they found the issue and the part to fix the problem will cost $140 + the fixed $90 labor fee + shipping equaled to about $272. That’s pretty much what was paid for these headphones back in June and they were charging me for a more expensive part than what I had researched.I feel cheated by Sony. A $300 product should not break in 6 months and it should not cost the same amount to get them repaired because some flimsy piece of plastic broke. This product should have lasted years, not months."
"I really wanted to like these headphones and was super disappointed that they didn't work out. The earcups were super comfortable, the noise cancelling was perfect and I couldn't hear anything when it was one and loved that I could connect to my phone and computer at the same time not having to waste time changing over from one thing to another but the thin band on the top just hurt my head way too much.I tried to do all the things people suggested like put a wrap around it or change the positioning of the headphones but nothing worked for me. After about 30 minutes I would start to get a headache and I couldnt handle wearing them anymore. It was a real bummer because so many people suggested these. I even tried wearing a hat and beanie but that seemed to make it worse.When they go on sale they are great for the price but for me they for sure were not it. If Sony made the band wider or the cushion thicker or something that would have made them the most perfect cans, but I could not hang with that thin ass band over my head at all.Really don't know how people handle it. It's not like I have an odd shaped head or anything either. I'd understand if my top of my head was more rounded but nope the band is just thin as hell. Maybe in their future versions they will fix that but if not they will always be a no from me"
"These headphones were amazing when I bought them back in 2020, the sound quality, comfort and noise cancellation delivers. Unfortunately, after the first year I had to get a new pair due to headphones developing a high pitched sound that pierces and doesn't shut off when it starts, I read is common for this model. I also lost sound in one ear, that must have been a fluke b/c I did not read about that.  I was fortunate enough to sell off the first pair to someone on ebay who was willing to try and repair it b/c I didn't purchase a warranty. The second pair has lasted me 3 years now but are now officially on their way out. The high pitched sound started up again about a years ago, so I was able to get 2 years of use without that high pitched ringing sound. I managed to figure out that when the ""Ambient Sound Control"" is off, that prevents the high pitched ringing, therefore I can't ever have it on. Today the plastic ear part broke off out of nowhere, so that's something to be aware of if you use headphones as often as I do. I would say you're better off getting a 2 year warranty in my opinion so you can at least get some peace of mind. These were not cheap and sadly, I don't think I'm going to drop another $200+ on headphones I know will break again and have 1-3 years shelf life."
"Update: The low frequencies seem to jump between really loud and quiet. It is severely inconsistent at times making the bass suddenly jump and get really loud? It's getting annoying but what can you do. Is it because the ""clear bass"" slider isn't reaching higher bass frequencies? That seems likely. So anytime audio jumps above where the clear bass is set, the bass becomes suddenly loud. Just a guess but hey whatever.So I work with audio. I have many pairs of headphones. Comparing all of them to these, these do get the job done when you need to block out sound. Otherwise, they sound very tinny and the bass is atrocious.So being frank, they sound fine for the average person. For me, I daily drive a pair of HD600s. Probably because I am crazy. But I love them. Going from those to my 250ohm DT770 Pros, and then to these...I cannot believe these cost almost $400.The bass is way too loud. It also is inconsistent. Much of the bass in the very low end (sub bass) gets really punchy and muddies the music. If you like that I guess? But then theres the bass just above what these headphones are tuned to and... it's not punchy anymore? Listening to a song where the bass frequencies go just over these headphones frequency curve and just drop off snd aren't punchy is TERRIBLE.The rest is fine. The mids and highs... you have a harder time loosing detail there. They sound exactly how I would expect.Going to the app, I got disappointed. The equalizer is half baked and built for people who need a handicap. That's totally okay. But not having a more advanced version available for someone like me who would LOVE to have that kind of tuning is kind of a bummer. Especially since you pay $400 or so on these. Ouch.My Jaybird Vista 2s have an app. The equalizer is highly customizable with 5 bands. You can point them to whatever frequency range you want and adjust their resonances. I spent like, $150 on those. Cheaper and has a feature I actually like.Considering that, I have to have the bass on these headphones turned down to -6 to -7 before it feels like my head is taking off like a rocket. The bass is so loud. Louder than anything on any headphone I have ever owned.I could not even begin to tell you what happened when I turned it past 0. I felt like I was going to shatter these headphones off of my head.The music I listen to is well mixed and mastered. So I know that isn't the issue.If I had one reason to hit these headphones down 2 stars from 4, it would be the lack of a useful equalizer. I spent a lot on these because I needed a good noise canceling headphone. I feel like these aren't worth the price for that reason alone. You make them $400, give them an equalizer, frequency adjustable, resonance adjustment, and no butt ugly ""clear bass"" slider. What even is that. What frequencies does it adjust???????????!?!?!!!!! Terrible.I'll be keeping these only because they perform well with noise canceling. I would recommend buying these on discount if you actually want them. I did. $250 from some seller. Got them new sealed in box. If you can get them for that price or something, these are nice and worth the price. Not at $400 or whatever."
"The product itself is amazing, it's honestly so perfect for headphones that I don't even think I would buy another if mine lasted forever. It's comfortable and the audio goes well, its medium so nothing like bass hits that hard but it's good for studying and chilling. Noise canceling is perfect too and I can put these on anywhere and it'll be way better at noise cancelling, especially better than the airpod pros.However, I find it really frustrating that sometimes, the charging just doesn't work. Usually, I can tell when the red LED doesn't turn on while it's charging. There a few quick fixes for that like turning on the headphones before you plug in the charger because, for some reason, that seems to work.Now the main issue I have is that, these quickfixes end up not working anymore. It'll take like 2 months or so and then the same methods like hitting the reset button or whatnot don't work. You're now left with a set of headphones that can't charge and you've done nothing different compared to the past year.I even had a replacement during my warranty because of this problem and guess what, the replacement went through the same problem. I was wondering if it was a problem with my type c chargers, but I had three different kinds and then three different charging ports and even tried plugging them into different outlets. Nothings gone wrong with any of my other products for years, but these headphones can barely last a year.I wanted to get a replacement for my replacement since it didn't last that long for me, but it's like 15 months since I first got the XM4, and I had gotten my replacement 10 months in, so it really lasted half a year. It's kind of expensive for the duration since it was $330 when I first got it."
"I want to preface this by saying - I’m new to wireless noise canceling headphones. I naively thought the audio quality would be on par with wired headphones. I bought these to have a more pleasant experience while working on my laptop on airplanes - well see if that use case can justify the price (because I’ll never use these outside of noisy travel).I am very disappointed with the audio quality of these headphones. I’ve been using the Sony MDR 7506‘s for many years. They are 1/3 the price ($99) but are designed for ‘professional’ audio monitoring. I use them for daily music listening in addition to mixing audio for commercials professionally. There’s no comparison in sound quality. Just in terms of specs - the MDR 7506’s have a considerably wider frequency range and 1/6th the impedance. I wish it wasn’t as noticeable as it is, as it stands I don’t even want to listen to music on the XM4s. Even after EQ adjustments the XM4s just sound distant, they lack richness, they are not crisp, and frankly to my ear they sound cheap. I’ve been spoiled with the 7506’s and I hadn’t even realized.Bottom line - if you need wireless, or noise canceling, or a ‘modern’ looking headphone you might be really happy with these. But if you want excellent sound - I would recommend avoiding wireless all together. If you’re a music lover who doesn’t mind a cable and a retro (?) headphone design, try the 7506’s - apparently ‘professional’ is more than just a marketing ploy, they really fit the bill. There’s a reason they are industry standard. Lesson learned."
So I've had this item for a little over a year. It's always cut in and out on audio while watching shows. I only use them when my infant is asleep so the TV doesn't wake them. I'm not sure why the audio keeps cutting out I've had to turn on subtitles to actually know what they are saying. Other than that I love these headphones and the noise canceling feature.
"I spend hours on long phone calls every single day.  I have been using Apple AirPod Pros for this and am very satisfied with the technology.  But the in-ear AirPod is causing me a medical problem with my ears, so I needed to find a way to make iPhone phone calls without something sticking into my ear canal.I decided to try Sony’s high-end WH-1000XM4 wireless headset.  When I called the person on the top of my speed dial list to see how the phone call quality was, she said on her end of our phone calls to her were always fuzzy sounding, and that they clipped some beginning and ending syllables.  Another frequent caller said our phone calls were alright (though he couldn’t rave about any aspect of the call quality at all). He also said he could no longer hear anyone in the background speaking from across the room when they spoke away from the headset.  In my circumstances this can be both good or bad, depending on what results I want.As the headphone wearer, I found phone conversations to be terrible regardless of the various settings I tried.  Phone calls were terrible to listen to as they sounded so forced and unnatural.  And they were also terrible to talk on due to inadequate sidetone and unnatural sound of my own voice.  Also, the back of the headphones rubbed against my chair and that carried into the headphones acoustically.The right cup wasn’t big enough, and so usually my right earlobe was scrunched under the cup edge unless I manually adjusted it each time I placed the headphones on my head.I didn’t like the Sony apps I had to install on my iPhone; they just didn’t feel like they fit well into my chosen Apple ecosystem.  There was also something about the initiation process each time I turned them on that forced some manual connect operation.  I didn’t like that I had to take the headphones off to adjust my head height, and also in doing so, they shut the headphones off (though I could could change that default if I was willing to turn off the auto shutoff).The “midnight blue” color might as well have been black.  Initial reactions from 3 of 4 of us were that the headphones were black. Not even close to blue.  We could see bluish elements by looking carefully, but the perceived color was far closer to midnight black than midnight blue. And I even paid extra for the blue color that I desired and felt that I did not receive.I liked the volume up and volume down and skip forward and skip back motions, as they were very intuitive.  I wish it was available on both sides of my head though, rather than only the one.I generally was not impressed by the fit and comfort, and never really felt completely comfortable wearing the headphones as there was an angle and tightness that was not fully satisfying.I really wish there was a lightning-to-headphone cable included, as then I would have tried wired phone calls, though I am pretty sure the lack of decent sidetone would still have been an issue, and I am guessing that the voice quality would have still been an issue to some large degree.  Even if wired mode would fix the sound quality completely, I want wireless for my primary usage.I found the added ability to listen to music or a phone call while also listening to ambient noises or discussions was somewhat more helpful than nothing, but woefully inadequate for routine use, no matter how I adjusted the various controls.  And specifically, someone walking up to me and posing a question left one or the other or both of us always feeling frustrated in our communication ability.  It was helpful to have some sense of what is going on around me, but not at all helpful to interact with another person intentionally.The 3D sound was “cute”, and even satisfying, but until my existing library of 400+ albums had some automated 3D effects, why bother?  Having a few special 3D albums, while having the totality of my well-loved collection being 2D just made me frustrated with the music that I love and devalued my entire collection in my mind.  3D was novel, but otherwise caused me real dissatisfaction with my collection acquired over the decades.  I will always avoid 3D unless my old standbys can electronically simulate some 3D effects on my request.I am not a high-end audio guy, but my music sounded fine to me.  I really needed the phone calls to sound decent, and they instead were unacceptable for business use. These headphones weren’t worth the almost $300 cost to me, and in fact I would pay maybe $50 for them for music listening, and would simply be unwilling to use them for free for routine business phone calls.I can tell you with certainty that I am going to be returning these Sony WH-1000XM4s, primarily due to telephone call inadequacy, but also because I really wanted a rich dark blue color."
"I've been in love with my XM2's for the past few years and have been wearing them all day, every day since the beginning of the pandemic. I recently realized if they were to give out unexpectedly, I'm up a creek until I can replace them. So I ordered these XM4's after reading the list of improvements and was quite excited to use them. However, nearly every improved feature is flawed to the point that the overall experience is very much diminished.Improvement #1: Headband. The padding is definitely thicker, however the foam is harder and creates a pressure point on top of my head which I never experienced with the XM2's. Also, the slightly higher positioning changes the balance causing it to shift more when moving my head.Improvement #2: Multi Device pairing. This was one of the main features I wanted, however I've had to disable it as it continually causes ""Device #2"" (computer) to be muted if I'm using an app on ""Device #1"" (phone), even if that app is making no sound whatsoever.Improvement #3: Noise canceling. Not at all improved. In Full Noise Canceling Mode, it sounds similar to the XM2's in Ambient Sound Mode. There is noticeable hiss and if you have a fan on, you can still hear it. A barking dog across the street sounded like it was in the next room.Improvement #4: Pause when removing headphones. This is great in concept, but terribly executed; another feature I've had to disable. It's just a light sensor inside one of the ear cups, so if you're in a dark room it has no effect. If you are in a light room and take them off, the media will pause, but turn off the lights on your way out and it will unpause again. If the media is already paused when you take them off, it will unpause.  A frustrating experience.Improvement #5: Sound quality. This is not improved. In fact it sounds like in order to address the issue many people reported with the sound being ""bass-y"" they added some high end that makes the sound tinny. I did notice the sound was a bit bass-heavy at first on the XM2's, especially in comparison to the Bose QC2's I had been using for over a decade before that, but I like a lot of bass, so I always saw that as a positive. The XM2's have always had a crisp, clear and pleasant sound for me. I heard things I never had before in music I'd been listening to for decades. The XM4's don't sound any better than the Bose.Improvement #6: Speak to chat. The third new feature that I've had to disable. Every time you start to sing along to the music it pauses. It's probably a very useful feature in certain circumstances, but not in any I'm currently in.The reduction in battery life over the XM2's is noticeable and they don't quite last me two days of use whereas I never had to worry about running out of juice before. I will say that I do prefer getting an estimated percentage of battery as opposed to the High, Medium, Low of the prior model.While writing this review I've been wearing the XM2s after having worn the XM4's for the previous 11 hours and the XM2's are so much more comfortable and peaceful. I'm very disappointed and I know that the next incarnations will likely stray further and further in the wrong direction so I will probably never buy another pair of Sonys again."
"Compared to the Surface Headset, that Microsoft no longer makes, this headset offers less functionality. For example, during a Zoom call, the microphone captures surrounding noises so the noise canceling feature only applies for the user while listening only, not speaking. I have experienced a lot of issues with pairing, where my headset appears to be connected but sound won't come through."
They fit nice and sound great
I bought these headphones thinking that they would be a drastic difference in sound quality from my airpods but to be honest they were not. I definitely would not buy these full price because this model is 4 years old and definitely not worth 350. I bought these for 200 on sale and I still returned them.
"After reading several online articles on the best wireless ANC headphones in the $300-400 range, I chose three to try out:- Sony WH-1000XM4- Master & Dynamic MW65- Bowers & Wilkins PX7The Sony pair arrived first and my initial thought was that although they had plenty of cool bells & whistles (touch sensitive volume control, automatic pause when removing them from your head) and the ANC was very effective, they sounded surprisingly flat. Even after trying various EQ settings within the Sony app and on my iPhone, the sound was decent but just not good enough for a $350 pair of headphones. And the most important thing to me with headphones is sound quality. I couldn't help but wonder why these headphones had such great reviews on sound quality when to my ears they just sound dull. All bass and mid, very little clarity of treble. To me, it seems the majority of the money for this pair went into the fancy features and not to the sound quality.Next came the Master & Dynamic MW65 -- a newer company based out of NYC I hadn't heard of until this week. Besides the absolutely stunning design (not the most important thing to me honestly) I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY by the full, rich sound and crystal clear quality of the audio -- especially on the high end. An absolutely beautiful, well balanced, natural sound -- unlike the Sony's. Bass and midrange are important of course, and these have plenty of low end punch, but if you're like me and you want a precise, clear, open treble (so you can really hear all those delicate cymbals and high hats), then these will delight you. To be fair, they do not have many of the fancy features of other headphones in this price range (and they don't come with an app, which is fine by me), and the ANC isn't quite as effective as the Sony's. But a more subtle ANC is also what keeps the music sounding so great. They're also the only pair of the three that didn't come with a hard case (the case is soft), so to protect these I'm going to spend another $25 on a case. They're worth it. I only wish these were super soft over-ear phones instead of on-ear phones. The earpad leather is very soft and they are definitely comfortable (even to a man with big ears like mine), but I feel after hours of usage an over-ear set would be more comfortable.Finally the Bowers & Wilkins PX7 arrived. I had high hopes for these because of their reviews, and the reputation of B&W for many years running. So I was as surprised as I could possibly be when I put them on and they sounded as flat and dull as the Sony's. In fact, after an A-B comparison they sounded nearly identical to the Sony's. Plus, the B&W app was buggy and terrible, and didn't even include EQ. (I used the iPhone settings to adjust EQ instead, but it still didn't help the B&Ws much.)Master & Dynamic was the clear winner of the three, no contest. It amazes me that the Sony and B&W headphones have plenty of glowing reviews from people who rave about the sound quality. All I can think of is everyone's preferences are different, but most likely the people who popped them on and enjoyed them didn't actually do A-B comparisons with other brands. It was when I compared the Master & Dynamics with the others that I really noticed what the other two pair were missing."
"My headline says it all.  I had the predecessor WH1000XM3 headphones for about 3 years and never had a single issue with them. All of the issues I'm currently experiencing are only with this 'upgraded' model.1. These are good for AUDIO ONLY (e.g. listening but not watching anything) - and the audio sounds exceptional - this is important to note.2. The noise cancelling compared to the previous generation product is atrocious.  I am sitting here listening to music in my XM4's while writing this review while house cleaners are upstairs vacuuming and I can hear the vacuums like they are right here next to me.  It's completely distracting.  By comparison, I used to be able to put on some music in the XM3's while sitting in a room with people talking and watching TV - and I'd still be able to fall asleep because EVERYTHING was so muted.  Now with the XM4's, ambient noise is subdued but I can hear EVERYTHING.  Changing noise canceling modes does nothing, it just works poorly, period.3. I used to have my XM3's connected to my LG TV via Bluetooth to watch movies and videos or play games.  I never once had any issues or concerns and I used them for hours and hours and hours and hours.  The XM4's CONSISTENTLY lose sync with the video after a few minutes and I have to restart the stream, EVERY TIME, to resync which only works for a few minutes before falling out of sync again.  Seems there's perhaps some Bluetooth incompatibility or other issue at large, however Sony Support just tells me my TV might not support the proper Bluetooth standard as a complete guess.  I asked if they can just exchange these for my old WH1000XM3s and was told they won't take back or exchange my headphones for the old model.I'm basically out $350 for a product that should have cost $75 max.  Sony has made it clear to me that  they don't care about customer satisfaction, especially with releasing a product that has lost some key features - features which I absolutely need for a $350 price tag and the loss of said features means this product can no longer set itself apart from competing products.  I'll be moving on to the Bose QC headphones moving forward and avoiding Sony products going forward.Thank you, Sony - because of your lack of concern for releasing quality products and driving customer satisfaction, you've just lost another customer."
"The sound quality of this headset is very good. However, the button to advance to the next song will require a lot of patience."
This needs to be less in price when comparing the sound quality. I d O not see much difference between my beats and this headset. But my beats are much less in price.
"Ended up returning these for the simple fact that having two devices paired with the headphones was a pain to use. Sound quality and noise cancellation is great but expect issues if you want to use the multi device support with Apple products. The feature does not change audio playback seamlessly at all. You have to always disconnect the Bluetooth connection from your MacBook if you want to listen on your iPhone. It even says in my spotify app that’s it’s connected to the xm4 but it has audio playback. Here are the specific issues I found. This is with the “connect to 2 devices simultaneously” feature in the Sony connect app switched on.Issue #1: when I turn the headphones on to start my day, they connect to both my iphone and Mac laptop, cool but If I choose to start playing music from spotify on my iPhone, I hear no audio playback in the headphones even though it says they’re connected in the spotify app. I see in the Sony connect app it is defaulting to my laptop even though there is no audio playback coming from the laptop and the spotify desktop app isn’t even open on my laptop. I can’t switch it to play from my iPhone in the Sony app either.Issue #2: As a result of issue #1, you then have to always disconnect the headphones from my laptop Bluetooth in order to start listening to music from the spotify app on my iPhone. Not seamless.Issue #3: if I am connected to both my iPhone and laptop simultaneously and listening to music through the iphone, when I take my headphones off for a few seconds it pauses playback (expected) but when I put them back on they won’t start playing audio again for the iPhone. I look in the Sony connect app and it has switched the device connection to my laptop even though nothing is playing from the laptop. When I start playing from my spotify app again, the same thing from issue #1 happens, audio doesn’t start playing again from the iPhone. The connection just stays on the laptop in the Sony app. You can’t even switch the connection in the Sony connect app.Issue #4: A similar issue happens if you are in a zoom call on your laptop and pick your headphones up to readjust and put them back on. They will disconnect from your laptop and switch to your iPhone in the middle of a call if you have the multi device feature turned on. Super annoying. The speak to chat feature also has issues if you have that on during a zoom call.It seems like the main issue is the headphones Bluetooth connection defaults/favors the laptop Bluetooth connection for whatever reason. It is not seamlessly switching between the two depending on the audio playback which I thought was the multi device support feature.It seems like my only real solution is to not use the iPhone spotify app when I am on my laptop. Just use the spotify Mac desktop app. I thought with having the Bluetooth multi device support, issues like this would not happen and I could seamlessly listen to music from my iphone and then jump on a zoom call from my laptop without having to fiddle with Bluetooth connections and visa versa. These issues were enough for me to return and get the current $150 cheaper Bose QC35ii."
"I have used these headphones on a near daily basis, and they were good (not great) throughout its lifetime. Below, I've included my experience throughout my 3 years with these headphones before putting them in its grave.Sound quality - 3 stars- These are great headphones for daily music use, and you won't regret the purchase if this is the only thing you're after. However, when I compared them to Bose's 700, the sound quality seemed a bit worse. However, for those of us who aren't sound engineers, these are good enough. I'd highly recommend going to a store and trying them out before purchasing. These headphones are good for answering calls in a quiet place, I would not recommend taking calls outside if it's a little windy, inside a car while driving, or anywhere that is relatively noisy.Noise cancellation - 4 stars- I can't give these 5 stars because the technology isn't there yet for total noise cancellation and honestly, they should do us a service and call them limited frequency cancelling. First, for those of us not familiar with noise cancelling headphones, they will not cancel every sound. However, these work great when on an airplane and definitely worth the price if this is a big weighting factor in your decision. Moreover, these work well for office noise, it won't totally cancel your co-worker's conversation if they are close to you, but reduces it enough to make the experience a little better.Comfort - 3.5 stars- I think the cushion starts out fine then after about a year it'll start to noticeably wear down, flatten and become uncomfortable. Maybe not a big deal if you have a replacement handy.Control - 1.5 stars- The automatic voice notifications drives me nuts and it now I essentially take off the headphones before receiving those voice notifications. These notifications are the ""power on,"" ""bluetooth connected"" etc.. There's no way to disable them, and Sony has remained quiet on this despite people calling for an option to disable the voice notification. The iPhone app is atrocious at times, it won't even load and sometimes you'll have to wait a while for it to connect to the headphones. The hand gestures are decent, and infrequently hit or miss with the swipes.Reliability - 2 stars- The headphones worked great the first year. The second year was good enough since the padding started to breakdown. In the third year, the headphones began to randomly disconnect from devices from time-to-time. Finally, I now experience a frequent and unbearable high pitch sound on the right earcup and the sound quality has been degraded. I can still hear fine on the left earcup, but I'd classify these headphones as not usable anymore. For the $300+ price I paid, this was not the best investment.TL;DR - If you want durable headphones, do not buy these. If you are going to buy these, I'd highly recommend trying them out in a store before committing."
"I bought the Sony WH-1000 to replace my Bose QC-35. The Bose headphones are super comfortable and provide excellent noise cancellation, but for music the sound quality needs improvement. The WH-1000's have a similar design and are almost as comfortable.Pros: I can wear them for hours in all conditions and they make good ear warmers in the winter! The sound quality is a huge improvement on the QC-35, much more clarity and bass. Also, in the app there is a free equalizer with presets so it is easy to dial in the sound to my preference.Cons: The noise cancellation works but it uses white noise to drown out the background so it's noisy in itself. The adaptive sound control feature is just annoying. It randomly changes the noise cancellation as I move around or turn my head. I used the app to turn it off so I can adjust the noise cancellation manually. However, the adaptive sound keeps turning itself on automatically and I can't get rid of it. Also, I would prefer traditional controls with buttons and dials on the headphones rather than finger swiping. It's too easy to swipe the wrong way and get the wrong result, like skipping the track when I want to turn up the volume.All in all, these headphones sound great but I will look for something different next time."
"It sounds great, the equalizer feature in the Sony Headphones app is nice, and it's nice to be able to connect to two devices and have it auto-mute when you're receiving a call. It also charges quickly.HOWEVER, the noise canceling doesn't seem to work that well, the leather on the cups has become cracked (as others have complained), the ambient sound feature is not very loud, and now it also seems to change the overall sound of the audio if it is in either noise canceling or ambient sound mode. The feature that pauses music when you remove the headphones also hasn't worked very well since I received them. The battery charge also seems to not last as long as Sony claims, and it would be nice to use the app on pc, not just phone, and have an option to switch devices in the app and on the headphones, not need to disconnect the device to switch to another if it doesn't switch automatically. It would also be nice if I didn't need to choose between Google Assistant or mode selection when it automatically starts in noise canceling and the only way to switch modes with Google Assistant on is to do it by going into the app on your phone.I hope these are cheap to repair because I don't have $250 to spend every 2-3 years when the leather cracks and they stop working as well."
"First the sound quality on this is incredible. However I am planning to return them for a number of reasons.1. You can't use them while they are charging. It automatically powers off2. There is no mute button on the headphones. You need to go to the app3. I was in the middle of a Teams meeting and a phone call came, I did not take the call, but the ringing disconnected me from my teams meeting and I had to reboot to get it back connected. Very embarrassing!"
"I got these because there were many reviews saying this was decent audio quality for the price and fit. I agree the price and fit is good but I was very disappointed at the audio quality. When I first put the headphones on it sounds fine but, after 15-30 minutes the audio will start to pop and crack. I will get worse the longer I listen. Its more noticeable when in noise cancellation mode but will also happen in ambient sound mode."
"These are good headphones for sure, but are they worth the $300+ dollar amount? Short answer.... No.If they were $200 and I'd say yeah, probably. It's a Sony product so they're also asking extra just for the brand name.Pro's:- Great sound, Good battery life, Noise canceling is really good, has Bluetooth AND an Auxiliary input jack for optional wired connection, has built in Microphone, can control media with your finger by swiping the earphone forward/backward and volume up/down and play/pause by double tapping, audio will automatically pause if you take off the headphones, and it comes with a very nice hard case for safe traveling.Con's:- It's almost entirely made of plastic. Plastic can get brittle and break, which is always a worry of mine. The headset will sometimes turn itself off when you're right in the middle of listening to something on a full battery (doesn't happen often but I've still noticed it), you CANNOT use the headphones while they're charging (if you try to charge them while you're listening to something the headphones will automatically turn off and go into charging mode).- And the WORST thing about the headphones are the Earpads. The Earpads are not firm at all and they're very flat. Your ears will rub against the inside of the headphones (and the inside of the headphones are very hard). If you wear the headphones for 30 minutes to an hour... your ears will start to hurt (I have smallish ears and it still hurts). I've had these headphones for almost a year and I really regret not buying Thick replacement Earpads sooner. Now that I have thick Earpads, I can wear my headphones all day without my ears hurting. For headphones to cost over $300 you would think the Earpads would be good quality, but they're very cheap. So, if you plan on buying this headset, get the Thick replacement Earpads or else your ears will be miserably uncomfortable.Summary:If you plan on getting these fairly expensive headphones..... Make sure to buy Thick Replacement Earpads. Because the stock Earpads are flat as a pancake and your ears will hurt.Note:- The Earpads in the image that I uploaded are the thicker replacement Earpads. 👌"
"I haven't tried other noise-cancelling headphones for comparison, but the noise cancelling on these headphones is good. The audio quality seems fine but the bass is annoyingly loud at times; although I am not and do not pretend to be someone with a good ear for that kind of thing.The reason I am writing a review is because in daily use these headphones unstoppably and predictably bombard the user with useless notifications. There is a setting to ""disable"" notifications but Sony in their infinite wisdom prevents the user from disabling ""important"" notifications, where ""important"" seems to refer to those notifications which provide information that can easily be obtained by means other than audio notifications.First I would like to discuss the format of the notifications. Whatever audio the user might be listening to is turned down to the point of being nearly inaudible, but since it's still technically playing Sony feels no need to pause whatever you are listening to, so something like a podcast or audiobook will keep going, allowing you to miss part of it. Then there is a loud beep-y sound effect. Then a robot lady's voice explains, loudly and in ""polite"", complete sentences, whatever has just happened in headphone-land. Recall that these are noise-cancelling headphones, so between cancelling outside sounds and turning down the user's audio, every sound in the world but the notification has been made quiet, in addition to the notification being made loud. It is obnoxious to a degree which may be difficult to imagine without experiencing it multiple times every day for months. That the notifications are so predictable, for me, only adds an element of excruciating anticipation.The foremost among these notifications are ""power on"", ""bluetooth device connected"", and ""bluetooth second device connected"", which for just $350 you could hear every single day for as long as your headphones last. There are also ""bluetooth device one disconnected"" and ""bluetooth device two disconnected"". These latter two may seem useful but they only trigger when the user intentionally engages in some action that would obviously result in that device being disconnected, such as clicking ""disconnect"" in the bluetooth menu or turning the device off. In situations where you may not know which device has disconnected, such as when the bluetooth connection cuts out or your computer crashes, you are finally spared from being informed about the nature of the problem by a notification which consists only of a synth instrument playing some kind of descending sound; the fact that this is the only situation where I have not been condescended to is part of what makes Sony's notion of ""important"" seem so surreal. And naturally, if the problem should happen to resolve itself, and you no longer have reason to worry about it, you will then be informed about the freshly-irrelevant details: ""(BEEP) bluetooth device two connected"".The best you can do is let the headphones train you to use the ""pause"" gesture every time one of these notifications starts, which cuts off the notification. In fact this is the primary reason I personally use the pause gesture.Interestingly, while googling for possible solutions, I learned that Sony has received a few complaints about the futility of ""disabling"" notifications on their forums, about which they have repeatedly pretended to care and in response to which they have never changed a thing. For this reason I am of the opinion that if you consider yourself in any way responsible as a consumer you mustn't purchase this product."
"They sound great. The noise cancelling is great. The side cushions are super soft but the top headband is PAINFUL. The weight is reasonable. They fold up well. The battery lasts a long time. They feel premium.Noise cancellation is forced on every time it starts. There is a phone app that used to be able to turn it off after like twenty seconds of powering on but even that no longer works. There is a button to turn it off but instead of just immediately turning it off, you have to listen to someone talk for second, then press it again and listen to someone talk for another three seconds. This makes no sense because they seem to remember all settings when they're shut off except the last noise cancellation state.During phone or video calls, if the headphones are lifted to scratch your ear or whatever, the phone IMMEDIATELY disconnects the headphones, switches to speakerphone, and does not reconnect until you switch it back manually.After more than four years, these issues were never addressed. They could fix them at any time, since they can push firmware updates to the headphones and also control functions via the app. I believe the XM5s remember the last setting so it seems Sony just wants XM4 users to be miserable.By the way, the phone app is WEIRD, like it was designed by some predatory marketing team. They designed it like it's a social media app with a news feed and popups, then asks you to make a Sony account for some reason. It wants to track your locations, ostensibly so it can change the settings automatically when you're at different places, but we all know what it's really for. Also it barely worked before and with the latest update it literally doesn't for disabling noise cancellation, so it seems they're more interested in tracking you than making a real product.The latest update also hangs, crashes, and takes extra steps to get to the same menus. It seems nobody online knows of a single benefit to the update. People are having all kinds of problems: losing connection, worse noise cancelling, rapid battery drain, lost features, and anything you could imagine."
"I had Bose Quiet Comfort for 5-6 years and wanted to upgrade. After many reviews and research, I decided to purchase a Sony XM4. Sadly, I am disappointed with the purchase. I am going to go back and buy a newer Bose Quiet Comfort. Here are my reasons:1) touch control does not work. It is the most annoying thing in the world. It worksSometimes it sometimes does not. Frequently, I have to reset the touch control setting on my phone app. I think whenever sony rolls out a firmware update, it changes the setting and I have to reset it to how I want it. Needless to say, I miss the physical control. Simple volume up and volume down would be nice. Wrong angle on your swap up and down will fast forward your music or skip your movie toAnother. Also, make sure your hands are not wet (I.e. I like to watch my movie or listen to music while doing dishes and with wet hands, your SOL on volume control. You have to control it on your phone)2) you really need a phone to control your headphone. See #1.3) keep your headphone steady. When wearing your headphone for a long time (20-30 min) your ears can get sweaty. If you try to adjust your headphone, the headphone will turn off itself. It can be convenient at time to auto stop your movie/music but it can be annoying at times.4) Bluetooth is better than my old Bose headset. However, it messes it up when you try to reconnect. See #3. When the headphone stops music/movie because you were adjusting, when you reconnect, the movie/music will act up. Not sure whether it is connecting and reconnecting Bluetooth with my device or the headphone, Bluetooth signal would act up and you hear weird static noise and have to reset the bluetooth.Bottom line, I prefer simple control that just works. The headphone is trying to be smarter than it is and it just becomes annoying. Therefore. I prefer Bose than this too good for its own good headphone."
"I already had a pair of Sony noise cancelling headphones, the WH-H910N h.ear on 3 headset I got from Costco. But I heard such great things about the XM4's that I just had to get a pair. So when they went on sale I jumped on it. Now I LOVE the WH-H910N headphones. Really couldn't imagine anything sounded better, but I was persuaded by the youtube reviewers that the XM4 was a huge leap forward, and the XM4 had bluetooth 5.0 (just like my WH-H910N's) with the extended range to 100 feet or so, which is why I never wanted the XM3's, as they only had the 30 foot range of bluetooth 4. So anyways, I ordered em, I got em, I unpacked em, I put em on, and powered on. HISSSSSSSSSSSSSS. That's what I heard. Opened the sony headphones app and checked to see ANC was on. It was. Downloaded a firmware update from Sony. Thought that might help. HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. No help. Looked it up online and this apparently is a common issue with these headphones. When I played music the sound quality was excellent, with perhaps a larger ""space"" sound than my h.ear on 3's, but not really a better sound. And you have to turn up the volume to a certain point to cancel out the hissing, which is still audible at low music volumes. I tried moving the ambient noise meter in the app, but that just let in more ambient noise. So.........just disappointing. I know Sony can do ANC well because I have a set with flawless ANC execution, but the XM4's are just a mess. I read Sony replaced Qualcomm chips in the XM3's with Mediatek chips in the XM4's and ditched support for some codecs (apx?), but not sure how that would make ANC hiss.By way of comparison, My WH-H910N h.ear on 3 headset is dead silent with ANC on. DEAD SILENT. I hear nothing. No hiss. No white noise. Nothing. Freaking awesome. So when you buy a pair of headphones that is allegedly the apex predator of ANC headphones, the best of the best, you expect them to at least match the performance of the headphones you got for a hundred bucks at Costco. These XM4's, however, were not as good as the h.ear on 3's I already owned. So I returned em. Maybe I could have exchanged them for a different pair, and the new pair wouldn't have the hissing sound, but I doubt it. I read so many reviews of this product where people would say they enjoyed the ANC's ""white noise"" and found it relaxing. I found it irritating. No way I could listen to that. It's not noise cancellation if it just replaces the ambient noise with a different noise. Maybe the XM5's will address the hissing issue, but I'm happy with the wH-H910N h.ear on 3 headset I have. You may want to consider those."
Makes my ears sweat and makes me feel too hot
"I did lots of research before purchasing over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones. The XM4s landed at the top of my list after weighing pros and cons of about 4-5 other models (including AirPods Max and even the XM5s). I’m happy with these, but they aren’t perfect.The battery life is incredible. Period.The noise cancelling in controlled environments is excellent. However, the noise cancelling when in an environment that does not have consistent noise (such as on an outdoor walk in the city) falls off significantly. The wind noise and “random” noises (such as a truck engine, etc.) are still annoyingly audible. That’s the nature of noise cancelling technology, but Apple does a better job than Sony in this regard.Also, maybe I just have a huge head (I don’t think I do) but I wish the ear cups were just even 10% larger. My ears tend to feel a bit cramped while wearing these. An hour is the absolute maximum I can wear these at a time before needing a break.I think I’m to the point where I am spoiled by Apple aesthetics and the overall experience with Apple products. (I recognize it’s not a true A/B comparison between my AirPods Pro and the XM4s, but I can’t afford to spend $600 on the over-the-ear AirPods Max. I’m speaking more about the overall user experience.) For example:The app that’s needed to set up the XM4s is fine, but just unintuitive enough to be annoying.The XM4s’ noise cancelling gives me a bit of the “claustrophobic” sensation that I never get from the AirPods Pro.Even though you CAN make phone calls on the XM4s, the microphone quality isn’t good enough to do so In any situation where you need to be clearly understood.I guess at the end of the day, if my AirPods Pro and XM4s are both sitting in front of me, I’m choosing my AirPods Pro 99 times out of 100. The only time I found the XM4s superior was on an airplane, and even then, it’s close.I still do recommend these to anyone looking for over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones. I’m only saying to take what the YouTube Tech Review machine is saying about these with a grain of salt.They’re fine. Not great."
"THE GOOD:I was honestly impressed with the noise cancellation. I have neighbors that are quite loud, and I have a window AC unit so I could hear them and all their outdoor chores like mowing, but with these on it's almost completely silent, and unnoticeable if I had any audio playing whatsoever. Even shrill noises like the train horns passing by are much quieter. I thought the touch controls were nice, albeit sometimes a little inconsistent, but not often. The App was ""meh"" to me, I guess it did it's job?Sound is decent, you mainly buy something like this to block out the surrounding noise around you instead of audiophile reasons, but it gets the job done so you can zone out or focus.THE BAD:Unfortunately after about a day or two the right ear kept producing a buzzing sound that would get louder over time as you wear them. This seems to possibly be caused by ""moisture buildup"" (aka sweating, from what I've seen people say anyway) and usually seems to only happen to one side, left or right. I saw some advice online about fiddling with the wires to fix this, but you really shouldn't have to do that on a pair of headphones that costs over 300 dollars. There seems to be some quality assurance issues in the manufacturing process, because it never happened on the left side for me, and again, I see people only reporting this happening on one side most of the time. Some people would recommend wiping them out with a dry cloth, but I found that barely helps and is only temporary. My room is constantly cooled too, so it's not like I'm sweating all the time. Some people report this never happening, others report it happening to their units after several months, really seems like you're playing some lottery where your prize is a dysfunctional unit. The noise WILL drive you absolutely insane, which is why I returned them, even though the noise cancelling is so good.Also, the leather (don't know if real or not) earpads probably contribute a bit to that sweat/moisture issue. The headband is also made out of that material, and a bit thin, which I find gets uncomfortable after some time due to the lower surface area resting on your head. The Sennheiser 569's use something that feels reminiscent of suede for the earpads and headband, but doesn't make me sweat, and in my opinion is just as good of ""passive"" noise cancellation since it's also a closed back design.With all that said, if Sony happens to ever fix these issues in possible future iterations of these headphones, mainly the buzzing + comfort, I would be more than happy to pick up a pair. It was hard for me to return them just from the ANC alone, but the buzzing was making me go crazy."
"I'm a long time Bose user.  I've always liked Sony products, so decided to give these a try.  I'm disappointed.Noise Cancelation:  The basic noise cancelation works very well.  The problem is that the feature will shut off at random when listening to media.  This shutting off is not prompted by any noise or speaking.  It seems to be correlated with picking up the media device or changing tracks.  I didn't have time to test it - that was Sony's job.Controls:  See photo.  The red circle contains the Volume Up/Down, Pause, Next/Previous Track, and Answer Calls buttons.  One has to feel around in the dark to activate these functions, and there are no indicators on the device for the locations of the buttons.  And there's no haptic feedback.  There's not a physical button under the device cover.  It's strictly a touch sensor.  This results in many wrong function selections.  Forward a track when you meant to increase the volume.  Tapping at random hoping to activate the pause function - stuff like that.  I would suggest small embossed indicators on the cover to give one's fingers a landmark to land on.I'm returning these after 18 hours . . . . ."
I purchased them in 2022 and absolutely loved them. Sound proof functions worked great and sound quality was amazing. It’s 2024 now and they aren’t holding much of a charge anymore. Sometimes they don’t want to charge when I plug them in and when they do charge they work for maybe an Hour and a half before saying “low battery” again
"Sound quality is very good and noise canceling is good as well that only thing that did not convince me was how expensive it was and just how fragile it felt on my head, as well as slipping off every so often :/ sadly I returned them and got a refund."
"I am autistic and wanted some high quality headphones because I wear them almost all day every day.The good:Music sounds great, I am no expert in that.Noise canceling works really well.Comfortable, I’ve never worn over head headphones so long because I wear glasses and am highly sensitive. Sometimes I feel some uncomfortable pressure but I can usually wear these literally all day.The badYou can’t use while charging. My cheap headphones can, this is so annoying because if they die while I’m working it messes up my whole flow. It does charge fast but this to me is a huge con.Often after charging, it won’t turn on for a few minutes after unplugging. Sometimes plugging back in and unplugging helps. I think maybe something doesn’t trigger it to let you turn in after charging right away. But it’s annoyingPairing with 2 devices doesn’t work that well in practice. Say I’m on a video call for work on my computer. Someone calls my phone, if I’m paired to the phone it switches to the phone. Now I’m frantically trying to find my phone to unpair so I can be part of the meeting. Same thing if your phone gets a message, though less time. I started just unpairing the phone whenever a meeting started. There needs to be a way to say x device has priority right now.Randomly the speak to chat will enable itself. I have turned off in the app many times, and it just decides to enable itself again at annoying times. One time I was using loud machines outside and my hands were dirty. The software thought the machine was my voice I guess, and so it turned off noise canceling and even seemed to amplify the noise. Pretty annoying, you can turn it back off but why do I have to keep doing that. I haven’t uninstalled their app or anything like that.When I connect to a computer, it creates 2 devices, an audio and stereo. You have to use the audio when using the mic. And the sound quality/noise canceling is terrible on that setting. I don’t know whose fault that is, the operating system or headphones, but I hate it.The mic quality works but I often get people saying they hear echoes or can’t understand. Other times seems fine, but I often use a different mic because of those issues.Overall, good headphones. If they would spend some time polishing things and allow use while charging it would be 5 stars for me. Due to the cost and many small issues I can’t rate it that high"
"I rarely write reviews, but considering these are premium headsets, I felt like it's warranted.  My goal for these headphones were for mix of personal and business use so I wanted a headphone that could connect to multiple devices at one time and could seamlessly transition from one to the other.  I wanted a headphone that could connect to my phone (Samsung Note 20 Ultra) so I can take personal calls and listen to music while I worked, as well as connect to my work computer so I can do Zoom meetings and make Google Voice calls.I am not a sound expert, so to me, this headset provided sound and call quality that I am satisfied with.  People on the other end of the line said my voice came through very clearly.  They are very comfortable to wear all day and do keep out a good bit of my screaming children in the background.My BIG gripe:I bit the bullet and spent more for this headphone instead of the previous model and other headphones on the market because of the advertised Multipoint connection - being able to connect to two devices at the same time.  So, I connected to my phone for voice and music.  Everything was great - I made calls and listened to music in between calls.  Then I added my computer.  I was able to do Google Voice, Zoom, and listen to youtube videos just fine on the computer.  The headphones were even able to toggle back and forth between the phone and the computer for voice calls and Zoom meetings.So the big problem came in when I realized that although it was able to switch between the phone and computer for voice calls, it could not do the same for music.  When the computer is connected, no music audio can be played on my phone, even when the computer is not playing anything.  After messing with the various settings, using the Sony headphone app, etc, I thought, maybe I'm not doing something right.  So I chatted with text support - 3 times, in case I got a chat rep who was inexperienced.  But all three of them gave me the same answer - you can connect to both devices.  However, you can only connect for either voice or music, you have to choose.  You cannot be connected for both voice AND music on both devices.  I only use my computer for work - no music or youtube, but cannot change the settings on it to remove the music.  So, not being able to listen to music on my headphone in between calls on the phone and still be connected to the computer is a big bummer for me.  This is especially true when I have cheap $30 earbuds from Amazon that can do this, they're just not comfortable to wear all day.Had I known this, I would have gone with the WH-1000xm3 and saved myself the $100 difference at the time."
"I had been using Airpods Pro for a while but they tend to make my ears itchy and I can't use them for long flights, so I needed something with a longer battery life.I got these during Prime Day at a great price, but I'm still not sure they are worth it.The audio is great, so they perform that very well.My problems revolve around the connectivity and the dependency on the phone app, which is useless when you're not using a phone.To start, it does pair with TWO devices at the same time, but only two, and half the time it works as it says.If you have a phone, a tablet and a laptop, you're out of luck. In my case I have my work laptop, phone and personal laptop that I wanted to use these with. I got used to the easy switch of the Airpods Pro (Once paired, whichever device requests connection, it connects).When connected to the two devices, it's supposed to play from whichever device is playing audio. So if you pause one and play on the other, it switches. This works... sometimes. Most of the time it won't detach from the paused one and the headphones can't be taken over, not even with the app. You have to go find that second device, go to bluetooth settings and disconnect. The $100 standard airpods handle this with grace, but the $350 sony can't.My other gripe is the padding. While comfy, it could've been deeper. I don't think I have abnormally big ears but the edge of my ear is slightly pressed by the inside of the headphone and after 10 min it starts going numb unless I tilt the cup forward a bit or do something to find the sweet spot.Other than those two (big to me) items, the audio is great once you turn the bass DOWN a bit and the noise cancelling tunes out a plane by like 80%. Much better than the Airpods Pro.I might have to look into the Airpods Max I guess.I don't fully blame Sony here, the Bluetooth protocol is a disaster from a technical standpoint, but Apple somehow made it happen, so it can be done."
"The good:The fitThe comfortThe sound quality and ANCThe microphone seems decent for phone callsThe 2 physical buttons are greatThe bad:The touch bad is a terrible replacement for simple buttons. I wear these at work and in the gym and often would like to change volume quickly and assertively, which more often leads to pausing or changing the track. I never had this issue with physical buttons.The “speak-to-chat” feature randomly turns back on and pauses my music, which is extremely frustrating as I have to go back into the app to turn it off.The price is what I would expect to pay for the sound quality, but it is terribly overshadowed by features I have zero interest in and the horrid touch pad. Please just give me physical buttons for my gorilla hands."
"I usually always buy Bose, but decided to try these. They have a great quality sound. They are a bit big.They don’t adjust much. I’m sure fit men much better than woman."
"Overall the headphones work just fine, but I have two major issues. First, I have thin hair and wear glasses so the headphones don’t fit very securely on my head. I constantly feel like they are going to slide off my head and I find myself constantly adjusting them. It’s very annoying. Secondly, I really dislike having to use an app with any item I buy. I just want to buy a product and be able to use it without needing an app. I don’t want to deal with app updates, nor worry that at some point in time the headphones will become incompatible with my devices because I can’t update the software for the product.. It is frustrating and tiring to feel like I don’t own the product I purchased anymore because we are at the mercy of software updates."
"LESS THEN ! STAR!!!I’ve been a loyal Sony customer for years, with a significant investment in their cameras and lenses. While there are some issues with their camera equipment, nothing compares to the disappointment and frustration I’ve experienced with their wireless headphones. I am thoroughly dissatisfied with both the **Sony WH-1000XM4** and the **WHCH710N** models.The **Sony WHCH710N** headphones literally fell apart. The cheap plastic components couldn't withstand normal wear and tear, and I never subjected them to any harsh conditions. Despite my attempts to fix the broken parts, I eventually gave up. Given my disappointment, I decided to upgrade to the so-called ""better"" Sony headphones—the **WH-1000XM4**, which were on sale for $100 off their original price. I hoped this would provide a better experience. However, my disappointment with this ""high-quality"" product was even greater.The problem with the **WH-1000XM4** wasn’t their durability, as I didn't have them long enough for that to be an issue. Instead, the Bluetooth connection constantly dropped between my headphones and my computer. I initially thought the issue was with my high-end computer or its Bluetooth setup. But I tested other wireless devices, including my inexpensive Sony in-ear buds, and those connected without any issues. The problem was clearly with the WH-1000XM4 headphones.At this point, I didn’t even bother asking Sony to replace these defective headphones. My past experiences with their customer service over camera connectivity issues had already left me disillusioned. Every time I reached out for help with these camera issues, my concerns seemed to fall on deaf ears. Given their unresponsiveness, I had little faith they would resolve this situation either.Given these experiences with both headphones and other Sony products—including cameras and lenses—I’m seriously questioning my continued investment in Sony. It’s frustrating when a brand you once trusted begins to feel unreliable.In conclusion, **buyer beware**: while some Sony products are still great, my recent experiences suggest the brand is becoming hit-or-miss, and unfortunately, in some cases, even third-rate.,I went ahead and ordered the Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT2 headphones and I can confidently say that these headphones are most superior to the Sony headphones I bought, thought they are not noise cancelling. Noise cancelling is not important to me as I am not walking down the street with headphones on or flying on an airplane. I live in a very nice simple home, and these headphones are the GOAT IMO!!!"
"I purchased this product because one reviewer wrote that it was a comfortable over-ear fit while wearing eyeglasses.  This is quite true - it was very comfortable.  Unfortunately, that was the only aspect of the headphones that I liked.  The weight, smartphone app, and noise-canceling were all negatives.  I ended up with a painful headache by the end.  I returned the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones for a refund (minus return shipping cost).+ Comfortable over-the-ear cups while wearing eyeglasses (a rare find).- Overall weight is uncomfortable.- The smartphone app was not created by persons versed in user interface/user experience design.- I could hear the noise-canceling effect... as in the electronic buzzing when the noise-canceling is working to adjust the volume of detected audio around the wearer."
"As a huge fan of the XM2s (which my son uses daily), I bought the XM4s as I needed to switch bluetooth connections and improved microphones for conference calls. Overall, I do love the XM4s. They have great sound and while I also have AirPod Pros, the sounds that the XM4s produce sounds richer and warmer.The mics, while better, didn't improve conference calls but with an external after-market wired mic that fits the headphones, an inexpensive upgrade that I can manage.But as others have indicated, they develop what is an insanely loud screeching noise that sounds like the mic gain is too high and the noise is a type of feedback in the right ear. Loud enough that others across the room and in an adjacent room can hear it.I figured out that if I move the app over to another ANC mode, the screech ends immediately. So, I suspect that there could be a software or firmware patch to fix it.Given that these were an investment for me, I looked on Reddit and other places to see if I could fix. I'd cleaned the mic after disassembling the right headphone and used compressed air to see if that would return them to their former glory days. Neither attempt worked. I still use them daily but have to get into the app when I boot them up to switch the ANC over to another option. Otherwise, the screeching starts.Since these are out of warranty, there's unlikely to be a fix. While the XM5s are tempting, my faith in the XM line is a bit shaken."
"As most reviews have mentioned, the noise cancellation feature on this headphone is top notch.  It makes most noises disappear.  If the noise doesn't disappear, it minimizes the noise.  That's still better than nothing.  That silence does come with a price for plastic glasses wearers.The pleather material used on the earpads makes a rubbing noise when it come in contact with the plastic arms of my glasses.  The total lack of sound created by the noise cancellation seems to amplify this noise.  Every time I moved my head/face, I would hear a loud (brrrttt) noise in my headset.  Unless you can keep your head/face perfectly still, you will end up hearing this noise quite often.  Yes, it will drive you nuts.  Microfiber earpads will help with this problem, but there are no third party microfiber earpads available.Folks with metal frames, YMMV.Couple of other things I've noticed:- Out of the box, the headphones are super bass heavy.  This can be fixed through the EQ on the Sony headphone app.  Setting is stored on the headphones, so you can use the setting on other devices without the app.- The headband is about 1 inch wide.  It is supported by relatively thick padding.  But since the band itself is so narrow, it was causing hot spots on my head.- Like typical closed back headphones, my ears got warm/sweaty, quickly.- I experienced some low frequency humming noises.  Noise went away when I turned off noise cancellation.  Not sure what noise the headphone was trying to cancel out.- The headphone is rechargeable via USB-C to USB-C cable.  Some USB-C devices don't follow specs so you have to use a USB-C to USB-A cable (similar to the one included with the headphone).  But, it charges fine with a C to C cable.- Build quality is excellent.  Didn't experience the creaking noise users experienced when stretching out the headphones.- LDAC would default to the best effort setting on my Samsung Note 10+ & Tab S7+.  I can manually change it to the higher 660kbps and 990kbps setting.  But, whenever I reconnect, my device would revert back to the best effort setting (adaptive bit rate).- Bluetooth light doubles as the power on light (blue color).  Very noticeable in a dark place.Noise cancellation works well, most of the time.  Unfortunately, the rest of the headphones need some work."
"Bought them for their supposedly superior noise cancelling, but hasn’t met expectations at all. My beats did better and at the risk of saying it my AirPods as well. I wore them to the gym and noise was still passing through, same thing for when I took a flight. The only way to get decent noise blocked out is the music volume on blast. The build quality is amazing and the headphones are comfortable so that’s a pro to these headphones. The bass sound is very good as well. Overall serviceable at best but not worth the price that has yet take a dip."
"These headphones felt comfortable and had good build quality, and the sound was excellent. The voice pass-through was very effective, eliminating background noise. The app was also of high quality.My problem with them is that there was no way to manually turn on and off the voice pass-through to the app. I bought them mainly for use in waiting rooms for my many medical appointments. The problem is that I wanted to enable the voice pass-through based on visual cues, primarily when someone enters the room to call names. I did not want to have to listen to people talking in the room, or a TV, or a conversation between patients and staff at the check-in/check-out window, but I wanted to be able to hear if it was my name being called or not. As I would not be the first person speaking, conversation mode, which enables pass-through when one begins speaking, is not useful. Neither is the capability for the headphones to learn based on location whether to enable voice pass-through. It was not even clear if I could program the button on the headphones to serve this purpose, but even if I could, if I’ve raised my hand to the headphones, it is just as easy to just take the headphones off as it is to try to hit that small button. It does not help in a restaurant or office either if I’m being approached by someone I want to hear who starts speaking before I do.So I returned them, and this is another issue. Unlike most Amazon returns, I had to supply a box, and the shipping method they supply is very slow. Apparently I have to wait several weeks after sending out the return to get the refund to my payment method."
"I have purchased this item twice, and both times it worked great all the way through the warranty period.The first one lasted 2 years (only has a 1 year warranty) before one side quit working., The second one lasted 18 months before the battery quit charging and overheated.This makes the cost of ownership excessively high! When they work the sound is remarkable, and the noise reduction can automatically adjust to reduce background noise. If it wasn't for the short service life I would buy again, but they shouldn't have to be replaced this often, especially at the going price."
"I recently purchased these noise-cancellation headphones, and they are fantastic for travel. They effectively block out ambient noise, making flights and commutes much more pleasant. The sound quality is excellent, and they are comfortable to wear for extended periods.However, they fall short when used for meetings on Teams. The microphone seems to pick up my voice clearly, but others have trouble hearing me properly. This makes them less ideal for professional virtual meetings. If you need headphones primarily for travel and casual listening, these are a great choice, but they might not be the best option for work-related calls."
"I love the headphones. Super lightweight, very comfortable (even though u do build warm moisture in the earcups), and they sound pretty good for their target audience. The app is pretty good too, it's easy to use and simple. Not too complex. However, it is lacking some clarity I'd like. Overall a great headphone. My issue with it is a personal one. That being, when I wear headphones I get tension headaches from the pressure of the headphones pressing around my ears. I thought perhaps since I've tried these before and they were super light, they might be the answer, but unfortunately they ended up doing the same thing for me. So I guess headphones are just a no-go for me at all. Sticking to wireless earbuds and IEMs I suppose! Oh yeah and the noise cancellation is exceptional. It's absolutely EXCELLENT! You won't hear the plane at all. However, I did experience discomfort from the negative pressure. Beware!If you like warm bassy sound that's pretty enjoyable for music then these are the headphones for you!! Haha, loved the sound, it was different from what I was used to for sure. And them being a headphone really immersed me into the experience. Oh well! I hope these work for everyone else who tries them out. I think I'm gonna return them, even though I got them for the sweet sweet deal of $229 😭 what a tragedy to have to return."
headphones sound great and are comfortable but the head phones lasted me about two years and now they wont charge.
"These are by far some of the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. The noise canceling is top notch in every environment I've needed to use them (mostly the office with an open concept, and airplane travel), which means I can listen to music or other content at a reasonable volume with full clarity. Having them paired to my computer and phone at the same time is a great convenience that will be a requirement when I replace them eventually. I use them for ~8+ hours a day, Monday - Friday, with minimal ear fatigue. The only downside I am aware of is that recipients on the other side of phone calls and video chats will often comment about my voice not coming through nearly as clear as others; not clear whether it's the headphones or a service connection issue.After about a year, I started getting feedback on a regular basis when turning them on (it occurs about 90%+ percent of the time now), or occasionally midway through a listening session (maybe once out of 20-50 sessions now). If you can tolerate the popping and extremely high pitched squeal, it may sort itself out. More often though, I've had to rub my fingers over the mics on the bottom and screened opening on the top of the ear cup that is acting improperly, interrupting the feedback, and hoping to quickly get it to stop before I have to take them off from the piercing pain the feedback causes. I've tried resetting and recalibrating them, with no long term success (in fact one attempt at this resulted in the feedback immediately starting again). I contacted support to report the issue and to get any assistance to resolve it, and rather than any supportive feedback, I was simply asked to confirm my purchase date, and summarily dismissed when they discovered that my warranty had expired. These headphones have experienced no trauma, no exposure to the elements, and yet this issue is extremely predictable. It seems that there is some minor product defect that Sony does not seem to care about so long as it only becomes an issue after the warranty period has elapsed.I would give 5* on the headphones. 2* knocked off for the feedback issue and lack of long term support."
"No I'm not an elf.  I have relatively small ears, but there's not enough room in the ear cuff.  I'm used to my Bose headphones and they have large ear pieces and don't touch my ears while I'm using them.  Not a problem with short time use but after a couple of hours of use my ears get sore.  Other than that I think the sony's are better than the bose.  Maybe my wife can use them while we are in an airplane traveling."
"Your review effectively captures both the positive and negative aspects of the headphones. Here's a slightly refined version:While the overall performance of these headphones is commendable, there's a significant letdown when it comes to handling phone calls. The noise-canceling feature works wonders for creating an immersive listening experience, and the sound quality is exceptional. However, the promised superior filtering for voice calls falls short of expectations.Unfortunately, during calls, background noise seems to infiltrate effortlessly, rendering conversations challenging, especially in noisy environments. Whether it's the rustle of wind, passing cars, ambient music, or nearby chatter, these sounds are uncomfortably audible to the person on the other end of the line. Consequently, I find myself having to abandon the convenience of using the headphones during calls, opting instead to take them off to ensure clear communication.In summary, while the headphones excel in delivering an outstanding audio experience and effective noise cancellation for music playback, their performance during phone calls leaves much to be desired. The inability to effectively filter out ambient noise significantly hampers their functionality for everyday communication tasks."
"After almost a month: This headphones sound quality and noise cancellation works great. When it comes to the pairing features, it can get complicated. Both of my device support multipoint connection meaning I can use two devices simultaneously. This headphones only allows two device connection, if you want to use a third device you will have to completely disconnect one device. Even though both of my device support multipoint connect only one device will play sound ( The way it prioritize devices is so annoying). Even when pausing (or closing the app playing the sound) the sound on the device I was using first (Which i was told from Sony Support)  to hear the sound from the second  device, it will not work, i have reset the headphone and the Bluetooth connection(forget device on both devices) multiple times, the issue persist. And when it works you will have to wait maybe 30 second then to hear the sound coming from the other device even when i completely turned off the sound on the first device. You will have to play with the Sony app setting to make  it usable, it is so annoying because i have heard multiple good review on the Sony WH-XM4. The pairng feature sucks , ""device one connected:"" ""device two disconnect"", it so annoying to hear it from the  assistant guide. Overall I don't recommend the headphones if you don't want to suffer from this issue."
"TLDR: Barely functional at moments every day, severe connectivity issues, highly annoying issues, replacements/updates solved nothing, but the sound and audio cancellation is great.  I would never consider recommending these to anyone.For the last year I've dealt with horrible connectivity problems: Every 1-3 hours there are flurries of disconnecting and reconnecting bluetooth that last several minutes, interrupt my audio, and add many beeps. At least once a day, at power on, it will not connect to the bluetooth of any audio sources at all. Several times a week they will connect to bluetooth but not register as an audio device meaning I can't choose them as my audio output despite seeing them bluetooth connected.For all connectivity problems I do the following until they connect: reboot several times, reset when that doesn't work, if none of that works then deleting and creating new bluetooth connections. Recently, it seems to me the problems appear more frequently when battery is below ~50%. I'm exploring that as a possibility now. I'd rather charge them more often if that reduces the frequency of these problems.The problems didn't seem so bad or frequent the first few weeks but I may have just been enamored with the great audio and noise cancelling. I thought matters would improve (faulty thought process), so I didn't return them. At any price these are ridiculous problems to deal with multiple times every day much less for hundreds of dollars.I'm on my 2nd pair after a warranty replacement because inserting the audio cable broke something inside which broke the noise cancelling. Warranty replacement was not smooth as Sony required uploading the proof of purchase to a site that would error out with every upload attempt regardless of which browser or OS. It took a few days, 2 claims, and one very helpful support person that agreed to let me email the receipt to work around the busted website.My problems occur with all my audio sources: MacBook and iPhone 11 are my primary sources and at times with an iPad and Windows laptop.  I use them 3-8 hours every day. I use the latest firmware which is supposed to at least address the frequent bluetooth drops (it didn't make any noticeable difference for me). The problems are no different with the the replacement headset received a few months ago.2 stars instead of 1 because when they work the listening experience, comfort, and noise cancelling are amazing. I also love the transparency feature and that it's level of transparency can be adjusted with the app. Some of the features accessible through the app are difficult to use (for example, switching equalizer settings is done in a really bad way and is very slow). Other settings make the listening experience worse like trying to learn my locations to adjust the noise cancelling which really just causes audio interruptions in my audio and extra notifications as I move room to room (I think I was able to turn off notifications before giving up in the feature entirely). But the features that didn't resonate with me might be good for others.I would never consider recommending these to anyone.Edit: After 7 months some of the plastic and the hinges on both ear pieces have started to squeak like bad $50 headphones.I would never consider recommending these to anyone."
"I'm an old hand at noise cancelling wireless headphones. I tend to wear them all day when I work from home. I listen to music, audiobooks, phone calls and online meetings all day. I use them with a MacBook and an iPhone. I got these in the hopes that they would work better with my Mac products that my Sennheiser PXC 555-II. Those ones just shut down randomly while connected to both devices. I was told these Sony's were supposed to work especially well with Mac products. They do not.What I like about these:(1) Good sound quality(2) mic works well for phone calls and online meetings(3) long battery life, very fast recharging. (The fast recharging is my favorite part, it's really amazingly fast!)(4) lightweight, comfortable on my head all day. But so were the Sennheiser.(5) noise cancelling works well for ambient indoor noiseWhat I don't like, and can't even really understand:(1) when connected to two devices, often I can't get sound from either device to play. So these basically cannot functionally connect to my Macbook and my iPhone at the same time.(2) relatedly, when my Macbook is asleep, my headphones connect to that, thus making me unable to listen to audio from my phone. So I have to open the laptop to turn off bluetooth so that I can listen on my phone.(3) when I burp (yes, burp), they headphones pause whatever is playing.(4) the controls on the right ear are insensitive. I effectively cannot pause my audio at a touch(5) when I receive a phone call while my headphones are connected to my iPhone, it turns the ring volume all the way down on my phone. This results in my alarm being silent the next day. This is a big problem so now I basically can't trust my iPhone alarm.(6) adaptive noise cancelling plays a noise as it changes settings. The sounds is much louder than what I'm listening to. So if you want to go for a walk and talk on the phone hands free and a car drives by or there's a breeze, I hear a loud beep and I can't hear the person I'm talking to. I've turned off this setting as a workaround.Overall, I regret this purchase."
"I would say the most impressive thing about these headphones are the comfortability-they are very comfortable and also the fact they are foldable. Personally, the sound quality is average to me compared to other headphones. Nothing very impressive, good but not great. I bought them on sale for $200 so its a bargain. The in app features being able to to tweak the sound, and other features is also nice."
"I appreciate how well it cancels out white noise, but I have a major issue with it cutting out frequently. While listening to music, it disrupts multiple times during a single song, which is extremely frustrating. I considered requesting a replacement, but since this problem started just over a month ago, I'm beyond the return window. It's really disappointing, especially considering the high cost. My cheaper headphones never had this problem."
"So, first off, I'll say that this headset has great active noise cancellation (ANC). I'm comparing it to a Sennheiser PXC550 which has been my go-to OTE ANC headset til now. The ANC on this one blows the PXC550 out of the park.For sound quality, eh, it's ok. It feels pretty flat by default, and trying different equalizer settings only made it marginally better. I'm in no way an audiophile, so I assume it's pretty bad to be this noticeable. Another issue with the equalizer that you need to switch equalizer presets through the mobile app (annoying for me, since I'm using this exclusively for desktop). This also contrasts with the PXC550, which has a physical button to cycle through presets.One feature that continues to irritate me with this headphone is that there is a slew of voice responses that cannot be disabled. ""Power on."" ""Bluetooth  Device 1 Disconnected"" etc. Again, this contrasts with the PXC550, where you could at least use their app to replace all voice prompts with succinct notification sounds. Looking up the issue, it seems to be something that Sony is actively ignoring despite userbase complaints, so I wouldn't hold out hope on them changing it.The touchpad controls also feel rather clunky. I only use it to change volume, and have to do a full swipe up/down for each tick of volume. It also semi-regularly misinterprets and tries to do something else, like pausing whatever I have playing, or turning off audio for local chat mode. This again contrasts with the PXC550 (the only other touchpad headset I've tried, admittedly), which feels pretty well-tuned and can adjust a full volume range with just a few swipes.One other feature that Sony really tries to push is a premium (subscription) feature called 360 Reality Audio. Their marketing for it is vague to the point that I don't understand what exactly they're actually selling. My big concern is that it's some sort of pay plan-gated access to surround sound for an already premium priced headset. I'll at least give them the benefit of the doubt and say that some preliminary surround sound tests seem to work alright without this.No report yet on battery life, but it seems that it can't both charge and play at the same time."
"Bottom line; sound is just mediocre.Out of the box these have a horrendous base shelf that drowns out all of the mids. You can attempt to tune this down with the EQ in the Sony app but it's difficult to get a proper tuning as their are only 5 preset frequency bands. The default tune of the headphone should be more balanced instead of being ridiculously boosted out of the box. Thankfully the EQ tune you set on your phone will carry over to over devices like your PC for instance; but that does not fix AUX mode. You'll always have the bad tune there. Overall detail is mediocre, as is sound-staging.There is a sensor on the inside of one of the cups. This creates a noticeable channel imbalance. They should of balanced out their sound by having two; that way the distortion created by having the sensor would be even on both cups. This is actually what Apple did on the Max's.You can't use the highquality LDAC codec and Bluetooth multi-point at the same time. You are forced to downgrade to SBC which significantly reduces sound quality. You end up with about a third of the data bandwidth. I don't use the feature specifically because of this.Then there is the issue of latency. It's noticeably bad on PC; to the point where you can notice lip-desync. On mobile it's fine, but still not good enough to play a game on. You can use AUX to solve this but then you lose your EQ and worsen the problems with channel imbalance. They could of included low-latency codecs and the option to switch to them but they didn't.What's possibly the most puzzling thing about these is that they removed aptX and aptX HD support from the last model. This is important because Windows does not support LDAC (And won't be), so your stuck with having to use SBC on Windows in all situations. Like I said earlier; about a third the bandwidth.Everything else works fine, as other reviewers mention. I personally have no problems with the touch-pad.  You can get significantly better sounding Bluetooth headphones for half the price if you do away with ANC and a few gimmicks. I got mine at a significant prime day discount and am still on the fence about it.Eh. Still waiting for a set that combine good sound with good tech."
"These headphones are almost perfect. The sound quality is amazing, the noise cancellation (while way too strong for my liking) is solid, and they're very comfortable to wear. Unfortunately Sony decided that they had to ruin these amazing headphones with multiple gimmicks, all of which are located in the (required) headphones app. The least annoying of these features is probably the one I was dreading the most when I bought these headphones: the touch controls. They are surprisingly accurate and they only really have issues if you accidentally brush side with the controls against your arm or neck. Then there's the automatic pausing feature which just pauses music and videos when the headphones detect that you've removed them, this usually works but sometimes it thinks my neck is my ear and starts playing the music again after I've just removed them. The absolute worst feature is the ambient noise feature. Theoretically it's supposed to be so you can hear your surroundings when you need to and be the opposite of the noise canceling mode. In reality it's just quicker to remove the headphones and the feature in general has absolutely abysmal implementation. There are 3 ways ambient sound can activate, you manually toggle it, you speak (with the speak to chat option enabled) or you start a call. The first two make sense, but the last one kills these headphones if you want to use them for literally ANYTHING other than purely listening to music. This ambient sound mode absolutely destroys the sound quality while it is on, this is fine in most scenarios as you aren't actively listening to the sound but it activating during calls makes it so you can't even hear what the other person is saying. Unlike the other two ways to activate ambient sound, you absolutely cannot deactivate or toggle the setting while in a call, it is stuck in ambient sound mode no matter what. This also effects all other sound coming though the headphones while also amplifying any sound happening around you. It's an effectively useless feature that though forced implementation ruins these otherwise very good headphones. Look for something else unless you are 100% sure you will never use these for anything but music."
"These headphones are my first set of nicer headphones.  I splurged on Prime Day and decided to try them out.  I previously used a set of pretty cheap noise-canceling wireless headphones- and I assumed that the much more expensive Sony ones would far exceed the sound quality and features of the lower quality set.After about two weeks of use, I'm a bit indifferent.  Yes, the sound quality is better with these Sony headphones.  There's an app that lets you adjust things, but after two weeks, I'm really struggling on how these are are worth the price premium of a set that cost half as much.If you are sitting down or not moving, these do sound much better than the cheaper set.  The problem is when you move- say you are wearing them while taking a walk or just moving from room to room- the sound quality can deteriorate pretty quickly- not because the headphones fall out of Bluetooth range- but rather because they seem to vibrate on your head as you walk- which creates some rather unpleasant sounds as the ear cushions move slightly on your head.  It's super annoying... because the none of the cheaper sets of wireless noise-canceling headphones that I've owned did that.Secondly, something that other reviewers have noticed- is that the pivot or joint between the headband and actual piece that covers your ear feels very, very cheap.  I'm constantly afraid that I'm going to break it.  Almost everything else about these headphones feels like it's pretty good quality- but those joints are very flimsy.In the end, I'm glad that I bought these on Prime Day- which is why I'm not returning them.  At full price, they just don't seem worth the cost."
"I had to exchange in my first Sony headphones because the mic on them was garbage – nobody on the other side of my phone calls or Zoom calls could hear what I was saying, and it was all garbled. I exchanged them, only to get another pair with the same mic issues and ALSO awful connectivity problems. It keeps turning off or disconnecting randomly, triggered by seemingly tiny movements of my head, or just on its own – sometimes every 5 seconds. Other times it remains connected for hours. I have no idea how to get it to work normally on command."
"I'm somewhat of an audiophile, certainly very discriminating when it comes to listening to music.  Having been a former musician, I know what live music should sound like.  I bought the Sony WH-1000MX4 when on sale (saved $100) and because of the generally good reviews I've read over the past few years.I almost never listen to music that has been compressed (such as AAC, .mp3, etc.), because the degradation in sound quality is unacceptable to me.  I prefer lossless sources, CD-quality or higher, and I find Bluetooth transmission to degrade quality somewhat, even with lossless sources.So to start, the WH-1000MX4's are, in my judgment, good but not great.  For the best fidelity, I much prefer my Sennheiser HD650 headphones.  Yes, the Sennheiser's are open-back and not noise-cancelling.  But for quality for hours of comfortable listening to a wide range of lossless music sources, the HD650's are my go-to (when not listening to Dolby Atmos music recordings in my living room, with B&W 804 D2 main speakers, CDM 7NT center/surrounds, and SVS SB-2000 subs).I even prefer the Apple AirPods Pro for listening quality, when compared to the Sony 1000MX4's.  While the active noise cancellation is not as good in the AirPods Pro when compared to the 1000MX4's, I still prefer the fidelity of the AirPods when the source is lossless and the environment is not too noisy.Also, the ""eardrum suck"" phenomenon (see WireCutter article on active noise cancellation) can be an issue.  At least the Sony app for the 1000MX4 allows some adjustment of the ANC level, which seems to help some in my own experience thus far.  I have yet to try the Sony's on plane flights, so the verdict is out on that for me.  My overall conclusion is that the ANC compromises sound quality of lossless music, especially over Bluetooth connections.  I suppose that, in a very noisy environment, the compromise might be worth it.  But I tend to avoid noisy environments as much as I can.  The verdict is out on that, for now, until I get more opportunities to try the Sony's with my lossless music libraries."
I bought these because I needed noise cancelling headphones for working from home. They're really good at the noise cancelling headphones thing and have great sound quality. The Bluetooth range is a little weak.Update: I've had to replace all the pads on these headphones to get rid of the awful stink. How is replacing these pads not part of the refurbishment? Cost me about $50 and several hours.I bought them refurbished. Whoever owned them before me or did the refurbishment soaked themselves or at least the headphones with the worst teenage boy locker room cologne. It's rank and giving me a headache. The stink is making them difficult to use and my partner doesn't want to be anywhere near them because they stink up a 10+ ft radius.So be warned that buying refurbished you may have to do a lot of work to get the stink out. If you have suggestions I'm open to them. Rubbing alcohol and Clorox wipes didn't do the trick yet.
"ANC is incredible 10/10. But the size of the headphones just didn't work for me. There wasn't enough clamping power, so my head got sore after an hour or so wearing it. Had to return. For reference, circumference around the ears where the headphones would sit, is 20.5 inches."
"I can count on 1 hand the items I've returned. In fact, I don't recall returning any other electronic ever. I'm hoping this review will help some people.I own the COWIN SE7 ANC (they go for around $100). Those got almost 6k review and 4.5 stars. So a well reviewed model, that costs less than 1/3 of these ones.XM4s are better are virtually everything, but does not blow them out of the water on anything except potentially the ANC for voices or other random loud sounds. For air conditioner or other low frequency noises they are both great.The one area where I like the COWN more is in comfort. I wear them for 5-8 hours a day.The battery life despite both being rated 30 hours is definitely better on the COWIN. The COWIN I had to charge once a week, I didn't have to think about it, the SONY never lasted a week, always had to charge mid-week and then end of week. Yeah both had ANC on.Despite all that I was going to keep the SONY, the app customization, the microphone quality is also a bit better, and especially the ANC for work from home made it worth it.The Sony also have Bluetooth 5.0 (can connect to 2 devices at the same time) BUT...Here is why I returned them. I own an iPhone and a MacBook Pro for work. I had had them connected to both.Things that could be just a faulty product:- one side would occasionally stopped sending audio. It didn't happen often but a few times during the month one side would have no audio, I would have to restart, connect back and forth until the audio finally came back. (this has never happened in my 2 years with the COWIN SE7)Bugs / Issues with the Dual Pairing. (this was the main reason I returned)- The headphones would pair a few times a day (2-3) to the wrong device and I had to fiddle with it for a several minutes each time to get it working again. One day it did this like 5 times and that was it for me. I returned them. Basically I'd open my phone and audio would play from the phone (great), then I'd lock my phone to return to the computer, and even though my phone had NO music playing, and the screen was locked, I could not get audio back to my laptop. So I had to fiddle with it for a few minutes to try and get it working. This became a daily hassle. So much that I stopped pairing it with the phone to avoid it, but the problem is in order to adjust ANC or music quality you need to pair it to the phone to use the Sony App. So I paired it to both again and the issue kept popping up. Sometimes it was the opposite. Sound would stay on laptop even though a call had come to the cellphone.The other standout feature above the XM3 was the ear detection to pause/play when you put them on your neck (take them off your head). While this worked fine sometimes, it still was a problem enough times. Upon inspecting the issue, the sensor is deep in the ear cup. When you wear these for a long time the cushion gets wider and the sensor keeps detecting them as on, so taking them off the music would just keep playing... If I got the ear cup and moved it (pressed the cushion to get out of the way of the sensor) it would stop playing.While I could've kept them, at that point I might as well save $120 and get the XM3s which are very similar. Since the dual pairing had so many issues, and the headphone detection (stop playing / resume playing) didn't work well, might as well save money and  get the XM3s.If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask in the comments and I'll try to answer them."
"I purchased noise canceling headphones to help dampen distracting noise while working at home. I did not intend to use them for phone calls, and indeed I have not ever tried to do so, so my review does not cover that feature. I tried the Bose QuietComfort 45, the Sony WH-1000XM4, and the Bose QuietComfort 35 II. I kept the QC 35IIs.NOISE CANCELINGThe QC 45 and Sony headphones do a much better job of canceling noise than does the QC 35II. If maximum noise cancelation is your foremost consideration above all else, get the QC 45s or Sonys. Their NC capabilities are comparable.SOUND QUALITYAs others have noted, the QC 45s emphasize higher frequencies. The WH-1000XM4s emphasize lower frequencies but the sound is what I call muddy: It’s not that bass sounds better, it’s that all low frequencies are boosted into a murky mess. The QC 45s and Sonys are distractingly bad in sound quality. This is where the QC 35IIs shine, and why I selected them over the others. Music, across all frequencies, sounds very good. No frequency range is dominant, and I can actually hear individual instruments and voices. I don’t drink NA beer, I don’t drink decaffeinated coffee, and I don’t listen to music through crappy headphones. Although the NC of the QC 35IIs can’t hold a candle to the others, had I selected one of the others, I would have cursed myself every time I used them. The music quality of the QC 35IIs is that much better than the other two. And I know that sound quality can be objective and can depend on the individual user. FWIW, my evaluation occurred shortly after I began my seventh decade on this Earth. BTW, when using the audio cable with the QC 35IIs, I found the sound quality noticeably better with the NC shut off.CONTROLSBoth QC models have physical buttons for volume and pause/un-pause, while the Sonys use various swipes on the right ear cover. As others have noted, each volume swipe on the Sonys adjusts the volume in a very small increment. It is annoying to have to swipe swipe swipe to make a volume adjustment, and that’s when the headphone actually recognizes it as a volume swipe. Double-tapping the Sonys to pause/un-pause works well, and is quick because you don’t have to feel around for the pause button like you do on the QCs. But I’ve come to terms with the microseconds I’ll lose over the lifetime of the headphones by having to fumble for the pause button on my QC 35IIs.BATTERY LIFEI didn’t keep the QC 45s and the Sonys long enough to determine battery life. I haven’t done a controlled study of battery life on the QC 35IIs, but based on my average daily usage, it’s got to be at least the 20 hours that are listed on Amazon.CHARGING CABLE CONNECTORThe QC 35IIs have a mini-USB connector, not the newer USB-C, but like the physical buttons, the microseconds I’ll lose by occasionally attempting to insert the charging cable incorrectly is something I’ve learned to accept."

I was able to consistently cause this issue to reproduce and attempted to report it to Sony who simply offered to replace them again! THESE HEADPHONES ARE DANGEROUS AND MAY CAUSE HEARING DAMAGE! DO NOT BUY!2021 original review:I bought these to use primarily with my Windows 10 desktop- which these headphones are clearly not designed to be used for.On Windows, the headphones show up as two separate devices- ""WH-1000XM4 Hands-Free AG Audio"" and ""WH-1000XM4 Stero"". You MUST set the AG Audio one to ""Default Communications Device"" and the Stero one to ""Default Device"" otherwise it simply will not work.My main grip with these headphones, though, comes from the fact that even though they have 9 integrated microphones for active noise cancelling, you cannot use any of them on PC while in high-fidelity audio mode. The device defaults to an audio quality lower than a piece of string connected to a paper cup if you have an application- like Discord or OBS- actively selected to use the ""AG Audio"" device.I just decided that I'd use my old, wired headphone's microphone for any audio input I needed, and use these headphones ""as intended by Sony"". Whatever, right? They still sounded amazing, they had amazing noise cancellation to the point where I couldn't even hear someone behind me talking.Well. That was true until about yesterday, when I started noticing I could hear things around me. I figured maybe my roommates were just being loud, but now I can actively hear someone watching television on the other side of the house while the headphones are set to ""Active Noise Cancelling."" So I've spent all evening looking at forum posts and other threads trying to figure out what happened and I'm finding that many, many other people are having the same issue with not only the XM4's, but the previous XM3's as well. After further testing, I've determined that when the headphones are set to ""Noise Cancelling"", they've actually defaulted to ""Ambient Noise"" with no way to fix this. I have tried factory resetting them, I have tried recalibrating them in the app, I've tried moving the slider around, turning it off, turning it on, resetting the headphones again, uninstalling the app, pressing the CUSTOM button on the side and NOTHING works.Turns out, Sony doesn't even have a support email. So now I need to wait until their helpline opens for either Live Chat or Phone to be told that I'll need to send them in for repairs. Lucky for me, my return period ended earlier this month so I guess I spent $350 on a pair of headphones that are notorious for experiencing issues after just 2 months of use.Not to mention that due to the shape and firmness of the headband and the weight of the device overall, likely due to the batteries (which I must say I am impressed with the battery life) I've noticed an unmistakable ""dent"" in my scalp where the band lays. Since I use these for >8 hours at a time, taking them off feels like I'm finally getting home from a long days work transporting water using a pitcher on my head. I've spoken to my doctor about this, and he tells me there's no chance it's permanent but it's very concerning to run my fingers through my head and feel what seems like nearly half an inch deep valley running across the front half of my scalp.Would I recommend these? Maybe, if you're the kind of person that buys new headphones every other month, and if you're really trying to solidify that Tyler1 cosplay these would be perfect for the job. For everyone else, I'd look elsewhere."
"This is a very disappointing review for me to write. I had the Sony XM3 headphones and got thousands of hours of use out of them during the pandemic. About a year after having them, I started having issues with the active noise cancellation (there was a slight background buzzing sound), so I turned the ANC off. The sound isolation was good enough that I didn't mind using them that way, and continued to use them until the band cracked. Despite the ANC issues, I liked the comfort and features of the heaphones, so I replaced them with the XM4's.Now, a little over a year later, the ANC is having issues again. This time, however, it's not just mildly annoying. There's a feedback loop being caused somehow so that the headphones blast an ear-piercing high-pitched tone inside the earcups. It's certainly loud enough to be extremely uncomfortable, and probably loud enough to do lasting damage if you don't get the headphones away from your ears quickly enough. So again I can't use the ANC, and I have to be careful during the few seconds after I turn the headphones on while they pair with my devices, before I can turn the ANC safely off.I contacted Sony support and they've told me they can't help because I'm 1.5 months beyond the abyssmal 1-year warranty period. I'll have to pay to ship the headphones to a repair center, then pay whatever they decide to charge for the repair. After some Googling, it seems this high-pitched feedback is a common issue, and Sony does not seem to stand by their product.At this price range, I should get more than 1 year's worth of full-featured use out of my headphones. I won't be buying Sony headphones again."
"I've had these headphones for just about one year in about 1-2 weeks from the date of this review. I've enjoyed how well the noise cancelling works. I wear these at work as I work within an open office environment, so I need to reduce noise to focus on my work. The audio quality is exceptional, the bass is good, and the active noise cancelling works flawlessly. There just one problem.The plastic these are made with with exceptionally cheap. The right ear swivel mechanism had a small piece of plastic that broke and the whole ear cup is now hanging by a wire. I would be understanding if I had been abusing these and handling them roughly but I have kept these in their protective case when not in use and stored them within a protective laptop bag for the entire year I've had them. I literally only use them at my desk. I have truly babied these headphones and now they've fallen apart due to low quality materials.I reached out to Sony customer service regarding the issue. They were quite friendly but confirmed for me that physical hardware or ""cosmetic"" damages such as the swivel falling apart would not be covered with my 1 year warranty. I now have a pair of $300 headphones that are completely useless. I looked into this specific part and found that others have had a similar issue with the cheap plastic swivel part breaking.In summary, I have now paid $300 for a pair of headphones that have fallen apart due to low quality plastics in the swivel just about 1-2 weeks away from the one year mark. I recommend avoiding these headphones, Sony's 1 year warranty will not protect you from low quality parts and you'll be on the hook for any repair costs. Save your money and go with a brand that stands by the quality of their product, Sony clearly doesn't."
"I really wanted to LOVE these headphones. For me, it’s all about the ANC and I know that these are one of the top rated and reviewed ANC headphones. Before I bought them I read hundreds of reviews, as I always do and mostly all the reviews were sparkling!!! I ride the train to and from NYC 5 days a week and one of my biggest pet peeves is people talking on their phones during my train ride, I honestly can’t stand it. So I did my research and ended up buying the air pod pros. Wow wow wow!! I couldn’t hear anything!!! The ANC was truly incredible!! This was my first ever pair of ANC headphones and I blown away by almost everything about these headphones. Key word. Almost. For the life of me, I couldn’t get these buds to stay in my ears. Tried every tip, even tried off brand memory foam tips. Still would fall out. With every tip, I even did the iPhone ear test that’s in everyone’s iPhone settings. Could NEVER get a perfect seal. Ok, no problem, I’ll order bud ear hooks. They stayed in with the hooks but after awhile, I was getting frustrated taking the hooks on and off to charge. So then I went without hooks. Again, they started falling out of one ear or the other. I couldn’t take it anymore. So my wife now owns them. She works out everyday, spins everyday. She hasn’t had a dropped bud yet (knock on wood) and that’s what I’ve been reading in my research. Some ears they stay in perfectly and some ears they fall out. I was too nervous about losing one. Had to move on. So after reading countless reviews, I ended up with thsee Sony headphones. Sound quality is top notch. A plus. Battery life is phenomenal. A plus plus. ANC. Ehhh. In my opinion a C minus. On my train ride I hear too much background noise. Ughhh especially other peeps talking on their phones. :(. I just returned them and now I’m waiting for the Bose quite comfort. They have hooks, so we’ll see.  So after some more research, I’ve learned that you really can’t compare buds to over the ear muff headphones for ANC, so in my opinion, if you’re looking for the very best ANC, muffs or buds, it’s night and day. Buds are by far better for drowning out backround noise. My Bose quite comfort came and the ANC is phenomenal!"
"TL;DR the headphones are nice but you need to pay monthly to get the full functionality of it, which dramatically impacts my review.When I first put these (or possibly the previous gen, I can't remember which but definitely a Sony WH series) on in Walmart when they were on display about 4 years ago, I wanted a set ever since. I finally made it happen this year in 2023, and I was blessed by the sweet sound of silence to the outside world, and I often just wear these without anything playing just to hear silence, as the active noise cancelling blocks out about 90% of my tinnitus and allows me to experience what I believe is true silence, which I love these for. You can link it to Google Assistant, or Alexa, or change the button to change the ambient sound mode on/off or noise cancelling on/off. To change settings and functionality of the buttons, you'll need to download their app and link the two together, there's no way to do it on the headphones themselves.These headphones are amazing for noise cancellation, battery longevity, and can fold up into a relatively compact size for portability. After using it for a while as wireless, It tried to plug it in using an aux cord and it just powers self off. Not sure if it's not compatible with aux input or if it's a user error, so I'm assuming it's only Bluetooth until I find out otherwise, but that's only a small issue. It folds up into a nice hardcase with zipper, and that's nice too. The headphones work great by themselves, but I have a bone to pick about the decision to make the optimum sound quality locked behind a paywall. Greed has eliminated the days of full functionality straight from the box, and it leaves a sour taste in my mouth, especially since this is relatively expensive, even when it is on sale. Of course you don't NEED to buy the subscription, and can get by just fine without it. However, I feel like the average person is adrift in the endless sea of 5.99/mo here, 9.99/mo there, and so on, and while the headphones are amazing even without the subscription, I am unable to overlook the lack of full functionality without a subscription to allow me to fully endorse this already expensive product."
"Ordered in Nov 2023 to wear during flights. Noise cancelletion works great. Sound quality is heavy on the base but the Sony app allows you to make adjustments to the sound. Will never purchase these again because one annoying and major flaw. Headphones randomly turn off if I tilt my head slightly, wear while laying down, move or simply breath and exhale. I disabled the auto turn off feature in the Sony app and that did not work. I had to search the internet to find a solution.  Disabled the ""talk to chat"" feature in the Sony app. I hate that I had do extra leg work to fix problem that shouldn't be a problem."
"I purchased these headphones in March 2021  The design and build is disappointing at best. The headphones developed a head piercing screech in the second year of use. There are pops and crackling sounds when using not using ambient sound, it will stop only when switching to  ambient sound. The right ear cup broke at the swivel connection. I now must  use duct tape to keep it connected to the head band.I have a headphone stand and do not abuse the headphones in any manner. They were good for a very short while, but after reading other reviews, two years seems to be the extent of good sound.Reading reviews on the Sony XM5’s have a design that will break even faster. Bose does not seem to have this problem and deserve a good look. I have ordered a set of headphones from a Kickstarter, better design, using a vacuum tube rather than transistor. The build is a  better design and will be an upgrade from the Sonys.Highly disappointing Sony, the headphones should last longer than two years. I used to be an advocate of Sony products, no longer.Update March 28 ,2024: The Sony XM4’s have been retired to the rubbish bin. I own a pair of Damson noise cancelling cans that I have had for over six years now. They are heavy duty being made from brushed aluminum, however that makes them a bit heavy while wearing them. Their age now shows as they are out of production and I was fortunate to find ear pads on Amazon UK. The Sonys were to be my go to and they have gone to the dump. While I wait for my  Écote Audio over the ear vacuum tube headphones to ship I purchased BeatsStudio3 wireless headphones. One day I will purchase a pair of very high end cans, just not right now.Sony, you must do better, perhaps upgrade your design team and move production back to South Korea."
"I got two years out of these headphones, they never once left the house. Normal usage and the right ear cup hinge literally broke in my hands taking them off a few days ago. I was never rough with them at all. They sat on my desk when not in use. Examining the hinge design leads me to the belief the hinges are being designed to fail over time. As a result, I cannot recommend and consider these headphones to be a waste of money."
"I'm going to base my review off of my Airpods Pro that I have and love, but have finally given out after some time.SOUND QUALITY:I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me here, but I think music sounds way better on the Airpods. I really expected these headphones to blow me away, but no matter which EQ settings I changed it to, they just don't hit like the Airpods Pro. It does get much louder though, but I'd rather have the sound quality.EASE OF USE:There are many issues here. Many of the features you would want out of the headphones have to be enabled/disabled in the app. These aren't great for zoom calls because when I take the headphones off and put them back on, it doesn't reconnect to my meeting's sound. I have to disconnect and reconnect the bluetooth to get the meeting sound again. I turned off the feature which does this in the app and it still has the same result. This is a big issue for me and actually the main reason I am returning. Connecting to bluetooth is fine. Very fast and with the android it's quite nice, just not a fan of the other experiences I've been having.NOISE CANCELLING:Once again, I think the Airpods Pro noise cancelling is way better than these headphones. I made sure I had it on (the lady in the headset tells you so). I can hear much more around me than with the Airpods. Especially my own voice. When I'm talking in meetings I can hear myself and I hate that. Second reason I'm returning.COMFORT & DESIGN:Best thing about these headphones is they are super comfortable. I could probably wear these all day if they worked better for me. The case they come in and the accessories they have are great!Overall, not a fan and going to return. Really bummed about it given the many stellar reviews on YouTube."
"I'm really conflicted with these. The noise cancellation is miles better than my QC 35 and airpods pro, and the sound quality is pretty good too. But these headphones creak to no end at the four points which connect the headband to the earcups. At first I thought it was a defective model so I got a replacement and tried to be as gingerly as possible but it started creaking again. I did some research on the XM3 and it seems these were an issue for those too. If you don't move your head at all it's fine but any movement of the head or jaw causes these creaking noises at those hinges. I really want to keep these because the noise cancellation is that good but when the headphones themselves cause distracting noises I don't know that I can justify these for $350. Maybe $250 for the XM3's and I can put up with the creaking noises but at this price point it's very difficult.Other complaints are fairly minor. Basically all the ""features"" that are advertised (not sure how many of them were also in the XM3's) are pretty gimmicky. The whole ""put one hand over the right ear cup when ordering a coffee""? Just slide the ear cup back and avoid looking like a goof. 19 levels of noise cancellation? I bought these for the max so cancel out the distractions in the back. The ambient sound noise works I guess but the microphones pick up wind noises too much and the headphones shifting around the head when walking make it more difficult to use - airpods pro transparency mode does this a lot better. The whole speak to put your headphones into ambient sound mode temporarily is super annoying. The only useful feature is the two connections, which is new to the XM4's. I personally don't like the pause music when lifting up the left ear cup because if I'm on a call and I lift it up to scratch my ear (which you will do a lot because your ear touches the inside walls of the headphones) and I put it back, my spotify will suddenly start ploying music again. Again, not a huge deal since the noise cancellation is that good. If only the headphones didn't creak so much, it would be well worth the $350. I'll use it for another two weeks to see if there is a ""break in"" period and the headphones stop creaking but if they don't, I'll have to make a tough choice on whether to keep them or return them."
"I still don't know how to permanetly put noise cancelling, and whenever I talk the headphone randomly stops. Also, music also randomly stops"
"This review is specifically for my the day to day use in Teams/Zoom, which I WOULD NOT recommend these for, especially for the price.WTH Sony – you are one of the biggest brands on the planet, how can you not figure out Bluetooth?!? These headphones are such a pain in the arse to connect and keep connected to Teams/Zoom – basically if they are not on before starting the meeting, connected, and on your head – these headphones take at least a minute to connect,  basically you get the robotic sound of death and silence while these try to connect to the computer.1. Switching between meetings? See number 1.2. They will just randomly drop right in the middle of the conversation – try to re-connect – see number 1 above.3. Want a voice to randomly tell you device 1 is connected every so often, right in the middle of an important conversation, then these are the headphones for you!4. Unlike every other pair of headphones I’ve used, including the cheap ones, I have been able to control the volume with the volume controls on the computer or device. Sony, nope – you get to either open the system volume or the teams/zoom volume setting. Do the side volume controls work on the headphones in teams/zoom? Now that would be silly, honestly what I what is to be fully blasted with sound at the start of every meeting with no other way to EASILY turn down the volume with the volume controls RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, I’d rather dig through system or application menus to control the volume.IF you are buying these for music, to connect to a phone for calls/music, these headphones have excellent sound quality, great app controls ( even better than the Bose I returned) and are EXTREMELY comfortable to wear even all day. I can have these on for hours, they are lightweight, and the ear cushioning is soft and pliable. Bose is the go-to if your main concern is the noise canceling, it is much better there, but I enjoy these for the environmental sounds controls, and I found the overall sound quality to be much better compared to Bose."
"Buyer Beware. You will find all over the internet, including in various Amazon reviews, reports that the software and hardware for this headset is erratic and, most importantly, eventually fails to allow the device to be charged often after only a few months of use. In my case, this problem began to intermittently affect my headset five months after purchase with charging no longer possible in month eight.That the various proposed possible solutions one finds in internet searches to restore charging prove not to be effective had me wondering: why hasn't Sony fixed this? What became more troubling was when I discovered in internet searches that the successor to this device, the WH-1000XM5, like this one, also suffers the same performance failures, also sometimes only a few months after purchase.To me, this says that 1) Sony knew of this problem years ago, 2) it could not or would not come up with a solution, and 3) it nevertheless made a business decision to continue to market and sell not only this flawed device but also its newer flawed version, fully aware of their shortfalls.Can I prove conclusively that this is true? Not without committing more time and money than makes any sense. So you’re left only with my estimate of why the devices fail.I'd give my eye teeth to be shown that Sony not only wanted to stand by its product but was ready to provide a bulletproof permanent fix. But so far as I know, a bulletproof solution provided by Sony itself does not exist.Bottom line? I used to trust the Sony brand 100%. Not any more. My recommendation: before you make a buying decision for this model or its successor, search outside of Amazon for what goes wrong with these headsets and then make up your mind."
"This is just an OK set of Bluetooth headphone for the price and from the name brand.  They're convenient, have decent battery life, and have a nice interface and are pretty comfortable, but that's probably the extent of the positives.They don't get very loud, which is safe, but cranking the volume on my phone is not really pushing these things.  Sound quality is average - I know you can mess with the EQ, but set on flat these things are still a bit unablanced.  Bass end is a bit dull and too muddy on the bass end - not overly boomy (unless you adjust EQ to boost it even more) but not super defined.  If you try to push the volume then it seems to favor the top end more and can get shrill without EQing.  Leaves more to be desired.It has a feature that pauses/turns the audio off when you take them off your head, which is cool, but it will improperly trigger and cut out if you try to move the head band around or wear it in a position to not mess up/dent your hair or if you want to slip one off your ear.  You can toggle this feature with the app, but kinda becomes useless at that point.They are OK at what seems to be an always discounted price.  Otherwise I would consider saving a little more for a nicer set or get a higher quality studio wired set for roughly the same price as these."
"These are not OVER the ear but rather ON the ear headphones. Big difference when you have a big head, they are a tight fit and hurt my ears pretty much as soon as I put them on. Also the buttons are either placed oddly or need to be moved imo. Everytime I went to remove them I was pressing a button. This never happened on my SoundCore q45 that I was hoping these would replace. I will be returning these since they are too painful to wear. Please change the description to ON THE EAR so people are aware. Other than that the sound was pretty good and the app was helpful."
"I bought two pairs on Black Friday, one for me and the other as a gift, and returned them both. I can't say how good they are because they were so uncomfortable that I knew they were going back. I am a female who wears a size S (small) in hats, but these were too snug even for me, so I knew they weren't going to work for a man. The ear covers were small, too. Maybe these are for kids?"
I got them on sale for $60 which is an ok deal. I would not pay more for these $199.99 is CRAZY. The noise canceling is barely there at all. My AirPod pros are wayyyy better. I have the noise canceling on now and I can hear everything. These don’t get that loud and bass is not that great. If you have a small head like me they don’t stay on that well.
"Bought mine for $60 three days ago.  Amazon, everyone should get it for $60 during this time  because I don't think it worth for mor.  JBL Junk- The build is good.- Battery is good.- Funni, wireless sounds better than with wire.-"
"They sound great and are comfortable with tons of features, however something inside of the headphone vibrates annoyingly in your ear when walking, making them unbearable to walk with."
"My hat size is ~8 and both the pair I got initially and the warranty replacement broke within 6 months of getting them, additionally they fall off my head extremely easily."
"I like the sound of the hradphones, but the ear size is too small for me. I'm pretty average in size, but cup of the phone is just too small  I can't wear these for more than a few songs before my ears are hot and sweaty and sore."
"The vintage Bose QC15's I use to listen to music on my vintage iPod Shuffle while I mow the lawn, blew a speaker, so I thought I'd try these inexpensive (On Sale for $100) JBL Live 660NC headphones as a replacement.The sound quality is okay at lower volumes, But turn up the volume and the midrange gets overly pronounced and harsh. They do sound slightly better when wired.However, JBL doesn't tell you beforehand that the volume buttons on the right earpiece only function when connected to Bluetooth. And the supplied wired cable does not have volume controls on it like the Bose. So unless the device you're playing music from has a way to adjust volume, my iPod Shuffle does not, you are out of luck.And... The ANC, Active Noise Cancelling doesn't function when using the supplied wire, it only works when connected via Bluetooth.Also of note. JBL has a Headphone App for the Live 660NC. But once again, it doesn't work when wired. It only works if you listen to music on your phone (I usually don't) via bluetooth. The EQ is excellent and greatly improves the audio quality, but again only works on the phone you're listening on.I was hoping for better from JBL. I love their bluetooth speakers! At least the older ones that have the 3.5mm aux input."
They are great at noise canceling people but… I can still hear other things and when I play songs it isn’t that loud :/
"I wound up returning these because the right speaker would cut in and out. While I could have done an exchange, I chose to return them instead for the reasons below:Pros: Nice build quality--the extenders have have metal strapping in them so they feel robust. I really like the buttons for noise-canceling, track and volume control--most touch headphones I've used are iffy in terms of reliability. Reasonably comfortable, pretty decent sound quality, amazing battery life (40 hours!)! They auto-pause when you take them off your ears for a quick convo, etc. The app is pretty decent as well with various EQ settings, the noise-canceling is pretty good, and they fold up well. Price point is good (great when on sale) when compared to similar NC headphones in this class.Cons: Ear pad opening too small for my ears. The ""case"" is really just a nylon bag that offers pretty much zero protection. While I like the buttons for volume control etc, they are fairly small and given that you can't see them when you're using them it would be nice if they were larger. Sound quality is pretty good, but when doing side-by-side comparisons to my Bose QC45's and Sony MX-5s, both of them sounded noticeably better with the MX-5s the clear winner. Had troubles with sound quality when trying to play music streaming or Teams call on my Macbook Air.If you're looking for good NC headphones in the $100-$150 range, these are probably among the best. But if sound quality and added features are important, I'd suggest looking at Bose or Sony."
Product seems to be in working well. My only concern is that I paid for a “new” pair of these headphones but the packaging they came in had broken seals and the instruction booklets weren’t in their packaging. Packaging was there but not on the instructions. Concerned I didn’t get what I paid for.
"I got this product as a replacement for my MPOW brand over the head noise canceling headphones that stopped working after about 2 or 3 years. I've got to say that I believe that those were better than this more expensive brand.The noise canceling on the JBL is better. However, anytime there is even the slightest amount of wind, it blows right through and you have to turn the volume up to almost a deafening level.Also, anytime you walk around in these the sound reverberates and causes this weird echo into the headphones which is very annoying. Same thing with eating or movement.Would I say that they're worth it? They're good headphones, but not for the price they're charging. If an off brand that no longer exists can charge a third of the price for comparable headphones, then a company with a better reputation can charge the same price for headphones that arguably perform as well if not slightly worse."
The earpiece was too small for me. It also fit too tight even when adjusted.
"These retail for about $200 and you can usually find them on amazon for $150.  Fine.  I got them on amazon prime day for about $90 give or take.  For that price these are good.  For their retail or usual discounted price?  Not a great value.  First and foremost, comfort is terrible.  These advertise as ""over-ear"" and maybe they are if you're an oompa loompa.  I assure you these earcups are really small and that these will be ON EAR more than Over-ear.  And to make it worse, they are a tight fit so it's constant pressure on the edges of your ears.  Bluetooth headphones should put comfort first and foremost as they are predominately used on the go.  Now, irritatingly terrible comfort aside, the sound is fine.  It's not amazing, but for a bluetooth headphone they're okay.  They have a good bit of Low Sub Rumble which is nice if you're into that but mid/high bass is lacking.  As well as the very high end is pretty much nonexistent with these.  I'd say these are a pretty dark headphone but not necessarily a warm pair.  I quite like the sound signature even though they aren't particularly good.  Features are nice, ANC is okay (not on the level of airpods/bose/sony yet but not awful.  battery life is nice, Build quality is passable.  If the earcups where just a tad bigger and they actually fit than I might say these are worth buying but as they stand I can't recommend them (unless you have unnaturally small ears or are a sicko who likes heavy pressure against your ears).  Save a few extra bucks and just get a bose QC45 honestly at this point."
"So first off, I celebrated like 3 birthdays by the time they arrived, so I was too old and senile to actually Use them, so I left them to my great great grandchildren in my will, to use, because that’s my name. So first upon opening the box and taking them out with the excitement a seven year old on Christmas morning, the left side earpiece was jammed in the plastic and wouldn’t release so I had to force it out with the only thing I could compare the unboxing to would be wrestling a dead alligator, I hear the plastic crack on the folding hinge and knew it was my lucky day, so as the earpiece now swinging as limp as your great granddaddy will, I knew instantly to not play the lottery that day. So I used them  for a week or two and life was back to being perfect as we all know it to be, Then tragedy struck, I bent over to put on a fresh pair of my pantaloons, and what would you know they slid off my big block head and smashed on the ground, so now they’re all  Banged up and broken like your ex girlfriend, and also like her they’re worth nothing, if only they could take a pounding like she does maybe these headphones would be worth buying, but they’re as fragile as your feeling and break easily, but unlike yourself, there’s no safe spot for them. I recommend wrapping them in bubble wrap to keep them safe."
"Got them for Christmas and although they are good headphones, I would Expect them not to break due to the cost.The piece that attaches to the over the head piece started cracking within 3 months.For reference I have A child sized head. I am 4’11 and prefer my headphones to be small since most just fall right off. These did fit my head, however if you include a mechanism that allows you to turn the ear pieces inward for storage and wear, then I would Expect them not to break. I am A stay at home mom and only wear them while cleaning etc to listen to audio books. This is not going to them, going running, working out, doing yard work…. It was simply wearing while vacuuming, doing the dishes, picking up toys etc. when they got taken off they were placed on my desk away from my kids so they wouldn’t get broken from rough use.HOWEVER, I was Able to get a replace from Harman Audio since it was within one year of the purchase date. The process was easy and I am Thankful of that. But the ease of connectivity, the use of the JBL app, and the noice canceling, pausing features, SIRI we’re all a big plus in my book. I really Like them but I’m deeply saddened that they did break on me. Fingers crossed I got a lemon pair and the new ones they send don’t break on me again."
"Locks good and I like auto stop option when get them out, but main reason I return (sound quality)."
"Most over-the-ear head phones encircle your ears, resting against your head. That's what I expected when ordering these. The moment I opened the package, I was nervous with how small the cups appears.  And to my dismay when I tried them on, unfortunately the cups are not big enough to fit your whole ear inside, which means the outer edge of your ears is pressed down against your head when wearing them. The product photos for the headphones that show people wearing them make it seem like they are much larger than they really are. After a few minutes of trying these on, they started to get uncomfortable already. Both my wife and myself tried and didn't like the comfort level. Sending them back for return."
"For $125, you can’t expect the greatest headphones ever, but I still think these could be better.Noise cancellation is not good at all, leaks sound a lot.Sound quality drops at high volume.  Overall sound quality is good, but not great.  Granted, I am a music nerd and notice things that most people wouldn’t.They are a little tight on my head, and my ears feel pretty cramped in the space.Also, the stupid blue light on the back, and front white on the front won’t turn off?  You wouldn’t notice it normally, but if you’re in a dark room, you’ll definitely notice these lights on.  Super annoying."
They were good… for about a year… then they broke so
"I'd have to say that these headphones are mediocre at best, the noise cancellation is pretty decent, not the best but not the worst. My issue lies within the sound quality of the headphones, for whatever reason they don't get very loud, and when your in a pretty loud environment such as the gym you can basically hear everything going on around you even with ANC on. Aside from this if you listen to a lot of Rock/Metal music these headphones aren't too bad, but when it comes to more bass heavy music, the sound tends to get pretty distorted when the bass hits. Overall these headphones aren't too bad if you can pick them up on sale, (I got them when they were on sale for $100) and for 100 dollars there's not much to complain about, but at they're regular $199.99 price tag, I'd say they aren't really worth it."
They look nice. They sound decent despite not supporting LDAC. Excellent battery life. Somewhat comfortable. Controls are well designed and easy to operate. Seamless solid BT connection.Made my ears sweat after 30 minutes. The hinges and plastic are junk. Cracked within 3 months. Screws on hinges just fell out. Even with proper care.The app was ok. Would not purchase again.
"Update:New problems include 1) More housing damage despite my careful handling, 2) failure to auto-connect often now, 3) sometimes buttons don't work until you dis\\re-connect, 4) the touch sensitive outside area that initiates the assistant accidentally triggers often, and you can't disable it. When triggered, everything pauses, and you must manually press play again.Original Review:The headphones work reasonably well. Sound quality is good and it connects easily. Here are areas it was lacking:1. The housing split on both sides where a tiny screw is used to assemble something. It doesn't functionally seem to cause a problem. But perhaps over the long-term it may. Difficult to say.2. The volume control and pause\\play buttons are so small and so hard to find and differentiate that I basically can't use them. I just, sadly, open my phone and control it that way. This is actually quite annoying.3. The touch features on the side don't seem useful. Instead of making it play\\pause, it is to activate the assistant on your phone. Why not have one side play\\pause and the other assistant or something? It's useless for me. Which feature do they think people use more?4. This is probably a personal complaint based upon my ear size and shape. The cuffs are soft, but they do begin to dig into my ears after a while. I don't find it comfortable at all. Perhaps the cuffs are just too small? Something for others to consider.5. A better case than a canvas sack that's a bit too snug to easily fit them into would have been nice."
"As a JBL lover, I am disappointed in these. I own 2 JBL Boom Boxes, 1 JBL Charge and a JBL Soujnd bar for the family TV. So I love their products. I ""like"" these but hey NEVER really stay snug. Ever since I bought them, they keep loosening. I use a clampt to close them back and that only lasts about an hour. Other than that they are ok"
Had to go to the doctor and had an ear infection. So check and clean the headphones when they come
The sound on this headset is good and the battery life is really good! However after just around 6 months of use and there are cracks and a chip missing and the buttons stopped working. I am not thrilled with the quality of the plastic since I just use them for music while I work at my desk so no heavy use. Especially with the price tag. Just something to consider when looking at purchase.
"These are junk for a JBL product. I will likely return them. They wont pair to my Mac, only my iPhone. Support said they dont have a current driver for macs, even though they say connection with macs is seamless in the (False) advertising. They lied. I do not recommend these headphones."
"I got these on sale for about 100 bucks on Cyber Monday last year, but I still kinda wish I paid less. I've been using these for 6 months, and I'm switching out.The noise cancellation is pretty bad. I didn't notice it at first, but the frequencies for the noise cancelation waves weren't tuned right, and it was really distracting. It sounds like quiet sci-fi lasers going off all the time. It got to a point where I have to turn the noise cancelation off. There are a couple different kinds of noise cancelation, but I couldn't really tell the difference between them.The sound is ok. I really like the equalizer in the app, but the default settings isn't the best in my opinion. A lot of others complain it doesn't get loud enough, but I never really need it to be that loud. However, when the volume is up, the bass gets distorted. The build isn't very sturdy, or at least it didn't hold up well with frequent wearing. Though, it is very comfortable.The mic isn't that good, but that's just because it's bluetooth."
"Update 8/23/24To my amazement, these headphones became a worse value. Last night the up volume stopped working (see photo, the button is slightly depressed and does not function). I can't emphasize how much I don't use these headphones, they basically stay on my counter top except 1-2 hrs a week that I use for gaming, and they still broke. Crazy.Edit: 3/9/24 (new edit 8/23/24)New edit: Really glitchy connecting via Bluetooth to PC, pretty much have to go to settings, delete the pairing, and re-pair every time you want to pair. Sometimes more than once.Removing one more star, these won't connect to a PC's bluetooth. First headphones I've ever had with this problem with.These are the worst consumer purchase I've ever made.Comparing these to Tozos HT2s that I also picked up, which are much cheaper, but end up being better for the reasons below.Comfort:Tozos 8/10JBL 2/10I wanted some daily driver headphones I could wear while working. JBL's are not them. The ear cups are too small. Period. And calling them over-ear headphones is misadvertising. After 2 hours gaming with on-ear headphones is almost unbearable. Tozos are the perfect size.Sound quality:Tozos 4/10JBL 7/10The JBL's have rich bass. But for $200 I would expert more. My $50 AKG 240 open ear headphones wow me every time I use them.Noise cancelling:Tozos 5/10JBL 6/10Accessories:Tozos 5/10JBL 1/10If you're planning on using the JBL's as wired headphones, you'll be disappointed. Instead of a standard 3.5 mm headphones jack, there's a custom 1.5 mm jack, which they supply the wire for. Big deal, you say? Unfortunately the wire is a cloth-braided style. So every movement your head makes rubs the wire, and is amplified like a stethoscope. Try playing Pubg with these. Disappointing.Value:Tozos 8/10JBL 1/10Combine all the above and these headphones just feel cheap. Paying $200 for on-ear style headphones is a rip-off. I paid $100, and I'm unhappy.If I had paid the full price, I would be returning these."
"The Live 660 headphones look and sound nice, but there were too many quirks for me to feel they were worth the price.1) The auto-pause feature is buggy. It will trigger sometimes if you move around too quickly. It can be turned off in the JBL app, but the headphones will still play the chiming noise when you remove them. This very briefly interrupts the audio which gets pretty annoying, especially when the auto-pause triggers by mistake.2) The button arrangement is not clever, especially for the talk-through function. You want to be able to activate talk-through quickly to hear/answer someone speaking to you, so it should only require a single-press and probably should have its own button. Instead it requires double-pressing the ANC button, which is easy to mess up if you're stupid-fingered. Over time I found myself just pulling them off one ear instead of using the talk-through feature. In general, these headphones have so many features that they should have an extra button or two and simpler controls.3) The textured headband looks nice, but it irritated my scalp after wearing for a few hours. This probably varies from person to person, but it was the deal-breaker for me. It's a shame, because I found these headphones very comfortable otherwise.I returned these and went with the Tune 760s instead. The ear cups are a little smaller and I miss the extra noise-cancelling functionality, but they're solid."
Nice sound quality but the side crack and break easily at the connection. The the ear peices.
There isn't much tension on the headphones to stay on my head. They slip off every time I bend or lay down.I don't think my head is that small.Touch sensor ir too sensitive and it pauses every time I try to adjust the headphones on my head. Makes it kinda annoying.Def not designed for the gym or jogging.
"This is a great product, the battery last, and the sound quality is good. The only bad thing about it, They are not very adjustable so if you have a small head be ready to hold them to keep them in place while running, which is annoying."
"Easy to set up with the app. (Why do all of these things require an app???)Sound is ok.  Nothing to write home about one way or another.Haven't used enough to tell about battery life, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I have worn them long enough for the headphones to become quite uncomfortable, though. A couple of hours.Controls are odd, and not entirely intuitive.  Do like the ""pause when removed from head"" thing.  (You can turn off that function in the app.)But I really wanted more noise cancelling/isolating.  I'm not entirely sure there is any noise cancelling.  There definitely is no isolating (I know they are not billed as noise isolating).Don't think they're good as a phone headset, voices sound muddy on my end, I can't imagine how bad the other end is.They're fine, but not worth the money."
I wear these headphones 12 hours a day while at work. Sounds is great and noice canceling works great as I am around machines all day. Only problem I have is something is loose in my right ear and it sounds like a piece of rice moving around in it when I turn my head. Still work great just have an annoying rattle at times now
"The audio quality is outsanding for the price, which is what I bought these for. But I'm not a fan of ANC or transparency modes (they make me light-headed), so I prefer to just leave all the artificial noise-cancelling off. Unfortunately, JBL *really* wants you to use ANC, because it's the default mode whenever you power these headphones on. The only way to switch it off is to cycle through the modes with a little button (there's no indication for which mode is active), or use the phone app, which is honestly pretty annoying.I'd rate these higher if JBL updated the firmware to power-on with the last setting used (instead of ANC every single time). Overall, if you love ANC, these might be great for you...but I returned them."
"Sound quality really was not what I was expecting. Ear muffs are also a bit on the small side. They sound okay, but not great. The left speaker also crackles for no reason, so I'm sure they are also defective, and given they really aren't that cheap, it was a let down."
"Maybe these deserve a better rating. If volume isn't an issue for you, these are really nice. As others have noted, they are tight, but super comfortable. Have good range. Easy to use out of the box.But they are just not loud enough. Nothing I could do with the EQ made it any better. Listening to early Nine Inch Nails should not be a calming experience. If you like jazz or Enya, get these. If you need music to pierce your soul every once in a while, these will not do it."
"Full review -Sound quality was pretty good for the price, but there are a variety of competitors that offer the same sound quality for a lot less, and this was supposedly on sale. 2-3 stars, it really doesnt give you that feel where the music is in your years and you can just focus, they really dont get that loud.Comfort was good. I used these for work calls and blasting music to help me focus. For calls, the mic was fine and unlike some brands, the headphones dont pinch your head uncomfortably, and the over the ear cuffs are soft and dont add pressure onto your head."
"Sound was good, Bluetooth was good, noise cancelation was good but directional (for example - if I had it running with the sink on and turned my head to look at something, the sound of the running water would immediately cut through the music), but the durability was deeply disappointing and they break VERY easily.No matter how you fold them, it puts a lot of pressure on these tiny joints made of thin plastic. Mine cracked within days, broke within weeks, and fell apart completely within months. I would fold them up and place them in the provided travel pouch only twice a week to take them to the office - I would not call that heavy use.Save yourself the money and don't purchase these unless they're on a huge sale. The price is way too high given the middle-of-the-road functionality paired with cheap and breakable materials.I'm super disappointed in this purchase. I have a $20 pair of JVC headphones from a local discount superstore that have lasted three times as long."
"I love the bass these output. I love the fit. I love the anc. I don't love how the app will limit the drivers. Something about jbl headphones recently won't let you up the bass or treble without taking a massive loss in sound volume. I get it, they are trying to be responsible with our ears, but I'm just going to use third party eq to push these. These are not fun to eq using the jbl app. Use third party eq"
"I've never been so upset by a pair of headphones before. I spent hours researching and saw nothing but glowing reviews for this pair, and I don't understand why. The sound quality is abysmal, worse than extremely low end headphones. The sound is tinny and unbalanced, the mids are weak, overall completely unpleasant. Bass even when turned all the way down will blow out. I've tried fiddling with equalizers both on the clunky, unresponsive app and on my music player of choice to no avail. I'm aware with bluetooth there is an expected drop in quality, but the drop is farther than headphones a quarter of their price. Wired connection is somehow even worse with the cord supplied.What's worse is that these headphones stutter, almost as they're repeatedly pausing and unpausing - turning off features such as the pausing music when headphones are removed does nothing. I've eliminated all other factors that can interfere with playback and even cross-testing with my old pair that have suffered no such issue in their entire lifespan. The only thing that fixed it(for now) is completely unpairing and repairing. If I have to do that every other day? It's already not worth the effort.Even if by some miracle I can get these headphones to at least produce the quality of audio one would expect from a low budget pair, much less anything better, it's not worth the effort it takes to get there. No headphones are going to be their best on factory settings, but when you've exhausted all options to make them not an active assault on your eardrums, it's time to cut losses and look elsewhere. JBL support was equally unhelpful - only told me to factory reset them to fix a problem present out-of-box - only for the problem to immediately start again.I'm returning these. Don't waste your time or money."
Headphones worked pretty well for the first month ish but then started losing the silencing feature. They also randomly pause even though they are put on correctly. I have a small head and they easily move around and are having to be readjusted frequently. Music still plays well but base is also not very good. For the price though I can’t expect a bunch.
"I am a full-time video editor so I wear my headphones 8-10 hours a day. I purchase a new pair of headphones every other year just due to wear and tear and these were my most reent pair. Here is my review after 3 months of use:PROS:- Great battery life. I use these over 6 hours every day and only have to charge them once or twice a week.- Quick charge - when I do have to charge them up, it only takes 10-20 minutes- They are snug and stay put for when you are in the gym doing cardio movements- I think the sound quality is pretty good for the priceCONS:- The noise cancellation is not great at all, I've had cheaper headphones with better ANC- They are not the most comfortable, not a lot of padding on the ears and they are VERY snug- You cannot be connected to 2 devices at one successfully"
"Ok short and simple review just the basic dive for anyone that is interested.Design, Comfort and Build is great! Got it on sale for $95 definitely worth the price. Can’t really complain.Ok now, the sound it’s definitely JBL’s signature sound. “Neutral” it definitely needs a bit of tuning through the app to get it just right.At low volume these sounds so dire, at high volumes as always it’s a JBL thing louder is better but high’s sounds so thin. If all else, Burning it in mite make a difference.Over all you can’t really consider these the best sounding. It’s definitely made for your typical everyday user. Audiophiles stay away these aren’t for you.Last but not least, the “Active Noise Canceling” feature. Honestly for the original MSRP of $199 I grantee you it isn’t worth it. Save up a bit more and get yourself the top of the line, skip these.EDIT: I’ve shared a few screen shot settings for anyone willing to enhance the sound of these headphones. I’ve tried various sources/ genre  to fit the signature sound and maybe brighten it up a bit more. And these worked decent enough, since the volume/ loudness is pretty low. Good luck!"
"I bought these for my husband for Christmas and he loved them. They had great sound quality and we had no complaints. Fast forward six months and they stopped working. We will charge them until they are fully charged, turn them on and they shut off after about 30 seconds. he has searched for reasons it might be happening and tried a few things with no luck. Reading more on the headphones, it seems like others have had the same problem, which is unfortunate because they did sound great up until this."
"Bought these for my dad in the end of December 2023. Less than a year after purchasing, one of the earpieces fell off in his hand. Very disappointed. Prior set of phones lasted for many years. Wondering if they can be repaired."
Build quality is nice which was unexpected in this price range. These sound horrendous. Look elsewhere.
I typically wear them to travel or to run and the sound cuts out very time I hit a bump. When I’m running the sound cuts out to my stumping. When I’m flying and driving the sound cuts out other every bump in the road/air.I tried exchanging them once. I figured maybe I had a default pair but my second pair does the same thing. Wishing I had saved my money to buy better headphones.
"The most annoying of all flaws is the very loud and obnoxious connecting and disconnecting sounds. If you are listening calm music to rest or sleep this is absolutely horrible. Very weird controls, no indication of charge level until it shuts down depleted. Weird wooping sounds when you walk. Good noise cancellation and very good sound, good and sturdy construction. The light indicator can light up the entire bedroom in the dark, not for using in bed if others are sleeping."
"These work well for watching tv and movies, but listening to music, the speakers make a popping noise at higher volume"
"They sounded good at first, though the volume peaks a bit quieter then I would like. Comfort is good. Bass was pretty nice. After about a month, though, hard bass started to go. Songs with a lot of bass crackle now, so I hardly ever use them anymore. They're okay at lower volume and for podcasts."
I have several jbl portable speakers and I got these headphones on sale. I love all my speakers but sadly these headphones fall short on sound quality on high volume. Maybe I got a bad pair so I’ll send them back and see how a new set sounds but the bass on high sounds terrible sounds like the speakers are blown! It only sounds bad when I move my head and the suction loosens a little I can hear distortion bad on both left and right. Other then that I like the head phones and they were loud enough which I like my music super loud but low bass just sounds bad. I also bought a Sony set around the same price range and they blow these jbls outta the water. So sad I really wanted to add these to my jbl family but not sure
"I use this daily for music and business calls. Overall sounds great. Problem is that the slider on the head band is breaking apart after just six months. I also have a jbl tune headset for 2 years that has held up nicely even with usage by my teenager. This is disappointing given the. Higher cost point and supposed quality of the live over the tune. I don't abuse this, it goes in its case every day. Battery is great, headband is a bit too tight, ear cups are soft, sound is superb."
The right side fell off. I suppose it clamps to my head but it sort of desk only now... still.
"TL;DRThey're ok for what I need them for but I wouldn't recommend. Keep looking.Update: knocked another star off because of the constant beeping when you move your head because of the ear detection that thinks you removed the right ear cup. I turned off the auto detection but it still beeps and it's constant. Maybe my ear is oddly shaped? I wish there was a way to disable the feature completely or turn off the annoying beep. when it happens every two minutes, it really does put a damper on the user experience.The headphones are decent fitting and comfortable. I'm not an audiophile but even I can tell that the bass is terrible. It's super muddy and the headphones don't get very loud. I got them to take classes online and maybe listen to some music so they'll work for me but for people that are looking for strictly music listening headphones, I'd keep looking. I turned off the ""pause when right side is removed"" option and the music doesn't pause but you get a really annoying beep if you move the right ear cup. Too bad the option doesn't turn that part of it off. There are a lot of buttons and the pictures in the quick start guide are terrible. They try to show what each one does with just pictures and they don't explain anything. It's like trying to decipher hieroglyphics just to figure out of you're using ANC or Ambient mode. That LED should definitely be two different colours (one for each setting) instead of a different beep sound because that doesn't explain anything.Terrible bass, mediocre ANC, horrid instructions, bad settings.Hopefully a firmware update fixes the annoying beep if the ""pause when removed"" setting is off, but I won't hold my breath. The app should have a more in depth settings description than the quick start guide but it doesn't help at all either. I expected more from JBL and I'm disappointed.Also, they don't use a normal 3.5mm jack on the headphone side. So you can't use a longer cable or one with an inline mic. I was going to try and use them for some light PS4 gaming but it can't happen. Shame."
"Considering I got it for $139.00 during the Christmas deal. The sound and bass are decent for a mid budget bluetooth headphone. Can't compare to mine old BOSE QC35 for the sound and build quality. Noise canceling is fine given that I work at a very noisy lab environment with hundreds of network routers and switches with their cooling fans cracking constantly. Somewhat disappointed that its plastic materials cracked as picture attached only after 6 months of light use. Maybe their warranty offer some remedy, let's see what happens after I submitted a request to JBL. I got both 40mm and 50mm drivers JBL headphones, while 50mm bass was not as deep as I expected. Overall, not bad for the price under $150.00, while BOSE easily cost over $300.00."
"These are great headphones don’t get me wrong, but for the price, they lack sufficiently in many categories. For 200$ headphones, personally I don’t think they sound as great as they should. They’re not horrible but even with the EQ in the app they still don’t reach the same sound quality as some much less expansive headphones I’ve had and used well. These headphones would not be for people looking for phenomenal audio but would be suitable for someone going to the gym or listening to music on a plane. The noise canceling is good but not the best I’ve seen but it definitely gets the job done. One feature I really like is how the ANC works while plugged in via headphone jack. Overall the headphones are decent but definitely not worth the price in my opinion. Other JBL products like their speakers never go wrong with great audio."
"I was expecting much better from these headphones. I've always thought of JBL as a high-quality audio brand, but I'm really disappointed with this product.Overall, I must say that the noise cancellation is very good. However, they sound like the speakers are blown, and it seems to be an intermittent problem since sometimes they work perfectly.However, this quality issue leaves a lot to be desired for headphones that were once valued at almost $200.Waste of money."
"I really liked these headphones a huge improvement on what I owned and the noise canceling was fantastic. The issue I had was the ear cups were small and wearing them at work most of the day began to make my ears hurt. I read the reviews and thought maybe my ears were small, but still had discomfort. Being at work, I loved being able to take them off and the music would pause."
"The sound is decent at moderate volume. I don't like the app. The passthrough is weird. I'd prefer either ANC on or ambient, no passthrough because it turns the volume down so much that I couldn't even hear the music and you can't just cycle through two, it has to go through all three. The noise cancellation is okay in a room with a steady sound like a fan or window AC but I can clearly hear people talking around me on the plane and during take off, there was this god awful rumbling in my ears, louder than if I didn't have the headphones on. It eventually evened out after the engines throttled down but it did not cancel as much of the engine noise as I think it should. The sound is decent but when I turned up the volume with ANC on, I got an terrible warbling sound in the right ear. When I paused the music, it continued for a second or two before finishing with a thump. All of these issues coupled with the fact that they squeezed my head to tight and it's a no go for me. I had to return them."
So far tried it with a couple songs and different styles of music and not very impressed. Anything g higher pitch gets “shaky” and bass is not very deep. Expected more from JBL. I’ll keep using it and will update the review in case I decide to return it. Fit and connectivity are great.
I bought these in July 2023. I have a large yard and spend about 2 hours a week sitting on a ridding lawnmower. I wear these headphones and use the noise canceling while mowing. The noise canceling eliminates some of the noise from the mower but certainly not all of it.My headphones are 8 months old and the left ear piece broke off. I can see the peg it rotates on and it is not substantial. Having the ear piece break off after 8 months of 8 to 10 hours per month of use does not make me happy.I have submitted a warranty claim to JBL and will update my review when I hear back from them.
"They never worked right.  At first they would quit playing for no reason or would go beep-beep when I was just standing there and quit playing but the blue light would remain on.  They would only hold a 2-3 hour charge before quitting.  Lately they come on when I push the slider, it stays on for 30-40 seconds and then power down.  My cell is a Samsung 23 ultra and in my pocket. it controls numerous things...nothing is wrong with the phone.  I am going to hang these on my desk to remind me to buy NO MORE JBL.  They must not do any quality control before shipping.  I ran into a fellow in my weight room that bought his about the time I bought mine and he had the same problem.  Too much money for a bad product!!!"
I like the comfort of the earphones but unfortunately not a great choice for bass. I tried these out to replace my old Sony MDR-XB950B1. Looks like I will be keeping my Sony headphones until I find a suitable replacement.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Bought these a while back I was in the hospital for a stay back in July of 23, I used them for about a week and then they sat on a shelf for over 8 months.  I started to use them more often while traveling on the bus back and forth to Doctors appointments and then in my kitchen while cooking to combat the sound of my loud kitchen AC unit. They work ok, the buttons a sketchy. The app is ok. But the cheap plastic is junk! The sound is not good, and they do not get loud enough. Both hinges broke and I truly babied theses."
"These were probably the most uncomfortable headphones I have purchased.  I was looking forward to trying them as soon as they were delivered, but I was quite disappointed as soon as I felt them in my hands.  The padding was quite firm, and the plastic felt like low quality.  Still, I wanted to give them a shot, so I synced them to my phone and started listening to music and YouTube videos.  I was not impressed by the sound quality (not a audio snob in any way), but I could get used to it (especially if I took the time to configure the audio levels).  However, after wearing them for less than 10 minutes, I started to get a headache. The band resting on top of my head was noticeably uncomfortable and was about to start to hurt.  Extending the height so the band did not rest on my head only made the discomfort on the sides of my head even more apparent.I work from home, and I have my Vankyo on my head for easily 8 hours every day without issue. I'm only looking to replace them due to the ear pads falling apart and the battery no longer lasting as long as they used to.  I'll continue looking for new headphones, but the JBL Live are not ones I would recommend."
The headphones are great but definitely not higher volume than 60 or 80 dollar headphones. Same thing.  Original features include good noise canceling and snug fit. Overall this product disappointed me.
Decent sound. Comfortable on head.Charging cord provided is ridiculouslyshort making charging the headphones cumbersome to do.Would not buy again.
If you are worried about hearing damage these headphones are for you.  If you already have hearing damage it's a big NO for these.  They do not get loud!  I got these on sale for less than 1/3 of the usual price and still not worth it...
Bought these to use on my Sony TV.  Wouldn't pair and there's no app on Google Play.  Worked with my phone but purchased primarily for my TV.
"After researching and comparing specs, reviews and prices of over-ear headphones, JBL was the winner. However, they sound terrible. I tried various types of songs with different music players and video as well. I tried with bluetooth, the aux cable, ANC on/off, with my phone, desktop and PC. Played with the eq settings in the JBL app, my music player's eq and my phones eq with very little difference.With the ANC off it sounds like it's playing from an old 80s cassette deck that doesn't work well anymore or cheap $10-$15 headphones or something playing inside a cardboard box. With ANC on, it seems like that's more of a volume/bass booster than it is noise cancellation. Even though it may sound a bit better, none of the equalizers help it escape from that muffled bass sound without removing it completely.Just in case I did order a replacement but it was exactly the same. I wanted to like these headphones because the physical design is very good. They seem tough and durable while still being comfortable with convenient button placement and the feature to pause the music when the headphones come off. I know these are $100 now but I'm shocked that these were ever sold at $200. The sound quality is like cheap headphones with a bass booster disguised as ANC."
"I’ll give this 3 maybe 4 stars based off the fact that my girl works at Amazon and she knows when people get used items branded as “new” and putting these on I noticed these aren’t new headphones they were refurbished to sell like new and you can hear the left speaker fizz out at high volumes , very disappointing will be returning for ACTUAL new ones and will see what those look like"
Every time I take a step I can hear it in these headphones. I can sit still and Google assistant think it needs to chime in. Sound quality is ok. 7/10. But the experience with these headphones is frustrating. I'ma buy a different pair.
These are very tight on my head to the point I get a bad headache. I'd say I have a normal to small sized head. I cannot use these for very long.
"These constantly slide off my face with any slight movement (running, walking, working out etc…) aside from sitting still. They don’t seal to your ear near the bottom and have bad noise canceling because of that."
"Cons  1. - No way to turn of sound chime for ear/head detection. When lying down it is constantly being triggered and interrupting music/video playback, even when the automatic play/pause feature is disabled in the JBL app settings.  2. - Without the ANC active the bass is gone,... and with ANC ON the bass is blowing out the speakers. Although they do give you an EQ which is nice.  3. - Cable included is Short, and buttons on headphones feel cheap.Pros  1. - Headphones look appealing and earcups and headband feels great.  2. - App is nice, however it needs more customizable features for the headphone sounds (Audible Chimes - On/Off toggle maybe?...)  :/  3. - USB - C is awesome"
"I like that comfort over the ears were great, over the course of listening headphones started to rattle on songs with more bass I don’t know if it was a defect or just this particular head set"
"I really like the fit and finish on these when compared to the Anker Soundcore Q45.  The noise cancellation also works much better than the Q45.  The Q45's noise cancellation effect varies depending on the direction of the noise source.Unfortunately, the JBL Live 660NC only seems suitable for a child.  The ear cups are small and the headband is extremely tight. My young son enjoyed them but I've tried several times over the last few days and can only wear them for 20 minutes maximum. They only feel good for about 10 minutes. (For reference, I'm 5'9"" and 156 pounds.)"
"I have had these for a couple months and I did not like them from day one but I wanted to give them a chance. They are very uncomfortable. They are to tight and they do not seal well either. Noise canceling with a poor seal makes for poor performance. I rarely take mine off for very long periods of time, 15 to 20hrs. I had Cowin E9 before these and never did my head hurt or my ears and with these they constantly hurt. Cowin E9 constantly disconnect and a female voice constantly saying connected, disconnected and after that a few thousand times and I had to try another brand despite them being perfectly comfortable. Of course sound is great with JBL and if you wear them for and hour they are good enough. Also there is no nagging voice speaking at all. I will be giving these away as I did with the Cowin's. I just bought another brand and hope they fit better."
very poor noise cancelling
Way too tight.
"I got these to use for both noise cancelling and for conference calls. These DO NOT work for noise cancelling during conference calls. For those on the other end of the call, they can hear everything, even from other rooms. For example, I work in an office next to an active kitchen, separate by walls and a door but not soundproof. When speaking on a conference call, people on the call can hear everything that is happening in the kitchen. If you purchase, remember they are not great for dual purpose."
My son loved them! However they are not as durable as I expected.  They are to fragile.  I'm disappointed in the product.  I/we have may JBL products and they was the first time we were let down.  Unfortunately I was informed they can not be returned..upsetting.
I’ve had these headphones for a year and if you tilt your head even a little bit the music pauses on Spotify. It’s very annoying
These squeezed my head so hard they were painful after only about 15 minutes. They are basically like wearing noise canceling headphones for shooting. They may fit a child or someone with a smaller head. I wear a L-XL in hats for reference.
"The joint where the headphones swing inwards started to chip less that 3 months into ownership. Today, at the 7 month mark, the joint on one side gave, and now it’s just hanging free. Sounds great, but not much use if it breaks so easily."
It’s okay. I got it on sale for 85 bucks or so definitely not worth 200 dollars tho. Audio is good but volume is lacking. Noise cancellation isn’t to bad. I’ll say tho my AirPods Pro do outperform these headphones a bit. Overall I like them but would not spend $200 on them.
"I gave it three stars because I was expecting extra sound and lots of bass for my deadlifts, but when I got them the first thing I noticed was they weren't as loud as I wanted them to be. My AirPods 2nd gen. were and still are louder than these headphones plus the bass sound wouldn't make this annoying click noise if too loud. The three is for the poor sound and annoying bass shake noise the headphones make. Overall I like them, the noise cancellation is pretty good I enjoyed that especially when my family is loud as heck and I need to do homework. I don't think they were worth the 105 dollars and my search continues for some gym headphones."
Volume is low and are not noise canceling
Not quite the depth and separation of sound that I'd like to hear.  A bit to bassy and not exceptional clarity.  Super nice controls.
"Worn for about 30 minutes, experiencing ear fatigue from pressure of the cups. Cups don’t exactly fit over the ears, don’t believe I’m Dumbo. The band has no cushion, creates a hot spot as well."
With a product like JBL you expect great sound quality not so much with these they are not loud at all but they do cancel any and all noise around you but they cancel noise without playing any music as far as video game usage it's still not that loud but again with the noise canceling you can't hear anything but the headphones I haven't had the chance to overly use the battery so I can't review that part just yet
"They are ok at best. My 70 dollar ear buds out class them. I was looking forward to these coming as I had always heard good things from JBL but these are some of the worst headphones I have ever had. The noice cancellation is ok, you can still hear a lot but the insane issue with it is the sound quality during use is terrible. Bass begins to make a horrible sound. Upon research, many people have had this complaint. The volume on the headphones is also quiet. These are a good buy if they are like 40 - 50 dollars. I couldn’t have imagined paying full price for these on launch. The only pros are the insanely long battery and that the build quality is good, but that’s not what you buy headphones for, you want good sound."
"Okay, for the price, but can’t wear them long the ears 👂 start to hurt."
I like the sound quality but the headphones aren’t that comfortable around the ears.
"This is a wonderful headphone as along as you do not want to be use it for TV or video. It suffers sound latency delay. The add is well written to not address if it supports that protocall. Bluetooth 5.x in and of itself does not ensure there is low latency support. Yes, my transmitter provides Bluetooth 5.3 w/ aptx.  I have not had an issues with delay with any other device that specified it supported that delivery. If you are using it for a normal let's listen to a stereo. it works great! I did not return it because of price. It did what it said it would do. Shame on me."
"I mean, you get what you pay for. The audio quality is pretty good, though it does kind of hurt my head. My main issue is that I can hear the audio through the headphones no matter the volume, which isn't ideal for listening to music in public. Like literally, I was listening to music on my headphones. Put the volume at 6 OUT OF 100. Took the headphones off, I could still hear the music through the headphones....you're better off investing in quality headphones."
"They work good, but the plug doesn't make a good connection. It seems to unplug itself every other time. I will not buy again.UPDATE - Seller replaced headset. They do work well BUT they have a charging port issue. it feels like a spring is pushing the usbc out of the charging port. You can charge but have to set them down carefully and make sure they are still plugged in."
"I really like the noise cancellation!! However, for some reason it pauses the music whenever I get a notification. Also, I think it’s pretty breakable because I’ve only had this for a little bit and I already have a small crack on the left side ☹️ idk how it happened but I think it’s the folding (or on my end)I still like it though!"
I absolutely love the sound quality and fit of these headphones. They also have a long lasting battery. The worse aspect is the touch to pause. I wish there was a way to shut this off because doing face pulls my music is constantly going on and off. This occurs with other exercises and stretching. It also does not allow me to talk and be heard unless the aux cord is plugged in. Overall disappointed and will be buying different headphones
"OVERALL - its a decent cheap option but lets put a bit more emphasis on the cheap part of that.SOUND- all the settings seem distant and I have defiantly had better experiences but ig you get what you pay for. You double click the power button to change the sound setting and none sound very good. At most the bass boost can help distract form how distant things sound but its still not good in my opinion. To be honest your better listening to music out loud than using these headphones. I think the best way to describe it is that it makes everything sound like noise rather than audio. They bleed moderately but as long as you don't have them on too loud it should be fine, the noise canceling is pretty dang good though I will admit that.COMFORT - not the best, they don't swivel back or forth so my locs (I have A  LOT of hair that's thick and course) bends it uncomfortably, I'm the type of person to wear headphones (not exaggerating ) nearly every moment of the day even in bed and I don't think I could handle the way they press on the side of my head.USEABILITY - I don't like how the pause button is in the middle of the earphone, I think you would need to build muscle memory to press it accurately since there is no symbol indicating where it is just that it's (I think) the center of the circling design."
"Sounds are good, but zero noise canceling. I can hear all exterior sounds. Will return."
Reasonable price and fit. Charged fast . Sounds good not great….
"These headphones are very comfortable, and the sound quality is better than expected for the price. I love bass mode the most! Unfortunately, these headphones have a very strong sound leak. I most likely wouldn’t wear them in a quiet setting. I purchased them to use at the gym, and I’m not sure I even want to because of the sound leak. If you don’t care about that, these headphones are great!"
The company reached out to us and is sending an upgraded headset to us. Thanks
"Decent headphones, volume not very loud at max I can still hear others around me at the gym. Lots of treble and no bass. Suitable for children in my opinion."
"I got these for my daughter for her birthday. For whatever reason, prime shipping was going to take 5 days (?) so I upgraded that and they still arrived a day late. That isn't factored into this review, but something to check for. Now, the estimates are normal. Anyway, when they arrived, I opened the box and it was not sealed and nothing was in plastic, which I thought was odd, but it also meant I got to test them out without messing up any packaging. They came in a black carrying pouch, which is nice, and they looked just as I hoped. I went ahead and charged them for a bit and tried them out. The charging was a little odd. They seemed to charge to full, but didn't the first time and needed to stay on longer before they were actually full, but finally did. They kinda yelled something when I turned them on, so I'm glad they weren't on my ears at the time. The first thing I noticed after that were the lights. They look really nice lighted up, at first. Having said that, you cannot keep them a solid color, which is aggravating. They cycle colors ALL OF THE TIME and the sides do not match each other, which takes the look from cool and impressive looking and makes them seem annoying and tacky. They aren't flashing or anything, it's a gradual cycle, but you can't choose what you want. Apperently, that's what they mean with the term ""breathing light,"" which had my girlfriend and I googling that (to no avail) before I ordered them. You can turn the lights off, but I really wish there was a way to select a color and keep it there. The red looks nice to me, but you can't pick one color. Looking at Picun's other headphones, it seems they all use the same circuit and do that, which is a shame, because it would really add value to be able to choose the light color and make them more ""adult"" and seem less like a tacky kid's toy from the state fair. Luckily, my daughter is 11, so they should be fine for her, but I admit, I wouldn't want to be seen in public with the lights constantly cycling this way; its just kind of infantile looking. Also, if you turn the lights off, they go on again the next time anyway. I wish it would save the setting. Anyway, they paired fine to my phone and I picked a track to test these out. I'm very picky about headphones. I have $350 Samsung Bluetooth earbuds, several Klipsch IEMs, Sony studio monitors, bass headphones (just for fun) and a billion pairs of wired earbuds. I hate the majority of headphones that I hear. When I heard the first sounds come from these, I was pleasantly surprised! The clarity was good, although the bass seemed light. The box said ""Extra Bass"" or ""Heavy Bass"" (Im writing this in bed and not getting up to see which one), so I switched to some more bass-heavy tracks. I still felt like the bass was fairly lacking, but the overall sound was really surprisingly good! With full range drivers reproducing all frequencies, its always a tug of war between bass and clarity. I'd like more bass, but I like the clarity enough that I think these headphones strike a good balance. The bass won't blow you away, but they arent muddy, like my Sony XB500s are. There is some sound bleed, so the person next to you is likely to hear you listening to that song that you're embarrassed that you like (everybody has a few). Anyway, I enjoyed the test run, and they were also comfortable, and I really started to consider getting a black pair for myself for home use at night, mostly so I could preserve the batteries on my expensive Gear IconXs, which I use for lifting, running and staying sane in the grocery store. I was impressed at the sound and features for the price and I was enjoying them. I showed them to my girlfriend the next day and she wanted a pair as well, so that was two more pairs I planned to order. ""So if he loves them so much, why the one star?,"" you may ask. Well, I probably would have given these about a 4, given the sound for the price, which was quite good, holding back a little for the lights that don't stop changing colors, which would be such an easy fix (whyyyy?), and the fact that the buttons and the charging port seemed a tad fragile. The pros definitely outweighed the cons and I was impressed, overall. However, the next time I turned them on, sound only came out of one ear. Bit of a problem, that. I turned them off and on again, paired again, used an aux cable, but no luck. The left side had already died. Keep in mind that they were used for about 30 minutes on the couch and for about 1 minute the next day. I felt like I had gotten a great deal on these until that happened. I wanted to order a couple more of these and possibly the over the ear model I saw that they they have as well, but I'm not confident about the build quality at this point. Did I just get a bad one, which happens, or are there build issues with these? A few reviewers have had this happen, although, in fairness, similar things can be said of my expensive Samsungs. If I ordered 2 or 3 other sets, would it be a matter of luck if they work/last or not? Reading other reviews, I could belive either. I'll shoot them a message tomorrow and see how things go and update if things work out. I'm hoping its just an odd, bad set, because I was really pleased with finding these at first."
These are very low-end headphones that are not noise eliminating but for the frugal consumer they're a good buy.
Picon gives an email for extended guarantee asking for order number  BUT the email address does not work!
Very cheap. Sound quality isn’t good but fades when you keep listening to music. Broke easily.
"The audio is tinny, the function buttons do not work and videos now just pause randomly even when I've done nothing, or when I try to adjust the volume.  The volume actually won't adjust at all now using the headset function buttons.  Will not be buying again.  Also fully charged device, and the battery is down to 50 percent already after only 48 hours."
Bluetooth pairing to all devices stopped after 3 weeks. Now I’m supposed to ship back in next 3 days which is impossible and on top of it buy a box when these only cost 16 bucks guess you get what you paid for. Supposedly comes with a lifetime guarantee that turns out not to be the case
I have used this a totally of 4times and the left ear has stopped working. Wish I could get my money back. Worthless
Says to enter the warranty number on back of card to register warranty and there is no number on the card in the box.
"It's uncomfortable. The bluetooth loses connection if you put your hand over the right headphone. That's right! It literally loses connection if there isn't a clear vacant path to whatever device it's connected to. The Mic is awful! It sounds like you're in a highly distorted tunnel, and the volume randomly ramps up and down from too quiet to hear to unbearably loud. I would be embarrased to use this mic in a game session with friends, let alone in a professional setting like on Teams or something. If you need something really cheap, the only thing I can see using these for would be like if you were a passenger on a LONG car ride or taking a trip on a train or plane where you're not moving for a while, then maybe the low price is worth it. But given I've only worn them for 10 minutes and they're already uncomfortable, I kinda doubt it. Steer clear!"
"I've had these headphones for a couple of months now so I've had time to see some of their product quirks.They're decent headphones, looser and less ear-squashing than most I've owned, which is nice. The sound quality is decent for the price but not superb and the included jack is a nice bonus for when the battery dies mid-commute. The color is nice and the lights look really neat and get a lot of attention from people asking where I got them.A few caveats though: the jack, while a lovely idea, has way lower sound quality than the bluetooth function. Maybe that's to be expected, idk, but it's pretty jarring to be mid-podcast and have all the sound become SUPER FLAT when changing to the jack, which I've found has to be constantly rotated to maintain a reliable connection to my phone for some reason. That just might be specific to mine as a bad luck draw of the batch. The battery life is supposed to be 20 hours worth of listening - mine rarely lasts that long, but that could be because it never seems to charge to 100%. It will spend hours, all day, overnight, unmoving and untouched on the charger and stop charging at around 70-80%. The slightest bump or jostle will also interrupt it. I can unplug them and start charging again but it's a little annoying to keep having to babysit them and prompt it to recharge and not being reliable on having a full battery when it comes off the charger in the morning.Overall, they're just okay. The problems are fairly minor inconveniences but still kind of annoying."
"I listen to audiobooks.  Hard to listen when it just starts playing at random times when I'm not wearing them.  Set them down, next to phone, with NOONE NEAR BY, and it just starts playing again, losing my spot.Why do we need to have all the extra sensors that just fail?  I just wanted a pair of headphone that worked.  Now it's another wasted chunk of plastic that causes nothing but frustration because they insist on putting in touch sensors that are cheap af and fail and then just start activating for no reason.Cash grab, lies."
"If you leave these on, they will stay until they go dead"
Pretty ok headphones very light weight great battery life charges fairly quick. Sound is clear with good clarity the mids and highs are rather Tin-E sounding. Same model type can be found on Temu for half the cost.
"These headphones look stylish, the sound is great listening to music for working out, relaxing, or to answer phone calls.  Unfortunately, the headphones feel quite uncomfortable after a while and give me a headache."
"I mean if your someone who hasn’t had Really good headphones and just want Bluetooth headphones then you should buy them, but if your someone with experience with different types and want really good ones then these aren’t the ones your gonna want"
"I bought these to workout in and it was a fail. They got so sweaty and were so uncomfortable because of the sweat. But they’re some pretty good headphones, i have to admit. Sound quality is great! Ease of use is great. And they look pretty stylish"
"Everytime it turned on it said CONNECTED. But to whom some ET in the sky, some neighbor, who the hell knows. Turned off every blue tooth in my home. Never could NOT CONNECT it. Turned it off, let it sit. Even let it go out of power and recharged. Turn it back on CONNECTED. What the heck? What a waste of Money. Too bad didn't return it in time."
I bought these for my son to use with his tablet. They worked perfectly until last night when he had them on and the speaker got funky and totally stopped working on the right side. Highly annoyed because we only had them a little over a month.
"I've had my headphones for just over a year and I have been very happy with them up until recently. I am not able to power them on. I had difficulty turning them on about a month ago while on a plane, but somehow was able to get them to finally turn on. Now I can't get them to turn on at all. I have tried charging them over night to make sure they are fully charged. The lights on the ear pieces haven't worked in months and the 6 month warranty has closed for me. I hope I can get a response from someone as I have seen many people say the customer service with this company is very good. Thank you in advance for your response."
After a few months these headphones won't work. They are fully charged but won't connect to my blue toothe. Shuts off when I connect headphones to my computer with cord. I've been trouble shooting for a few hours ans nothing. Buyer beware.
"I’ve used a lot of different headphones and earbuds growing up, and these are the audio equivalent of dollar tree earbuds. I will admit they are comfortable and have a long life but there are better options for the same price."
"Had issues right off the bat,keeps saying disconnected then reconnected even though sound would stay on, also constant moments of brief sound drops. Don't know if this was just a lemon, seller didn't offer to replace."
Had to return. Sound was muffled and distorted
They keep cutting off randomly for a second and they have a very slight audio delay on videos as well.
horrible quality. sounded very cheap
"I like the teal color of these headphones and I liked the lights that lit up when they were on. The battery life was pretty good and the buttons used to pause/adjust volume/etc. were pretty easy to find by feel. I used these headphones pretty often, almost every day for several months. But they began to ""stretch out."" If I were inclined at all (like on a machine at the gym), they would slide off my head. If I bent my head forward (like when gardening), they would slide off my head. Not cool! I need them to be grippy enough to stick on there. So I had to get some new headphones and leave these a so-so review."
Purchased them Oct.7 on Nov.8 one ear stop working. SMH Can’t get a replacement nor refund.
Got it in AugustStopped charging in OctoberWouldn’t recommend or buy again
"Loved the color, however the charging port is defective. When plugged in to charge it flickers and doesn't charge to capacity."
"Absolute garbage, do not buy. Perhaps the most useless product I've ever bought amazon should take this crap down."
"I really was impressed with these headphones. They had surprisingly great sound, and worked great as a headset to talk on the phone with.  The charge was really great too. I thought it would never run out.  But then it ran out, and no matter how long I charged it, it didn't come back on. I am very disappointed. I am unable to wear ear buds, they contribute to ear infections for me, let alone they are uncomfortable.  I go back to the drawing board of finding these type of headphones."
Product works wellHowever I don't know when on or off unless I turn on before I put them on. It speaks in Chinese. Instructions are very vague. Hard to understand.  And volume does not go very loud. I only use to watch videos and tv after my husband goes to sleep. And they are not loud at all even if I have volume maxed out.But I guess they are good for what you pay
"5 stars when it was working. Zero Now. I purchased this on January 10th. In March the right side of the head phone started to fail. on for days off for  now that side NO LONGER WORKS. It is now useless. It was for my wife's birthday. This suck big time . She is so disappointed. The return window closed in February. A beautiful waste of money. I am now in South America so cannot return it, even if i wanted to. If I could, it would the price of the Headphones at least. I feel ripped off. SINCE WRITING THIS REVIEW THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY AND AGREED TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE ITEM. This has been quite an adventure. Months after placing this review and the amended review they finally sent me a replacement item which, while appreciated was not the item I ordered and paid for in the first place. What they sent me was a wired headphone. And then the headphone worked for a while until the headband that holds the two speakers to your ears snapped. First the right side then the left side. The sound of the speakers in the headphones is lovely but I have been forced to wrap the broken headband with multiple layers of industrial strength tape. Needless to say I have not been able to enjoy a wireless headphone. They sent me a replacement one. Surprise surprise. It fell apart. And it now resides in the trash."
These are OK wireless headphone with an extremely long battery life. The only negative is a big one. The headphones lack bass. Even the bass mode isn't that good. I'm probably gonna return because I an get jiggy with no bass
The volume is horrible. You turn them up and still they are low. Pretty color poor volume
"The ear pads on these are huge and protrude from the side of your head almost comically. The color of the headband is an ugly shiny gray plastic, not chrome as pictured, and there is no option to turn off or change the led lights that glow from the ear pads in alternating rainbow colors. Overall a ridiculous product. Couldn’t imagine wearing them in public so I returned."
"I ordered as Christmas gifts for the girls for personal and school use they loved the color and lights . In January one of the girls complained the sound is going in and out I thought I fixed it then I saw her keep fixing the cord . Eventually she gave up. Now my other child keeps fussing she can’t hear any sounds coming out the headphones I did the same thing though I fixed it . Now I see her need fussing with the cord , no sound . The girls and I are very disappointed because they were very cute especially with the light . Good thing I got a warranty let see"
I love the headphones themselves but I’m really upset about the fact that while I’m using them the headphones just stop playing out of no where and they are brand new out of the box. I haven’t even had them for a week it’s only been a couple days and this problem has been consistent
"1. The design is pretty. I like the LED lights2. The sound is good, but not great. Needs more base options, I've bought cheaper headphones with better sound.3. The reason for 2 stars instead of 3 is the comfort level. These HURT my ears so bad after 15 min,. I work out, so it's distracting to try to work out for 90 min. and your ears are inflammed after 15 min. of just starting.4. The ear cuffs do not completely cover your ears. It's like they just sit on top of the ears, instead of going OVER the ears like other headphones.5. Noice cancellation is pretty good."
these don’t sound that great.ive bought my other daughter some off amazon they are way better but we needed something fast for school so didn’t return.they are just ok for school work.music nah
"Cool color, pretty good sound and battery life. Noise cancellation may work if the ear piece would fit over the ears instead of awkwardly squeezing them into my head."
"These are great headphones if all you are doing is walking. I like the sound quality but they frequently fall off while doing anything other than walking at the gym, and there is no way to make them tighter on my head."
"My daughter loved them while they lasted. Two months later and there is no sound from one ear. Amazon tech support tried to troubleshoot, but when nothing worked, I was told to contact the seller. I was asked to unlink the headphones and try again. We’d already done that with the Amazon tech support. I responded to their email, telling them that I had already unlinked, had linked again, and had tried other electronics to fix the problem. I received the IDENTICAL email from them telling me to unlink and try .........UPDATE: I have edited the lack of response noted in my original review as emails apparently were not working correctly in Amazon’s automated service. After receiving my email response, I was contacted and my daughter received a new set of headphones two days later."
WHERE CAN I GET A USB  WIRELESS ADAPTER/TRANSMITTER . WANT TO PLAY HEADSET WITH XBOX ONE. WHICH DOESNT SUPPORT BLUETOOTH BUT HAS USB PORTS.
I got these in June 2020.. I used them about 4 times a month until last month when they stopped connecting to the Bluetooth devices it was connected to. I have disconnected them from all devices and started over and it never and still hasn't found the device. Can't get a hold of Amazon customer service or this company for Warranty issues.
"There's no way to adjust the size. They fit close enough that I'm not going to return them, it's just something I wish I would have known going in."
"I was able to use these for about a whole hour.  When i first took the headphones out of the bag,  a small piece of plastic fell out as well,  which i realized was one of the four little plastic hinges.  I figured I'd try them out anyways, and they still held together.  I folded them back up,  and when I unfolded them again, I heard a crack, and the OPPOSITE side's hinges had shattered too,  the bottom part with the ear piece broken off.  I'm thoroughly disappointed... the sound quality for that one hour was really good!!  I really wanted to like these."
"I was very eager to receive these headphones in the beginning. But they take around two hours to charge, and only last around five hours before the battery's out. The sound sometimes glitches out and sounds so dissonant that it makes you want to tear the headphones off. When it's connected to any device it glitches out out almost every 10 minutes. I had read very good reviews, but I received a very glitchy pair."
"Bought these for my daughter while working remotely from home for school.  She disliked them so much from a sound quality perspective she has gone back to listening to her cheap plug into the computer ones.  She uses a bluetooth set in the car and loves them, but these just did not get the job done."
"Honestly these headphones are flimsy and not really that great, I've gotten better ear buds for the same price. I bought for my persona 5 cosplay mainly and that's all I'm really gonna use them for"
I returned because is not was the color the I want it .
Broke after normal wear and tear. The part that bends should not be made out of plastic but an elastic material. The lights are only so cool on broken head phones. Broke after 3  months.
These headsets are cute but low quality for sure. They don’t want to connect to laptops but will connect with my cell is what I really need it for while working outside.
If you want your ears blown out of your head every time you change the channel or every time you change anything or touch any button these will blow your eardrums out. You have children do not buy these things every single time I put something different on the volume is over the top. Yes you can adjust it but all you have to do is touch a button and it'll go right back up. Really ticks me off
"Edit: Changed my rating from 2 starts to 1. I've owned these for less than 6 months, I can't even use them for 4 hours on a full charge. I've barely used them, you'd think they'd at least last a year.Super disappointed by the battery life on these. I can't even get 4 hours on a full charge. It's probably due to the LEDs, which I thought were amazing, but I wish I had purchased something more sensible that would last a bit longer."
"Bought to use with my Fire TV, it reads the headphones but won’t connect. Works with my iPhone so not a total waste."
"Bluetooth consistently shut off after 15 minutes in use and had to move to corded back-up. Didn't work fro what we needed them for, so we returned.They look really nice and come with a nice carrying pouch."
"Loved the color but these headphones would not stay on my head. Didn't check the sound quality or noise cancellation. Definitely consider headphones with an oval-shaped ear cushion hole, rather than circular. That makes all the difference!"
The price should have told me all I needed to know however the reviews said otherwise. Thus my purchase.The right headphone is louder than the first.
"I bought one pair for Christmas 2021 and it broke within a week, they sent me another set and that one died with 6 months. The weak spot is where the headphones fold. Both sets are holding using duck tape right now."
"Battery life is excellent, super cute... but very uncomfortable, feel very cheap and sound quality is not the best."
"I purchased this for a 3rd grader's online schooling. After setting it up, it worked flawlessly for two days. The day of school however, it stopped connecting. 20 minutes of struggling with the BT driver to connect/disconnect, pair and resetting the unit just before the class begin left me very frustrated.  I am not happy with this product that quits when we need it. I give it 1 star for cool lights; the only feature that still works."
Sound quality is just ok. Microphone is near worthless in Bluetooth mode. My daughter has to plug in the cable for anyone to hear her well on FaceTime. The lights can be turned off but you can’t stop them on a single color. Construction feels cheap. Wish I would’ve gone with a different pair.
"I bought this for daughter. She lost the manual. I tried to find any online instructions on how to pair this device to another ipad, but cannot find anything. I tried to long-press the power button, but all I got is power on or power off. Without instructions on how to pair to a new device, this headphone is useless. one-star."
"I purchased these for my daughter to use with her iPad. I connected the headphones with the device. This was the only Bluetooth device connected to her iPad. After 2 weeks, the headphones disconnect from the iPad after 2-3 minutes of use. In order to reconnect them, you have to turn the headphones off, then on again. Very frustrating. Now they are utterly useless."
"These worked really well for about 9 months. The left ear sound went out now, but the lights still work. Did all the troubleshooting and nothing works. Just as some other reviews had said, they don't last. Also don't be fooled by a ton of positive reviews, these companies offer products for good reviews."
"These block out outside sound, and sound great, but they are very small. After taking them off, my ears hurt like crazy, because the padding smashes into my ears. They fit my kids' heads better. They don't even reach all the way round my husband's head when fully expanded."
My daughter has been using them for 3 months and has been loving them till now one side has stopped working. I had decided to spend more to see if would last longer than the $10 ones been buying locally but not so much
"I bought these on March 2nd,2021 and now it's May 1st, 2021 and only the right side is working. I am beyond annoyed. You get what you pay for"
Only one side works
I've bought these headphones 4 times and they always die after a few months.
"Stoped working with wifi after 1 week, have tried everything"
These were great headphones with good sound quality except they broke within 10 months of periodic use. Sent a message to customer service and haven't heard from back. Don't waste your money.
At first it was working the next day all I hear is static out the right side before you know 20 minutes later it stopped work I haven't dropped them or anything
Stop charging.....!! Not cool!!
It broke apart by the hinges in less than 2 weeks.
Okay for the price
Headphones worked once and I cannot get them to work again.  Bluetooth or with audio cable.  Phone says it’s paired. Indicator lights say it’s paired.  No sound.
It’s poor quality and there is no instructions.. do not buy it it awfulAlso it stopped working on left ear in such a short time
It kept sliding off as I tried jogging.
Did not hold together. It broke within a week. Loved everything about them besides this
I returned this item. It was very staticky and it was not comfortable
Don't get these headphones because you'll unable to charge it after a month. I've only used it a couple of times. Had to buy a pair of earbuds.
Small - hard plastic - cheap looking - returned immediately
"Cheap trash quality,  looks nothing like product image,  I feel like I was scammed."
"Bought them little over 2 months ago and already they don’t hold charge at all. Tried leaving them charging overnight with different cords, nothing works."
bought  2  both  failed\\
"June 2023: Well another pair ... one of the pair I bought in 2022... has failed completely on one side at least.  This is the second pair of these ""110's"" (look at the end of the model number) that has done this in say a year to a year 1/2 at best.  I may have gotten lucky but I had a pair of the ""100's"" (sound basically the same, discontinued, and they have a thicker insolation around the wire .. aka a thicker cable) that lasted me for about 10 YEARS. Under the same condition these last two pair that broke on me were subjected to.  I am on the borderline of saying ""I cant recommend these"" anymore ... but I admit for the right price I may get another pair and just KNOW these will not last and if i get even a single year out of them, that will be great.  It stinks and I am NOT happy but, the other options I see do not sound as good in this price range or sound as good but are made even cheaper.  I want a pair that sonud decent enough when eq'ed (I do like my music) but aren't 100's of dollars since alot of times i am in the hot Florida heat and humidity.  That pair that lasted 10 years at least I am sure I even got them in a unintential rain storm or two over that time.  These 110;s dont seem to last.  Even the pair of Sony ""300/310s"" I have in red have an EVEN THINNER cable.Feb 2023: just noticed this yesterday but between that pair that seemed like it was tuned funny and another pair i use at my laptop (main computer i use alot) ... the earpads that NORMALLY flake to pieces in no time ... well in both pair they are a-ok and not even starting to flake off ... from an old pair that broke i still have some memory foam earpads that i can swap on anytime i want (they are more comfortable though the stock pads are decent enough too comfort wise) ... but credit where it's due on the not flaking to pieces issueJan 2023 Update for ""Muddy"" pair vs others EQ'd the same way ... well i have to go back and read my review ... I think i adjusted the mids somehow but i have been using this pair constantly and not only does the pair bought in Jan 2022 still work fine, the earpads which i expected to go by now, are still ok and also the sound issue ... EQ'ed thanks to Rockbox ... I dont notice any ""issue"" (granted my expectations of these NOT being audiophile quality sound but a good clear V-shape with decent mids .. not too back and not too forward) ... yeah i am ok with even that pair, nowFeb 2022 update to the newest Jan 2022 pair i mentioned sounding muddy.  I have used them a few days and now i think I have the fix ... they need EQ help but they sound decent now, even if not ""great"".  My fix was in Rockbox (Sansa mp3 players running Rockbox was always my main use-case) I left ""Treble"" and ""base"" alone and kept all of my prior sound settings I had for prior models sounding good.  I kept the i want to say around the 1k and 2k EQ ranges that were at zero and i pulled them down a bit ... THEN I also (based off a youtube video suggestion on muddy sound) i pulled down the low end in the advanced EQ part, STILL leaving a boosted ""base"" in the individial ""base"" part .... hard to explain for those that dont know Rockbox but it's like an android EQ where you pull the low end down in the slider portion but also ENABLE a ""base boost"" toggle or something that an EQ app may have ... that sort of thing only you have more control over how much the ""base boost"" is ""boosted"".Not all songs sound great but that could be the source file ....even the one i am thinking of doesn't make me go ""wow .. that is not the way i am use to these headphones sounding on that track"" .... I still would prefer not having to do this and having them tuned the way they use to be tuned (maybe i got a bad pair) ... but they are usuable now and i like themJan 2022 Update:  I recent bought a ""backup pair"" this past December and just tested them today ... I do like vs the 2016/2017 versions of the ""110's"" the cable from the split down to the connect it seems thicker (like the ""100's use to be"") ... though what I dont like is ... the tuning ... I still have those old 110's and I 100% notice a clarity difference ... turns out I cant return these if i wanted to (not saying I would ... ) but doing an A-vs-B comparsion I totally hear a clarity difference ... these new ones sound balanced, do not get me wrong, but they sound a tad muddy vs the old pair ... and I totally admit i do a combo of a U or a V shaped EQ when using the Sony 100's or 110's ... these dont sound great un-EQ'ed .... .but ... this exact pair while they work sound muddier than any 100's or 110's I have had before ... if this was my own experience with the MDRXZ 100's or 110's ... I'd be considering other brands in the same price range--------------------------------------------------This review is based on my first impressions with the ""110's"" on a number of mp3 player, and a number of ""100's"" (the previous model https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WODP20/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) that I have had and used over the years.Pro - Sound QualitySo far I DO notice more bass in these new (my first pair of the ""110's"") pair of headphones and unlike prior experience with Sony (and other companies too ...) earbuds where the ""new great model"" .. didn't sound as good as the prior ones did ...These 110's just add enough to the bass and possibly treble too, that makes it definitely sound better then the 100's though it doesn't fall into the trap I described above, when sometimes they add ""more bass"" and it turns out the bass is so strong, that it drowns everything else out.  I have to say that this is not really a knock on the 100's .. I do still like them but for the same price on either ... I'd go with the 110's but if there is a ""good deal"" on the 100's and I was getting them again ... I am not against getting another pair of the 100's either.Yes these are ""cheap"" headphones and probably not as good quality wise as a really expensive pair though I do recall some reviews saying they tried these along side a pair of ""$200 Beats"" and while the did say their friend's Beats did sound better ... they personally would rather get maybe two or three pair of these and still have say $150 left over ... meaning ""they do not sound price-vs-quality of the sound"" .. 'that much better'Pro/Con - Build qualityThese ARE plastic headphones of course, though I do not agree with those that say ""oh its like they are from the Dollar store ... the plastic is horrible ..etc etc""... just if your going to buy a much more expensive pair of headphones ... your will probably get better quality tooThe one downside that ... I admit I see in these, and are a problem in the pair of ""the 100's"" that was 100% caused by me ... AND EVEN THEN that exact pair, needed fixing but still sounds great ... I am using THEM while typing this review, is the part where the 100's and the 110's ear-cups move.  I am not sure ""how it could be made better"" but that was the exact point of failure for my long-used pair (again 100% my fault for HOW the break,happened) .. note that if it wasn't for me they would still be fine and that is after 3+ years of HEAVY use and they still work ... so maybe it's fine for being able to fold (in both models I mean)Pro - FitI am not sure if i can say one way or the other ""I have a big head"" (100% not a small head) but they fit fine .. even out of the box.  Heck after that DIY type of repair I did on my broke pair .. .I had to flip them backwards and .. they for the most part still fit great ... these 110's are no different.By the way I have glasses (regular and sunglasses used when wearing these) and just like the 100's, these are nice and comfy ... not too tight or too lose, if you ask me??? - The cordThe cord looks different from the 100's I have and I like the cord ... basically I think some of the cords on others are way way too small and that always leads to the problem of one of the two sides going out for good ... The cord on the 110's looks a tad smaller diameter wise but really if that doesn't mean that issue I just described DOESN'T happen .. I do not really care... I just want the headphones to work for a long time ... if the cord is different but there are no issues ... this change is fine by me.Plug - I will keep this review updated IF there is a change but I have no had these for long enough to comment on some of the reviews who keep having issues with the plug breaking ... NOT on this pair but my other pair of the 100's get plugged into and unplugged from stuff for over three years now and often too ... never had a problem .. but then again I cant comment on these. for now.SummaryI would recommend these no question ... though if your expecting a super high end sound (aka are an ""audiophile"") you MAY BE disappointed though as someone who loves his music ... I think the sound with the right equalizer settings, on the device or program your using... I do LOVE the sound of these.Update - After using a new pair of the ""100's"" ... aka the prior modelReally ... the 110's do have the slightly higher bass and that is not a bad thing either  .... the new pair of the 100's I am using I actually thought were the 110's (I just forgot what headphones I was using)... THE POINT? ... they both have great bass and I think the pair that I use to wear daily (the broken pair that still works great.... just doesn't fit perfectly anymore)'s fit actually effects the bass ... that old pair I hold the earcups closer to my ears than how they ""sit"" now .. .and I hear alot more bass.Between the 100s and 110's ... if the way each one of them fold doesn't matter to you for say fitting them into a caring case .... I recommend both 1000% (no typo) ... find the best deal  ... if you can get one a little cheaper than the other ...cool ... there is more bass by a little bit on the 110's but do not think I am saying a new pair of the 100's are weak in that department."
I was disappointed because these are a VERY cheaply made pair of headphones. I figured they would be decent being from Sony. I got them for my elementary age child to use at school and they do work for that purpose. He says they aren’t all that comfortable. I hope they last the rest of the school year. I thought they would be better than the cheap kind from Walmart but I should have stuck with those rather than these.
"The older version sony made was better sound, and how they could reverse the headphone speaker toward the outside so two people could listen with one speaker each, but you can't do that with these, not as much bass as the older version either, but they sound good enough for the money.  If you're on a budget, then I'd say get these, but they aren't going to blow your mind or anything... still far better bass/sound than and ear-buds, and obviously much more comfortable too. Great for media/video editing if you need to keep the sound down around you, but if your making beats/mixing music these are not good enough. You'd want a much higher grade headphone system than these for mixing music, unless you're just starting out."
"For $10 they're OK.  The feel light, cheap and plasticky...  The sound isn't great, but it's not terrible either.  If you need a set of non-microphoned wired headphones in a pinch, these will do.  If you need a set for kids so they don't rip apart your good headphones, these will do."
"This headphones aren't bad. I got these because i needed a set while my bluetooth one's charge. There light weight and work great. My only issue is I feel there not loud enough, I like to feel the bass. Overall not bad for the price."
"Sony ZX Series Wired On-Ear Headphones with Mic, White MDR-ZX110AP,  Comfort Level- Only Short Time Needs more Cushion Support around the Ears it feels like carboard."
I had to get a new pair because my 13 pound dog slept on them and they broke. No volume control on them
"I like the price. I have ordered twice to provide over the ear headphones for my kids who are not looking for high quality music sounds but want to play Fortnite and casually listen to music through Spotify.So from that perspective and use, it is a good product.I lowered by 1 star simply because when I ordered, they always take forever to arrive.  It was estimated to take 4 or 5 days. It took 15 days from ordering before this item was put into a mail tracking system by having a label printed. Once it was, it arrived late, by the estimate of that system, because USPS was waiting for them to arrive. As of the writing of this, 18 days after ordering, I ma still waiting... but hope to have them in 3 days according to the tracking.So just be aware, there is the potential for a 3 week turnaround, which in 2024... is unusual.EDIT: USPS was able to get them there on Day 18. so that is better."
"these work as an average pair of headphones.  the sound quality is fine and they fit well. unfortunately, as the price suggests, they won’t last long. i bought two pairs. with regular use, one broke within a month and the other within about 6 months. the jack stops connecting well with the device. it served its purpose well but i wouldn’t repurchase."
"I'm in a Convulsant hospital across from the nurses station. It is very noisy during the day. and a little noisy at night. They try to keep thing quiet. I got these because they were constantly turning my volume control down on my computer as I listen to music when I can't sleep and I only sleep 4 hours at night and I'm done. I have 1 hour power naps in the day time again with music or a movie. So I plug them in hoping for more volume, But I had the program on as high as it would go and the computer as loud as it would go. and I could just hear it bearly what was being said in the movie. I pulled out the head phone jack and I was asked to please to turn down my movie so the sound was on. So I again put the jack in. I didn't hear my movie so the jack must be working. I put the head set on and yea i could hear them talking just bearly.  I couldn't hear enough of the movie to enjoy it. I gave it to my care giver and maybe if there is no other sound around and you have good hearing you will be satisfied but it's to much trouble to send it back. It's not worth the $10 I paid to go to the Post Office and take it back. It has no volume control I have ordered one with volume control."
"If you're interested in high quality sound from your headphones, look elsewhere. If you're willing to compromise and want headphones that are adequate but unremarkable, and if price is a big factor, these will do.Pros:- Low price- Adjustable to fit any size head- Comfortable and light weightCons:- Short cord. If you don't want to sit within 3 feet of your audio source, get headphones with a longer cord or go for wireless/Bluetooth headphones.- Sound quality is maybe a bit above mediocre. I listened to a sports event and a number of different streamed songs. The audio for the sports event sounded hollow and tinny. The music sound quality was much better, but the bass was lacking, no matter how I adjusted the tone and volume controls on my laptop.Bottom line: Buy these if audio quality is not a major concern for you (probably if you only listen to audio books and stuff like that). If you're really into music, save up and buy really good headphones when you can afford them."
My husband says they are a little small but easily transportable.  I can hear them when he is using them because they don't fit snuggly over his ears.  They may be better for someone with smaller ears or perhaps children.
For these for my kid for school. He has had other brands and the volume on these were very low. They fit kind of tight. He liked the color but overall these were not good quality headphones.
"This was cheap, but a sony. Let's see how the sound performance it, because the unit is flimsy: I know it now taken care of like a baby it'll snap apart fast."
"I bought these ones, because they weren’t Bluetooth. I’ve always had AirPods, but they broke recently and I’m trying to steer clear of more Bluetooth for now.If you are using these with your iPhone…just know you will need an adapter, because it’s not compatible.I don’t like that everyone around me can hear everything…it’s supposed to help keep my music, etc, from being super loud. Anyone around you can still hear so if you’re looking for something to use to listen to music or have a private conversation I’d suggest a different item."
Okay they are lightweight and inexpensive- but there isn’t much volume or base to these cheapy headphones.Good for watching YouTube so as not to disturb your sleeping spouse but I wouldn’t pick these to listen to music.
"The sound quality could be improved, and it may feel a bit uncomfortable after using it for more than three hours."
"I use these and they work OK, they’re not the greatest sound, But for what I use them for they’re fine."
feel very flimsy and the sound is a bit meh but at the price what do you expect?
"These headphones were very cheap, so I'll keep them, but compared to my previous cheap headphones, they are much quieter for the same volume setting for a small, portable radio. I have to turn to volume way up to hear at the same volume as my previous headphones, so the radio will likely consume batteries more quickly. Again, they were very cheap (on sale for $9.99), so I'll keep them."
Nice just hope they last longer than the last pair we bought.
"Just some headphones, nothing special about them, they're not good but they're cheap."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            These are light and compact headphones that meet all of my listening needs. They are a bit tight-fitting and don’t completely cover my ears. The sound quality is louder and high-pitched.I previously used the discontinued Sony Noise Canceling MDR-NC7 headphones which worked very well for many years. Then last week I had worn them while resting on my couch, and I inadvertently put pressure on the side of the headphones with the weight of my head twisted against the pillow. Although not a lot of pressure, it was enough to cause a small piece of plastic less than half a centimeter at the joint of the left ear to break off. I tried was unable to repair the joint with glue and resorted to wrapping tape around it as a stopgap.The MDR-ZX110AP version is designed in a much simpler manner than my older model from Sony, mainly having one piece stretching from ear to ear. The previous design was head two rotating joints on each side attached by a curved bridge-piece. I find that the one-piece curved design applies too much pressure to the point of being uncomfortable, but this model seems to have some give to it, and I expect I’ll get used to the difference.I wasn’t sure if I needed the mic for $10 extra but decided audio quality is critical to video calls and other recordings I might want to do more of in the future.The ear cushioning is also more of a professional-grade quality compared to the foam material in the previous version, but I found the foam more comfortable although it may have resulted in some of the audio leaking out to the surrounding environment.The inward fold-up when not using them is convenient mainly because it’s quick to unfold and apply back on my ears. The old version would take longer to reorient when unfolding because the each earcup was free to rotate on an axel, and you had to make sure it was oriented so that the bottom of the cup with the wired connection wasn’t spun to the top. This isn’t a big deal but added a couple of seconds every time you wanted to put them on before.The sound quality suits my needs although I do feel it’s a bit screechy in the limited time I’ve tested it. I also don’t detect any noise cancellation. I believe the previous version automatically reduced the audio as part of the noise cancellation, so it makes sense that this is louder. This isn’t a major issue for me because I only use these on my computer, so the surroundings aren’t overly bothersome.These are also much lighter than previous generations of the product. It’s actually something I’ll have to get used to, but I suppose it will be something I take for granted and hard to go back to a heavier one once I do."
"We have two pairs of these headphones for our kids to use at school.  The compact, folding set was a big plus for us.  They're sleek and easy to transport.  The biggest issue is that they don't contain the sound very well; my daughter got in trouble at school for having her headphones on too loud because the whole class could hear what she was listening to.  I've confirmed this issue myself when my son is using his set at home.  I check that he's listening at reasonable volume in the headphones, but I can hear what he's listening to all the way across the room.  There's a reasonable expectation that headphones will contain the sound to the wearer and these completely miss the mark on that point."
"Muffled sound, too quiet, awkward fit"
The cord is short
Not That Good
This product was not an expensive purchase howver it is nice headset.  The sound can be a lot better in other sets: this one does not have the deepest baseline. It is comfortable on and it does not squish your ears or head.
"So I've had these for some time to be used as backup. I tried them out when I first purchased them and was underwhelmed by the sound quality. There are no highs and no lows, only mid range in terms of sound frequency. Even cheap desktop speakers do better than this. It also sound like the speakers are wrapped in plastic.The quality is also a little baffling. The slightest movement makes the plastic shift against itself causing popping noises. Simply rocking your jaw a little or maybe chewing causes these to make noise louder than what I'm listening to.I cannot for the life of me see why these are rated so high. They are cheap, sure, but my old set that I purchased 15 years ago was just as cheap and they were not the highest quality, but they lasted 15 years before the wires broke internally and caused intermittent sound. But these Sony headphones don't even work as backup. I had to immediately purchase another set, but this time I went with the same mfr that my last set was from. I'll not buy Sony again judging by what these were like."
"I know they were $10 bucks, but the sound quality even for that price was a let down.  spend a little more and get something better..."
I'm a tall man and these phones look and feel like toys. They work but the cord is only 4 ft long - too short for me.
There  ok. Should have bought  little more expensive  ones to fit snugg you can't wear these working out to loose
"If your device is battery-powered or rechargeable, like an iPad or phone, be aware that these earphones will rather quickly drain its charge."
Expected better quality from Sony but this model muffles the high and and medium frequencies.I do not recommend.
"I've been on a quest to find a decent set of headphones with a microphone in them for meetings that I have over google hangouts which can last hours at a time and listen to some of my favourite music while designing the next big product release. This review is for the Sony MDRZX110AP ZX headphones that I purchased from Amazon.com.Overview:I really wanted to love these headphones. After all, 916 reviews with 4.5 stars across the board they couldn't be that bad? As soon as I got the headphones I spent the next 10 minutes trying to carefully extract them from their packaging. This is never a good sign but I didn't want it to influence me so I pressed on. Having the headphones removed and able to examine them more closely, they feel about what you would expect for a $20 set of headphones. I like the inline microphone and single multifunction button. The manual doesn't really tell you what the multifunction button does and how it's supposed to work but by trial and error I was able to determine that a single button click pauses and plays music, a double press fast forwards and a triple press rewinds. A long hold on the button calls Siri. The padding is not horrible and they are lightweight. They do press snugly against my head but I'm not sure if this would make them uncomfortable after long use. Last, they do feel somewhat brittle when moving them from flat to open position but as long as you aren't brute forcing it, you should be fine.My BackgroundI am not an audiophile and my hearing range cuts off right around 16.5KHz but my background is that I have a degree in physics with a focus on acoustics and own my own home theatre speaker building company. At best, that makes me only slightly more qualified than the average Joe in testing headphones which are a completely different than testing HT speakers. I rely on two things when testing, an SPL meter with a frequency generator and my ears. The latter because what ""sounds"" right from speakers and headphones car vary immensely from person to person. It's like buying a pair of sneakers, and having everyone agree on the ""perfect"" pair. If that were the case, R&D in sneaker design would have ceased about 20 years ago.Tests:After burning in the headphones over a period of 24 hours playing a sweeping frequency at a moderate level, I tried the first of tests which are highly subjective. I do this before attaching any equipment to not be swayed by what the equipment is telling me. Bass seemed decent, but mids seemed really high and the treble seemed to be non existent (or extremely muted at best). I thought it was my ears so I switched over to a pair of headphones (Sennheiser) that I know and sure enough the treble was there. Next I listened for the soundstage using a THX 5.1 soundstage demo. The X direction was fine as it should be for a pair of headphones. The Y direction I had some serious difficulty picking up on - it was there, but just barely. But the Z direction, the most difficult soundstage to reproduce was non existent. I believe this is due to the weakness of the treble response.Next I connected my meters to see if perhaps my ears were way off. The results speak for themselves. You get a climbing bass response from 12Hz up until 225Hz. At 1000Hz, things start to go really haywire with a nearly 20db spike at 3686Hz. At 10KHz, you see things level out to about where the bass response is and then quickly taper downwards. From 12985.7Hz to 14056.2Hz there is a drop from 93db to 86db. Over a 1KHz upper range a drop of 7db is quite poor.In all, I will be returning these headphones as I cannot live with the mid range spike these headphones have. It really takes away from the highs and lows these headphones are capable of if the mid range was flattened out. My guess is that if Sony could sort the 875Hz to 10343Hz range -- that is flatten it out, these would be a decent set of headphones for $20. As they are, I cannot endorse them."
"I didn’t expect much, but they sound really cheap."
So for 10$ these are great especially for kids and class. They get the job done but just know they are literally the most basic thing ever. They are like a level up from headphones on an airplane so don’t be disappointed because they are purely simple
"I've only used these headphones 3 times and the right speaker is already blown...and it's past the return window.  I did not listen at a high volume, or even thumping music...just watched a few YouTube videos. You definitely get what you pay for!!"
The sound quality is great. They fold up into a very convent little package shape for traveling. My only issue is that the ear piece does not cover my ear thus allowing more ambient noise into my listening experience.
"Works well For what I need them for. Nothing to write home about, but does the job nonetheless if you need a headphone with these type of jacks"
"I bought for my kid for school, she liked it and a volume controller would have been helpful. And the card is little bit short."
"For $10, you get what you pay for.  I wanted a wired set of headphones for use with my older Fire 10 HD so if SHTF, I can still listen to audiobooks.This set is ideal for that job description.For music?  These are utter trash.  Horrible.I gave them 3 stars since they do an admirable job for what I expect of them.  I can't give them more than 3 stars or someone will think these are acceptable for music...which they are NOT."
They sound ok but a lot smaller than they looked. And they are not very comfortable.
Good for the money but I like it able to get a lot higher in volume
"Didn’t even get a chance to wear them, great price but we had to return."
Not much padding. They hurt my ears.Average sound.Inexpensive.
Good but not great for Sony oroduct
"I bought 4 of these things over the years and they have all had a similar problem with the wire deteriorating at various flex points leading to the headphones failing. Still, better quality sound and durability wise than Walmart's ""Onn"" brand $10 headphones. My kids like them but I'm not sure they are even worth it at $10."
"Well, I've decided to switch from earbuds to headphones, so I decided to pick up the Sony MDR-ZX110s, which are Sony's cheapest and best selling headphones at only $9.99.Build quality is a 5/10. It's made of plastic and feels very flimsy. You'd have to be very careful with it so it won't break. But you can fold it up to store it in a safe place, so that's cool.Comfort is a 4/10. The stock earcups that come with the cans feel very average and made my ears hot.Sound quality is a 4/10. The audio is very muddy and flat-sounding. Even with the earcups removed, they still sound boring.As someone who is more interested in audiophile-grade cans that sound crisp, clear, bright, and vibrant, these were a disappointment. Sending them back to Amazon."
Overall these headphones are a great deal for the money.  I was very disappointed that they DID NOT FIT OVER MY EARS and consequentially move around a bit.
"Sound is pretty good, but the cord is ridiculously short. It’s hard to imagine what this would actually be good for. It makes it pretty unusable for me"
I ordered these earphones and they work but don't have great sound quality but they are foldable and convenient durability is pretty good and they fit well.
"these used to be the most reliable headphones I could buy. I had my first pair of these and I loved them for at least 3 years before i accidentally broke them. I bought a 2nd pair and for some reason the cord was made different and cheaper and it ended up snapping off one of the ears leaving me with only one earphone working. and last but not least I bought a 3rd pair this year and for some reason the sound quality is muffled and worse than the last 2 pairs I bought, although the cord was better. I'm so sad my 3rd pair isn't working out because I love these headphones and the sound quality for such a cheap price, but I don't know if I bought a faulty pair or if they started manufacturing these with worse quality as with most things after the pandemic. I'm very tempted to buy a 4th pair to hold out hope but I'm afraid I'll have to say farewell. :("
"These headphones look amazing. They have a great design. But that's where it stops.The audio is muffled, The padding for the ear pieces is non existent. They are too tight and pinch your ears. The bass and treble are both muffled. if you can get these for $5 they would be worth it but any other price you might as well just use ear buds. These have lower quality than ear buds.[Pros]Cool looking[Cons]Bad audio qualityBad designUncomfortable"
I purchased the Sony Headphones after yet another pair of expensive headphones broke.  I was looking for a cheaper pair just for an on the fly replacement when I found these.  I opted for no mic because it would have taken longer for that version to be delivered.  The headphones are sturdy but a bit smaller than I'm used to but I'm ok with that.  The sound is pretty good but there is no volume control on the headphones which was a bit disappointing.
"I've had many Sony products over the years, and I have a general sense that if they put their name on it, then it's at least decent quality. The price was a little scary low, but I figured, it's still a Sony.Well, as soon as I picked them up, I knew it was a mistake. They are so cheaply made. They feel horrible in every way. Uncomfortable on the ears, on the top of the head, and they stick out very wide and look ugly. Did they sound ok? Who knows. I put them right back in the box and sent them back. I'm ok if the sound quality isn't perfect (they're very inexpensive) as long as they are somewhat comfortable to wear. These are absolutely horrible. I would've given it a 1-star, but I have no doubt that the sound quality is fine for the price, so I'll give them that.TLDR: The title says it all. This is in no way a deal. You are truly getting what you pay for in quality, or less. Probably less."
"Earphone ear pads are small, so don't cover the ear like my Edifier H840's do, so doesn't block ambient noise as well.  Also the funky materials in the ear pads are noisy, the create snap & crackle noises whenever they move, like having a bowl of rice krispies up to your ears !  Sound quality is good however.  If you want a good noise dampening heaphone, keep looking.  These arn't them."
They are ok for cheap headphones. Audio isn't the best quality but they work.
"These are on-the-ear headphones, not over-the-ears, they're too small, But, sound quality is ok."
"I'm an audio guy, and care mostly about sound quality. For ten bucks shipped on Prime, these are very inexpensive and you have to adjust your expectations accordingly. I thought the build quality was pretty good, and they looked more expensive than they were. They're comfortable to wear, and are lightweight. There's no battery, no volume control, no noise-cancelling, no Bluetooth, and no microphone, but there's not supposed to be. These are simple, straightforward audio headphones. My one main gripe -- and it's a pretty big one -- is power efficiency. By that I mean the volume, when connected to a phone or a computer, is really low compared to my other headphones (I also have high end of Shure studio monitor headphones). Even at maximum volume, they're pleasant but seem to provide half to a third the volume of my other headphones. In addition, the sound is flat, kind of like you're listening through a thick blanket. So yeah, they work fine, they're very inexpensive, they're well made enough, they look good, but the audio quality is at best on par with other sub-$10 headphones - there's no bargain to be found here in that respect. If sound quality is also your priority, I think you may be disappointed.EDIT: I just lowered the rating. I think Sony's Chinese manufacturer is kind of screwing them. I think they substituted poor-quality magnets or some other component in the middle of the manufacturing run without telling anyone, including Sony. Probably the first batch of them were pretty good. But these are really annoying me for one primary reason: very low volume. Compared to nearly anything similar, they just plan too quietly. I usually have to turn the volume up to 100% on everything  I have lots of other headphones and none of them are like this, even my very expensive and inefficient studio headphones. I'd recommend looking for something else, even at this extremely low price."
Great sony sound for the price
"The Sony ZX headphones are a budget-friendly option with decent comfort and portability, making them suitable for casual use. However, they fall short in key areas, particularly with sound leakage, as audio escapes noticeably even at just 30% volume. This makes them unsuitable for quiet environments where privacy is needed, such as offices or public spaces. While the design is lightweight and foldable, the sound quality is average, lacking depth in bass and clarity in mids and highs. For the price, they’re passable for basic listening, but the leakage issue significantly limits their versatility."
"Is it that people need to have a name brand, such as Sony, to feel validated?  and do people really believe that anything Sony makes must be a great product?  I had BIG doubts that these headphones could be good at $9.99, but given the 100,000+ reviews with such a high overall rating, I ignored those doubts, and that premonition ... I wish I'd trusted my instinct, because now I have to return the headphones (and returning stuff is such a pain).The instant I put them on I noticed the sound was ""muffled"", so I played with the equalizer and was able to improve the sound a bit, but then the volume was compromised.  I then compared these to my 15-year OLD Apple wired earbuds and the Apples, beat up as they were, were so far beyond superior to these brand new $9.99 Sonys that it was comical.  I literally laughed out loud.Also, they don't fit well; they don't cup your ears properly; the fit was so poor that I kept fidgeting with them, but alas, I gave up.You know the adage, you get what you pay for?  well it's true.  Instead of buying these, I would encourage you to save up your money for a couple/few months, however long it takes, and maybe you'll also need to bide your time until you find a good sale, but please treat yourself to a quality pair of headphones; these are not it.  As far as I'm concerned, Sony can stick these in their Mt. Fuji.  Because after all, you get what you pay for."
Works pretty good. The sound quality is good. Only the size of the earpieces are a little small. Don’t actually cover the ear can be a little uncomfortable too.
Extremely cheap. I got them thinking that because Sony is a good brand they'd be decent but they a crappy.
There is a ton of sound leakage and there is nothing preventing sound to come in because the material that covers your ear is terrible. Also the length of the wire is about that of a standard earbud. I would not call it good for the price but fine for the price. It would probably be worth it spend an extra 10 dollars and get something just that much better.
"Just received these. I got them primarily  for use on my computer, mostly just listening to videos but also to use with voice recognition software, so I got the one with the microphone..I'm not an audiophile, but I did want decent sound in case I use them on a music player. They sound just fine, as you would expect from Sony, especially at this price point.I'm quite happy that they work very well with Dragon NaturallySpeaking, which I'm using to dictate this, so the microphone is quite adequate.What is nice is that the microphone is on one of the wires and it is not more than three or 4 inches from your mouth. Again quite happy with the fact that it works quite well with Dragon NaturallySpeaking.I can't see me using this for telephone calls. For some reason I don't feel comfortable with over the ear headphones, or earbuds for calls. I don't get a real sense of feedback to be able to modulate my voice. For phone calls I prefer a single ear unit.The big disappointment is that, like so many Sony headphones I've had in the past these things are so tight, it squeezes your head like a grapefruit. What I've done is take a hairdryer to the headband to heat up the plastic, and attempt to bend it a bit to loosen it up. I've had some success in making them more comfortable. At least this plastic is somewhat malleable, because I found that some of the other plastics are almost impossible to bend without breaking.For me they'll do the job quite well for something under $20.After wearing them now for just a few minutes I remember what I hate about most headphones. The vinyl earpiece cover always make your ears hot.Now I'm on the search for foam or cotton cover to go over these."
"I think it's not worth the money, I definitely don't recommend it."
Headphones are not snug and are a pain to wear after wearing for a time.
"For a $10 pr. of headphones, for listening thru a digital voice recorder (also a Sony) w/ an MP3 playing feature @ work, the sound is actually pretty good.  They are over-the-ear headphones, so sound cancellation is minimal.My issue is, however, that the molded 90-degree plug has loosened inside the molding, & periodically (more often than not), the sound cuts in & out, so I'll hear my music thru the built-in speaker on the voice recorder, which I place in my shirt pocket when listening.  I jiggle the plug, & the sound will return thru the headphones, but then, as I move around @ work, the sound will cut in & out.  Plus, the plug doesn't snap securely into the headphone jack on the recorder, that is, it doesn't have a precise fit into the jack.As a temporary fix, I've attached an additional 6"" 90-degree adapter where the headphone plug snaps into the female jack of the adapter more securely, & the adapter plug snaps more securely into the recorder.  This helps the headphone plug stay more stationary in my pocket.  The problem still occurs, but not as often.For now, when budget permits, I will purchase a better pair of headphones, & hopefully, this problem will not recur.  I would still recommend these phones for their sound quality, but that is moot if the plug is feeble.  Hence, I am not satisfied w/ the product.  Unfortunately, I've had them long enough now so returning them is not an option.Update -- March 2023:  The earpiece wires are not molded to the earpiece, so repeated use causes the edge of the plastic hole through which the wires are fed to fray the insulation around the wire, thus causing the wire to fray & break -- not what should happen, even with $10 headphones.  I'm changing my rating to 1 star.  Do not buy these -- too cheaply made.  This is not the manufacturing quality I've come to expect from Sony."
"These are decent for what I paid.  They sound just fine, as I expect from Sony.  The last Sony pair lasted 10 years and, if I didn't break one of the headphone housings, I would still be using it regularly.  It is now a backup.The issue I have with these is that they slip off of my head.  They shouldn't slip off of my head...ever.  I have been using headphones for over 40 years and it is not my head that is the problem, or EVERY pair would slip off.  These are, I think, the least expensive ( cheapest ) headphones that Sony makes.If you are using them for professional recording, what the hell is wrong with you?  These are, at best, to use at home with a 4 track recorder or an interface going directly into your computer.The 3 stars is because of the weak housing that slips off of my head.  It would get 5 if the ENTIRE product worked properly."
"Super comfy. Good for hours.Sound is okay. Nothing distorted. The highs are quite buried in the distance though.If you are just casual listening, these are hard to beat for the price. If you are doing anything critical you may find these lacking. It's a pretty big difference compared to more expensive gear."
"Fit tight, uncomfortable"
"I mean, you get what you pay for, and I knew the price was too good to be true. I literally cannot use these headphones, as they don't stay on my ears well; it doesn't cup over your ears, it just lays on top of it awkwardly, as Sony decides against adding any curvature. Everything about the product feels incredibly cheap, from the material to the actual design. I immediately looked for a replacement pair as this is a headset you either get out of desperation or because you're really, really broke and it's better than nothing (barely)."
Poor quality sound. OneOdio is much better for not much more cost.
They are smaller than I thought lol but they worked okay for the price.. sadly I accidentally dropped something with a sharp edge and cut the cord 😞 so only lasted me like a month.
"Flimsy.  No bass effect.  Poor fit.  I have an average sized heat, I'm pretty sure.  These are tight.  They don't cover the ear. They rest on the ears. Poor craftsmanship as far as I can tell.  I highly recommend that you find another set."
"Seems to be of decent quality, the anti tangle cord is nice. They do tend to slide off my head quite often if I'm bending over or making quick moves."
"I should have considered the price point when buying these, but I was blinded by the fact they are Sony, and the brand typical doesn't disappoint. There is very little padding on these, and they are so small that they sit on your ear instead of around your ear like a more comfortable pair would. They work just fine for what I need them for, but if you have an older kid or are using them as an adult, they make your ears sore after a little while"
These headphones are great for someone on a budget but for like 5$ more you can get earpods from apple and they are much better than these. Good if you can get them on sale but not recommended in my opinion.
Bought for my daughter because her therapist recommended them for noise cancellation and music use. They work great for listening to music but not for noise cancellation.
It doesn't fit as well as I hoped. I have to push the ear pads against my ears to close off all noise.
"These feel as cheap as they were. I was able to do some editing with them, but they fit awkwardly and don’t fully cover my ears. Immediately ordered a better one. Will be keeping this as an emergency backup, but I don’t recommend it."
Worked great at first but having issues with the cables/jack after less than 2 months
Qualities good needs more colors
"not as good as expected, don't like double wire."
Sending them back. Muffled sound quality like they are holding back. Laptop speakers are much louder.
I like those headsets good price
A little bit flimsy but works.
Nothing to exciting here. They are just budget headphones. Didn't want to get anything fancy since my kid is required to leave them at school. They seemed to have made it through a year of school fine. The sound quality is good for the price but definitely not for the audiophile.
"Previous buyers beware - what they are selling here is an inferior product to what they used to sell under this label. I bought this listing of headphones years ago and it served me well. I ordered it again, thinking it would be the same - but the new product is about 1/3rd the size of the old headphones! It is extremely uncomfortable to use, and I wouldn't be able to use it without giving me headaches - it simply wouldn't fit my head. Obviously they have chosen a cheaper process to save money, and hope that it just stretches to fit someone's head - regardless of how uncomfortable it must feel.I encourage no one to buy this product, and am unsure if Sony offers any budget headphones that are up to the standards of their old products. These headphones are good if you like getting your head squeezed. Attached pictures show these headphones are tiny compared to the same product I bought years ago."
"I am of two minds on this product.  First of all, if you want to know if they're worth the low price the answer is yes, if you have a smallish head.  They were $12 when I bought them and for the price they sound good. The sound is sort of muted and dull, nothing crip on the high end and the lows are a bit muddy.  This is exactly what I would expect from inexpensive headphones.  If you are a serious music junkie you won't care about this too much I think. I use them to listen to music and work and for that they are fine.  I wore them back-to-back with my in-ear buds and the buds sound better, but that's because they're inserted into the ear canal.  They also cost more than these Sonys but there you go.These are ""on ear"" headphones so the foam pad sits directly on your outer ear.  That means the sound output is a half centimeter or so from your ear.That is also the downside to these phones.  Since the headphones are small and sit on your ear instead of over your ear they become very uncomfortable after an hour or so.  The foam padding is thin and soft enough so I can't determine exactly why these hurt my ears, but they definitely do.  I have a large head so maybe that's the problem, but after a while I can't bear to wear these anymore and I have to take them off.If you have a small head or don't wear them for a long time they're good.  They fold down compactly and are easy to transport so long as you're not rough with them."
"The headphones are comfortable, but you have to put the jack in JUST right or else they don’t work. I have to tinker with them quite a bit to get the sound to come through correctly, and then you can’t move around or they disconnect again. For $15 headphones, you really can’t complain too much, but it’s definitely frustrating when I can’t get them to work. The mic doesn’t work either, which is annoying because I bought them for work calls and have to use my laptop mic when I have them on."
"VOLUME SUFFERS AND IF THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE NOISE CANCELATION, WHERE IS IT? BUT IT SOUNDS GOOD, IT WOULD BE BETTER IF I COULD HAVE MORE VOLUME FOR M LAPTOP AND MY PlayStation."
Would not recommend these to anyone. They should not seperate from the head band and make them unusable. Very disappointed in this product and will not be getting anything else from you.
Got these because my wife wanted some wireless charging earbuds that were long lasting. By the way the Amazon ad is worded she thought these were wireless charging and they ARE NOT! That is a big disappointment for this purchase and I would not have got them had I caught that.Otherwise they are a really great sounding over the earbud and seem to be well made. We had ordered two but after finding out they didn't wireless charge I cancelled the 2nd one and found another that is very similar from another seller that actually IS WIRELESS CHARGING.
"Admittedly, I was dubious at the dramatic price reduction, but the reviews for these buds were very positive. And the cost was low, but then so were my inexpensive over-the-ears and they sound great. Sooo, I am very disappointed with the sound quality. Very tinny; no depth and no deep bass. These were once not inexpensive so it was reasonable to expect a full, rich sound. Perhaps mine are defective and I will contact customer service."
"For the price they are good, but not great sounding and not much bass.  Worth keeping for the pricing knowing I'm using them to work out, which is why I wanted the over the ear piece."
"I got a replacement. I spent HOURS trying to get the buds to connect and sync.NO ONE should have to work that hard to get a product to work.  THE Replacement didnt work either. They worked singular but would not pair up. I unpaired, and disconnected over eight times. Tried and tried but the replacement doesn't work. When I opened the bud holder, only one bud lit up. I removed them at same exact time. Waited for buds to connect with each other. They didn't.  I started over...still no sync. I tried holding power button together...5 seconds, 10 seconds,15 seconds,  20 seconds...nothing. Each ear bud working separately,  but not together.  I'm a teacher, teaching computer graphic design. I'm not a stranger to technology. I am ordering a different brand. Plus, this shipment was just put in a box. No bubblewrap or paper to cushion the product. The box was crushed, but the product seemed unscathed. I wish I could charge for my time of trying and trying to get them to work. Plus the time repacking,  using bubble wrap( even though the seller did not use bubble wrap), printing the labels, because there wasn't an offer for UPS to print label. Using large amount of packing tape to insure product safety.  Driving 18 miles to UPS facility.  Walking in with 2 canes...as I am disabled. Then getting a receipt from UPS, and driving 18 miles back home. I am not happy with the situation.  I would give a ZERO STAR if I could."
"I'm disappointed that this product falls short of my expectations but for its price I'll just call it a day. There is no noise cancellation and sound quality is average at best, but it works well for answering phone calls and I paid only 25 bucks so that makes it useful and I'll call it a day."
"Not noise cancelling any more than any other earbuds I have that simply fit tight enough to block out external sounds to some extent. Only 1 pair of ear tips which seem to be medium size, not the three sizes claimed. Severely lacking in bass. But good enough for my purpose, especially for $28 on Black Friday."
These earphones have a long battery life…but that’s the only good thing I can say about them. The sound quality is the WORST I’ve heard. I use them only to listen to news and event videos. Music is TERRIBLE. Are they defective? Or are they just awful?
"These earbuds don't work. It's as simple as that. They pair easily, but after a minute or so, the connection breaks up and will not re-establish itself. Re-pairing brings back a good connection, but again, it lasts less than a minute. I have done this repeatedly (the definition of insanity?). All this at a distance of a foot or so.This product is unacceptable. I can't recommend any other because a similarly-priced product behaved the same way. Although the manufacturer's name was different, they were packaged identically and had identical charging cases. Hm. . . .In any case, save yourself the trouble."
"It is terrible - static when it connects, no bass sound, hard to understand the words.  And, Amazon refused to allow me to return it because it has been opened and used.  I tried it for 10 minutes.  It was a completely loss.  Amazon's promise to return it in January is a lie - it is defective in my view and yet they don't replace it because it was used.  There was no to way it would be defective until I opened them and used them (even in a few minutes).  I will likely end my Prime membership given this shows we can't be trust."
No Sony Tv Bluetooth connection no
"Unable to properly pair to phone (Samsung Ultra 23s or my Mac Pro). My other blue tooth earbuds, which I loss recently, was cheaper (comparing regular price) and did not have pairing problems."
one side won't charge no matter on many times I restarted it and I watched your videos 4 times.
"Fits well but the sound is AWFUL, very tinny and a low hiss. Returning it immediately."
I have an iPhone and it does not connect properly. I have to manually connect. Everyone has a hard time hearing me.The only they’re good for is listening to any audio.
To expensive for not easy to use bad sound
Worked for the first two weeks and then one of them stopped working
"Stopped working within a month, not recommended"
"I wanted to get a pair of earbuds that were wireless because I was tired of the constraints and nuisances of wired, and headphones are uncomfortable and mess with my OCD too much.These seemed to posess all the features and qualities I was looking for, and it did deliver. I don't think that these are garbage, but I definitely don't think 40$ is a price befitting for cheap Dollar Store earbuds; I will explain what I mean.Firstly, the base sound profile - it's terrible. I am no audiophile, but I do have some standards. They are not drowned in mud like my previous Monster Achieve Airlinks, but still very flat and lacking body.The soundstage/spatial sound is decent; it fills the stereo appropriately, but don't expect to feel it project.The buds come with a companion app which allow you to use different EQ presets (my personal favorites are Piano or Accoustic, which help bring the sound up a bit). These presets also program into the buds, meaning if you connect them to your PC or another device, they will still retain the preset. My only gripe is that when you use solo bud mode (which I do a lot while at work for environmental awareness), it will not activate; you need to have both buds connected for it to activate, which to me makes no sense.The fit is something I cannot get really comment positively on. I have had these for a month and while the right bud is secure, I can never get the left one to secure, no matter how much I fasten it nor what eartip sizes I use. Though this may be a fault of my canal shape. The comfort otherwise is very good.Battery life is great. They come with a 10 hour charge and a case that holds up to 30 I believe.  I use these for work and then take them home and use them for my PC, which the buds are fully charged for by then.The touch controls are responsive, albeit difficult to get right as I can't always tap correctly due to not knowing where my finger is in relation to the bud (though this just may be a me thing). You can also change the taps/holds for one or both buds, amd program them to do different things - I like having single tap for play/pause, double-tap to skip forward, and long press for Assistant.The verdict in general - I think they are a decent humble pair of earbuds not trying to present themself as anything extraordinary,  however I would not recommend them for audiophiles, unless you love bass and know how to EQ to your preference."
"For me personally these earbuds are just okay. For the price they aren't too bad, but for me they're going to become a backup pair in case I need them.First off, the sound quality is pretty good in both mono and stereo mode and they charge quickly. But that's about all I like about them.Secondly, the call quality isn't great. I've been told it sounds like I'm ""under water"" and it's hard to hear me. When I change to another earbud the person on the other end notices a huge difference. Lately I've also had issues with AI answering services not recognizing my inputs so it might be part of that as well.Next, the range is much shorter than other earbuds and often will skip or disconnect when I move into another room. The touch controls, especially pause and fast forward, can be really annoying to use due to it not always registering your input and the fact that it takes about 5 seconds to skip ahead 10 seconds. The touch controls can also be TOO sensitive which leads to it pausing or just beeping in your ears without you intentionally touching them. They hate hats and other head coverings! I primarily use earbuds to listen to podcasts and audiobooks, so having these finicky controls is not ideal for my needs.Are they the worst earbuds ever? No. They're okay. But they're not great either especially for what I use them for. I have since purchased a different earbud from the same company (p3i) that has actual buttons that is MUCH better for my needs!!"
I’ve had these for close to a month now & I’m a bit disappointed. I’ve tried countless earbuds & was hoping this pair would be better than the others but unfortunately that’s not the case. While they do have really good sound for playing music audiobooks podcasts etc they are horrible for phone calls which is mainly what I needed them for to begin with. On my end the call is clear & perfectly fine but for the caller it’s loud & they can hear EVERYTHING in the background but me unless I’m in a room that is quiet or in my car with the radio off. At first I thought it was just this one person & possibly their phone but I’ve heard the same complaint from numerous callers across all brands or types of phones. It’s annoying to say the least & frustrating when I’m told to call them back later when it’s quiet or I’m forced to take it off Bluetooth in order to finish the call. I’m on the road all day so that’s usually not an option. If you’re just needing earbuds to play music or listen to books these are great but if you need to take calls make sure your in a quiet area or apparently the callers ears will be blown up by the background noise.
"Update: The vendor spontaneously reached out to me and offered a full refund, surprisingly WITHOUT asking me to edit my review. 5 stars for customer service, I'm bumping my review up one star. The buds sound fine, with the functional limitations noted below that make them less optimal to me, but might be OK with you. (I actually found that my old style -Life P2- are still available, and just purchased a pair: i like the brand, and the customer service appears second to none!)Over the years, i've purchased 5 pairs of Soundcore BT earbuds, and have managed to lose all of them, save one last survivor. I really like my old ones, but they're not available anymore, so I bought these new ones, trusting they would be as good if not better... wrong. The sound is fine (especially since i mostly listen to audiobooks), they fit as well as the old model, and i can use only one individually, to effectively double my listen time when away for charging options. But --a) the ""tap"" controls are awful: it takes me dozens of tries to get my book or music to pause, or start again,b) there's no way to completely turn them off without placing them back in the charging station. I used to just take one bud with me, drive or bike to work or wherever, just turned it off with one long press on the control button when arrived at my destination, and turn them back one a few hours later when heading home with still lots of battery left: not possible anymore unless i pack the charging pod with me, an unnecessary & PITA step.c) i've used them for over a week now, and i've had _several_ instances of them connecting to my phone when the buds are stored in the charging pod... :-|So -- good buds for the price, but be aware of those 3 backwards limitations, if they matter to you as they do to me. I bought 2 pairs, knowing i'm going to misplace some of the buds soon, but will return one pair and look for another alternative: i can live with remembering to take the charging pod everywhere i go, but the lackluster pause function and random connections are very frustrating."
"Extremely comfortable. I’ve worn them all day with no soreness. (The Tozo T20 is as good.) My AirPod 3’s hurt after 3 hours, these are much better. Really good sound regardless of the price. Good bass, which my hard AirPods could not reproduce with the lack of a rubber tip. Pairing is super easy. When talking on the phone, the other party has no problem hearing your voice clearly. Now the bad. 1) The case. Who designed this? Did someone set out to make the most slippery case possible? Success! Without the leash this thing would slip out of your fingers constantly. Fail. 2)Clamshell form. Combined with the slippery finish, almost impossible to open without being EXTREMELY careful. And given the case is so round everywhere, there’s no place to hold on to it. Also needs a bigger/deeper indent at the body/top split. 3)Charge LEDs. Or lack of. One on the front of the case is all you get. When do I charge my case? What level the buds are at? 4)EQ. Not a major issue, but the pre-set EQ choices are just silly. You’ll use the one on your phone instead. Sound quality and comfort is great, but I don't think enough to overcome missing features. We'll give them 1 more week."
"First Impression/unboxing. My first pair of SoundCore earbuds. I love the presentation of the item. Graphics and information on the box. Everything was nicely packaged. The contents consisted of the earbuds and case, 1x USB-C cord, and a manual.Breakdown:-Body/Quality. Flawless design. Made from sturdy plastic! It doesn’t feel cheap which always makes me feel better.-App. One of my most favorite things about using the earbuds is the app! It enhances the usefulness of the earbuds. Besides being able to change the equalizer, you can also customize the taps/holds to what you want! You can customize it to when you use 2 earbuds or even just 1 earbud.-Functionality/features. Bluetooth 5.3, IPX5, 10mm dynamic driver, up to 2 hours charge time, able to use the earbuds upwards of 10 hours and 30 hours with the charging case. And has fast charging; 10 mins of charge gets you 2 hours of playtime. Controls are done by a series of taps or holds.-Performance/Results. I had mixed results. First of all, fitment was good, comfortable for me, and this is coming from someone who normally has issues with earbuds staying in my ears. It paired up easy. BUT I found that it kept pausing my shows or music, I had no idea why. Then from listening to the beeps and seeing what it was doing to my phone, I found that it kept disconnecting from my phone, then reconnects. It was all happening randomly. I own SEVERAL pairs of earbuds and wireless headsets, and none of them have ever had this issue. I unpaired it previously, and paired it back (but didn’t reset the earbuds), didn’t fix the issue. I chalked it up to a faulty set, so I returned it and received a new set. Well, once again, the same issue. I am going to try again to reset it. Its unfortunate because I actually really like the earbuds, but for how many times it disconnects is pretty annoying.Also, when trying to reach out to customer service using the app, I couldn’t get ahold of anyone since there was no option to select “P20i”. I guess its too new of an item.I tried using these in the gym during a 2-hour workout. Fitment wise, these did pretty good, every other set, I had to readjust them, 1x time one of them almost fell out. But that’s still pretty good for me, keep in mind, I haven’t changed out the silicone pieces, usage outside of the gym, the original silicone pieces fit good. The volume and sound quality are great. The issue was the disconnection that happened continuously which got old really quick. Odd occurrence, I was using a different set of wireless headphones, all of a sudden, my music randomly stopped. I looked at my phone and it said it connected to the P20i, even though, it was in its case and fully seated. This happened twice, after each time, I opened up the case, and reseated the earbuds, then it stopped.SummaryI’m in a weird position because I love these, but the performance with the disconnection is annoying. The app and performance of audio quality was good. There’s no reason why you should have to go through extra steps of unpairing/pairing, and resetting the earbuds. And once again, I have never had any issues like this with any other brand (JBL, soundpeats, Edifier, ADV, random/no names, and boltunes). I can’t say I would recommend these until  this issue is solved."
"These are the first pair of detached bluetooth earbuds I have ever owned.  previously, my earbuds have always been connected to each other by a cord, which made them convenient to hang around my neck when I couldn't use them.  But after going through four pairs of earbuds in 3 years, I wanted to try something different but didn't want to spend an arm and a leg.  I found these on Black Friday and thought it was worth a shot.  After more than two weeks of using them, here are the things I like and dislike about them:Likes:1.  They turn on automatically when you take them out of the case.  With my old earbuds, you had to press and hold the play/pause button to activate and I didn't always remember if I had already turned them on.  Now, if they're out of the box, I know they're on.2.  They charge automatically whenever they're in their case.  If I'm not using them, they're almost always in there, which means they'll be charged when I want to use them again.  With my old earbuds, they would usually hang around my neck when not in use and of course the battery would continue to drain.  This meant that if I had a heavy usage day, they'd be screaming ""low battery"" at me before I was ready to stop listening and I would have to plug them in for at least an hour or two to get them charged.Dislikes:1. Comfort.  The ear tips don't do much to make them comfortable to wear.  I've tried all three sizes of the silicone tips that come with the buds and I also ordered a 3 size set of memory foam tips.  None of them made them super comfortable to wear, but one of the memory foam ones make them less uncomfortable than the others.  All the same, I find myself taking them out after awhile because they do become uncomfortable.2. The touch control features don't always work right.  With my previous buds, I could pause my music and turn the volume up or down with actual buttons on the cord.  I almost never had to press the pause button more than once to get them to work.  The touch control features are not as reliable.  I originally had the play/pause command as one tap, but if I happened to take my bud out and accidentally touched the area, my music or audiobooks would inadvertently turn back on.  So, I switched it to two taps.  Now I have to double tap my bud 2-3+ times before it will successfully pause anything; which is not ideal when you're pausing whatever you're listening to in order to hear what someone is saying.Bottom line, they're not the best earbuds in the world in terms of comfort and functionality, but their pluses might outweigh their minuses depending on what you value.  I'll keep using these for now until another option presents themselves."
"I thought I liked these at first, the sound is good, however, people can’t really hear me in the phone, and they are very bulbous and don’t really want to stay in my ear. These may be suited for a man’s ear, but my girl ears aren’t deep enough out something and they don’t want to stay in, especially if I’m not sitting or standing. I can’t really lay back and relax. I wish I could return them but it says it’s past my window. I’m going to try anyways."
"These earbuds are great if you are only going to use them to listen to music/videos, etc.  If you plan to use them for calling then keep shopping.  You can hear your caller just fine, the problem is your caller cannot hear you over all the background noise these ear buds pick up.  Also, Amazon changed the price on these to make them appear to be on sale.  Regular retail is only $24.99."
"Let me start with the positives. These are some of the most comfortable earbuds I’ve worn. Well cushioned and can be worn for a long time with no discomfort.The audio is well designed and comes through exceptionally clear. It’s easy switching from podcasts to music and keep the audio quality strong.My big issue is that there is a consistent Bluetooth interference whenever I’m in a moderately populated area. Walking down a city street or waiting in the train station, one or both earbuds will stop sharing sound. It’s really difficult to give these earbuds a higher rating when this is something I know is going to happen when I leave the house.The accompanying app also is a huge plus. It’s great to have many options for EQs and to be able to customize the “tap” controls."
"These have pretty good sound quality. Not very good range. At about 20 feet, they start cutting out. The most annoying thing is they are supposed to be able to push the note on them to pause and then to continue with another push and somehow skip forward. I've been able to make that work twice in about a 100 tries. I get beeps but they do nothing most of the time."
"One of the most reliable brands out there I have like 10 pairs of earbuds for every everyday use depending on what I’m doing that’s what dictates which pair I’m using, this pair did not disappoint at all, it’s cheap but not in a bad way, affordable would be the best word, it sounds decent and the quality of the product is what gets me every time, top notch quality 👌"
"These were a replacement for some others that were a nodule type bud where I dropped one and it blew the bitty speaker bits in it, so anyway, I thought I'd try these. I was interested in the little drop piece on the outside like air buds, wondering if it might make them more user friendly...quite the opposite. They would get hooked on stuff or I'd catch them with my hands when tucking my hair or something and would get knocked out of place or fall out. Idk how y'all do it with those air buds, lol.I ended up buying some jlabs that I really like now, so these are just backups for me now.Sound quality:The got the job done, but nothing spectacular. They have an app so you have a few different equipment setting options, but I wasn't too impressed with the performance of any of them, tbh.Pros:- One good thing about the app is that you could change the quick settings to your preference, so if you wanted to pause with a single tap, or a long touch, you could change all that how you like, or how you're used to doing already. That's what I did, and set them up to mimic my last pair, which was probably my favorite feature.- I also liked the colors and the little case they came in with the little lanyard."
"Have had these for about a month.  I use them when i travel and also when i run.  Generally like the earbuds, but they will fairly frequently disconnect from Bluetooth and won't reconnect for several minutes.  They disconnect on two different devices so it appears the earbuds are the problem.  Not worth returning given the price I paid.  Just a bit disappointing."
"For listening to music these are just fine for the price point. They're comfortable, not heavy, and seem to be decently constructed.The mic quality, however, is absolute butt. It seems to me that it picks up everything BUT your voice. Nobody listening to you will be able to hear you outside of background noise.TLDR: Great for music, bad for talking."
Would I buy another one even though it's only $20? No.Is the sound quality surpass $20? Yes!For some reason the right side of the earbud keeps popping out when I'm working out.  I thought it was just my ears but saw some reviews of the same problem. If this wasn't the case it would definitely be a high five stars. Unless you are walking or just sitting around then you'll be fine. If you're jogging or lifting weights good luck. Another thing about this is if it can go up just one more notch louder it would be perfect but what can I say it's only $20.I would probably return if I kept the Box and use this money and triple it for a higher quality headset to be honest.
"I like the sound and design for it. Unfortunately, I lost one of my earbuds the first day I used it at work. It has great connection but be careful if you use it. It has moderately EMF frequencies which poses a health risk for long use. I'd recommend if you don't care but if so maybe try a different brand."
"So it is supposed to connect immediately to the source and it started out doing that, but now it makes me put BOTH buds back in the container and take them back out again for it to activate and turn on.Having said that,Everything else I like about these. I've had a few now and more annoying ones will loudly announce YOO HABA INCOMIN CAH over and over with no gap in between nonstop, this is just a subtler phone call notification sound. Nice. Also the sound to notify you that it is connecting is nice. These feel great and don't move, the middle size fits perfectly and I like that you can switch ears and wear the left one in the right ear etc without them falling out.The charger light flashes green when it is charging, flashes white when it is very low battery. Each come with a mini lanyard attached to the bud case. They charge quickly. The battery lasts a long time, all day, at least eight hours the last time I checked. I go to sleep with these in and I actually wake up with them, no problem with comfort and the battery lasted all night from full charge. Really love that.But this connectivity issue is annoying so I will keep one and try to find a replacement for the second pair that I got. They have to connect otherwise what's the point? But I still recommend these. Maybe I just got a dud pair. Overall, a good purchase."
"Sound is great from these! My only complaint is that they just don’t stay in my ear. I’ve tried all three provided rubber tips and I think it’s a design thing. Especially if you’re being active while using, you need something that will stay in your ear better. Hopefully, Anker can figure that out, because it’s annoying."
i looovveee the sound quality and the battery life but one of the earbuds will stop working within 2 months which makes them unusable after that for me. i have to have both in my ears or nothing. so these really aren’t any better than other earbuds but i keep buying them cause they’re cheap.
"My wireless earbuds before these were Skullcandy Jib True, and as fine as they were, they pressed on my ear so much it hurt after a while. I bought these thinking this shape would be better, since it didn't seem to all be packed in the area right on the ear, but it hurts the same way.Apart from that, these sound pretty fine. Though they never feel like they're securely in my ear, unlike wired earbuds I usually use. The controls are touch sensitive, so I disabled them to prevent accidental commands. I like the shape of the holding case, and how easily the earbuds snap into it magnetically."
"I never write reviews but wanted to on these.. these work fine if you’re indoors but i walk outside a lot where it’s windy and  these do NOT work while I’m walking outside. Constant static, starting/stopping, losing connection. I can only figure maybe the wind is somehow pushing the buttons."
I love them because there are loud and compatible with apple devices. But my only issue is if i move a certain way they will fall out of my ears . And I’ve tried all of the cushions they still fall out.
"Well, I really liked these the 9 days they worked well. I use earbuds with my computer pretty much all day for listening to music or while gaming. The sound was not great out of the box, but with a couple of tweaks in my Windows audio settings (enhancements), they were perfect. I love how long the batter life is. The earbuds I currently use [from 2 other brands] only last 2 and 4 hours. Getting 10 hours out of these Soundcore P20i earbuds has been a boon. I do find that I'm constantly accidentally touching the sensitive touch pad found on the upper outside parts, so am regularly having to adjust the volume due to this. Overall, based on this experience alone, I would give these a 4.5/5 stars.Last night, however, while changing out earbuds after my other pair died and needed recharging, these suddenly weren't pairing correctly, got super choppy and kept disconnecting from the bluetooth as if I had gone to the other side of the house (even though I was still sitting right in front of my computer). Today, not only is the sound still choppy, the left earbud won't stay paired to anything or pair at all, and the sound is really low in the right earbud now. I tried all of the usual troubleshooting. As others have stated, there is really no easy way to reset these (no button), and unpairing/re-pairing and conducting tests across multiple devices did not resolve the issue - it remains the same. Since I'm still within the return window, I will be returning this set and try a different pair. Based on the other reviews I've seen, though, this seems to be a regular issue."
"I shouldn't complain about the exterior box feeling like it's cheap plastic, because you pay a low price and you don't get the grand package. However, I can't complain about the earbuds either falling out, or constantly feeling like there about to"
"Over all it’s nice the Battery is durable , giving it 3 star because I  can’t wear this for a longer period of time because my ear hurts may be because, the ear buds are too big"
They work you can connect it to your device they look good on the outside. But they aren't good quality at all sound goes in and out all the time and the mic is kinda meh
I tried all the tips that came with it and it just falls out of my ear so easily that I can't use these. Sound quality is decent when I tried them.
"HONEST REVIEW: During specific/certain higher pitches, my left ear bud will make a clacking/ticking sound like something is loose on the inside. Not sure what compound is used to hold things together but, it seems it may not be assembled properly. Whether it's a sort of epoxy or solder, it doesn't seem to have held up quite good either from production or miss-handling during shipping. I also didn't receive small, medium and large sized fittings. I only have small, large and large hahah.These ear buds sit just outside the ring of your ear canal, so the noise cancellation may not be what you're looking for, or it may be perfect for ya! Unfortunately they come loose in my ear way too easily and I’m CONSTANTLY fiddeling with them to get them in a comfortable spot, the design just doesnt work to keep them in my ear very well. I would honestly say they block between 40%-50% of the noise, depending on your ear shape. My previous pair blocked about 65%-85% which is what I'm in the market for.Ultimately these are a solid product of what you're buying them for, just that I genuinely enjoy the technicalities of my purchases. Though I won't be returning them because for the price, quality of sound, touch features, simplicity, case design, quick Bluetooth connectivity and battery span, I'd be a fool to! Overall a decent pair!"
"Microphone quality is poor, have had several complaints from others on my cellphone calls that I sound like I'm 'talking into a tin can' or the microphone is overwhelmed by mild wind noise.  These are also not very comfortable for my ears, compared to more expensive earbuds (but that is acceptable at this price point). If I had known the call-quality would be so poor, I would not have purchased.  Also, these earbuds do not 'pause' podcasts, etc when you remove one earbuds, which is an annoyance."
"I did not realize that these earbuds can only be used with my smartphone, as opposed to other devices, likechromebooks and tv's i have with bluetooth capabilities."
"These have a fantastic sound and rich bass, but on calls it picks up every background sound so whomever you are calling can't hear you over it."
"I like the look of the case; earbuds sit nicely and are easy to take out and place back. Strong magnet for docking into the case for charging. Plus the material of the headphones and everything else feels well. Nicely assembled.But out of the box I have pairing issues. Both earbuds are at 90% battery. The audio on the left headphone goes in and out intermittently. There's no real cause for this issue. I Checked the app and firmware up to date and tried to unpair and repair it again, but there was no change. Kind of thing that will drive you crazy. I'm going to give these earbuds 24 hours to self-heal and improve.The bass and audio quality are good for on-sale headphones, but if the pairing issue doesn't resolve, I'll have to return this set. May go up to the next model in the SoundCore series. Stay tuned 👀"
"1. Why would earphones need a start up sound…..It’s not a tv… so everytime it takes forever to start playing your music or hear someone cuz you gotta spend 2 seconds hearing start up chime then the connection beep (it has already connected the second it came out the case so the startup is what’s taking foreve)2. If you have one earphone in don’t even think abt putting the other in  your pocket…..it’ll start glitching the song or audio (I’m assuming it’s not very good at differentiating between the phones Bluetooth and the pairing between the two earbuds)3. Just nitpicking but the low battery warning sound sounds ugly 💀💀4. That’s it tbh it was $20 so it sounds great for the price, battery lasts from yesteryear to new millennia so no complaints there. All in all it’s great just those two issues grind me gears every now and then."
The right units stop working after 3 month. You can see it on the phone bluetooth list but no sound.
"This is great for listening to music and sound quality is great , love the case and battery life is good however it is terrible for taking calls it amplifies everything in the background and it zones you out - only flaw for me.I bought two and both have the same issue oh amplifying back ground noise and zoning you out.Otherwise it’s good and pairs easily ."
With the earbuds would turn off once placed in the case but they stay on till u turn blue together
This is really good and comfortable easy to use you won't remember that it's in your ears 😉
Bummed out this has terrible connectivity to the Bluetooth I have to par then everything I need to used them.
"These earbuds are only $20 for a reason... Let me just say that I really wanted to like these because of the brand. Before these earbuds I had a pair of Soundcore Life P2 earbuds that I loved and had for at least 3 years with no issues until the last few months I used them. I just assumed the issues were coming up because they were a few years old and it was time to replace them. But after my experience with this model, I don't even really know anymore.I picked these P20i earbuds for the brand and the price. The first day I used them, no issues at all and they sounded great. The 2nd day I tried to use them, (which was the 3rd day of me owning them), I started having connection issues. Over the course of my shift at work they kept randomly disconnecting and then re-connecting after a few seconds all throughout the day.I have had these for a couple weeks now, and keep trying to use them but it has gotten progressively worse. They started taking longer and longer to connect, then it was saying they are connected and you can see the music playing but don't hear anything. When I finally got the sound going, even with the volume all the way up, the sound was very low. Then today no amount of charging, factory resetting the earbuds, ""forgetting"" the device on Bluetooth and re-adding them would get them to pair and connect. I really have been trying for hours today to get them working with no results.I don't even normally bother doing reviews on anything, but after this I'm just so irritated. I have looked all over the internet for possible solutions, and have seen that this is a fairly common issue for at least this model from Soundcore, so I just feel like the reviews on here are misleading, and wanted to add to the people that are on here telling you not to waste your time and money with these earbuds. I'm not saying Soundcore in general is bad, but maybe try a model that costs a little more? My original earbuds were like $40 or $50 if I remember correctly, and like I said I really did not have any issues until the end, after several years of use. So I want to say maybe this really is just a case of ""you get what you pay for"", and these earbuds are just not the way to go."
Hello I would like to exchange for  a  new pair the left one doesn't work
"I've been using these earbuds for about 3 months now, and the right one just stopped working."
Sometimes they won't connect but I like the design & they are easy to use & lightweight
There are decent quality but get the job done and are waterproof
"I bought these to replace a really inexpensive pair I purchased a couple of years ago. I expected these to be a better quality based on the brand but that is not the case. I'm starting to have problems charging these. The green light on the case indicates that they are fully charged but I receive Bluetooth messages stating that they have 10% power after being charged. Sometimes one ear bud will charge and the other one doesn't. Also, they are constantly falling out of my ears. They came with three different sizes of fittings but I have the problem no matter which size I use. The next time,  I'll replace these with a higher rated no-name brand."
These headphones have pretty decent sound quality. I use them mainly to listen to audio books. The range on them isn't the greatest. And people complain that when talking to me on the phone I sound muffled. But they get the job done i can listen to my books or podcasts and still be productive.
"Really liked them, especially for the price.  Have started at times to have a split second delay between the two buds.  Can be a pain when using for meetings on my laptop.  Have to take one out.Sometimes when I then put it back it works fine, but not always."
"During my experience using the headphones, the left earbud often cuts out. Additionally they earbuds lose timing with each other and then one headphone will be on a 2-3 second delay from the other.Overall the sound quality isnt bad and the battery life has been pretty decent."
"Purchase the set of these to replace a set that was stolen. I have numerous sound core products, including four speakers. The set that was stolen was perfect and had been for some time. I had the life a3is, so I used the same model from amazon, they were defective out of the box. Knowing I was getting a refund from Amazon I purchased another pair while returning the first pair. Amazon customer service screwed me over. Apparently you now have to pay an $8 return fee if they pick it up at your house. If the ship you a label by mail it's a $1 fee. The second set was also defective. I threw them away not going to hassle with customer service again it's not worth my time. Got this pair instead. Paired up right away, works exactly as it should, but the sound quality is not as good as my old ones. I will eventually repurchase my old ones, but not from Amazon. Walmart has them for about the same price, and Walmart won't charge me to return it defective item on for only 48 hours. I've already paused my Amazon Prime and canceled my Amazon music. I believe Walmart plus is a better deal, Walmart's and no hassle return policy, and I'll go to Pandora plus from my music."
"Sound quality is OK, mic is pretty good and touch controls work well but these developed pairing issues after about 5 months. They would struggle to connect and even when connected sometimes there would be no sound.Pairing is also a challenge when you want to use with another device. I also wish these could pair buds individually to different devices like I could with other brand.I had a beat up pair from the other brand that still worked and never gave issues after years of use. Lost those 😔Using these made me crave wired headphones.I would not recommend these, spend a little more and get something better."
"Fitting is not good , they fall out easily"
Occasional audio de-sync between left and right buds or volume mismatch.  Don't take telephone calls with these if there's any amount of background noise since it'll pick all that up better than your voice.  Otherwise okay if just listening to music while working or doing chores.
"Pros• For around $20, I consider these earbuds a very good price for the quality.• This is my first pair of wireless earbuds so sound and quality appear great. The earbuds do their jobCons• The touch controls are clunky. For example, when attempting to lower volume during phone call or virtual meeting, I inadvertently disconnected the phone call / virtual meeting. Or maybe I don't know what I'm doing?• These are not multi-point earbuds so you cannot seamlessly transition from phone to computers (I have 3). You must manually reconnect to each device, which is disappointing. However, for the price, it is reasonable this feature is not included.• If earbuds are not connected to your phone, you cannot see battery status on the website page (on computer). That is, you can only view battery status through the phone app AND ONLY when connected to your phone. The phone app offers no battery status when earbuds are not connected to phone. You do receive an aural ""battery low"" warning but you don't know how much percent or time you have remaining until it disconnects on you. So, if you are trying to train your battery and/or maximize the life of each charge, it is only possible when connected to phone and using the phone app.• Same thing with the Equalizer. You can only see and adjust the Equalizer if you're connected to your phone and only view on the phone app. You cannot view equalizer when accessing your account through the website on your computer.• There is no way to view when the charging case needs to be charged, which means you would have to be motivated to count / keep track of the advertised hours of charging the charging case provides.While I gave 4 stars for sound and battery life, which are great, for the Cons listed above, I gave an overall score of 3 stars. I also use other Anker products, in general, like the quality for price, and intend to continue purchasing Anker products and remain brand loyal."
"Things I like about this is it's sleek design and it does seem to have noise cancelling abilities. However, it is really hard to connect these earbuds especially if it's mid-video call. It connects but there's no sound."
"It’s not the best pair of earbuds I’ve owned but it’s definitely ok. It cuts in and out some times when jour iron my back pocket while sitting down. Other than that, it has great battery life"
"These ear buds have pretty good sound quality, but the mics pick up and magnify even the smallest background noises on calls.I liked the ""lost my ear bud"" feature and being able to customize the controls.However the mics pick up way too much background noise on calls and it's problematic. The person I'm trying to talk to on the other end can't hear me for all the noise.I've tried calls in many settings and had problems, which is a deal breaker for me. I'll be returning these for another set of Anker earbuds."
"Decent, but they got stolen."
"The quality of the earbuds is great, especially for the price.Only problem is when they are closed up IN their charging case, they'll connect to the phone, overriding an existing Bluetooth connection. Very frustrating!"
"The sound quality isn't bad for the price, but they don't stay in my ears, and the sound quality degrades rapidly even when they start sliding out of the ear just a little bit.  Trying to press them back into the ears ends up skipping to the next song.  Overall a bit frustrating to use.  For about the same price I was able to get another pair  of ear buds with an ear loop, and those stay in the ears.  These will be a backup pair..."
"I've used a pair of Anker soundcore life note E earbuds for over a year now & they have been great. So I decided to try this model out since it's a newer model & has app support. After just a few minutes of using them I packed them back up & processed a return.  My Life note E's have great range & I can leave my phone laying anywhere downstairs in our house & roam around talking with no problem. With the P20i's They started losing connection as I walked into only the next room. This is unacceptable to me. The sound was good with them when the connection was strong, but I just couldn't do it with them giving less range performance than my old Life note E's.  I also prefer the size/shape of the Life note E's case...it fits well into a pocket without getting in the way too much. Also the P20i case does not have the 3 LED's on it like the Life note E case does which allows you to determine the amount of charge its battery has remaining. The only plus with the P20i case over the Life note E's case is the tether string, which the older model does not have.  Even though they were a few dollars more, I went ahead & ordered a pair of Soundcore Life P2 Mini's, since I read that they are the same as the Life note E's(just the version of them made for Amazon)....I hope they're right about that!"
I had a similar pair before and loved them but I’m so disappointed with this pair. The left bud works like 60% of the time. It’s so frustrating
"Purchased in May and these had done well. The call quality is decent and sound is pretty good. After 3 months it stopped charging, worked after cleaning the contacts on the earbuds and the case. 4 months later the left one is not holding a charge as long. They still last through the night and for a few more hours after, and quality is good, so you will get a good amount of use from these. Updating 4 1/2 months later and it only charged to 50% after a full day of being in the case AND being plugged into a charger."
"The first pair of wireless earbuds that I purchased from Anker were the Life P2 series and I loved them. They sound great and still work without a hitch despite every day use for the last couple of years. Deciding to upgrade I went with these based on reviews I’d read on line. Slightly smaller, more features, great sound (using the app is a breeze when finding the right sound profile) —- great purchase, right? Not really. I returned the first pair due to the right earpiece dropping out randomly and then reconnecting, plus they wouldn’t hold a charge that lasted four hours.  For context I use these on my daily commute (an hour each way) and maybe an hour every day during break time. When not in use - back into the case. No more than four hours before I was getting the battery low warning. Time to send them back.Got my replacement pair in good time, fully charged them and off we go. Nope. Same issue. Randomly dropping on one side, losing connection with certain apps (Audible being the most likely, but occasionally with iTunes and YouTube as well) and still won’t hold a charge for more than a few hours. I’ve updated the firmware and reset them multiple times as suggested on the Anker website as well as a few troubleshooting sites I’ve looked at. No change. As of now, they sit as a backup pair (shame, these really are nice earbuds) and I honestly can’t recommend them as a purchase."
"I gave it 3 STARS, because they work fine while I'm close to my LAPTOP and I can listen to music and news,and that was the main purpose for buying them and they work ok but once I move a few meters away, reception is no good!!.So again, these are entry level headphones are OK for the price;But if you want to listen to high quality music then you better buy APPLE or something else, more expensive.."
"The sound quality is good but they won't stay in ears. You'll have to keep pushing them in every so often which is a little frustrating. I've tried all of the ear bud sizes that it comes with with no success. I would not recommend these ear buds for anything that requires movement like walking or exercising. Again, the sound is good and call quality is good. Others may have better success with the buds staying in the ear."
"They don’t have great noise canceling abilities, they get the job done though.An annoying thing these do is, even if you aren’t actively trying to use these, if the case runs out of battery, the headphones turn on and they automatically connect to your phone. I have to go through my Bluetooth setting at least a handful of times a day to manually disconnect them.They’re ok for the price point, probably wouldn’t buy them again once they die."
"These have great sound for the price.  Too bad I only had them about a month before they stopped charging.After original post, seller reached out and sent replacement.  Excellent customer service.  Hopefully these last."
Stopped working after about a month of use. Not sure why. Case still lights up to charge but no sound on any device.
"These are not expensive and they were fantastic when I first bought them. I was impressed by the sound quality and the length of time they held its charge. After a month of owning them, I’ve noticed that after taking them off the power cord, within a few minutes of wear, I get an alert that says there’s a low battery, I can still use the headphones but the intermittent message about low battery is annoying."
"As far as headphones to listen to music, they’re ok. A bit muddy and it’s not high end sound, but hey, they were $20. My only true gripe is how they function for phone calls. No one can hear me and there are complaints that my voice goes in and out and there is a lot of background noise. But as a second cheap pair to have on hand for music, they’re ok."
I bought these mainly for calls but the sound quality is poor. Keep getting complaints that Im not being heard clearly
Pairing was easy. My thing is I need to be able to change the next song fast and easy. These headphones do that well. I am not so much into the sound reduction because when to change the song you push the earbud farther into the ear. Witch really cuts out the background sound. There not to bad sound is good. Wish it had the charging percentage on the case.
These arrive today to replace my dead Jabra's. I got to say these have a very nice sound quality to them and they fit nicely. But the problem i having with them are stability issues. I will be listening to my music and then they will cut out few times during the coarse of the song. In they fix this issue these will be some great ear buds.
"Both headphones won't sync properly, have to use them one side at a time, bit of a bummer"
Returned product because they were just too large and kept falling out of my ears
The headphones are very good for listening to music but talking to people on the phone I had an issue where my friend kept asking what I was saying as if I was cutting out or something. I will definitely keep them for the gym but I would not recommend if you like to talk on the phone everyday.
"I don’t like this product, after some time the quality of sound not good"
"Well I love anker but this but this one is just ok.  I bought it because I work by myself so I listen to audio books. The battery life is great, no problem with that.  The sounds works for books, don't know about music because I don't really listen to music.  The problem is when I get phone calls.  If I'm inside it's soso, but outside just horrible. The mics pickup every single noise there is and I have to cancel the bluetooth and go to speaker which kind of defeats the purpose.  I will keep them because I really just use them for the books. But I don't recommend them for phone calls."
"Received as promised. These earbuds feel and sound very good. However, i gave a 3 star rating as the right side stopped charging after just 3 days of use. All efforts were made to address this problem as recommended by the manufacturer (cleaning contacts, resetting and firmware update)."
They have good sound but they aren’t the best for those who have VERY small ears. Mine wouldn’t stay in my ears when I tried on all three sizes of silicone earbud covers. Over all if you have “normal” or larger ears I would say it’s worth it to try it.
It has good sound but the battery dies quickly.
Between walking and jogging I put in 40 miles a week. These headphones work great except when I am on a call. They say AI for good call sound but they don't have noise canceling and people can't hear me if cars go by on the road.
The sound is very clear but it is not smooth.
They're really nice but they will drop the call like disconnect and then it whoever you're talking to you will hear over your phone and you won't hear over the the earbuds other than that they sound great and they work great...
Sound quality is pretty much what I expected.  The bass is pretty decent . Only issue is there is no noise isolation because of which all the background noise can be easily heard so it can’t be used in noisy spaces
"Fit is OK but have to tuck them in tight otherwise will fall out. Bass is marginal at best.Pairing was not as automatic so scan the User Manual to see the details if yours do not pair.For the price, they are OK."
Love the quality and feel of the headphones. Only thing to watch out for is that you may be missing the USB cable in your box. It doesn't kill it for me cause basically everything is USB-C these days
"the sound quality is ok, it’s on par with what you pay for. my main complaint is i’ve only had these for a couple months, and the right one has stopped charging entirely, so it no longer works. :("
"I purchased it specifically for taking work calls while at university or away from home, and the sound quality is good. However, the microphone is not up to par. My friend's Chinese earpods have better microphones."
"If your looking for earbuds that are noise canceling or high volume,  these aren't them.  As a contractor,  most my tool's decibels will exceed the earbusds maximum volume.  If they're used in a quiet environment,  they will deliver a reasonably good sound with surprisingly decent bass. When i tried usung then for a call, i was asked if i was on speaker or standing too far away from my phone. They connect without any issue and haven't had connectivity issues as some do when one gets more than a few feet away from their phone."
"3.5⭐️After the end of a pair of regular AirPods and then  gen 2 AirPod pros  I decided I was done with Apple headphones. I really didn’t want to drop a ton of money until I could do some research and spend a more around Black Friday.What I liked:They don’t fall out, a constant problem with the AirPod pros for my small earsI’m not supper picky on sound but they sounded better than I was expecting.Battery life is excellent.Cons:Phone call quality was not greatCase does feel a little cheap"
"Pros: size of the earbuds and charging case, lanyard, noise canceling, excellent sound quality, portability, doesn’t fall out of your earsCons: hurts my eardrum, buttons difficult to operate, no display indicating how much battery life on charging case, so tight that you have to physically remove earbuds to hear someoneOverall: while Anker did an excellent job making a very compact, portable and high quality sounding earbuds, these particular ones are just not for me.  Earbuds shouldn’t be this painful.  Maybe some of the other Anker earbuds might be better suitable for me.."
Quality is good
"At this point I am happy they STAY in my ears even after talking and eating at lengths.  Too many have popped right out and one has been lost.Trying a pair with a cord caused me too many issues. They ALL sounded as I am told, as if I were in a tunnel.  Or very far away.  At least I can report that sister and one friend tell me.I am having a hard time learning which, side gets the two longer bong than the right to tell them/they who to call. This or that or that or this.I wish the case and ear pieces were not slippery.  The case seems to have mind of its own were it not for the cord attached to its so slippery back.  Uh side other side?"
"Opened them up and charged them for 30 minutes. I was listening to music, and it was such a great sound. It has better treble height and bass low end than my old pair. Then I made a phone call and got this weird echo. The headphones were getting feedback from itself and causing evil hissing and buzzing. I had to turn the volume down, and it went away, but I couldn't hear the call well. It's so great for music and movies, but it could be better with the mic on!"
"Fit good,  sound is good but no app function.On the Amazon page they make it seem as though the app works with buds,  They don’t!"
"I bought these earbuds because I am part of a meditation class on Zoom. The speakers on my 8-year-old Mac are shot, and I wanted to hear the voices of the teachers well, hence the purchase of the earbuds. They work find with music that is a constant sound. In the class, after a short time of listening to speaking, I hear some static. After a short period of silence, an obviously required part of a meditation class, the earbuds shut off, so when the teacher begins speaking again, I see lips moving and hear nothing. When I sought support, the phone number listed says there are no support people for the P20i product, and recommends emailing anchor.com. When I did that, the email came back as undeliverable. It seems there is essentially no support other than the basics of setting up and turning the earbuds off and on. The ""manual"" is in such small print to be undecipherable and the symbols do not address my issue. I don't see how these can help me, and since there is no support, they will have to go back. Disappointing."
"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged it’s like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if it’s not straight up refusing to connect it’s disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so that’s a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didn’t pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.ETA: as of july 2024 i ditched these and bought another pair of airpod pros. literally no regrets."
"**Review:**I really wanted to like these, but after using them for almost a week, I find them poor in everything except for the relatively good sound when playing music. They are absolutely unusable for my work, which involves video conferencing. This is a deal-breaker.**Pros:**- Sound Quality: The mids are nice and clear, and the bass is tight and punchy when the volume is turned up. When listening to the right kind of music at high volumes, they can sound downright amazing. I appreciate the trueness of the sound, especially given my diverse music tastes from reggae to hip hop, jazz, R&B, and EDM.- Fit: They sit very snug in my ears, effectively blocking out external sounds, which provides a passive noise-canceling effect.**Cons:**- Noise Cancelling and Transparency Modes: Both modes fall short of expectations. Transparency mode, which should let you hear your surroundings, instead adds a hollow reverb and doesn't work well; I couldn’t even hear someone talking directly to me while using it. Noise cancellation mode introduces a persistent noise layer, similar to wind or the sea, rather than effectively blocking external sounds.- Controls: The physical buttons are a matter of personal preference. For me, they are frustrating and cumbersome, often leading to accidental pausing of the music, restarting the track, or skipping to the previous track. I find touch-sensitive controls more intuitive. Maybe I'll get used to it over time, but currently, it’s quite inconvenient.- Bluetooth Range: Disappointingly low with frequent disconnections even at moderate distances. To be honest, they perform similarly to the Earfun Air Pro 3, but I expected them to be better. Maybe I need to cut them some slack since they're a year older (2021) than the Earfun Air Pro 3.- Microphone Quality: Sounds horrible and robotic on a PC, making it unusable for video conferencing or recordings. I need to test the call quality on mobile.**Conclusion:**Overall, I'm not convinced these earbuds live up to the hype or their price. Despite impressive sound quality and numerous positive reviews, I want to be objective and make an informed decision. Here are the questions I’m considering:- Am I being more critical because of the price?- Is the fact that the normal mode sounds amazing with the passive noise-canceling from the fit enough to overlook the underwhelming or broken modes?- Should I use these earbuds just for music and avoid using them for work, which heavily relies on video conferencing on PC?- Will the microphone performance be better on mobile?- Will the fit remain as good when working out or sweating?- What will happen if they fall into a puddle of water?- Can they handle 8 hours of continuous work without causing fatigue?I realize that I can’t fully trust online reviews, particularly with notable brands where reviewers might be enamoured by the brand itself or the product’s popularity. This can lead to mismatched expectations between what is advertised and what actually meets my needs. I’ll continue to test these earbuds in various scenarios to make a more informed decision."
"While I think beats have a history of being reliable and great quality, this specific model failed the test. I am not a music expert but this is how I felt the earbuds performed.Pros:- noise cancelling is really impressive.- ear bud sizing is versatile. I have small ears but the small size fit me perfectly.- snug fit meant that using at the gym came with no problems.- the functionality with an iPhone makes it more convenient than any other brands I’ve tried.Cons- quality of the case was questionable.- audio lacked that surround sound attribute that I personally prefer. I tried listening to various genres and found that the audio sounded like you were listening to music in an empty room; very echoey.- songs sounded quiet but when I went to raise the volume, it was so sharp that it hurt my ears to listen. Even using r&b songs that tend to sound more pillowy, I felt like everything sounded like nails on a chalkboard.The main reason I bought these earbuds was to have something more reliable than the Apple AirPods. I also wanted the audio to be loud enough for my outdoor runs and still provide a great listening experience. It’s because these buds lacked in the sound department that I won’t be keeping them. I did try the other beats model: beats fit pro. Those provide all the pros of this model with the additional case quality and better audio. While I think the noise cancelling is slightly better with the studio model, I think the fit pros are far better in every other category that it seems to be a non-issue."
"Honestly,I buy many earbuds. I never put them back in case and we know how that goes. You lose one and you buy another and another. So finally I decided on buying the more expensive ones like these that tell you where your earbuds if lost!! Sounds perfect! The audio was not much different from $20 pair so that was a big downside. Figured there would be amazing bass and it literally wasn't. My husband just bought the Samsung galaxy buds and sound wayyyy better. Also it's not important but I've never had any with the noise canceling feature and when I put the galaxy buds on and he presses the button to turn on it was like I had my hearing sense taken away! These have the same thing but I can still hear everything so that was disappointing. There good headphones but for my first buy of more expensive I really can't say it was worth it."
"My Airpods died post warranty so I thought why not make a new change to see what’s out there. I heard Beats headphones are touted for their bass so I thought I’d give it a try. If I could go back in time, I would’ve went with air pods again.You might be seeing reviews about how these buds don’t fit and or fall out…they’re 101% correct. I even bought smaller bud tips and they still fall out. Often times they’re slowly making their way out of my ears even if I’m just sitting still. Putting them in is an absolute pain because you have to find “that right spot”, and during that you’re pausing, unpausing, and skipping whatever it is you’re listening to.The bluetooth connection is about 75% hit, 25% miss. The 25% is when I’m holding the buds’ case open waiting for my device to remember the existence of my buds because just plugging them in your ears isn’t a guarantee they’ll connect.It’s only getting 3 stars from me from a sound quality standpoint. The noise cancellation I feel could be better, but it’s not horrible. The music I listen to sounds clear and crisp. And I do enjoy the feature of being able to turn noise cancellation on and off.Overall: If you’re tired of whatever brand of earbuds you’re using and want to take a risk on these, go for it. BUT, if you’re thinking “I wonder if there’s better than airpods out there” from a curiosity standpoint, GO BACK OR GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! You probably won’t be a fan of these."
"I got this product because I missed the cut off deadline for getting my Airpods fixed, and it was on sale. If I had to do it all over again, though, I would just purchase another set of Airpods. What's great about these is that because they're Beats brand, they get some extra support with Apple products, but that's about where the benefits end. These earbuds are so quiet. I have such a hard time hearing my audiobooks when anything else is playing in the area. I also find that they disconnect pretty easily from whatever I'm using--presumably because they're trying to reconnect to a separate Bluetooth elsewhere. I also have an issue with them falling out of my ears pretty easily, no matter what size rubber tips I use. I wish I could tell my past self not to do it and just fork out a little more for what I really wanted."
"Cost (4/5): Was searching for good quality BT earbuds while staying around a $100 budget. These seemed to be right in the range, granted I did add the apple warranty thing for an additional $20-30 dollars (will more than likely need it based on the battery life details below)Sound Quality (4.5/5): Good quality and base in my opinion, but I don't really have anything to compare them to.Case Quality (3/5): Case is made up of very thin plastic material with a flip open lid. I dropped this once already when getting out of my vehicle (I guess it was in my lap) and thought for sure it was going to implode on impact with the pavement, but luckily it didn't. Still questionable if it would survive a second drop though.Battery Life (1/5): I must have received a very poor pair of earbuds, because the page here shows ""24 hours with the two additional charges from the case"". If you do the math here, that's 8 hours per charge with the earbuds which is an absolute lie for the pair I received. At most, I'm getting about 90 minutes of continuous play before they are dropping to about 10-15% life. My right ear bud seems to always drain energy faster than the left ear bud as well. Typically when I check the right one is about 15+% lower than the left for battery life. IF the two charges is correct for the case, then I'm looking at a total of 4.5 hours of battery life with the two charges from the case. Very big difference here vs what was advertised, granted removing them every 90 minutes or so is ideal to prevent my ears from getting annoyed/sore with the buds being in so long."
"Not sure what it is but many times when I take out the headset to listen to music or to answer the phone, it switches to handset mode. I’m using an iPhone 15. I thought because I was using an iPhone XS that was the reason. But I now see that it’s not.  Also, people cannot seem to hear me when I’m talking to them on the phone.  Nice pair of headsets (especially for the price). But overall, I’d say it’s ok, average. Also, the find my feature seems to work with the headphones and not the case."
"I have $30 Targry earbuds with better sound quality. The Targry ones don't have different noise cancelation settings, but they are louder. These Beats have decent enough sound quality and the noise cancelation is nice, but I don't think they're worth the money at full price. That being said, it seems these have different sound quality depending on the app you're using. Youtube, the music isn't as loud as I'd like. But the sound quality while using Pandora seems louder and more clear. All and all, I have mixed feelings on these. But I will be keeping them for work."
"Purchased these on sale during Prime Day, and were a decent value on sale, but would consider them a rip off at regular price. Sound is decent, but have purchased ear buds that sound as good or better at 1/2-2/3 the cost of Beats Studio Buds. I do like the fact that when you open the case lid, a display comes up on your phone to show the battery levels of the case and the individual buds. At the point that you open the case, the buds try to connect with your phone. I've found this to be hit and miss. Sometimes you have to open and close the case several times to initiate the connection with your phone. I've also found that the bluetooth connection is made more reliably when you are in Apple Music/iTunes than when you are in, for example, YouTube. Each ear bud, with a full charge, may last a little more than two hours before drained. Sometimes you'll need to go to Bluetooth under Settings to select the Beats Studio buds to connect. Mic is fine and can pick up sound easily when initiating or receiving a call. Noise cancellation is a nice feature at this price point, but can't say that they are my favorite go-to ear buds..."
"Honestly, I really wanted to like these earbuds. I purchased these for a 30$ discount but just missed the 40$ discount. Unfortunately, I ended up returning them as they just didn't cut it.1. SoundI was really underwhelmed with the sound of these earbuds. Upon receiving them, I immediately wanted to see what the sounded like. To my surprise, the sounded shallow, and not immersive at all. I have a pair of fake air pod pros and even they sounded better than these. Now, I'm not one to require an insane amount of base, but this was ridiculous, these earbuds had horrible sounding low base. It relied too much on higher frequency sounds. This make the sound seem like it was coming through a filter or like you were listening through a wall. This is especially disappointing as Beats are supposed to be catered to base-junkies. I was also surprised when I found out that these earbuds cannot get very loud. I don't think these earbuds ever touched 90 decibels for me. Even though I try not to listen to music too loud, I would like the option to turn up my music for a little bit.2. FitOverall the fit was ok. The instructions to properly insert the earbuds were a bit difficult to adjust to but I got the hang of it eventually as once they are in your ear, you are supposed to twist them down into your ear. The issue with this was that after a period of time, the earbud would untwist on their own requiring you to readjust them. This also happens if you make any kind of face movement aside from talking or eating such as smiling. This might not be a problem except the noise control ability of the earbud is completely dependent on the seal it has on your ear. This is easily disrupted when it moves out of place. Aside from that, the earbuds did not fall out of my ears easily.3. Noise controlOne of the aspects of these earbuds I was excited for was the noise control. According to some reviews, it was just shy of Air pod pro level. Especially since I got it for 120$ less than half the price of airpod pros, I was excited to see their noise control ability. I was again disappointed. As mentioned above, the seal of the earbuds on your ear is easily broken therefore making noise control pretty much useless. Aside from that, it does a pretty decent job at blocking out VOICES when there is music playing at a medium volume. BUT it does NOT block out low frequency sounds well such as that of a car engine.4. Appearance/caseThese earbuds look decent enough, if you dislike having stems like from air pods you will like these. They are pretty discrete but not as discrete as the beats fit pro. The ends of the earbuds still come out a little bit of your ears. The case is slightly larger than that of the air pods pros and slightly thicker. It has a matte  finish as opposed to the glossy finish of the air pods. I actually prefer the matte finish but that is my preference. One gripe I have is the fact that you are provided with a charger but it is usb-c to usb-c as well as being about 2 inches in length. Aside from the ridiculously short length, not having a cable have a usb side is extremely annoying.Summary:If you can get these earbuds for a discounted price, they are an absolute steal, for being only very slightly more expensive than regular airpods, they are a big step up. For 150$ I really don't think they are worth it. I decided to return mine and pay the extra 50$ for the Beat fit pros."
"So these sound great, good base and I love that you can toggle the noise cancelling on and off. However, my biggest issue with these is that you can't walk very far away from your phone because they start glitching in and out and won't stay connected. I have a 20 dollar pair of Back Bay buds and I can walk outside and stay connected to my phone inside. If these would stay connected from a further distance I would have given 5 stars. I honestly may even return them because I like to be able to listen to podcasts while I work outside and don't want to have to drag my phone around with me."
"I like the design and sound quality of these earbuds, however, these are not a good choice for people with small ears. I switched to the smallest earbud options that were included, in hopes that they would provide a more snug fit, but they continued to slip out of my ears with minimal movement.To add to my frustration, my fingers would pause/skip the music every time I adjusted the earbuds.If you have small ears, I suggest you consider getting over-ear headphones or earbuds with behind-the-ear hooks."
"The sound was good. A little squeaky noise, which goes away and then the sound is fine.  My problem - and it's a ""me"" problem is that I have small ear canals and even with the smallest tip provided - and there are 3 provided  - these earbuds would not stay in my ears.  You try to push them back in and you'll disconnect your call. I really wanted these to work 'cause I got them at a great price.  All ears are not created equal!"
"the sound was great when paired to my iPhone, streaming music.  When paired to PC, it cut in/out and was untenable.  Tried multiple settings, re-pairing, etc. to no avail.  These Beats were also to be used for Zoom meetings for work.  Upon my initial test, pairing to PC, the result was so bad I had to send them back.  If all you plan on doing is pairing with iPhone, I give them a great recommendation.  If for laptop PC, do not."
"Bought a pair during Black Friday sale. Took longer to deliver than declared, then Right Ear DIDN’T Work!!! They wouldn’t offer replacement. On top of which I had to pay to print labels for return. Furthermore it of course costs more to reorder by the time I get my refund. Only reason I give 3 stars is cause I happened to order a second pair as a gift. They arrived and work, so far. Won’t be shocked if there’s an issue down the road"
"After losing my 1st Gen AirPods Pro to my son, I needed some wireless headphones, preferably with decent noise cancellation since the guy who sits next to me at work likes to eat ice for no particular reason. I went with some Beats buds - these and a pair of Beats Fit Pro. The Fit Pros had some better features but I wasn’t sure about the fit and the price, as the Studio Buds had a better look to me, a better price point, and looked as comfortable as my previous AirPods Pro. Figured I’d try them both and report back. My notes on the Studio Buds below:The good:Feel: the Studio Buds sort of twist into the ear canal, and surprisingly stay in place pretty well. I used the smallest of the three supplied ends and they still stayed in better than my AirPods Pro ever used to. I had them in for over an hour straight with no discomfort.Case: the oval case was secure and the buds locked in tight with the internal magnet. The smaller case fit into my pocket well.Look: the color options stood out. Honestly, the red color of these made me want to keep them over my grey Beats Fit Pros. There’s something about “Beats” and that red color.The bad:The sound: I mean that’s what we’re here for, right? I take teleconference calls with these and that’s fine, but if I play music - especially something bass heavy - and the difference between something like this and the Fit Pros comes in. It doesn’t sound that bad on its own, but carrying the Beats name and a three figure list price you expect something more.Noise cancellation: again, this is a case of “it’s fine, but you expect more.” This doesn’t reach the ability that the Fit Pros or AirPod Pros did. Maybe I’m asking too much for something not labeled “pros,” but again - for the price, you expect more.Battery charge: these seemed to drain pretty fast. Even with limited usage I was down to 70% before lunch if I wasn’t putting them into the case to charge during any downtime.VERDICT:Like I said in the title - I wanted to like these, I really did. But I really can’t justify paying full retail price for these. They’re an Apple product so they pair with iPhones and other iOS devices pretty easily, but they lack the H1 chip so they lack certain features that AirPods and other Beats earbuds have. If you’re spending this much, you might as well spend a little more and get the Fits Pro or AirPods Pro and get better quality. If you don’t need the high end sound quality, look for something from a third party like Anker for half the price."
"Sounds ok, it sounds like any cheap 10 dollar Earbuds. It fits my ears properly but feels little bulky. My it's my first beats, sound quality for the price and comparison to My old NONE working OnePlus Bud pro 1 OnePlus is 3x more expensive but the sound quality is awesome.  1 think this beats Studio Buds is great at. Noice cancellation, I can't hear my wife and kids yelling for me :-p hahaha. I'm going to return this."
"In my experience it's been a very protective casing and I've had no trouble taking my earbuds out. However, once you put your earbuds case into this protective case, expect to never be able to get it out again. The top of the case slips off very easily but the bottom half is nearly impossible to take out, which makes it hard to press the bluetooth pairing button on my case or be able to clean my case"
"Sound quality for the earbuds actually wasn’t too bad. The biggest issue I had was the fact that while I was listening to songs or podcast, the connection would cut in and out or bounce from to ear to ear, and it seemed to constantly fade out then re-equalize itself.  I couldn’t get it figured out to see whether it was an issue on my end or not, so I’m just sending them back."
"I really like how well they stayed in my ears, and the call quality was good, but I couldn't get through an entire song without them glitching/cutting out for a split second. It was annoying and distracting. The audiophile comments are definitely correct. The sound quality was OK but definitely not like AirPods Pro. I sent them back. The glitching was too much"
"Good for the price if you just need bluetooth ear buds. If you like a lot of bass these are better in that area than airpods, so like if you like edm music maybe. I am actually returning because the higher end noises get super scratchy sounding. You loose a lot of the airy surround quality. They are comfortable though."
"Held up good for 2 years on the dot then the left ear just stopped working overall. Case can charge my friend’s left ear so it’s something with the buds. Was kinda happy with it other than that besides occasional buzz. Unfortunate that it’s dead and one ear doesn’t make sense, probably gonna get the AirPods Pro 2 now"
I bought these because I have the Beats Studio over the ear headphones and those have amazing sound with brilliant low notes. I already owned the Apple AirPods Pro and wanted to compare them. The Studio Buds are good but not nearly as good as the AirPods. They do not have the low range that the over the ear ones do and their noise cancellation does not work as well as it does on the AirPods. I still use them as a back up if my AirPods need charging but they don't have the same quality sound. For the price though? They are decent enough. For the price? You get a decent pair with decent sound.
"I don’t like how they fit in my ear. Feel like I’m stuffing a cotton ball in my ear. They will not stay in for nothing, I’ve dropped them so many times. When I’m on the phone people say my mic is trash. I got them because the were cheap and name brand but I rather pay extra for AirPods."
"If you have high intensity workouts, these may not work for you. I have tried changing the ear piece, cleaning them, and setting them in, they always pop out. I end up chasing them across the gym floor as my workout. If you are a person that needs music in your ears during a workout, I would look elsewhere"
"Bought the Beats headset for business travel and liked the fit and option for different ear pieces for different sizes, but actually used the original earbuds because they fit my ears well. Loved the touch feature because I fly often and is easy while sitting on a plane to just tap the ear bud to turn on and off the volume with a touch of the earbud. However, as soon as I went to have a phone call, my recipient could not hear me without all the background noise, so I had to turn off the earbuds and use my phone instead, which was inconvenient with my luggage, etc. In my hands. Very disappointing because that is a key feature I need to use with my earbuds, to have conference calls."
"I was super excited to see the first pair of true wireless earbuds from beats since 2019, and I was intrigued by the supposedly dual native features between Android and iOS. In the end though, I would have rather paid more for this product and have it include the H1 chip. To be clear, it does integrate better than any old set of bluetooth headphones, but nowhere nearly as good as AirPods(or even devices like the beats flex which use the older W1 chip).Sound quality, which is probably most people's biggest concern, is good. Better than AirPods Pro in my opinion, not by a mile or anything but I prefer the sound of these over AirPods Pro. These are clearly better sounding than the regular, 2nd generation AirPods from 2019. They do sound a little more bass-y than Apple's normal sound, but it's not the older signature of beats where they used to use too much bass.The active noise cancellation features are halfway there, the ANC is almost as good as AirPods Pro. The problem is the ambient mode where it lets in sounds from the outside. This is one of the worst implementations I have ever heard. I don't know how Apple could do so well with this feature on their own headphones and do so poorly on the Studio Buds, but they did. I basically have to take them out if I need to listen to someone talking to me or be aware of my surroundings. No two ways about it, this feature is terrible. I think it's because there are no vents like AirPods have, and they just weren't able to replicate the sound using only the microphones. I think it probably also is due to the Mediatek chip (MT2821-A) that this product is using, their bluetooth chips probably aren't on the same level as Apple or Qualcomm (you would think they would have used Qualcomm over Mediatek).The AirPods like features of these headphones are sometimes almost as good as the H1, other times, the only way you can get the little popup card on screen is if you hold down the pairing button in the case. Switching between devices is not seamless at all, even ones that you have previously connected to. I oftentimes found myself having to select ""forget device"" in the bluetooth settings and then re pair these earbuds. The only thing they are really good at is using them with just one smartphone or tablet and not trying to jump back and forth between devices. They work pretty much like AirPods if you were just using them with your iPhone and nothing else.Pros+Good sound qualityCancels out a decent amount of the ambient noise using ANCGood value for what you getBuild quality is good for $150 (especially when they are on sale)Cons-No automatic play/pause detectionThe transparency mode is just not good, like AT ALLEven for the features that are supposed to work well, the lack of an H1 chip is a huge bummer for Apple usersNo wireless charging on the caseSwitching between devices, even manually, is a frustrating process that doesn't work as it should"
"I have mixed feelings about them. I purchased for 79.99, normal price is around 149.99. (Prime day is a joke however)Cons:They advertise battery life of up to 24 hours, within 2 hours I had drained nearly 30% of the battery. It only comes with a usbc cable but not the port that connects to power. Charging port does not have a display to let you know how much battery. If doing more active tasks they are likely to fall off. They seem a little too quiet, and seems to vary a lot if watching movies, social media and listening to music.Pros:Extremely easy to connect to iPhone. They are made of good materials and feel good quality. They have really good noise cancelling.Overall they are decent. But I feel they are worth at most $60. If you pay more than that they are not worth it. You can definitely find better more affordable options out there"
"I was so excited to get these earbuds, knowing that Beats is a reputable brand and this item got a ton of 5 star reviews. When I got them, I set it up with my Mac and iPhone. I tested them using the phone with Pandora, Spotify, and YouTube apps. The sound seemed unusually low, even if I turned the volume to the max. Then I tried using my MacBook during a Zoom meeting, and using YouTube with different browsers. Still, the volume seemed low. It was all frustrating because I can barely hear the music or voices. I had to do a little research online - the fix was to place the Beats earbuds back in the charger, then put back into your ears. It worked, and I can finally hear the music. BUT, the volume was still a bit low compared to other earbuds. I tried it for a week, but the volume never got better. Sound quality was good and I enjoyed plenty of music, but I wished it could go higher. Then these earbuds started to hurt my ears. Its shape pressed against my ear cartilage, and it got worse every day I wore them. I read the instructions on how to put them on properly. I also tried putting on the different sized liners, but that didn't make a difference.  It’s the shape of the hard ear piece. I returned it to Amazon - but the return process was a hassle! It has to be picked up in person rather than dropping it off at Amazon Fresh. I wasn’t home when they came to pick it up. No bueno! Had to hand it to them next day. Ah man, I'm so disappointed."
"They sound good for the price.  However, almost immediately there was a loud buzz coming from the right earbud.  I'll give it to Apple though, they are going to swap them out for a new pair with little questions.  We will see how long these ones work."
These are nice. Was going to order a 2nd pair on Black Friday since it was the lowest price all year. But it was the same exact price I paid in July. What a scam. This isn’t a Black Friday price. What a disappointment taking advantage of people.
"Honestly, the sound is great for these earbuds and I loved the bass. My main problem came from the fit of the earbuds. They were so PAINFUL. I've owned multiple earbuds before and have never had any pain associated with them. I'm not sure if my ears are abnormal or if it's the fit or the earbuds, but I was unable to wear them for more than 30 minutes before my ears became super sensitive to touch and I developed a headache. So caution to those who may have smaller earphones? But again, I've never had problems with earbuds until these"
"Very disappointed with these.  Not only does the volume not go up loud enough but there is no bass.  With my bose in ear headphones they had bass and almost enough volume.  I went with these because my bose did not have the battery longevity that I needed.  Also the beats don't feel secure in the ear.  The bose are heavier but are definitely secure.  The audio quality isn't as good as the bose as I felt immersed in the sound like it was coming from all around.  I would not buy again nor recommend these for anyone who is an audio enthusiast.  I even watched a few reviews and read a few articles about these that stated they were pretty good.  Maybe something changed from the time those were written or recorded to this set.  Here is what I want, an adjustable set of headphones that don't dial the volume down, have adjustable settings for each frequency range (user set), killer bass, killer highs and mids, last for 4 hours at full volume and don't cost 800 bucks.  Is 150 range too much to ask?"
bought these to try for work. i work at an automotive plant. its loud in here. compared to airpod pro and jbl beam these ranked at the bottom. the battery life is the worst of the 3. sound quality is fine but matters not if i have to switch them twice in a shift. im only allowed to wear one so i appreciate that these have controls on both sides. they would be great if not for the battery life. maybe im biased because the jbl last an entire shift 🤷🏽‍♀️ as it stands im giving them to my teen
"I wanted to wait a few months to give an honest review. I wear my earbuds quit frequently and here for the issues I've encountered with the Beat's studio buds. They did not come with an earpiece that was small enough to fit in my ears. I know that is probably a me issue and not necessarily the earbuds faults but do keep in mind if you have smaller ears, you may have trouble with these. Also, more than likely due to that, they did not stay in my ear very well. They constantly fell out of my ears all the time. I mostly use them for music or watching shows, but I do not think they would hold up very well if I was to go running. Also, the left ear bud was always cutting in and out with the sound. I'm not sure if I just got a faulty earbud or what but after a few weeks it stopped working more than it did. These are also not earbuds I would wear for an extended period of time either. They would start to hurt my ears after a while and were not very comfortable at all. The battery life was not great either. I feel like I was constantly having to charge them.All in all they were just okay headphones. I originally had airpod pro's and then they got water damamge. I got these when they went on sale instead of spending more money on a new pair of airpod pro's, however; after 6 months of discomfort and inconsistency with the sound, i did end up just repurchasing a new pair of airpod pro's. This was just my experience with the earbuds so like anything else take that with a grain of salt."
I have four different pair of Beats Fit Pros (all different colors). I really want them in red but they don’t make the Fit Pros in red so I tried these Studio ones thinking “surely they won’t be THAT different than the Fit Pros”. *sigh* They are. They are so sooooo different. Once you listen to your music using the Fit Pros….hearing every bass line…every instrument….and then pop in these Studio ones….your ears will start crying. Everything sounds low and cheap with the Studio Beats.-They fit in my ears like they want to jump out. The Fit Pros have that little “hook” thing that hugs that hump inside of your ear and they feel like they’ll stay in even during an earthquake. The Studio ones feel as though they will fall out if a butterfly whispers in my ear.-They won’t stay connected to my devices (Apple products).I just started the return process and will use this money and add some to it so that I can purchase another pair of the Fit Pros (maybe the blue pair).So…trust me….skip the Studio Beats and buy a pair of Fit Pros. Your ears will thank you.
"These ear buds are simple to control and multiple ear buds allow for ""fine tuning"" fit.  The fast charging feature is very nice but is needed considering the short life span of the bud itself.  Noise cancelling works well and is easy to toggle and these puppies do have great sound.Overall, I use when exercising and they get the job done.  I do not recommend for HIIT/Crossfit/Runnings as the bouncing will knock them out of your ears.  My biggest issue is that both buds never charge at the same time, I have to remove one to get them both to 100%... I've seen this issue on multiple forums.  Would be a 4-5 star review based on my other comments; however, the charging issue is extremely annoying and needs to be fixed."
"These Beats earbuds offer decent sound quality, but audiophiles should temper their expectations. While aesthetically appealing, the slippery plastic on both the earbuds and the charging case creates significant usability issues. Removing the earbuds is a slippery frustrating task, and their slick surface makes it difficult to precisely position them for charging. The magnetic charging wells are helpful, but the earbuds often slip and slide between fingers before finding their proper place. A more textured, grippy material would have been a welcome improvement. A slight irritating ticking noise occurs when the earbuds are idle, though thankfully masked by music. Battery life is a major disappointment, falling far short of advertised claims with a mere 3-3.5 hours of use before reaching a critical 15% charge. The noise cancellation is barely noticeable, with only a very subtle audio cue to indicate its activation, which can almost be missed. Additionally, the physical button on the earbuds feels prone to wear and tear and its audible click is distracting and uncomfortable in the ear canal. Overall, I'm underwhelmed by these earbuds and question whether I received a defective pair."
Very small. Sound is very good. Noise cancelation is very good. Battery life is very low. Well less than 6 hrs even when listening to music sporadically. Size makes them difficult to get ahold of while in your ear.
I’m loving my headphone. The sound quality is on point. Noise cancellation is great. The battery life is not the best. Dies within a few hours. Would like to be a full day of battery life.
"I went with Beats because they are owned by Apple and I have an iPhone so I thought it would have great compatibility but boy was I wrong. Since they are owned by apple there is no iPhone app to control these and everything is done through settings. Unfortunately the earbuds don’t take the settings into consideration for things like noice cancelling or pass through controls and instead they randomly apply these settings even if you have them turned off. For example, I have it set for pass through audio turned off when I have one earbud in but not only will the earbud default to pass through 90% of the time I put it in, it will also insistently turn it back on several times when I manually turn it off by holding the button down. It usually takes 3 to 4 times of me turning it back off before it finally lets me have pass through off. It is quite possibly the most annoying thing ever.Not only that, but the earbuds will just randomly not connect, disconnect or even say they are connected but the audio will still come out of the iPhone speaker instead of the earbuds. Often this requires me to turn off Bluetooth on my iPhone, put the earbuds back in the case, turn Bluetooth back on again and try them again before they will work.To top it all off, I tried these “apple owned” Beats earbuds with my old Samsung S9 using the Beats app on the Google store and I don’t suffer ANY of these problems on the Android platform.The sound quality might be a tiny bit better than the Samsung or Jabra earbuds that I have owned before but the frustrations of using them do not make them worth it and at this point it’s only a matter of time before I spike these things into the concrete while fighting with them to do what they are supposed to do.Stay away unless you are using this Apple owned product with an Android device."
Am not impressed with battery life of earpieces.  Have been averaging perhaps 90 minutes on each one before i have to return to  fully charged case.
"I really regretted wasting money on these.  Getting it for about $80 on Prime days price doesn't help, but at least I didn't spend more.  Bought them simply because in order to hear spatial audio tracks on apple music, it requires Apple devices and the Beats are lower in cost and are a bit more comfortable than Airpods.  I noticed a scratchy background noise in the left ear after a few week and it took an hour and 15 with Apple support to get a return setup.  They acknowledged that units made in 8/24 were ""known"" but they were not recalling it.  You had to complain and send in for service for something they know were defective.  So quickly enough, I got replacements that worked properly.So the only really good thing about them is the ease at connecting to my phone and iPad.  The only noise reduction comes from basically sticking two earplugs into your ear.  Zero difference between on and off.  Can't even cut the fan noise of my laptop.  Sound is OK, but headphones are very personal. I have JVC earbuds that sound 10 times better.  There are a lot of $40 earbuds that sound better.  I'll keep using them because for phone calls on the iPhone, it's pretty seamless but if you want a decent music device, buy something else."
"So let me start by saying that the sound from my Beats is amazing. However, the fit is horrible and they will fall out of your ears."
"I bought the Beats studio buds to replace my Jlab elite ear buds. my jlabs fell out of my pocket and i did not realize that the buds fell out of the case before i drove away! That being said, this is what i think of ""Beats"" studio budsPROS:Price points hard to beat for something name brandedANC works wellMetal casePositive Tactile button clicksYeah thats it!Cons:Sound quality is lack luster and left me wanting moreBass in comparison to other buds ive owned is sub par, Jlab elites had way more deep bass, Jabra 75t absolutely destroyed Beats in a sound and bass comparison.No volume control unless you download an app and change the button layoutNo way to adjust sensitivity like an EQ, or even a simple Bass Mids Treble ""knob"" like a car stereo would have so they are setup at factory and end user has no way to adjust for personal preference. My Skullcandy jib II have about the same sound and end function and those are only $40.You can waste your money for the Beats name, or you can buy others at the same price point that are way better. I recommend spending your money on virtually any other earbuds so you wont have the same dissapointment i currently have!"
"I bought these ear buds because I work in a loud office and they said noise canceling, but there is nothing noise canceling about them, unless you turn the music up so high you can't hear anything else.  When music goes off you can hear yourself typing.  However, have tried a few others that were worse and at least they are comfortable in my ears and they do have good sound."
"So let me start by saying the build quality of these in ears and their case are top of the line. They feel and look very high quality. The tactile feel of the buttons are perfect. The position of the buttons did not, however, work for me. This is not a critical comment but merely a statement of fact about what I needed. I often wear my in ears when I am sleeping and I am a side sleeper. When your head presses on the pillow it activates the buttons leaving you with either full volume or no volume(if that is how you set up your button functionality). Again, not a negative comment, just a limitation for how I use mine. Now, to why I only gave them two stars for sound quality. Some background. I own a pair of over the ear Sony WH-100XM3 over the ear headphones. I also own an old set of Skullcandy Method in ears and Raycon Everydays. These are what I judge these Beats against. First of all, nothing comes close to the sound quality of the Sonys. They are a phenomenal set of headphones with a very robust supporting app and I recognize that and take it into account when looking for new in ears. When I first received the Beats I downloaded the app and updated the firmware so everything was up to date. When I played them they were very flat in bass response. Almost tinny if that makes sense. As I dug into the app I noticed they were in noise cancelling mode so I turned that off. Marginally better bass response. So I dug around in the app to try and find an equalizer to adjust. Nothing...So I went into Apple Music and attempted to adjust the equalizer and didn't have much success making the sound better. I was so disappointed I went out and bought a pair of Skullcandy Indy Evos to see if I could get better sound out of a set of in ears half the price....and I did. They were much better sounding. Nothing approaching the Sonys but much better than the Beats. The reason I bought these was to replace my Raycons that I dropped on our wood floor making them sound like they had blown speakers(guess I jarred something loose inside the buds.) I loved the Raycons but that was the second issue I had with a set of Everydays so I won't buy the brand again. I'm too hard on them. With that said, I believe if I would have dropped these Beats I don't think it would have affected them at all. The build quality is very good. They feel incredibly solid and the case feels the same. Unfortunately their sound quality just isn't what I(and I stress the I here. Many people have given these high ratings) would expect from a $120 set of in ears. I hope this helps someone. Again, these Beats have received high ratings so maybe I am just the outlier. Good luck."
"These are pretty nice, the one thing, if you sweat a lot or live in a very humid or wet climate, they fall out"
"These headphones were kinda a letdown for the price. My biggest issue is they do not stay charged for long. Personally, they aren't very comfortable in my ears compared to other inner ear buds I have used before. Sound quality is good though and they seem to be made well. I don't absolutely hate them but would not buy again."
"Purchased these to replace my Jaybirds earbuds. I like how they fit, the audio sounds nice, I can switch between transparency mode and noise cancelling mode easily, and not needing yet another app to make them work is great. My biggest issue is when I use them to talk on the phone. The other person always tells me they can’t really hear me and I have to switch to a different earbud. I gave up trying to use them for calls and it seems like an enormous waste now. Would not recommend if you talk a lot of the phone. They definitely do not live up to the hype. Wouldn’t recommend them for that reason."
"I got these like a week or two ago. I always saw kids having beats ear buds, or headphones and they always said great things. I grew up poor and never got the chance to have beats, it was either those $10 skullcandy wired buds and they did the trick.Now that I have adult money, I decided to switch to these beats ear buds. I had high expectations, I was using Raycon buds so that is what I had to compare and reference to.1- battery sucks - you will get a solid 8 hours per bud, but after only one recharge by case, you need to charge all of it again. So a total 32 hours if you use one at a time without recharging the case. The Raycon buds I can use one for my 4 day work week and only have to charge it once. The case maybe charge every two weeks. And I use one bud at a time so I am getting so much more life per bud with raycon over beats.2 - sound/quality - I’m not going to write much here. They are as good as any $40-$80 headphones I’ve ever used. Not spectacular by any means. A little uncomfortable in my opinion.3 - price - these are over $100 and you don’t really see the extra money in performance, or quality. Raycon ear buds I use are more comfortable and have the same quality of sound for like $70. Personally I think I set my expectations to high, and I’ve been let down. I would not recommend buying these if you want a “superior” headphone.I sound like an ambassador but if you want good ear buds for cheap Raycon is the way to go."
"Great sound,  lower than expected noise canceling efficiency, doesn't stay in the ear very well, but it is comfortable, case is also a little heavier than expected,  the beats app for android works well though not such an aesthetically pleasing app (compared to Samsung, jbl, etc.),For the price I was expecting better"
I actually had to send these back the right ear bud wouldn’t work whatsoever the left ear did but it didn’t fit in my ear correctly and kept falling out the sound quality in the left earbud was great even tho I was very disappointed I had to send them back they were not terrible
These ear phones sound great and actually do block out noise but they constantly fall off and on the right ear piece it has developed a loud annoying buzz. These are great phones but aren't well designed for someone that is active. I give 3 stars because they sound great and block out noise
Sound quality it great but the battery life is HORRIBLE which is very unfortunate for me
"For $149 this is a good value, especially in the gym.  I'm an IOS user.  The sound volume is better than AirPods but I have had clients tell me that the background noise is worse off compared to AP's.  The biggest difference in these buds is that they don't recognize when they've been taken out and automatically disconnect from your phone like AP's do.  Example - I come home from the gym while using these buds and I take them out to go about my normal business.  Someone sends me a video that I want to listen to and I either have to manually disconnect the buds or walk across the house to put them in again as they're still connected even though I'm not wearing them, UUUGGG!"
"For the price, they do not hold a charge nor do they have good sound quality.."
"So far I have to say these just get the job done. Not the best wireless headphones I’ve had but they’re not terrible. I do like the sounds quality and that my music sounds very clear. They are noise canceling and the battery life is also good. I can wear these all day at work with no issues of them dying. Down side to these are the transparency and noise canceling features suck. The features aren’t really necessary since the headphones themselves block out noise very well. You’ll hear just a bunch of interference when either of those modes are on. Connection issues at times. It only happens when I first put the headphones on. They seem to want to disconnect but after a while they continue to play music fine with no issues. Talking on the phone with these has been alright so far but I’ve had a few times where people can’t hear me very well. Overall if you’re looking for headphones that play music well, last long, and block out most noise  then these will do."
"The sound is perfect, noise resistance is suberb. The battery doesn’t last long at all. I am thinking of returning them. So disappointed I charged them overnight and got to work. Only last close to 4 hours. Apple AirPods literally lasts at least 6 hours straight or longer. So disappointed."
One ear bud did not work.  Iam hoping it was just a bad batch.
"As far as sound quality goes, I would give these earbuds a four. Battery life was also good. Another positive is the controls on the earbuds work relatively well compared to many others. The problem comes in the fact that the sound will pop in and out intermittently while you are exercising or walking. The biggest problem I had and the reason for the low rating is that they will come unpaired sometimes if you pull an earbud out of your ear and they will not re-pair on your phone by turning Bluetooth on or off or anything else. The only way to get them to re-pair is to put them back in their charge box and pull them back out again. That doesn’t do any good when their charging box is hours away and you’re out exercising. The last time that happened to me, I took the earbuds out and threw them in the woods as far as I could throw them.  I have a couple sets of wireless earbuds that don’t sound as well, but I would much rather have them as they are reliable. Very disappointed for earbuds and that price range."
Easy to use+. They don’t feel premium and sound could be better.
I like the sound quality but the battery life is very short
These aren’t my favorite. They fall out my ear constantly. I changed the buds to different sizes and neither of them work well with MY ear. If I could return these for something else I would. I did get them for an Amazing price but they literally fall out my ear every 15 secs :((
"The charge on my AirPods Pro Buds doesn't last the entirety of my long-haul flights or overnight if I wear them to sleep. Buying a 2nd set of AirPods to always have a charged pair on hand seemed excessively expensive and indulgent. These Beats Studio Buds do the trick for less than 1/3 the price of my AirPods. For my purposes, the Beats Studio Buds work out great.The sound quality and noise-cancelation features of the Beats Studio Buds are just a step down from my noise-canceling AirPods Pro Buds. With the Beats Studio Buds, I hear a little more of what's happening around me which is disappointing, hence the 3 stars. However, I wouldn't give the AirPods Pro noise canceling feature more than 4 stars. Neither brand of Buds holds a candle to my Beats over-the-ear noise-canceling headphones. For sound quality, I get some weird feedback if I'm laying down and the Beats Buds rub against my pillow, whereas I've never had that problem with the AirPods Pro, hence 4 stars for Beats Buds vs. the 5 stars I would give to the AirPods Pro. The battery life is almost identical for both brands, which IMO is subpar in both brands of Buds, so I would give them both 3s. I would rather have slightly larger buds that held a charge longer than the tiny buds I'm constantly searching for when I drop them on the floor or into various crevices.The charge on both brands of Buds lasts about the same amount of time, which equates to about 4-5 hours of usage per set. For my very long-haul flights of 10-15 hours plus airport time, my Airpods are recharged again by the time my Beats run dry, and then my Beats are recharged if the 2nd Airpods charge gives up. Most planes have USB ports, but I have yet to find one that does more than trickle charge, which means my iPhone must get the USB port so it doesn't die when I'm watching shows, listening to music and podcasts, or reading on my Kindle app. So I can't recharge my Buds of either flavor while I'm using my phone. Fortunately, the charged-up cases get one set of buds back in action by the time the other set dies, and I can often get enough of a 2nd recharge on my Airpods to last until I reach a 'real' recharging location."
"My wife and I both got a pair of these for the gym. I’ve had over the ear Studio Pros (PHENOMENAL) and wanted to not have a dent in my hair lol, so I ordered these. They’re sleek, and nice quality but… lacked a couple things.1. They wouldn’t stay in my ears if I yawned or started to sweat (yes I tried different sized rubber ends)2. The sound quality was not at all good, it was honestly awful. I’m not trying to blow my ear drums out by any means but, adjusting the sound to max, super underwhelming.I order Anker p30i’s for a fraction of the price and found they fit better, performed better, and costed less."
I generally love Bose products but these headphones have been a mixed experience.Pro: Great sound qualityCons: 3 hour battery life without using noise canceling. Over time they pretty easily work their way out of your ear and fall out.
"I got them to replace my Pixel Buds Pro which I got as a compromise replacement for my Sony WF-1000XM4 which I had to warranty with the manufacturer because the right earbud battery went bad (I got a refund of purchase price). Given the cost of the new model was $100 more than their predecessor I needed a more cost effective bud. Pixel Pros hit the mark well TBH with a few compromises, but I somehow misplaced the buds and needed a replacement. I saw the Beats buds on sale and figured it would be of a similar caliber as the Pixel Buds Pro. I was completely wrong. The Beats are the personification of compromise and mediocrity. I didn't enjoy them at all.FITThe fit of these buds was just horrible. Regardless of me switching to the smaller silicone tips from the medium, the buds never sat comfortably in my ear or provided a great seal. I would constantly be readjusting the buds in my ear, which meant I would constantly press the button to pause what was playing or to skip to another tracks. The fit was even worse when in motion as the buds would always feel like they are about to fall out of my ears.Noise CancellingThe bad fit also negatively impacted the sub-standard noise cancelling performance of the buds. Honestly, the noise cancelling, even in the few minutes before requiring re-adjusting for fit, was almost completely useless.Audio ProfileComplete garbage tuning to be honest. This factor is a matter of taste and it was completely not compatible with the audio Profile I like. The lack of an equalizer in the software also meant I was stuck with the default sound profile built into the buds.Battery LifeSlightly below decent battery life on the buds. They seemed to last 6 hours at a time before needing recharge. However, they did charge up really quickly we placed in the case.ConnectionThey would often get some type of interference and the sound would get distorted to sound like I was listening to a robot speaking (this happened most frequently on phone calls)."
"If you’re considering these, make sure you pay attention to the more critical reviews and not just the positive ones.Pros1. Compact size without a microphone sticking out. Comes with different gel sizes to fit most ears.2. Controls are the same on both earbuds. So unlike some where skip is on one and reverse is on the other, you can use either one individually and have full functionality.3. Pairs easily with multiple devices.4. The sound quality is decent.Cons1. Since the microphones are built into the earbuds, they don’t work very well. During calls the other person had a difficult time hearing and was only resolved when switching to either speaker or the phone itself. Kind of negates the point of using the earbuds.2. The controls are on a physical button, meaning you have to click it. If you use them during sleep you will always accidentally click them.3. No volume control. You have to adjust the volume on the device you are using.4. Poor battery life. The description states that the earbuds last up 5 hours. They don’t last even close to that. With a full charge they only last maybe 3 hours at best. And when they do drain there is no notification. No audible tone or verbal indication. They just simply die.5. Sound. I saved the best for last. After all, this is the most important part for earbuds. As I mentioned above, they are decent. But for the amount of money you spend and the brand name, I was expecting much more. There are much cheaper brands available that out perform these.Overall a disappointing product. Definitely not recommended."
I do not like the fact that they don’t stay in the ear. I feel like with the money that you pay for them they should come with a way to keep them in the ear so you don’t loose them.
"I really wanted to love these, but I only like them. The biggest and most challenging issue is touch sensitivity. During phone calls or any time I’m attempting to adjust the buds(which unfortunately aren’t super stable), the call ends or music starts and stops. I can’t even adjust the volume during a call or it’s over, which is very frustrating if I’ve been waiting on hold etc. I will say the sound quality is actually really awesome, especially in Noise Cancel mode. However, I’m still having to switch back and forth between my old AirPods and these, depending on what I’m doing, which defeats the purpose. If you’re wanting these for music only and don’t need much adjusting, a great buy. If you do a lot of phone calls, I do not recommend them.*those having issues with sound being too quiet, Dr Google told me I had to change a few sound settings to make them louder, which worked!"
Noise cancellation doesn’t work. Quality of sound it not great.
"I’ve had these ear buds for almost 2 years now and can safely say I can give a fair review. The ear buds are comfortable in the ear but have a tendency to slide out every now and then, the sound is very basic and not anything I would consider note worthy but they work for around the house or at work, the noise reduction feature is amazing it definitely cancels out most of the noise even with just one in it’s pretty good BUT the biggest problem I have with these is the battery life is ATROCIOUS the case will last you about 24 hour before needing a charge if your ear buds have been used, from what I’ve notice i can go about 8 hours of work with out needing to charge it but the next day you’re looking at a dead case and ear buds after just a single day, I have another set that I got for $30 and it last a whole week without any need to charge it."
"Damn, they fit in my ears perfectly and the sound is pretty good but the volume could be louder for us rockers.The reason why I returned them is the button controls on the actual buds are really buggy. They should rename them Buggy Studio Beats. Sometimes one click pauses the music and then you click again and it doesn't start up..sometimes it does start up..maddening for a guy like me.Also, I don't agree with the user interface where you push down on the button to raise lower volume..I prefer each tap changes volume incrementally so you can fine tune the exact volume you want. Presently when holding down the button the volume zips higher or lower..no control really.Additionally, what's the logic behind having the same command to lower/raise the volume as pausing the music? I can't tell you how many times I just wanted to lower/raise the volume slightly, which meant a quick hold down of the button, but the buds interpreted that as tapping the button once which pauses the music..maddening!Sent em back..what a shame"
You can't touch your phone or turn your head without it fading in and out I bought something similar to these at 5 below and it was much worse I wonder if it was made by the same company.
"So i bought these earbuds for $120, in a few days later there only $70. Seems like Amazon loves to lower the price of things i just purchase to make me furious. I’m working my rear end off & don’t have time to be returning everything i buy just to get them at a regular price. These things don’t charge well, gotta leave them charging for 8hrs or more. Lets not even get into what if the case charge stops working one day. This was a mistake. Great earbuds but risky."
Short battery life. sound quality is low.
Buy the ones they stole the tech from
"I purchased these because of the price. They sound good, but the fit if terrible. They do NOT stay in your ear. I had to readjust over and over in order for them to stay and they would still fall out. Yes, I switched out the buds to the smaller ones and still had trouble with the fit. Might not be for people with small ears. I would prefer a fit like Apple has that does not entail of going partially in the ear canal. I will be returning."
"The sound quality is amazing but one downside is the battery life. It states that it has 8 hours of playtime but when fully charged, you only get about 4 hours. No other issues besides that."
I love the sound and they work great but they don’t t last more than 5hrs even when noise canceling is turned off maybe it’s just mine but 8 hrs isn’t true
"Not sure how or why these have such great reviews.The only positive thing I have to say is that I appreciate how quiet these can get (almost whisper quiet), which is quite nice. Unfortunately, if you are listening to something with a very quiet recording, you can only barely get these loud enough to hear, and then only if you are in a quiet setting and have both earbuds in place. Because of this type of situation, I was able to learn these earbuds can produce a bass tone I did not otherwise notice with normal listening settings, which was neat, but otherwise useless.Unfortunately, these only come with three size earpieces. You would think they would be enough, but they are not. The medium are too big and hard. If I use them for too long my ear begins to hurt. The small are too small and if I use them, the earbuds do not stay in my ear and are constantly falling out. All the earpieces are also short, so none of them really stay in well. I had to use ear pieces from a less expensive brand that came with 6 different sizes (buds that were only 1/5th the price, too).Because of the twisting motion that is required to put these in your ear properly, I almost always accidentally press the play button before I am ready. Also, even with the more comfortable earpieces I use from another brand, because of the weird footprint these earbuds have, they still do not stay in place well. Also, when repositioning to make sure they don't fall out, I almost always pause what I am listening to by accident. VERY FRUSTRATING.Only while using the better earpieces from the significantly less expensive brand will these buds stay in place while running, but it sounds like someone is playing a bass drum inside my ear everytime my foot hits the ground (PAINFULLY UNCOMFORTABLE). This does not happen with any of the less expensive brands I have owned.There is no standby mode with these, so as soon as the earbuds are out of the charger the battery drain time starts ticking and you only get 8 hours or less when fully charged regardless of whether you are listening to anything or not and regardless of whether you are using the noise canceling or transparency modes or not.The noise canceling function is really not any better with it on or off. The transparency mode is a neat idea, but when there is no sound and nothing is playing it sounds as if you are standing in a wind tunnel (noisy and uncomfortable to listen to). Not worth the loss of battery life to use either function.There is a Beats app you can install. Other than being able to see what mode your earbuds are in, there is really no benefit to installing it though. I had to uninstall it because it was malfunctioning and causing my earbuds to randomly and repeatedly switch into transparency mode (SUPER ANNOYING).The only way to see how much charge is left on the docking station is to check your phone while the lid is open. I don't like that I have to look at my phone to see how much charge the docking station has left instead of having a built in meter like many other brands.There is no effective way to tell if your buds are seated correctly in the docking station and are actually charging.Major buyer's regret after purchasing these. Definitely NOT WORTH THE MONEY."
"I've had my Beats Studio Buds for 5 months now and I wish I would've paid attention to the return time frame and gotten my money back and just bought another set of Airpods. If you are just sitting at a desk maybe these are a better option for you but if you intend on running or working out I do not recommend as they will not stay in my ears no matter what size I switch the inserts to. Even if I just smile the buds move and nearly fall out of my ears. The noise cancellation setting sounds like a fuzzy sound instead of just blocking outside noise in my opinion but even when I turn it off there is still a muted white noise sound. I've read reviews talking about ringing in the left bud if you're in an area where Bluetooth interferences occur and I've experienced that myself. Because of this I can't use my buds in the library which is a major issue for me as a student. However, the battery life is great compared to Airpods and the sound quality is just fine."
"These were ranked very well on numerous articles and lists for “most comfortable earbuds.” However, I could not wear them for more than thirty minutes without a lot of pain. The small ear tips are not small enough and they stick way out of my ears. I could barely even walk around without them falling out, let alone eat, drink, or just turn my head.Additionally, if I tried to adjust them it would often activate the touch controls. I can see how touch control sensitivity would be a good thing but even when I rolled over it would pause my music because it touched my pillow. I ranked three stars because there’s nothing really defective with them as long as you don’t have small ears. The music quality was great, but too painful to waste this much money."
"Bought at prime day sale. I purchased 2 earbuds: one inexpensive (20$) and this ones at 50% off. Well, price was decent compared with quality. Sound is pretty decent, the fit is not snug, I tried all the accesories to ensure a good fit but not snug aa other branda. My biggest complaint is battery life (60-70 minutes max). The interface is not intuitive and you cannot see the status of the battery life. The cheaper pair is my go-to."
"If you're buying these headphones, expect them to last about 3 months before things start going south. Noise cancellation is spotty, runs out of battery fast, overall you will run into minor but frustrating problems. Ex: sometimes only one of the earbuds work and you have to put it back in the case and reconnect it about 2-3 times. Sound quality is fine, nothing really specialI recommend spending the extra money for a better pair."
"They aren’t bad…. But the audio quality isn’t what I expected from Beats. These are on the lower end price point wise for them, but at $100 I still expected better sound. There isn’t much base in the headphones and there is no equalizer option I have found to turn up the base. Considering returning them not because they aren’t decent but they aren’t up to the $100 Beats standard in my opinion."
"First, after about a month of using them, these earbuds stopped registering that I had put them back in the case and they kept connecting to my phone while they were in their case. Which meant I had to fully ""forget"" the device on my phone to be able to make sound come out of my phone instead of my cased up headphones. This also meant that the headphones were constantly on so I'd have to keep the case plugged in at all times to keep them working. Second of all, the sound on these little guys isn't really anything to write home about, which is disappointing given the price. Third, the buds don't stay in my ears very well (which could be a me problem), partly because the outermost part of the bud with the beats logo on it is so heavy, it pulls them out of my ears while I'm using them. It's also pretty annoying that the entire outer surface is a button so unless I'm very careful, every time I go to push them back in (often), I pause whatever I'm listening to. I've always been more of an Anker girlie but I thought I'd give the name brands a go since they were on sale. Needless to say, I've already ordered a pair of Anker buds to replace these."
"Just got ‘em. And several hours later… here’s my honest opinion. I’m totally satisfied with the design, size, fit, iPhone compatibility, charging case, price, range, etc. Can’t tell you much about their battery life yet. What I do wanna tell you about is the sound. I’ve tried a lot! of high-end headphones and earbuds over the years. Bose, Sennheiser, Sony, Apple, JBL… But these Beats Studio Buds blew my mind! Clarity within strong bass. True sound of live music. Unbelievable! You MUST check this out. Go to YouTube and search for “dolby atmos sound test”. Believe you me, it’s a game changer! These bad boys CAN pull it off, revealing their full potential! Amazing! PS usb-c to usb-c charging cable (included) is an idiotic idea! IMHO, usb-c to usb cord would be more suitable.Update: Two weeks later. Here's a few things I'm not happy about...Battery life. Honestly, I don’t think they can last up to 8 hrs. straight, as Beats claims (without putting ‘em occasionally into the charging case). Wearing ‘em “on and off”, the battery charge level drops rapidly within a couple of hours. (neither ANC nor Transparency mode activated) Hmm…Physical “click buttons” suck! Sticking ‘em into my ears (with my sausage fingers) can be quite challenging sometimes. I happen to press these buttons too many times and this is annoying as hell! Oh, well…Lack of volume control!!! That’s a big issue, I’ve experienced with New Beats Studio Buds, for sure! Every now and then, you may wanna adjust the volume… Nope, can’t do it! You must have your phone nearby.An instant pairing with iPhone works 6-7 times out of 10. Go figure, right!?In conclusion, I have to say I still like Beats. I’m gonna keep ‘em as a secondary pair. The sound is astonishing, no doubt about that! The price is right too. Would I recommend ‘em? I guess. But… (read above)"
Battery lasts about 3 hours. I would have expected more.I simply cannot tell if the noise cancelling is on or off-- it all sounds the same to me. If I were able to determine if it were on maybe I could figure out how to save the battery.Good fit however. Does not fall out of my ear and the sound is quite good.
Let me start of by saying I love this product great quality and sound. The problem is they come loose very quickly. So much so that I lost the right bud.. They do not stay in your ear for to long until it starts coming loose and eventually fall out. I tried contacting Amazon and although I have a limited warranty which is still good for a few months it’s only for broken or damaged. So in my opinion. Beats knows that this item is defective because it’ does not stay in your ear securely like it should. Amazon has reviews stating that customers have the same issues I have but no one can help. Unless I pay them to replace a DEFECTIVE ear bud. SMH.
I bought these as an alternative to AirPods. The sound quality for audio and calls is great however the fit is terrible. They constantly fall out during low impact movements like walking. You can buy wings to keep them in but then you have to store them separately and remove them to charge. I would not recommend these for that reason.
"I wish I had a review like this when I was searching so lets get into this. I got this on sale for $100, a steal right? I've been an airpod user for the past 3 years so I was nervous looking around for reviews. For reference, I have an iPhone 12 pro.Cons1- The case is MASSIVE. In comparison to the Airpod case. They both come with cases that are able to charge.2- Missing H1 Chip. What does that actually mean? No Live Listen. No text announcements.3- The bud. The ear bud in theory seems like a great idea. I was excited to have a button. The placement of the button its self.. was not well thought out. I've hung up on plenty of calls trying to readjust the bud.4- Speaking of the adjustment. None of the tips have really made a ""firm fit"" So they do slip and slide.5- No in ear detection. Won't pause music automatically.Pros1- Noise cancellation is really good. I can't hear any outside noise when it's active.2- Microphone works the same - Everyone hears me crystal clear.3- The seamlessness from case to ear is amazing.4- The Magnet is VERY strong. If I drop my airpod cause my airpods fall out. Not these. They stay snug in their place.5- Even without in ear detection. I don't mind pausing my music in it's place.All around, the beats are a very different experience than the airpods. If I had a review that placed it as plainly as this I don't think I would have gotten these beats. I'm keen to my apple products due to the seamless capabilities. I did think that as beats are now produced by Apple, that alot of these cons would not have been an issue. But unfortunately they are, I'll try them for a little longer and see if my opinion changes otherwise I'll be right back to being an airpod user."
They don’t stay in your ears and honestly they sound the same as other popular brands. I was disappointed.
"They sound great when they momentarily stay in their perfect spot. Then they slide out slowly. They when you push them back in you inadvertently hit the button and they pause. Sound isolation works well, was able to easily hear an audiobook while vacuuming. Tried eating dinner while listening and chewing causes them to fall out repeatedly."
Sound is good. Battery life is good. Everyone I talk to complains about background noise. No feature that allows you to control that. I have 2 wireless buds/headphones and none have problems with background noise being overbearing for the people I talk to. I missed the return window by 3 days.... not happy.
"Their battery life isn’t too good. I have to charge it pretty often. The sound quality is great! They’re pretty comfortable, but like to slip out of my ear easily. I have dropped them a lot, but they haven’t broken, so they’re very durable! The only thing I wish was better was if they came with a case to put onto my keychain."
They are not very comfy and the noise cancelation is not that great.
"I’ll keep it short.Pros:They’re super comfortable, and they sound great!Cons:This one isn’t such a big deal, but the buttons are so sensitive, that they might as well be touch sensors. I accidentally skip to the next song if I try to readjust them.The battery life is a joke! I’ve been using them for about a week, and used them for abt 2 hours yesterday, after a full charge, and got notification saying the buds were at 10, and 18 percent. And considering that these are $150 earbuds, that’s a complete joke!! They don’t even last half of the advertised listening battery life!!"
"2nd Review:OK. After using on airplane on 2 trips, I'd like to update my review. My first review was inside my room at home so there was hardly any background noise. On my flights, these earbuds did not perform nearly as well. Noise cancelling capabilities are very weak & sound quality is thin. Also battery life not as long as advertised. But, you get what you pay for, & they are quite adequate for around the home use. So I still intend to keep these & just use them as needed. They will do the job without high expectations.My review only base on first time use, so please take with a grain of salt. I also gotta say that I'm not an influencer & my review is completely unbiased.Shipment was a bit delayed but understandable due to the Prime Deal Sales in Oct.These earbuds arrived almost 80% charged, so I brought that up to 100%. My only gripe is the tiny manual - print instructions are so tiny, not easy to read. On the other hand, the instructions were clear & concise. Also, I must say I'm an old man, but they were simple to follow.Finally got the earbuds paired with my old IPod. I was blown away! Superb performance, good bass & the tapping on the buds to make volume changes or stop/pause all worked well. I guess that I was expecting the worse because of the $21 cost during the Prime sale.I actually have a pair of Bose QC Ultra NC Bluetooth Earbuds, but was disappointed with the very short battery life when Immersive Audio in use. I travel on 5-6 hour flights often so I was looking for some backup buds to supplement these when the battery runs low.Man, It would be an understatement to say that I find these Just Awesome! I'm truly hoping that this first impression is not short-lived.Again, can't beat the price."
"I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the low price. Otherwise, these would get 2 stars. The sound quality and noise cancelling are great. I bought these mainly for running, but they don't stay in my ear at all especially once I start sweating. They even fall out of my ear when I'm on a call walking around my apartment. The touch control is somehow both too sensitive and not sensitive enough: every time I adjust my falling earbud, I end up increasing the volume, and whatever I want to pause a song, it takes me about 5 attempts of double tapping. TLDR: I should have just spent the money and bought proper earbuds instead of these."
"Product: 2 StarsThe sound is pretty good and it stays charged a decent amount of time, even better than past earbuds. However, the level of discomfort I have while wearing these is impossible to get over. They don't come with extra ear pieces, so they can't be changed out either to try to accommodate for ear size, which means there's no way to fix the issue. I have to rotate them constantly just so it doesn't hurt against the outside of my ear.EDIT:Customer Service: 5 StarsExtremely good customer service! I was offered a refund and it was a very easy process."
"The case is great! it fits comfortably in the pocket and the battery lasts for weeks. The specs say 30 hours of battery life, and I believe it.The ear buds are very comfortable. I can wear them for hours and it does not make my ears itch or get annoying. The battery on the buds is incredible. I took an 8 hour flight, and the buds worked the entire time.They don't make a good seal with my ear canal. Maybe that makes them comfortable, but it means noise leaks through. I fly a lot, and I can clearly hear the airplane engine. I have had other in ear buds with way more effective noise cancelling. Good noise cancelling should prevent me from having a conversation with other people, not the case with these.When I am talking on the phone, the other party says I sound muffled. If I am giving them my address or phone number, I sometimes have to take them off and talk directly on the phone so that the other party hears the numbers."
"I recently lost my apple earbuds and started using my much lower priced backup earbuds until I could replace the apples. I saw that theses were marked down 76% and offered noise cancellation which my apples, being older, didn't have so I got them. After charging them up they paired and connected quickly and easily. I thought they sounded a bit tinny so I started comparison testing them against my other  earbuds of the same price that don't have noise cancellation.  As far as noise cancellation goes I couldn't tell any difference.  Sound wise the upper frequencies are OK if a bit tinny but there is very little bass compared to my backups. I can see now why they are 76% off. I'm just going to return them and buy some new apples."
"These are decent earbuds, but they could be better. The biggest negative is that they don't connect to headless BTE transmitters that don't have a user interface. You can only connect to BTE via devices like phone/computer that have a GUI where you can select which BTE device to connect to.Also, when I connect them to my laptop, the sound cuts in/out and I get random disconnects. I have other headphones that work perfectly with this laptop. Otherwise, I use it with my phone and it works well. The range seems limited though. I have to keep the phone with me if I'm moving around the house.Sound quality is surprisingly good though."
Comfortable and connect well via Bluetooth but the sound quality isn't great. Turned up all the way on a plane I still have a hard time hearing. When listening to podcasts the sound just isn't that good. I have had several other brands with better sound for around the same price.
NO comparison to Apple. :-(Although there are extra ear bud tips included they seem to be the same size.The buds fall out randomly.When they are get loose if you try to put them back in securely you interrupt your music or worse hang up on a call. Very frustrating. There is no rhythm or reason to the touching of the buds. Some times you lose the call and other times you can’t replicate the “touch” to disconnect a call  when you want to. And the charging cord came split. See pic.
"The sound quality is good but in no way would I say these are noise cancelling!  The first time I used these I went on my typical run and could hear the leaves crunch under my feet.  I thought maybe because of the hard steps I was taking while running so I tried a gen when I took my dog for a walk and could hear everything around me just fine, unless I turned up the volume.  I’ll be returning these for ones with better noise cancellation."
"they have good bass, but they are wide, i would rather have slimmer and longer peice going into the eat, i tried thinner rubber pieces in the insertion point, but still wide"
"Every time I’m at the gym working out, one or both pods fall out of my ears in the middle of a set.  My ears are small so if yours are small, beware.  The sound is good and the battery life is good.  Sometimes, one side doesn’t want to work (no sound) so I put it back in the case and take it out again and then they both work."
"I didn't have too high of expectations due to the cheap price, but the battery life and sound quality are amazing. I rated it 3-stars due to the earbuds not always staying in. I'm usually sitting at my desk when using them and always find myself having to adjust them or they'll fall out. This product definitely limits when and how I can use them."
"They work fine, but the soft part is very thin so they’re not very comfortable. Can’t wear them for long."
"The A90Pro are a cheap, affordable alternative to earbuds.Wireless earbuds with dual digital battery status indicators, LED power indicators. The A90 Pro is one of the ""cheap"" wireless earbuds in the market , with a modern design and a ""decent"" sound quality of highs and lows frequency's.The ANC + ENC Technology can block 40%? (Not 90%, as advertised) of external noises."
Great sound and connectivity only thing is volume is difficult to control as well as other features
"I like to listen to music and podcasts at night, when the surrounding sound is quiet. But these earbuds completely mute when my Samsung phone volume goes below 8, which I means I have to listen to the volume slightly too loud. Not a major thing for people who don't have sensitive ears, but definitely annoying. I've never seen this before in a pair of earbuds. They were easy to pair and seem to have a decent battery life though, so if you like to crank your volume up anyway go for it!Update: a bit annoying but I did find a fix. Downloaded a free app called wavelet and played around with the gain control channel balance sliders. I can turn them down and it's easy to put them back to normal volume limits again if I need to. One more app clogging up my phone but at least they're usable now."
"These seem to be quite adequate as earbuds.  However, the ANC feature apparently only functions while listening to an audio input.  I could detect no  noise cancelling when powered on, without an audio input.  I am looking to cancel background noise, when not listening to an audio input."
"I didn’t like the sound quality, but for the price they do the job."
They are ok but sometimes the other party can’t hear me when talking
Iwatchh football in my IPad and the rest of the family isn’t interested
"Music sounds amazing but the noise cancelling feature makes it very difficult to have a phone conversation. My voice sounds so muffled in my ears, like trying to hear your own voice if you were wearing foam plugs and putter hearing protection.I’ll switch back to my Powerbeats for phone use."
You get what you pay for. The music quality sounds muddled. Good for podcasts I suppose. To be fair I'm comparing to the sound quality of two other different pairs of over ear and on ear headphones MPOW and JBL respectively.
Not my best purchase. Went back to wired headphones.
"Don't care so much that it's plastic - makes it lighter and stays in your ear with zero issue and never falls out.  Comfortable fit.I have had friends complain in the past when I'm talking to them while wearing the iPhone (noise cancelling) version - but nothing like this.  They can barely hear me, and the outside noise overpowered the call.I will keep them as they are inexpensive, and while commuting, I need something to block out the noise around me (cuz I hate people...lol).GREAT product - could be better."
"You can find better in the $20-$30 range. Right out of the box, my first impression was cheap Chinese earbuds from TEMU.  I would definitely prefer my earbuds from ""soundcore"""
Short battery life span
"These were cheap, and it shows. sound is poor, but I needed a pair that it wouldn’t matter if I destroyed them at work so they get the job done."
Haven't figured out how to pair them to my cell phone yet. The instructions are so tiny it's hard to view. I have grandchildren coming over soon to get their help.
It's not what I wanted. Only the microphone is noise cancelling. You can still hear everything going on around you very clearly. Read the product title carefully! Otherwise it seems to work fine.
"I usually don't write reviews but I had to say something about this product.  Love the sound quality for this headphones, but this thing is EXTREMELY SLIPPERY.. It slips out my ears every minute, no exaggeration. When it is slipping out, if you're on a call, your slightest touch ends the call. Very annoying! I tried changing the buds itself from the biggest to the smallest. It doesn't matter. Know this will not stay in your ears especially if you're working out, forget it! 🤷‍♀️"
"So, the bass SHOCKED me. Really good bass in this. The sound is nice and clear. Only complaint is slight lag in voice and sound."
"If you're looking for budget earbuds that fit well and have good noise cancellation, then these earbuds may fit the bill. Don't expect the sound quality to be great. They're good at most. Exactly what you'd expect from a $30 pair. I'll use them as a backup pair but will put down more money for a better pair."
No active noise cancellation. Bluetooth drops out often.  Charger case is cool.Doesn’t compare to more expensive headphones.
"On Android, I get the battery life of the headphones which is nice.  The multifunctional button doesn't seem consistent, it activates google assistant or changes the volume.  But I can't get it to pause or reply my song.  The manual doesn't cover anything about the MFB other than it's location.With the expectation of inexpensive headphones to replace my beats, they aren't bad but you get what you pay for. I wouldn't pay than 30 for these.The headphones work about 20 feet away from my phone but as soon as the distance is too far, one hear goes out and the other one doesn't play at normal speed.  The ears don't seem to talk to each other.I'll try in my work iPhone and update that experience later."
"Not much ANC. Music sounds ok for earbuds that are no more than $30, not $89."
Work fine but I really can’t not detect the noise canceling as advertised
Sounds quality is not the best but works.better than a sharp stick in the eye!!!!_.
They are ok for the price don't really stay in your ears
They’re not bad. Just the features are out of wack
"Good sound. But are hard to get in and out of the case. And they are NOT noise canceling. Overall decent for the price, but don't count on any noise cancellation. They are near useless in a noisy environment."
POD case hold a charge for a long time. Sound quality isn’t the best  (have to turn the volume up too much at the gym) - but not terrible for the price.
"These work but the sound quality and max volume is average to say the least. The battery life is also nothing like advertised. Spend that bit more on genuine Apple Earpods, it's night and day."
The sound quality of this product was much less than what I anticipated. I bought it trusting all the positive remarks from product listing. I am planning to return this soon.
Sound feels good. However 3rd time using it and the rubber ear attachment fell off. That’s a first for me.
"I'm disappointed with these earbuds. The sound is very tin-ny. There is no base at all, and it sounds like you're listening inside a tin can. I'll use them for listening to podcasts, but not for music.I was also disappointed with the instruction book. They mention a ""MFB Button."" Do they tell you what MFB stands for? I had to google it. The first thing that came up was ""Mother - bad word -  that ends in ing, and then another bad word to describe a female dog. I had to do more searching, and then I find out it means ""Multi Function Button."" But it isn't a ""button."" It turns out it is like a touch area for your fingerprint. A button would be physical, like something you press.I had a hard time connecting, and I kept trying to push the MFB button, because I didn't know what MFB stood for. It is a bad user experience when skimp on the user's manual when they use acronyms, and expect you to know what it means.The other thing about the instruction book, is that the text is so small, it is unreadable without a magnifying glass. I had to use the camera on my phone to blow up the text large enough to read it."
"These earbuds are OK. I bought them as backup airpods because I thought they would also have a noise canceling feature for playing music or podcasts -- but it doesn't exist and its not in their manual. Now reading this description more carefully, only the mic has noise canceling when making phone calls. I would have made a different purchase if I had realized that."
"Close but not close enough to Apple AirPods.  These almost fit perfectly but because they don’t, they’re apt to fall out."
The volume does not satisfy the loudness I get with my other wireless headphones. Seems quite low.
"I mean, they work and serve their purpose but they don’t stay in my ears and after while it makes my ears really sore. Sound is super loud and bass is decent. I just wish they’d stay in my ears so I don’t have to adjust them every 20 seconds."
Not bad for the price.  Definitely won’t last kinda cheap
"I think these buds stop working effectively after a small amount of time. Maybe mine is one of the defective devices .. I dunno. But the sound stops working in the left ear (fully charged mind you) then the right ear stops working. I get soo frustrated on these things. Spending my hard earned dollars and anticipating the arrival only to get disappointed. I wish I could send the device back for refund, but my 30 days are up. And that's what I'm talking about on defective devices. Some stop after 30 days and some keep working with no issues. Anyhoot... I'm stuck with this device working when it wants to or not. Oh well"
Dis function only one ear work now..
"Decent battery life, quick charge, 8/10 sound, durable but microphone does not work. Another negative is that there is no pause/play tap feature."
I liked how good the sound quality was but man these are not comfortable.
Bass over powering Bluetooth connectivity range not as good as my other Bluetooth ear buds
"These ear buds seem to be pretty good far. Although I had a cheaper set and I've yet to see much difference in them, other than the prices. So I can't really give a good review so far."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            but now the charging case won’t shut off for about 5 minutes.
"I expected more from these ear buds.  They don’t last very long. I thought they’d be better for driving but they just don’t last long enough.I’ll use them at home but for the driving I need to do, they aren’t for me."
"There good if your getting them to listen to YouTube or podcasts etc. However, if yo are looking to get these primarily to use for talking, I suggest looking elsewhere. It's hard to hear and it sounds like you are in the back of a room with a mic in the front."
"These ear buds worked very well the first week or so. Then, after being in the charger and going unused for about two weeks, they no longer worked: the audio cut in and out. The manual is no use, since it simply advises to put them back in the charger, remove them from the bluetooth setting on the phone, then re-pair them. I did that many times. The Result was they began to work briefly, then cut in and out again."
"These wireless earbuds are every easy to use and have excellent battery life. However, the sound is tinny....virtually no bass."
"Mix feelings, I have some ear piercing makes the ear bud uncomfortable besides that like them"
"I purchased these Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones as a temporary replacement while waiting for the new AirPod Pros. For the price, they’re decent. The earbuds are comfortable, and the noise-canceling feature is adequate for daily use. The sound quality is acceptable, though it can be a bit echoey, particularly during calls. However, for a budget option, it’s sufficient.The major downside is the connectivity. Switching between devices is a hassle. If I want to use them with a different device than the last one they were connected to, I have to manually disconnect from the previous device. For instance, if they were last connected to my laptop, I need to dig out my laptop, wake it up, and disconnect the earbuds before I can connect them to my phone. This is a significant inconvenience, especially when you’re on the go.Overall, they serve the purpose if you’re looking for something affordable and temporary, but the poor device-switching functionality might be a dealbreaker for some."
"Bought the wireless earbuds as a backup for my Bose QC II ear buds. After charging these earbuds, I was able to connect them to my iPhone without any hassles. In playing music via Amazon music (downloaded as high quality), there's very little bass with these ear buds as compared to my Bose QC IIs. Actually it's night and day difference, so I'll leave these in my car and only use them on workouts where I forgot my Bose ear buds at home."
"I purchased these as an alternative to bulky hot headset for my computer, but then realized a major delay in the audio to the videos I was trying to watch. Then I thought maybe these would just be better for phone... they are, but still noticed a slight delay for the audio for the video I was watching. Mind you, very slight. So I would say these are good for music, audio books, and podcasts. Just don't watch videos with these as the main audio source."
Great sound.  But earbud covers were left out.  Needed smaller covers to stay in my ears.
"I started having trouble with the earbuds holding a charge. I checked everything to make sure it was connected but within twenty minutes of use, the right one would announce low battery and die. The left one stayed on longer but after an hour it, too, gave the ""low battery"" warning. I found the charging bars lit up for a few seconds before going dark and the charge reads 100 constantly, even when they're dead. I have another pair without mic that I plugged into the same cable and it's working fine. So it's the device itself. I will be returning these for a refund."
"I bought these ear buds because most reviews said they were good and the description claimed they are water resistant. (I sweat a lot) However, after wearing them to workout for only two months the right side already doesn’t work. I can’t return them now because I missed the window by 3 days. So they were great until they weren’t. Very disappointing."
The product connect to phone without issue.. it’s when I receive/make a call that the connection is full of static and neither myself nor the person on the other end can hear clearly. If you ONLY want to use to listen to music/videos they work fine for that
"My first ear buds. I like the little charging box. The ear buds stay in my ears, the sound is good but.I got this to watch my new fire tv with blue tooth.I starting using them and the lag is terrible."
"They fit well, sound good. No charger cord is no bueno..."
"I so wanted to like these earbuds but I just can’t.They are NOT water proof. I used them in the shower and one stopped working. I wouldn’t be bothered except the item title actually says IP7 waterproof.They are the opposite of noise canceling. (Which actually isn’t a bad thing if that’s what you’re looking for.) But not as described.Lastly, the mic for taking calls is so poor, you can’t really have a conversation."
These are perfectly fine ear buds but I bought them for noise cancellation which doesn’t work well at all and missed the return window so I’m stuck with them. On every call background noises are prevalent.
I got them and plugged them in for an hour and paired them and played one song and already at 70%. Completely disappointed. 20$ is cheap yes but to die so quick not worth it.
"Sound quality seems nice, but I have small ears and am on the search of earbuds that won’t fall out my ears…these fell out of my ears"
I like the sound quality from these earbuds but unfortunately after only a couple of months they seem to be giving out. The left earbud sound constantly cuts out and I have to wiggle both earbuds around for it to cut back in and it’s getting progressively worse even at full charge. I would not purchase these again or recommend them.
"When I receive a phone call, my earbuds don't provide any indication that there's an incoming call. Is this normal behavior for these earbuds? If there's no notification, ringing, or other signal that a call is pending, then these earbuds aren't what I expected."
"I guess where it is windy, it keeps getting disconnected from my phone."
"These don't stay in the ear, the soft, thin tips allow them to slip out very soon after putting them in. If you buy them, you should look at buying a better replacement tip!"
"You get what you pay for. If quality of sound doesn't matter, then these are for you. The sound has a tinny brassy quality. They fit comfortably in the ear, once you can figure out how to get them to stay in."
"See above,lt says it all"
"Well, I just received my earbuds yesterday 08/07/24 afternoon, so so far so good. I have tried them most of falling day l,at this point I do like them still trying to get use to the features. So I had to return my earbuds because they would not stay in my ear,not only that I had to keep readjusting them and they still would fall,very irritating. The sound was great. They to redesign the earbud altogether."
"Only the right earbud will turn on. I have charged them overnight in the case to make sure it wasn't;t the battery level but the left earbud is still not turning on or lighting up when opening the case. I have searched many youtube videos trying to figure out why only one earbud is working but all the tips they give do not work. If somebody could enlighten me as to how to turn on the left earbud I would appreciate, otherwise I'm going to have to return them."
Wore these sporadically for about 3 weeks when the left ear stopped working. I did all the troubleshooting in the website and even bought an earbud cleaner (while they are still pristine and I didn’t think it would solve the issue). Occasionally the left earbud would connect enough of a connection to get a slight charge but that was only a slight charge for 30 seconds. I gave up completely and tried to contact the company— don’t bother because the phone number amazon provided and also on the website is no longer in service and there’s no way to contact the seller. Yet these are still cheap and offered for sale on Amazon. Buyer beware and don’t waste your money.
Sound quality horrible.
These worked good for about two weeks..then one earbud suddenly just stopped working. The other still works but i have to buy a new pair now. Not sure what happened with mine but wouldn’t recommend
"At the low price, you get what you pay for!$23 for the item is probably what it is worth.  The sound quality is poor. I would not purchase again."
I mostly use the Earbuds at the gym.. got this one because of the good reviews and had them on at the gym for 4-5 days.. they were not staying in my ears and were falling off every 4-5 minutes.. so annoying
After a month can’t talk only listen
"While using ear buds, they would drop out of Bluetooth connection.  Also, found it difficult to make connection.  If these problems didn't exist I would have kept them but they didn't fit well in my ears so couldn't wear them while moving, such on a walk."
I was really excited about these at first. Seemed to be a great deal and just a few weeks in I started to have lots of connection issues. I actually wanted to return them and the return window closed yesterday.
Very difficult to open the case it's so slippery and the opening is flush with the case and it slips out of your fingers. Couldn't get it to pair. No buttons on the earbuds and the earbuds don't fit right. Returning.
I went through the instuctions three times and see nothing about noice cancelling. I can still hear everything outside. I wanted noice cancelling because i live at the noisiest intersection in town
The audio through the set I had was like Mickey Mouse squeaky.
They work just fine.. they just won’t stay in. It’s annoying to have to readjust every 30 seconds
Voice is good.  But it's bud hurts my ears.
"For moving around and exercise this is great, it stay in place. Good sound. I have difficulties switching between my phone and laptop. Often, I have to reboot the laptop to pair."
"Uncomfortable, very poor sound quality. Extremely disappointed!"
This are very comfortable and stay on however the sound is very 'tin can' unless I press them into my ear and keep them there with my hands. I tried all 3 sizes of the tips. The latency in my TV setup was .1 sec which didn't seem that bad for lip sync but I need more bass to make it enjoyable to watch.
I liked the way they fit. I didn’t like the way the speakers would cut out from side to side and then disconnect with my phone in my pocket the whole time.
Only one side of these headphones works at a time
"TL;DR - sound is just ok, scared they will fall out of my ears at any moment, battery life is amazing. Save your money.The fit is not great. Don’t expect these things to stay in your ears, like, at all. They fall out constantly, even if you have the right size on them. Definitely don’t wear them where they could fall into something (drains, grates, toilets…). If you’re sitting at a desk not moving or chewing food/gum, you’ll be fine. The sound is just ok as well. Not much range to them. Yes, you can download the app and control the equalizer a bit, but there’s not much low end/range at all. Overall, the sound is just ok.  The battery life is AMAZING. The battery in these things last forever. Gotta give credit where credit is due.I’ve been a fan of JBL for other products they’ve made and I was really excited about these earbuds. Overall, I’m pretty disappointed with them. I had some cheaper ($24) off brand ones that worked for a long time (until my toddler lost one) and sounded just as good as these more expensive JBLs."
"JBL got a lot of things right with these. There's three different 'listening modes' where you're able to adjust how the earbuds operate - my favorite feature of which is the active listening mode. The earbuds will pass outside audio in your environment through into your buds so you're able to hear people around you and conversate. There is zero lag and compared to other buds I've had with this feature, these do it the best.The case is also really nice. I love the hinge and shape of it. I haven't had these very long due to this stay-in-ear issue but in comparison to other similar products, this earbud-charging case is everything you'd expect in $100 earbuds. The app, connection, packaging, and case all nail it but these freaking earbuds WILL NOT STAY IN MY EAR!!Now, I've seen a few other reviews with this issue and figured they must've not been doing something correctly before I purchased so I went ahead and bought them. Every one of these reviews critiquing JBL on this issue has JBL replying saying ""oh you have to find the right ear tips for the correct fit, then they'll fit snug!""I'm telling you right now, they do not fit snug whatsoever. If you're looking for some earbuds for anything but sitting still, these are sadly not the ones. They fall out of my ear standing out of my chair, walking, even just after a while they loosen up and eventually fall out. I would never bring these to the gym, let alone use them on a walk. Your mileage may vary because occasionally you do get a good fit but for the most part I'm probably going to return them because the only real thing these have going for them (aside from really doing all the supportive things, case, app, etc very well) is the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) abilities. It is plenty good enough for plane rides and other similar situations. Overall I'm pretty disappointed tbh.All in all I really am dumbfounded that JBL produced such a great product and biffed it all up by not realizing the severity of this tip issue. At first when looking at these I was thinking its not the shape of the tips that's the issue but the material. Though I'm not really sure. It may also be the shape of the earbuds themselves, idk, or maybe a combination across the board. Unfortunately the tips for other brands don't really fit on these so I'm not sure what to do."
So ive had my JBL Tune buds for about a month now and i’m going to give a honest review when I first bought them I were absolutely in love I mean the sound quality is absolutely amazing! Inlove how they aren’t easily visible they have the best bass and the noise canceling effect is the best in the game I love the way you can tap the right side to either achieve noise canceling or awareness or talk thru those are game changers .. HOWEVER !! NO MATTER WHAT SIZE YOU HAVE AFTER A WEEK THWY WILL NOT STAY IN YOUR EAR!! this pet peeve is what makes my review 3 out of 5 these things will fall out in seconds which ultimately reduces the quality of these earbuds simply love your head to the right bd theyll fall out not kidding for that reason alone dont buy these I mean if you dont mind them falling out every 2 seconds thats fine but honestly go with the beats earbuds instead lol . because these things will fall out in a jiffy.
"Pros:Reputation Brand NameGood sound with JBL Headphone appPlenty of bass with JBL Headphone appCONS:FitBluetooth disconnectsI purchased these after mt galaxy bud 2 died, due to one bud falling out into my pool last year then finally died about a month ago.My primary use for ear buds is listening to music while doing yard work (mowing, weed eating, edging) and during pool maintenance (brushing the walls and vacuuming).When I first received these, I downloaded the app and they paired nicely with no issues. Capsule charge was at 75% while both buds were at 100%.Next I tried placing them in my ears. When i placed them in my ears and turn them counterclockwise the weren't very comfortable and felt loose like they were going to fall out, however they did say in place when i tilted my head to either side and shook my head. These earbuds are supplied additional ear cushions. I tried the bigger ones and for my ears these were too big for my ear canal and would not stay in very well. I tried the smaller ones and these wouldn't hold in place. I'd like to say they were like Goldilocks and the 3 bears, but none were just right. The closest for me were the medium size, but I still didn't trust them staying in while doing yard work.Today was the first day I've had to really put them to the test. I place them in and fiddle with them for a bit to get a ""snug"" fit. The only way I could achieve this was by turning them so that the J in the JBL logo was at about a 180 degrees facing upwards.I started Spotify and proceeded to start the yard work. I noticed myself constantly fiddling with the earbud, because the kept feeling like the were going to fall out, enough so that I kept activating the voice pass through.After about a hour and a half into the yard work I was met with a bluetooth disconnected message. When I looked at my phone (Samsung galaxy s23 ultra) it showed bluetooth was enabled and the buds were paired. I started Spotify again and the music resumed. So I was like ok????I did about another 2 hrs of yard work and they stayed connected, but I still constantly felt they were going to fall out.With today's experience, I will not be using these near my poolWould I recommend these to a friend? Probably notDo i think these were worth what I paid for them? No, with the fit issue, these should cost closer to $19.99"
"Had these for a few weeks now.No matter how much I twist the earbud, or what size ear tip I put on the bud, it continually falls out of my ear. The noise cancellation sounds almost no better than without it. The talk through mode allows you to hear other people with your earbuds in, but you can’t even hear yourself, so it defeats the purpose of having them in and trying to talk. Putting them into talk through mode also mutes the music, so there is just about no way to effectively talk and listen  with them in.I do like the buttons on them though because of the customization and how easily they respond to a tap. The battery life is also great I’ve only had to charge them about twice and they’ve lasted weeks which is great.Overall would not buy again or recommend. Not worth the price and does not live up to the brand."
"I lost my awesome older paid of JBL's that I swore by... even have had three people purchase them from my recommendations because I loved them. After losing mine I went on and saw there was a new design which was a bit more expensive but seemed like the newest would be best, right? WRONG!!!! I don't know what happened or why the entire design changed but it is not useable for me. No matter what little ear attachment I used it wont fit, small one falls out very easily and the others wont fit in my ear. The design is confusing and I have to sit there and figure out how to get it fit right just for it to fall out moments later... and I work at a desk it's not like I'm even up around moving. Seriously wish I had just bought the old design because now I have a more expensive product that I can't even use. Will not be recommending JBL after this one unless they put some effort into getting this design under control"
"Loved these for the first week I had them. The noise cancelling and sound quality is really great - better than airpods IMO. That said, I have been through several pairs of Apple airpods in the last year, and cannot stand the fact that I constantly deal with any of my pairs not charging each air pod equally - often leaving one dead and one charged, only to never be able to revive the dead one. Nothing worse than showing up to a workout and only having 1 charged airpod...These JBLs worked / fit great for the first week of working out. I typically run a few miles on the treadmill and then do weights.. and I sweat...a lot. These stayed in my ears for the first week or so but it's like they lost their fit / ability to stay in my ear. SO much so that they were straight up falling out when I ran last weekend. This wasn't an issue in the beginning... And now I am constantly adjusting them every minute to keep them from falling out. I tried the different ear piece sizes and nothing works.Onto the next brand to try out..."
"The sound quality is very tinny, not as good as my no-name $30 ear buds! Which I was hoping these would replace. They also don’t stay in my small ears very well. I find myself often needing to push them back in, and if I’m doing DuoLingo or on a call and I have to push the right one backIn, my music sometimes comes on. Which is very annoying! And then I lost the damn things so the return window closed and I’m stuck with them now. As backups, they’re not the worst but they’re not replacing my no-name cheapie ear buds like I was hoping they might!"
"First off, I really like the way these buds sound. I really enjoyed the eq portion of the app and option to find lost earbuds, being that I've lost more buds than I'm comfortable with. My issue came a couple of days ago. One of the buds fell out of my ear, and onto the tile floor. Now it won't produce sound. It charges and pause still works when you press it, but no sound comes out. I'm pretty disappointed 😞"
"When bought these earbuds on oct. 22 i really loved them. They sounded amazing but as of now December 4, the right earbud has lowered in quality and now has low audio and rumbles. I was really happy with the product and hoped it would last longer then 2 months. I really expected jbl to hit the mark with these but sadly they just aren't it if you want long term earbuds."
"They are ok at best. But the most disappointing thing about them is they don’t fit well in my ears. I changed the ear piece so they fit better but instead just keep falling out any time I move my head. The other two sizes don’t fit at all.The noise canceling is ok, it’s more of a noise reducing effect rather canceling. I can still hear everything and can’t hear my shows/movies, it’s even worse for music. The music sound is horrible!! If it gets too loud outside I have to turn the volume all the way up and it’s already very high and even then it’s hard to hear, except  when the movie/show gets super loud then it’s deafeningIf you bought them at half off then it’s ok but not at full price of $100"
"I needed in ear Bluetooth headphones. I have in ear word Sonys that I love. But wrestling with the wires is annoying. I don’t like the Apple ones because there is a bar that sticks out. They don’t feel secure. I bought these with the tiniest memory foam tips that fit (3rd party). They settle nicely in my left ear, but I have to work very hard to get them seated in my right ear. Yes, I’ve cleaned my ears. Once it’s seated, there is some passive noise cancelling. Not nearly as good as my in ear Sonys. The active noise cancelling works well, but a baby’s scream does irritate. I’ve kept them, because I love the ability to adjust my own EQ. The app is fantastic. I just wish the stem were slightly smaller. If you have small ear canals, look elsewhere."
After 3 months of having them. The more you use them the sound reduces to barely audible. I used them while at the airport/on a plane and by the time my flight was over I couldn’t hear anything. After about 3 hours of listening the sound is so low it’s inaudible with more than 50% charge left and recharging them doesn’t help. I just put them in the charger and wait a day.
"They keep a good charge. The noise cancelling is very good. The price is right. My only problem is none of the three sizes of interchangeable bud covers really fit my ear. The second I start moving around too quickly, moving my jaw, or swallowing anything, the seal starts to break, and they start trying to work their way out.Caveat: I think I have a weird shaped ear canal. I also have trouble finding ear plugs that work well for me. So, the fit issue may not be something most people will have. I mostly use them for walking to work and other low intensity activities—i.e. they aren’t my gym headphones—so, for my purpose they do work well enough."
"They’re not very comfortable in your ears or stay in even when changing the sizes. I got these in Aug 24, it’s now Nov 24 and the left bud is no longer working. First it said low battery after charging all night and now it sounds like it’s in a can under water. Save your money."
"The fit is not great. I wouldn't leave the house with them. They fall loose and out constantly. The volume doesn't get that loud, for those that like to play their music loudly. I'd say they're good for just around the house and not moving around much. Even chewing food with them in will make them come loose and fall out. The functionality is perfect though. Does everything stated and easy to use. Glad is purchased them while they were 50% off. Otherwise, I'd say they're not worth it. For me, not comfortable at all. 3 stars, cause they do what they say and function how they are supposed to, but just don't stay in ear."
"Pros:My workmates say I sound good on Teams calls, always a plusIt does do noise cancelling, not as well as say a $300 pair of ear buds, but you can tell the difference.Connects quickly and without fuss once you have made the bluetooth connection.Cons:They fall out of my ears without to much effort, regardless of which size rubber cover I used. I mean, like sitting at my desk effort, not running/walking etc.Volume control is not well managed without the app on your phone. Problem is, I use it on my pc, not my phone. They could do with more bass by default, shouldnt need the app to mange that.Overall, I would get a different style of earbud, probably more like the style Apple prefers."
"These have great features and really great sound, but these will not stay in my ear for anything.  I have tried at least a dozen different things to get them to stay in my ear when I am walking around.  When setting, no problem.  The noise cancelling actually works really well."
"The sound is above standard for the price, the battery is great for the price, and they look good. However, they have a tendency to fall out (yes I have tried all the ear pieces included) and if they don’t fall out they feel like it and shift around so you have to constantly adjust them. The sound canceling feature is barely noticeable. The button are also hyper sensitive so you tend to alternate between sound cancel and ambient sound. The case is so annoying, it constantly opens if you move a certain way and the ear buds fall out. Overall, I would not recommend buying these unless you were broke like me."
"These work and sound great, but the user experience is diminished by their boxiness and short bud that doesn't hold in the ear very well. My wife and 3 kids agree on the poor fit issues, even after showing them that they were wearing them sideways. I slipped while fishing and both popped out into the weeds, no fun to find! Not good for running or jarring work"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Connectivity is great and fast. Very comfortable. Compatible with my laptops and phone  (Acer and Lenovo and Samsung), value for money with good battery life. Charges quickly when it worked.So these earbuds are great. However, as stated in the video, the case stopped charging which now makes the buds completely useless. Definitely a manufacturing fault somewhere. I do recommend them but just beware there is a chance you would be buying new ones in a few weeks if not returning them."
"Great sound and battery life, however... as many have mentioned, they tend to fall off often. Also, the touch controls are way too sensitive and when you try to set the earbuds back in your ear you end up messing with the settings."
"The audio and noise cancelling on these are great, they have nice audio mixing options! BUT the tap feature on the ear buds is WAY too sensitive. I have long hair and if it brushes the sides of the earbuds AT ALL it turns the noise cancelling on and off constantly which is very annoying. I guess they'll be great for if you have short hair and you're sitting totally still most of the time, but I wanted to use them while outdoors working out and they're not great for that.I'm happy I don't have to press a button into my ear like other earbuds with skip functions, but there needs to be a better happy medium. The ambient sound feature does make me feel a bit safer for walking outside though, so that's good. 3/5. Does the job but has some flaws."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            My gf bought me a pair a few years ago.I lost them and bought a new pair to replace them. ( i since then found the old ones)The case and actual earbuds are bigger. Maybe the charge last longer idk. But my main problem is the new case's magnet is much weaker and are constantly opening and coming out of the case in my pocket. In the video the new case is on the left
"These headphones would be perfect if they would just stay in my ear. Even small movements can cause them to fall out. Battery life is not what I thought it would be, but it's not bad."
They will not stay in at all. The second I start walking or move my head I have to readjust them so they don’t fall out. Other then that the sound quality is great.
"These wireless/bluetooth JBL headphones are amazing. Sound is great, quality is good, battery life is excellent, BUT…the design and fit are lacking! They don’t fit in my ears well and are constantly falling out. I’ve tried all three of the ear cushion sizes, but they’re all uncomfortably, don’t fit exactly, and fall out frequently. The AirPod Pro design is just far superior to this wonky design. Gotta admit, a little bummed."
"Well, put me in with the ""lousy fit"" folks. I tried all 3 tips and none of them was a good fit. I even took the tips off an older pair that fits like a glove, didn't make a difference. I think the speaker stem 1. Not long enough and 2. The diameter is too big. However, I'm only using them house to watch TV while not disturbing my wife's sleep. She works normal people hours, while I live on a swing /night shift schedule. I agree they sound pretty good for the price. They're not Bose, but we're talking ear buds. The Bose that I listened to were almost130 more and the difference wasn't enough to justify the cost. Just a tip, but if you get a little water on your finger and rub it around ear tip it should solve or at least help the problem with a loose tips.  One thing I didn't care for was the earbuds have no volume control, so you're limited to the volume control on whatever your device is. At this point I may return them, we'll see."
The fit isn't as secure as I would like it. Tried different sizes of rubber inserts. Sound quality isn't as good as I thought it would be either.
"I have tried all three sizes of tips and they just will not stay in place securely. I was using them for yardwork and light activity and one or both would constantly come loose or fall out. Sound, connection, voice features are all fine but useless if I can't wear them and do anything physical like walking. Looking for replacement tips or new buds altogether."
"They have decent sound, but their volume is on the low side compared to other earbuds. The mic noise cancellation is impressive, but they don't fit well into my ears. Even after trying all the tips that come with them and trying to accommodate them on my ears, they keep falling while walking, so the ANC doesn't really work for me."
After using them every day for around a month. The conclusion I've come to is I miss my Samsung ear beans. These don't compare to them. If your looking for earbuds my opinion is just get the Samsung ones.
"I've been using these since i got them around August. it's now November and these don't hold a charge, they'll be in the fully charged case or even in a charging case for DAYS and still, every time I go to use them within 10 minutes I hear ""battery low""I've cleaned the ports and whatnot, it's just super disappointing."
without adding the eq the sound is flat. To add EQ it requires a release of my info to deeply and to many questions etc.
"Purchased these JBL Tune Buds a few weeks ago as I had misplaced my Javbra 5 Buds and needed a quick and inexpensive replacement.Here are my observations:Fit - I am of average ear size (I think).  I tried all three sizes of bud that came with the packaging. The medium size fit best but by best, I mean just adequate. The silicon buds were cheap feeling and lacked any stiffness that might have helped secure them better to my ear and helped/assisted the ANC when turned on.Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) - I live in a metropolitan area that is chronically loud.  If  you live in a quieter area, these might work for you.  For me, the ANC is poor to adequate and I suspect the ill fitting bud plays into this factor.Software - I feel the software is mediocore at best. I use these buds for playing music and for remote meetings via MS TEAMs. Once the TEAMs meeting starts the software deactivates ANC and you are able to hear the ""ambient' sounds from your surrounding environment.  I can hear the meeting participants fine but they complain that they have trouble hearing me. They tell me that the barely hear my voice and instead hear the noise around me. Not sure of the logic making this ""auto ANC off"" for meetings a thing with the buds/software. Ultimately, I just listen and don't offer much feedback because it ends up being a distraction.Talk - On individual calls, friends and family hear me fine.Meetings - not recommended for meetings as the software is set to turn off ANC once a meeting begins.Gaming - I feel that young people could use these phones to game if they are in a quiet setting like their room.Price - I feel that these JBL Tune Buds were priced adequately around $50.Final Thoughts - If you are willing to pay $25 more I recommend Jabra 5 buds. Your ears will thank you for it."
Your target audience is old folks because they won't know better and will spend all night hunting the gd things.
They really don’t have much bass in them. I should have just got some “Beats by Dre” again.
"Good sound, nice color, app is okay. They will not stay in my ears!!!! I've tried every size of the silicone pieces that you can swap out and none of them keep them in. Had better luck with my old cheap tozo buds. Really disappointing."
Keeps falling out of my ear with little activity. Sometimes I dont even have to move.I've tried all the 3 buds that were supplied so I know it's not me.I had no such problems with the Tune 130NCHas good sound though
"I've used these for about 2 months.  I've never found a way to turn the headphones back on aside from having to put them in the case and take them out.  Not convenient if I don't take the case with me.  The right earbud also doesn't always seem to charge.  Other than that, the sound is good.  They stay in the ear well for the part.  I've had to make adjustments while running occasionally."
It was a  better sound than my cheap ones.  But Just walking around the house they would come loose and fall out.  Not really for gym use.  I usually use a wired headset.
"Lost my headphones on a plane in Colombia and had to get some new ones, was excited to try these out but they didn't wanna stay in my ear very well. I even tried all the different tips."
"About 55 dollars for me. None of the ear bud sizes fit properly and will shake lose with any headbanging or continual head jostling motions. Despite using the JBL App on my mobile to fiddle with functions, there is no way to disable the virtual assistant / voice command feature. If you don't like to accidentally call people, consider a different model or get used to not touching one of your ears while the product resides within one."
The buds are fantastic. I feel read played though as the second I got them they were 50 percent off on Amazon. And the reason I looked them up in the first place was because I had seen them on sale at one point. So I ordered them between the two sales. I share this in hopes other people don’t make my mistake. Great buds though.
"READ THE LOWER/1-STAR REVIEWS...wish I had.  I've tried all 3-sizes of adapters that come w/the earbuds in the factory box...NONE of them will keep the bud firmly in either ear.  They fall-out after a period of time, in the bathroom, at the sink, at my desk, on the floor.  I can't imagine running or trying to work-out in these things as they do NOT seat well inside your ear canal.  Again, doesn't matter which size  Aside from that, they're great.  I just have to re-work/twist/push them back into my ear every hour or so.  Just like the reviews say:  They will NOT stay in your ear."
"JBL is generally quality sound, so I had no issues with that. I mainly bought these so I could have a good quality noise-canceling earbud. Unfortunately, even with the 'perfect fit' 3 sizes supplied, none fit in my ear to secure them. The buds fell out every few seconds or when I bent over. As you can imagine with this insecure gap, the noise canceling from my ears wasn't much at all.Out of fear of losing them and not being able to use the noise canceling I unfortunately had to return."
These are ok once you get them in your ears. I find the case and buds hard to hold and bulky. I thought they were wireless but they are not and were disappointed when I realized they were not.Noise cancellation is ok. Quality of the sound is ok when in a quiet place but not in a crowded place or when walking.For the price they are fine but would not recommend or purchase again.
"The ear buds sound great.  Only complaint is that they constantly fall out of my ears.  If they would stay in, I would give a 4."
"These earbuds are pretty good, except for call sound quality. If you just pop one earbud in to take a phone call, you'll be asking the person to repeat themselves constantly, because you'll barely be able to hear them. Even with both earbuds in and noise cancelling turned on, the volume is far too low."
I have used these for a couple of months. I do not recommend them.  They can get the job done for music but thats about it. They are not a secure fit. Even with different ear buddy sizes. See cons when it comes to call quality.ProsDecent sound qualityFind my ear bud featureConsFor some reason on phone calls it becomes ambient aware or pass through. So people talking to me could hear EVERYTHING around me and get frustrated because it was so loud. I had to take calls in my car or buildings in a quiet place.If I was walking they would become loose and fall out. Definitely couldn't run or workout with these in. If I bent over it was a 50/50 I'd lose an ear bud. Constantly adjusting them made me go buy a different brand all together.
"They are back heavy so the design is not ideal for them staying in your ear on their own. Otherwise, they work great."
"They sound ok. Not amazingly impressed for a JBL product. I don't really write reviews often but these.. ppl should know. I love the battery life, I do like the tune in and out sounds mode.. but the 3 sizes of ear bud and shape of them are kinda bulky and one of my ears are I guess different then any 3 sizes of ear buds they offer... so since they don't have the extra stabilizing aspect of more cylicone that helps hold them in place... they fall out even walking sometimes. Especially when u fall on a skateboard... both... as I picked up my sunglasses and both ear buds in front of some elder couple in the middle of the toad..  I'd say they are a 6 out of 10..  sorry jbl. Always stayed true but you could do better.. Bass isn't very impressive and even loudness.. just solidly a 6 of 10."
"Product has amazing sound quality but fits poorly in my ears. Frequently falls out. Overall though,  happy with it."
"Sound quality is good and connectivity is easy. The vud themselves are super sensitive to touch- like if my hair even touches it, it pauses what I'm listening to which got annoying. These buds are BIG too....too big for my ears which I thought were pretty average size?"
"Would have gave it 1 but 3 stars for the battery life and the fact that it gets the job done. It ain't the best ear buds, sound is decent. Noise canceling is bad, and its ability to stay in my ear compared to previous ear buds (WF-1000XM4) I owned is terrible. This ear bud wants to hang out as far as possible to the edge for me to keep pushing it back in and when I do it hits the touch sensitive surface and does all kinds of stuff. I ended up changing the silicone tips to what I'm comfortable with and it doesn't make a difference. The design is nice but thats all it is ""nice,"" and inconvenient compared to what I expected."
"The sound is great, stays in well, and has a great battery life. The problem is, when it connects to my computer, I have to manually disconnect it from my computer in order to connect it to anything else."
These see horrible. Don’t stay in your ears. Do not block out sound. Very easy to connect but what’s the use. Would have returned them but the box was thrown out
Fits horribly in the ear and will fall out if you chew gum or move your head too much. Sound quality is good and the touch controls are Very responsive.
Sound is ok. Unconformable to wear. Feels like they are going to fall any time. My over a year old soundcore A1 earbuds have way better quality sound and wears more secure in the ears.
Sound goodSound deadening not so good
"I was very disappointed in the quality of sound coming from these buds.  I have gotten JBL ear buds in the past (that were tethered and stayed in my ears very comfortably) and the sound quality was excellent at half the price of this pair.  Also, I can;t get them to stay in my ears as I walk.  They continue to get loose and fall out or if I try to press them back they go on and off repeatedly.  It's very irritating.  But the quality of sound is terrible.  It sounds like an AM radio with no stereo.  Not really happy with these at all and feel like I've completely wasted my money.  I'm a disabled veteran and I can't afford to get others."
Pros: sound quality battery life amazing!! Love the deep base Love that they are water proof love the sound canceling modeCons: they don't stay secure in your ear..they will fall out.. and the touch sensitivity is too sensitive..any slight touch is pausing or skipping my music I am constantly having to worry about adjusting them
"Sound quality is just above average at this price range, bass is sharp and to the point, not too much not too low. Mid and treble are the way it sounds perfect for the music, movie and podcast.But the issue is, it's not fit in ear perfectly, it tends to fall down from ear after some time specifically if your ear sweats.I also noticed while talking over the phone for a ling time, for the jaw movement it tends to come out from the ears. I twice face the issue and they dropped from about 5'6"" height and survived.Now, the Ambient sound mode is just a trash. Very little or no sounds are hearable from even 5ft distance. Talk through can help in that case, but talk through make the volume lower by default and can't increase at a certain level.ANC works fine at this price range, but a hissing sound is there and sometimes feels annoying while in between songs. But don't expect too much from this ANC.I used a similar product from Soundcore which is Sound Core life note 3i.The ANC and Ambient aware from that device is far better than this one for sure."
"I loved these buds until I started using them.  They will not stay in my ears, regardless of the size tips I used. I think this is because they stick out of my ears a bit and gravity takes over.  I don't have that problem with buds that have stems so I am sadly returning them and Amazon will destroy them :-("
"As per usual for JBL across earbuds and speakers. Amazing sound quality, not nearly enough volume/way too quiet."
Did not fit well. Fell out very easily. Sound was ok. Felt cheap but for price so what!
"JBL is my preferred speaker brand and I have never had an issue with their speakers, until now. Sound quality is poor on these earbuds. They don’t have that usual clear and high bass quality that JBL is known for. They sound like very cheap speakers. They are so touch sensitive that they’ll hang up on a person if you adjust them in your ear while talking, which you inevitably will because they do not stay in your ears. Mic quality is good. Keeps a charge for a long time. I bought them for use while driving and in the gym- I can’t even wear them lounging around the house, they fall out. There’s no way they can be worn working out, you’d be stopping every couple minutes to adjust them or catch them falling out.  Don’t waste your money."
"Great sound, great price, but will NOT stay in. They use the typical ear bud tips, but something about the weight or proportion of these is off, and they won't stay in for long. Be careful not to use them somewhere you won't be able to retrieve them!"
I got this trying to take the cheap route and not purchase Apple AirPods again after losing them yet again(😆) and they’re ok with music but not so great on phone calls. Sometimes the other party can’t hear me. They complain of me sounding low and I can sometimes not hear them at all
These have good bass but they don't get loud enough and really didn't fit my ears well.
"Don't get me wrong, these are decent earphones. On par with the good sounding off brand $30 sets. Big difference is that they have features that help with ambient sounds and has noise canceling. Thing though is I was very unimpressed with those features after owning a pair of Bose earphones. These were also really lightweight/cheap feeling compared to my Bose, and weren't as easy to use with the taps and stuff. Then there is the fitment issues. Do they have different size rubber pieces? Yes. 3 sizes, 1 set of each. None of them worked, to the point that almost every facial muscle movement or jaw movement caused them to fall out. Personally I like to be able to talk when I'm on a phone call, but these made it hard to. And trying to watch a movie while eating? Impossible! I spent more time catching/picking up my earbud and trying to resume the movie than I did eating.Ultimately my advice is that if you're not wanting to spend a lot of money on features like noise cancelation, take a chance with an off brand for a third of the price and you'll most likely still have the same sound quality. If you want thise features and are willing to pay this price, spend a little more and get Bose or a good brand that knows how to to it right. If you want them to stay in your ears, go with literally ANYTHING else!Battery life was great though!"
"Way better than my previous pairs.  Volume level is good, not great.  Ergonomics aren’t the best but noise cancelling is pretty good.  Connecting was easy.  We shall see how they hold up to sweat and heat."
I ordered these JBL TUNE BEAM earbuds as replacement for my apple earbuds. The bass is great but I move a lot and found that I constantly hit the ear buds with my arms and it kept changing the settings. Also 20 minutes in to my workout they kept popping out. I plan to keep them because I only paid 28.00 by using my amazon points. I just got these so lets see what happens:) Hopefully they last a little while.
"I bought it because it has Good reviews about noise cancelling but really it does not work well very poorly. Good sound, good brand, bad fit into ears. Even the promotion price is not worth it."
"First off audio quality specifically the audio that you're playing through the buds is actually very good. However, the noise canceling function couldn't be worse. There's a constant soft buzzing sort of static sound even when not playing audio through them. Turning the noise canceling off helps that but sounds like you're listening through a paper towel tube. Worse than that is that any high pitch noise almost seems to be amplified. I know that sounds crazy but that's my experience. Also significant wind or air moving past your ears seems to make the audio staticy. For what it's worth I work in an industrial environment that is very noisy but my old worn out galaxy buds noise canceling function was absolutely night and day difference even though the sound quality of the galaxy buds was not as good as these. If the noise canceling only works well in quiet environments then what's the point? I wouldn't really recommend these to anyone because of that."
"The first day I worn them, they fell into a puddle as I was turning my head quickly. They don't fit in my ears well, even though I changed the earbud tips, I expected better quality, this is on par with my $20 tozo earbuds. Battery life is poor, call quality isn't great, case will get scratched, it's made out of cheap plastic. It doesn't have wireless charging for the case. Once again my $20 tozo earbuds does something this JBL should. Don't buy if you want to keep these for a long time"
"For earbuds that advertise ""Pure Bass Sound"", they stink. My JLab $20 buds push more bass out than these. I own the UA Project Rock buds, and they are good, so maybe I was expecting more from these. Otherwise, they sound OK."
"Aside from the fact its another primeday scam where the price is the same, the fitment of the buds is loose so dont buy these if you exercise at all they're only good for stationary listening to light movement. Overall they need to be about 20 bucks cheaper. the sound quality is only slightly better than my skullcandy sesh evo buds that were $18. 1 Star off for primeday scam, 1 star for fitment."
They sounded great when I was listening to music or videos. When I made calls with my Pixel 7 I could barely hear the person I called even at full volume. Disappointed.
"The sound quality is good but no matter which size ear bud I used, they would not stay in. I spent more time readjusting them and trying to get them to sit properly than I did enjoying music."
"Other than that, the sound qaulity is pretty good"
Wife complained that airport background noise was bad.
Everything I have to worry because they don't fit that good in my ear. Beside that the sound quality is great and the voice call are even better.
"Out of package sound wasn’t great but with the app I was able to adjust the EQ settings and it sounded great. Unfortunately, they’re a bit bulky and easily fall out of my ear. I’ve never had that problem with any other earbuds.Bluetooth connection, mics, noise cancellation work pretty darn good. I just wish it was a more snug fit.(yes I tried all the ear pieces for the best fit)"
"Decent ear buds, but expected more from JBL.  If I was shooting for ""decent"" I would have bought some off brand buds for cheaper.The case feels cheap, sound is ok.Easy to use.. but nothing special."
"will sometimes randomly unpaire from your phone, and reset all of your settings. and loading the app to change them again takes surprisingly long to load. maybe because it's the old model?"
"While I have other earbuds in the lower cost range ,  I've had other JBL products off and on over the years, and decided to give 'em a go.  So I bought and tried these earbuds for a couple weeks. I am not a ""power user"", but just want to listen privately to quality sounding music while working around the house. With the JBLs I was underwhelmed.After downloading and installing their software, as recommended, I gave another try.  I felt like I was just listening to music with my old buds, didn't feel wowed by the JBLs for their expense.  The difference in quality wasn't significant, the value just wasn't obvious to me. To be fair to the earbud industry, I've worked around machinery for many years, and likely have some hearing limitations that buds just won't overcome.  Nonetheless, these are being repackaged and returned.  I'm kinda brand- loyal, and as such just bought bluetooth JBL over ear headphones.  We'll see how they do. I want them to live up to my less-than- onerous expectations. We'll see."
"Push buttons are intermittent. Sometimes you hear the beeps but no response. I have to plug them back into the case several times to get them to reset. The sound is nice. They don't stay seated in the ear very long. I wear them all day at work as a welder, and constantly have to twist them back in."
"Sound is good and bass is only noticeable when really into the ear. Anc is ok but not good for gym. I can hear everything specially mid to high frequencies.Very difficult to pair with 2 devices close to each other (needs to assure one is completely disconnected). Also, it connects to my pc but the mic doesn’t work. Paired many times, deleted and pair back…nothing.  My right ear got bruised due to angle. I used the smallest tip but still not small enough to not get the plastic hard tip to bruise my ear. So I am using it only for office where I don’t need complete insulation."
Very low sound.
"Love the quality and the battery life the only thing I'm not happy with is how it sits in the ear. Changing the size doesn't help either. The buds are too heavy and should have a wrap around the ear for more support. If you don't plan on moving, chewing, talking then these are great. Otherwise get ones that wrap around your ear."
"Really cool concept, love the app and all the extra options for listening. Only problem is no matter what I do, these things will not stay on. I tried all the sizes, and had no success getting anything to stick. I was initially interested in the Tune Buds because they’re much cheaper than Airpods and seem to offer many of the same features (noise cancelling, sound equalizer, etc.) but to my disappointment they are extremely uncomfortable and fall off on their own all the time. Not worth the advertised long battery life if I can barely make it through 30 minutes of listening. Will be returning."
"I want to like these earbuds. They are good audio wise and I really like the noise canceling option. But, I can’t get them to stay in my ears if I’m doing an activity like working out. They are never secure in my ears and slowly slide out as I move and turn my head in any scenario.  None of the sizes of earbud pieces that JBL provides helps either."
"Sound quality, amazing. Battery life, fantastic. Fit? Absolute and Total TRASH. I could barely get these things to stay in my ears for more than 10 minutes at a time, no matter what bud size I used. For those of you out there with monster ear holes and the perfect shaped cartilage may just love these, but my baby ear holes, and average shaped ears could not, and WOULD not. 2/10"
"Feb 2024: I am not sure if my current issue is fixable but maybe a day or two ago i noticed the right bud is not working ... it seems to be normal when i put it in the case but it never turns on anymore.  The left bud is a-ok.  Really this didn't last (note: i did get these used-like new and i have used them a bit) as long as I'd hope but it doesn't change my opinion.  For the price (say $19.99) you can do better .. even if you have to wait for say a lightning deal on something like the TOZO T6's for $22.99 or something ... BUT ... i'd not say ""these are horrible, avoid"" ... the sound isn't the best like i said but they are small and really comfortable ... and while they dont have the best sound ... i have heard FAR worse ... just a little EQ'ing and these sound decent for relaxing music (one of my main uses) .. for podcasts or something ... that doesn't matter as much anyway (EQ'ing them) .... I will update this if i find its an easy fix but even a few resets hasn't gotten the right but to turn on yet.April 2023 Update: well ... I see these are $23 now ... I dont think they are worth that much (just a few $1's too high, dont get me wrong) ... but I got mine used-like new for $12.50 and I have seen them say at the $16 or so range ... you know .. these aren't 'great"" but they are not that bad.  I think say for podcasts or whatever they are fine ... you can just find better for music (even ""jlab signature"" and eq'ed on top).  having said that ... I have used these at night for sleeping and they fit great.  I HAVE gotten use to being careful with the built in cable (still not a fan of that though ... if a cable breaks you can replace it... if this breaks, your charging case cant charge the earbuds).I hate to act like any of the buds I still have are ""not comfortable"" but for me, comfort wise, these are up there.  As long as you dont expect these to be top quality buds (NOR worst of the low price buds, again dont get me wrong) .. I think people may like theseUpdate 2+  condensed)  After using these for a bit, and even counting the best EQ option (Jlab Signature) and a v-shaped EQ on top via Wavelet (app) these still do not sound as good as some other pairs i have, however using them for side sleep (whatever side faces the pillow DOESN'T have an earbud in), these do a surprising good job at passive noise cancelling for me.  While they also dont sound the best... they dont sound ""bad"" either ... you can some real no-name duds below $20, .. these are decent for that sub $20 price range to be clear.I gave these 3 out of 5 stars but really its maybe between a 3.5 TO MAYBE a 3.75 to be clear ... maybe more toward 3.5 in my book though.  I'd say look at TOZO first for deals ... but I still recommend these.They are comfortable to me too ... like they dont feel too big ... just right.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update:  1) I did notice one day when it was REALLY humid the controls seem to get wonky ... like sometimes my presses weren't ""registering"" and then others would which would mean i'd do a function (change track for instance) when i wanted to change the EQ mode instead... it doesn't alway happen but it has once or twice in constant use since i bought these.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------i have to say the default tips + the size of the buds combo are nice ... I have ( .. even just to test THESE) been using these sleeping at times rather than my TOZO T6's and while i love the T6's i haven't found the ""perfect"" eartips for them that fit me (so to speak) ... at times with these Go Air Pops ... I hardly notice they are in my ears ... I didn't even open the little bag with the other tips to make sure (note: bought ""used - like new"") I got the other tips, yetmy one con that I REMEMBER typing this update is the sound quality ... .ok for the price on ""JLab Signature"" EQ but bang for your buck ... counting deals on Amazon ... you may be able to do better.So far Battery Life seems decent enough ... a little shorter than I expected but like i said i am using these for sleep and i count that time that I am sleeping so .... yeah battery life is good for the price, I'd say--------------------------First I want to mention this is all based on my first impressions after a few hours of use, only … things may change later.  Bluetooth Earbuds I have are TOZO’s T6’s and NC2’s (two pair now), Fiil’s T1XS with app support, and Edifier’s TWS1 Pros and Earfun wise the Air Free Pro 2’s, (Returned due to a number of issues) Earfun Free Mini’s and to be clear… Earfun Free’s that were sent to me unexpectedly after they saw my review of the Free Mini’s (thank you Earfun) … point being is that I have experience with a number of earbuds even if I do use some more than the others (no real particular reason).Right away I noticed these opinionsPros- Fit – to be clear none of the buds I have are really “uncomfortable” in any way but these just fit good, with the default tips … or what I am guessing is the default tips (comparing them to the default TOZO T6 tips, they seem the same size) …. Unless my ear starts to itch or something, I HARDLY notice the Go Air Pops are in my ears.  I love my TOZO T6’s (form factor wise the nearest on the list I mentioned, to the same form factor as these)… but these just seem to fit a little better.Update a few days later (after writing the prior paragraph) –  these while they have fallen out from time to time… these are very comfortable.  When using them for sleep (whatever side of my head faces the pillow if “side sleeping” doesn’t have an earbud in) … they are more comfortable then the TOZO T6’s I have used for the same thing before and with these there are times I barely know they are there, and I really like that.- Build quality – I will not say these have “great” build quality .. that just seems to be overstating it but these do not feel as cheap as the Earfun Air Free Mini’s.  Some ultra budget earbuds have a quality where it just feels like the cheapest plastics and materials were used … not the case with these buds, even if they don’t scream ‘high end quality” either.- Battery Life – I am not going to act like I have counted or even really paid attention but these seem to last awhile and even after falling asleep for a bit with these… I cant say I have ever woken up to them NOT playing … since I bought them I had to charge them once and (just in case, I probably didn’t have to) then a second time, just to make sure the case was fully charged at that point, but I just had no idea the case’s charge then and it could have been say 70% or something and the second charge was un-needed.I’d say I am “impressed” by the battery life being good.------------------------------Pros/Con (??) – This may be my least favorite sounding earbud I have but … from what I remember of the Earfun Free Mini’s … they do sound better than they did … and I love TOZO but I can not compare these with the TOZO A1’s which I don’t have …. say comparing these to the TOZO T6’s seems sort of unfair as the A1’s (TOZO brand wise) are more of the equivalent to the Go Air Pops.  They could sound the same for all I know.I do notice a difference using the built in EQ’s (note too that no matter the headphone or earbud I tend to have an EQ setting or app with a “U” to a “V” setting applied) … but not much … I do agree that the Bass Boost mode CAN muddy things up at times … the Flat EQ setting …. makes it a lot flatter sounding (no matter what I listened to) than I was expecting … I mean FLAT sounding … NOT “neutral” like I’d describe the TOZO T6’s for example.The best setting between the three is Jlab’s Signature sound which boosts the Bass and the Treble in a V like sound signature.  Like the Fiil T1XS’s many EQ options and customization, for instance are nice to have, in my view … the default sort of “V” signature THEY offer is also the best THEY sound.  If I am not mistaken .. the “Jlab signature” sound EQ setting IS the default and it does sound the best, like I said.After a few days and a “side-by-side” comparison to the TOZO T6’s I have (some of the others are in a higher price bracket … I am trying to be fair here) the T6’s do sound “sharper” and “crisper” …. sort of hard to describe if you don’t get what I am saying … however, forgetting these I got “used-Like new” for $12.50 … I’d sort of say they are worth $19.99 (typical price) … but I’d HONESTLY spend a tad more for the T6’s ….if someone did ask me about these “go air pops” ...”yes or no, at 19.99?… no commentary” … I’d say yes … if you note the con’s (below)----------------------------------------------------------------Cons- The built in charging cable.  - I do have to admit I KNEW about this before hand and this was not a surprise …..A) the length … I mean many earbud’s cable that comes included IS short, but this seems extra short.  I may pickup usb “extension cable” to use with these buds which ACTUALLY may solve the other issue …. anyway I just do not like how short this is, where depending on how you are ABLE to charge this, the case has to be dangling somewhere with all the weight of the buds and the case on the built in cable.  To keep it as a built in cable I know they HAVE TO make it small or double/triple the size of the case itself … that makes sense to me … but I’d just rather have a say separate USB-C port + cable for instanceB) I didn’t even think of this at first but with the prior Jlab model that didn’t have a top on the case (not sure who’d like that design idea) … but the built in charging cable the way Jlab has it, has the bottom (even when it’s tucked into the case) pins exposed… .this seems like a really bad idea for dust/dirt/etc to me but for the record I have only just gotten these and NOT had issues with this yet … just something that seems like an oversight or something.- Max Volume - this may or may not always be an issue but especially if you have audio that is not normalized (the default level of the source audio is too low vs what it should be) ... the max volume of these earbuds may not help.I never truly paid attention to reviews saying how loud certain buds are, but I do notice that compared to some earbuds, the MAX volume of these or even ""on tick down"" from max is what i have it on a bit (note: sometimes i do have a black Honeywell fan on next to me) .... when some other buds ... say oh 70% to max (guessing, but it's close) is good for me volume wise.  Again this is not always an issue with good source audio or if your not in a loud/noisy place-----------------------------------------Summary (again based on first impressions)I think if you count lightning deals there may be better options when others go on good sales, but these aren’t bad.  I can “deal with” the sound not being the greatest, but that charging cable A) being so short and B) the pins being completely exposed I do not like and maybe a deal breaker for some.I can’t say I 100% recommend (I mean counting deals there are better options out there .. even for a LITTLE BIT more in price)… nor can I say I don’t recommend (even with issues like I said) … they aren’t bad … as a backup pair or if you are just curious about theses … I’d say go ahead and give them a shot."
"JLAB reached out to me and offered a refund. That is the kind of customer service I greatly appreciate! Thank you, JLAB.While the sound quality is good, the earbuds are not easy to use nor are they quickly responsive, which means you will tap again to make sure it's working and end up getting a different result than the one you wanted, since 1 tap is for volume and 2 taps is start/stop. Additionally, it says you can use one earbud independently, but the right and left earbuds have different functions--a single tap on the left brings volume down, while a single tap on the right brings volume up. Play/pause is only available through a double tap on the right. I tend to wear only one earbud while listening to audiobooks, so these are not working well for me. Additionally, instead of a charging cord with plug, there is only a short cable ending in a USB-C connection, which is awkward. You're supposed to charge it using your laptop, but I move my laptop all over the house, so it is only plugged in once in a while. Too late for me to return them, so I'll probably go back to using SoundPEATS."
"I was excited to own my first pair of wireless earbuds, and as soon as they arrived I charged them up! Next step was to get them out of the case and try them out. That was a bit more difficult then I expected…had a tough time getting them out of the case. The buds kept slipping out of my fingers. Didn’t expect that, but eventually got them out. Oh, kudos for the built in usb plug on the case although some people may not appreciate the “old” usb a plug. I didn’t care, so I was happy to just plug the unit into a charger.Now to actually test the buds out. Simple connect to Bluetooth, fired up a music streaming app and….then spent a half hour trying to fit the buds in my ear! Eventually had to switch the ear pads to a smaller size, and was ready to go!Listened to a few tunes…sounded ok, but a bit “thin” and a little bright. But I had the next day to really give the buds a listen! Turns out, bad decision. Next morning I started to listen in earnest, various genres of music, at different volume levels. Everything was going great until I got the bright idea of testing out the buds while mowing my lawn! Yeah, bad, really bad moves. Lost one of the earbuds somewhere in my back yard! Spent hours crawling all over the yard with my cellphone trying to “connect” Bluetooth to the missing earbud! It’s gone, now days later the battery in the earbud has surely died, to be found nevermore!Hence the 3 stars for initially sounding ok but being a pain to fit them in my ear! Oh and I also learned listening to one earbud is no fun!"
"I’ve been using these earbuds since June, and I have mixed feelings. I set the touch control to double tap to skip a song instead of holding it, but it’s been a bit frustrating. When the music is paused, I can’t skip the song, and often, it pauses the music instead of skipping, even when I double-tap correctly. I set the volume adjustment to the hold function, but it only increases by one level, so I have to hold it repeatedly to raise the volume. The touch sensitivity is also too high—a light brush from my hand or even tree leaves can pause my music. Today, the right earbud stopped working; I think it ran out of battery and won’t charge in the case. The left earbud only charges if I hold it at a certain angle. On the plus side, the built-in charging cable has worked well. I expected it to wear out or become loose over time, but it hasn’t. The case cover has also stayed intact, unlike the covers of my last two earbud cases, which broke off."
"I had a pair of jlabs earbuds before I lost them. They lasted me literally years I was absolutely in love with them. Unfortunately I can't find them and they don't seem to be turning up so I orded these excited I could basically get a new one of my old ones and try a new color. It is quite the sad purchase.Pros:- It works (mostly)- Lightweight- Love the color- Charging slots and earbuds are marked L and R- USB C for charging- Long battery lifeCons:- Left earbud cuts out every couple minutes and I need to tilt my head a certain way to cut the music back in- Do not fit well in the ears (need to kinda be jammed in)- Noticibly bad audio qualityI just want to say whatever my last jlabs were, one of my best purchases ever, these ones are the opposite, I don't even think I'm going to bother using them at all to be honest. It's my own fault for cheaping out. They look cool and they work. They also fall out, cut out every couple minutes, and have bad audio quality. You get what you pay for I suppose."
"First time user of jlabs so it might be something im not understanding but the be aware mode doesn't work on my pair. Downloaded the app and can turn it on from there but it will turn off randomly and i can't get the change through bugs to turn it on.Other than that, great little product. Sounds good for watching TV shows and clips on social media. Fit is great and love the color! The charging option is a bit daunting but for now I'm using my computer to charge. Long battery life!"
"Rewriting my review after using the earbuds for about a week. As much as I like them, I think I might return them because of the charger type and the lack of a left pause.Pros:1) Earbuds last very long, around 8 hours. Perfect for listening to audiobooks or music while working.2) The case is cute, colorful, and compact. Doesn't bulge in my pocket.3) The sound is okay. Earbuds fit comfortably in my ear.4) Overall decent quality for the price.Cons:1) Only the right earbud has a pause feature, while the left has the ask siri/google instead. I personally don't care for ask google or whatever, and my job has a rule of only wearing one earbud while working, so the left earbud is next to useless if I need to pause to listen to a coworker or engineer.2) Most of my devices use type-a charger, not type-c. I admit this is my fault for not double checking.3) Compared to a Sesh Evo (the only other wireless buds I have to compare to), the sound is much weaker. I have to raise the volume a lot higher to be able to hear in a noisy room.4) The tapping mechanic isn't very intuitive. Hard to tell if I actually did anything when tapping until I hear the volume change or audio pause. Many times I have to tap multiple times because I didn't do it right, or forgot that left *can't pause*. Would've preferred pressing a button instead where you can at least hear/feel the feedback like the sesh evo."
"Overall, I’m really happy with my purchase. The sound quality is great, and the build quality is solid. The size is perfect for me, and I love the fact that they don’t fall out during workouts. However, I did find that they’re not as durable as I would have liked, and the design is a bit uncomfortable. The biggest issue for me is the software. It’s super hard to change into transparency mode and then turn it off. Maybe it was just my fault, but I didn’t like that.."
The headphones were decent. I mean the sound was good but that was all. It wouldn't pause the music unless you used the right headphone. It wouldn't pause podcasts at all. You had to tap the headphone to get it to pause instead of pushing the headphone. Was not a fan of that. I sent these headphones back and bought a different pair. I have it a three because the sound was decent
"I love my airpods, the sounds quality is deep and rich but the downside is that it's hella uncomfortable to use when laying on my stomach and the earbuds just dig into the side of face, so I bought these ones because the reviews say the sound quality is really light compared to airpods (idk if that makes sense to anyone but that's the best I can describe it).Even my $13 fake AirPod pros from alibaba sounds better 💀💀"
"Short cable makes it impossible to remove from the case without unplugging. Earbuds are very difficult to get out of the case and hard to orient correctly to go back in. Sound quality is ok, but when new the battery would last 8 hours now maybe 4. Generally for the price what did I expect. Spending a little more for better design and quality is probably warranted."
"Size is good, battery life excellent, even the sound quality is above par. However, with that being said the issue I am having with being able to find a way to charge them negates all the good things about this product.I need a USBc specific charging cube in order to charge these. My laptop and computer doesn't charge USB CASE"
"I bought this earbuds about 4 months ago at first they were really good. About 2 weeks back I started to notice that the battery doesn’t last long anymore, I do only use them about once a day for 3-4 hours I did also notice that both earbuds when turning on they sometimes sound like it’s glitching. Overall they are ok earbuds."
"Not bad for under twenty bucks, but not worth for what you can get for a bit more.Sound is basic without any depth. A bit bulky. The biggest thing is no connectivity with 2 devices, supper annoying having to turn one off and the reconnection is not automatically. Controls are not as smooth as competitors, but not too bad"
"Cute little headphones good sound quality, but you need to buy a USB charger block for your headphones I had to wait to use mine because I thought it came with USB I misread the information but the product should have said you need a charger block."
The case is small and compact and the sound is pretty good. However the battery life is awful. Mine hardly last a few hours and the case battery doesn't charge at all. I've charged the case for hours yet it doesn't charge the earbuds.
I realize how much of an old millennial this might make me sounds but here we go. The earbuds are very small and slippery. I have small fingers and struggled getting the earbuds out of the case. I assume they have some type of magnetic connection to keep them in but a button to eject the earbuds might be needed. Once out of the case they are still slippery and can easily be dropped. I might have suffered through the size but the left earbud had a connection issue and would not charge. I ended up returning and getting the sport version with the ear clip.
"These earbuds sound great, and they are comfortable in my ears... BUT1. I have an extremely difficult time extracting them from their case. This is extremely aggravating.2. This is a personal problem, but the raised logo on the touch surface gives me some sensory ICK.3. Probably my fault for missing it in the features, but case does not have a micro-USB or USB-C outlet to plug a charging cable of your own into. It has a short, hardwired, naked USB cable that nestles into the bottom of the case. When pulled free for use, it is fair game to get mangled and jerked around. And if it ever goes bad or gets broken, that is the end of your earbuds.All that said, I will be keeping them because they do sound great, and they weren't expensive. As such, I'm sure that I'll at least get my money's worth out of them before they either break, or I get too sick of dealing with all the things that irritate me about them to keep using them consistently and relegate them to being backup for a new pair that better suits my own ideosyncratic needs/preferences."
"So i love the small designs they fit in my jean pockets great. The sound is wonderful. The charge life is fabulous. Only complaint with these that i have is the head phones themselves had no buttons. This has been frustrating because i usually start my day listening to something before my little awake and then i will take them out well if not put directly in the case they wont repair you have to put them in and take them out just to start them. You cant skip songs,end calls,ect because of this as well so i took stars away for that."
Don't love these to be honest. Giving 3 stars because it feel sturdy and seemed like it would last decently if I kept them. I may need to up my budget to get better sounds quality - not worth the compromise!
"$22.-Sound quality is fine, no noticeable noise cancelling.-Volume control is easy.-These start falling out with little sweat, like just vacuuming!-Cannot go back 30 seconds/replay like most.-Mike sucks. Sometimes I can be heard in t/c, zoom etc., mostly not.*CON*  If you have arthritis, carpal tunnel, CMC joint issues...be aware that it is really hard to get these suckers out of the charging case! The magnet is way too strong, and you have to clench and pull in this really un-ergonomic way to get the 1st one out. I often cannot get it out and switch to different ear buds. The 2nd one is easier to get out after removing the 1st one.*CON*  If you don't get them connected very quickly initially to whatever bluetooth device you want to use, or you get disconnected from signal, they will turn off, and the only way to turn them back on is to put them both back in charge case, wait a few seconds, then pull them out and try again. (!!!!!) So I only use them at home. I can't deal with that problem when I'm out doing whatever I'm doing.*CON*  Weird usb charge process, backwards. A little usb arm unfolds from bottom and has to be plugged into a usb port on power strip etc. All of the other ones I have, the usb plugs INTO the charge case, so that is my setup. Only have 1 location in home I can charge these without totally changing setup."
"The audio quality is good. But the feature to listen to surroundings feature amplifies too much ambient noise.They do not fit well, I’ve tried all 3 sizes of ear pieces and they fall out of my ears while I exercise. They hurt if I lay down with them in my ears.They have to be manually connected or disconnected to go between devices like iPhone and peloton. It’s frustrating.I’ll use them when I need to but these will not be a long term replacement for my old and dying AirPods."
"I'm returning these the first day because I don't like the external charging cable. It's ugly and unwieldy and doesn't even come with it's own charging block. The manual says to plug it into a laptop or PC with a USB-C adapter and I don't have any device with that capability. Luckily I have a USB-C charging block from another device but I think it's ridiculous that it doesn't come with it's own. Besides that, the sound quality was great, but the bass is a little harsh in my sensitive ears."
"These earbuds had good sound and the aware mode was nice to have. The major problems I had were 1. They caused fatigue after about an hour and would start just swapping out each earbud. 2. There is no way to power these on without the case. If the buds have shut off from not being used, you have to place it back into the case and take it back out in order to pair. Not my favorite feature. I ended up returning these within a few days."
"This is my second pair of JLab Gos. First lasted about 3 years before they stopped working. For the price I paid, that was a good lifetime. To replace the broken ones, I got the Air Pop+ rose. Sound quality is more than enough for making phone calls and casual music listening. Price is unbeatable.Major nit-picks:The buds are hard to get out of the case because the lid doesn't extend more than 90 degrees and because there's no grip on the buds. At first I thought this was a minor issue but having used them for 2 weeks now it's unbelievably annoying. It's such a struggle to get them out that I hesitate to ever put them back in the case. I'm changing my review from 4 stars to 3 solely on this point. Honestly what were they thinking?The embedded charging chord is stupidly short. And the stupid short charging cord is USB-C, not USB-A as in the older pair, and that makes it harder to charge. At least in my world, USB-A is still ubiquitous and I need to track down a A-to-C adapter whenever I need to charge the JLabs. They would be better off dropping the charge cord completely and reducing the price by fifty cents.Next time I'll get another Tozo."
"Sounds was clear. What I didn't like was that after a period of no use, even if they were still in my ears, they would shut off. I would have to return them to the case momentarily and THEN they would powerback on. It was inconvenient. Half the time my case was tucked away in my bag, or I had walked away from it and had to find it to make a call or listen to music. There is no on button. Would not purchase again."
"First off amazing headphones overall for the price, great fantastic. Just 1 tiny kitty bitty issue that deducted 2 stars... They don't turn on without the case pair that with the fact they turn off if you don't connect them within 3 minutes or 30 minutes without activity and you have a massive design flaw. Why isn't there a way to turn them on without putting them in and out of the case exactly? Idk but it should be mentioned in the product description."
"Good price and function, but you need to buy a separate adapter for charging blocks. I didn’t notice this before receiving it, don’t be like me."
"These headphones are good for the price point they are at. They are no air pods or other leading ear buds with noise cancelling but that's okay. They do the job, and not half bad either. My biggest complaint would be that the touch controls are not very sensitive, and they are completely un-intuitive. You can set new ones through the app, but again the sensitivity is not great.I use these as a backup, or if I'm doing something where I expect I might lose or break a headphone.I will say though that the size of the case in particular is much smaller than much of the competition and fits easily into any pocket. The buds are a little thicker than id prefer, and the plastic feels cheap-ish. The clasp on the case is not very strong and opens easily.Overall they are not bad, just not great either. For $20 it's certainly worth it when compared to other makes at this price."
"These did not come with the other earpiece options as stated in the description. This aside, it is a good quality purchase."
"Sound good,however range sucks. Lose connection while phone is in back pocket. Cannot even connect to tv less than 10ft away."
"They sound fine, the buttons work great, and the built-in cord is convenient if you have a usb-c handy.What I really don't like about this is mainly the case.  The buds are hard to pull out because there isn't enough area to hold onto with my fingers.  Also, the lid to the case is very easy to accidentally close while trying to pull out the ear buds. Kinda annoying."
"These earbuds have decent sound but the earbuds are extremely hard to get out of the case if you have hands bigger than a child. Also the USB C plug built in the case is good in concept, but it's not practical in daily use. Most people have a USB C charging cable, but not many people have a USB C port they can use for charge."
"Well, it says JL and I thought other JLL products from target this product is not the greatest. The left AirPod does not work correctly. You put it in and it starts off initially we can hear the sound and then it turns the sound down all the way and you cannot hear anything, but you can’t control it from the phone.  There is no way to turn it up. Maybe this is like buying from Ross.. it looks correct but with minor defects. I will not buy anything electronic from again from Amazon. That’s just my preference. Hopefully your experience was/is better."
"I bought these earbuds August last year. I loved these, they worked great. The connectivity was good, they paired nicely. I was able to take phone calls just fine with them. The sound was good, the earpieces fit well. But my opinion has now changed because since last week they did not charge when connected, therefore could not use them anymore. It seems that the rechargeable battery has died after about 1 year of use. Important to know that I didn't use my earbuds daily. I used them more often on weekends mostly to listen to podcasts. I wish they were better made. So now I plan to invest in earbuds of higher quality."
"Ear buds are nice quality, but the fact they only include one pair of silicone tips in a gigantic size was really quite disappointing. I don’t have small ears by any measure, but these are just impossible to comfortably seat in my ears, constantly readjusting and pushing them back in just to get relatively okay sound quality. Probably will not purchase from this company again"
"I am someone who loses Ear Buds often so I decided to go away from the expensive pairs and try a cheaper one this time. It is clear that you are paying for what you get. They aren't bad but they sure aren't great. The functinallity of taping on the ear bud to do things such as volume, pause, skip, etc is terrible with these and by far my least favorite feature. There is no ""button"" to push so you just brush your finger on the end and hope it reads it as the number of taps you are wanting. Also, with other ear buds, if you only wear one then it usually is the one in charge of volume and pausing but not these. Only the right ear bud pauses which is a pain if you are wearing the left one and you can only turn the volume up on the right ear bud (very annoying when trying to pause and instead it turns it up a lot louder) and down on the left.They aren't terrible though. The sound quality is pretty solid. I throw them in to mow and they are perfect for that. For what you pay, they are worth it. If/when I eventually lose these, I'm not sure if I will get this brand again or try a different kind next time."
There ok if you get them on a deal I got black friday deal
Sound is decent. Difficult to remove from case. Bluetooth connectivity is not seamless.
If you’re coming from air pod pros you will absolutely hate how these feel. Even with the smallest fit they feel huge in my ear. Like the cheap ear protection you’d buy at a race track in a pinch. The sound is very mid definitely don’t hit the same. All the way up there’s no bass
They keep falling out of my ears and the Bluetooth connection cuts out sometimes I also often accidentally turn them off a lot because I use them while I sleep the microphone quality is bad but people can still hear and understand you good all around earbuds but there are some key issues.
"Low cost, low audio quality. But they do work as described."
sound pretty bad without a custom settingsHad to find some custom equlizer settings online to utilize the full potential of the earphones sounds decent noweven the app settings where no help but i know everyone ears are diffrent so could be just my ears
Working out at the gym great sound.
"I really wanted to like these earbuds, inexpensive and the promise of good sound, waterproof, etc. They sounded really good, and the features worked fine. What happened was that the charging system didn't work like it should. The battery was dead long before the promised amount of time, even if it had been half of that I would have been satisfied. But after the battery was about 10%, the earbuds would not connect, so I ""charged"", the cord that comes attached to the charging station is small and pretty much useless. I had JLAB earbuds before theses and they had a normal USP connector instead of what looks like a connector to a cell phone. I could never get these to charge up after the first two times. The previous JLAB earbuds I have stopped holding a charge also, but after about 5 years, which was the reason I got a  new pair. I guess I will look for a different brand. I am disappointed because these came with over 511K 4 and 5 star reviews. My opinion, don't waste your money, maybe you'll get lucky and receive a pair that actually charges."
"i listen to rock/metal, these headphones would be better for rap or hip-hop. ives had these for 5 months and they are still good.Its great for the price, but I prefer louder and more bass-filled earbuds. i bought these because my headphones broke. these are good as a replacement or for someone who doesn't listen to music very often/doesn't care for quality. these earbuds also are not super loud, but get the job done.there are three modes, bass-boosted, balanced, and J-lab signature.1. bass boosted doesn't really....sound bass boosted, it sounds like the vocals have been muffled and the backings have been enhanced, but enhanced by dunking them underwater.2. balanced is well...balanced. the vocals, backings, bass, etc are balanced pretty well, though I don't prefer to listen to this mode.3. The J-lab signature is pretty decent, it has surprisingly okay bass and evens it out with the vocals. I listen to this mode the most because it sounds the best.In summary, these are best for people who don't care for quality or sound, for replacement when something breaks, and for an emergency buy if you have prime."
"These earbuds have touch controls, tapping/holding the different buds produce different effects. They are very sensitive, and cannot be disabled. If you don't want to restart your 10-hour ebook every time you adjust your left earbud, don't buy these."
The buds keep falling out whenever I move my head. Like simply turning to face someone. I bent over to pick something up and one earbud fell out and went down the furnace vent. I had them for 6 hours!
"Generally, I actually really like using these earbuds. They very affordable, fit well (for me), and they've been nice for running, especially because I can just wear one at a time. I've never had problems with them falling out of my ears, and the sound quality is more than decent for the cost. The built in charging connection is super convenient, but I keep wondering how long it'll be before it becomes brittle and unusable. It'd be a shame if the earbuds were still playable, but the case couldn't charge because of a broken wire. I guess that's a future me problem and it likely wouldn't happen until after I've already gotten plenty of use out of these to make up for their cost.The biggest negatives for me:- the earbuds are super slippery! There's no grippiness except on the touch button, so it makes it a bit hard to pull one out of the case or even handle it without it jumping out from between my fingers. I'm constantly worried that I'll lose a bud because of this. Speaking of the touch buttons, they're sensitive, which is great. What's less great is that they register touches even when I'm handling one briefly after removing if from my ear. Not a huge deal, but a little annoying especially when I don't have my case on hand to put it away.- I'm also not in love with the pairing mechanism. It'd been nice if I could pair the earbuds without relying on my case, especially if I'm out on a run and don't want to have to carry it with me. And sometimes I have trouble pairing BOTH earbuds with my phone at the same time if I decide to go from using one bud to two. It'll pair one, but not always the other."
They disconnect by their own
I just got mine 2 days ago. The box said 38hrs playtime. I used mine fully charged today. I got 5 hours of play time before it died. The sound is great. I just wished the battery lasted longer..
"Nice small case, formerly well in my ear. Sound quality decent but difficult to get out of the case. After about 4 days it would no longer sync with my iPhone. Returning."
"I purchased these for my daughter to use during the upcoming 5th grade school year after seeing them mentioned as a good pair of budget earbuds.  In the video, they were sure to say, ""dont expect stellar sound""......They were correct. No surprises here. Competent, clear, reasonably strong but, not stellar sound. The case is good in all areas. Not too big, too small or unweildy. The charging pigtail is convenient but a little awkward. The buds themselves are plastic but feel well made and they fit well. Not too heavy. No drooping or falling out.  The Bluetooth connection range is very good.  The microphone is very good.  I enjoyed not having to raise my voice to be heard.  I forgot to see how wall interference affects them though. Clearly marked left and right on the buds and inside of the case.A little fiddly to remove from the case.I'm happy. My fifth grader is happy."
These are great for listening to music or watching YouTube. As far as talking on the phone the person on the other end will hear everything but you.
"This review what I’m gonna write it down is not false . I am very disappointed that the case charger didn’t charge my earbuds when I just got it for the first day. KEEP IN MIND that this charger is the USB-TYPE C.  so you might need to buy an outlet charger that needs to have that USB-TYPE C. Please don’t buy this item ( because when I first got it , I tried to charge the case along with the earbuds throughout the whole day . Till the next day I went back to check if it’s charge. I’m very disappointed that it didn’t charge my earbuds like 100%. It says battery medium -.- . I thought maybe the earbuds wasn’t connecting good so I tried to fix it but even when you put it back in the case charger . It didn’t charge the whole day. Anyways , the only good part of it was the sound quality was great . I’ll give 10/10 . So I recommended to anyone who had a thought to buy it please don’t waste your money on this. If you are a person that knows how to fix technology go ahead . But if you think this review is nothing and ignore it. Trust me you will regret it to buy this junk. I thought the same when I saw the review and wanted to buy it anyways . I prefer to buy again maybe in Walmart or Best Buy ?. I think this product is poorly design from Amazon ."
"The sound is good! Will not stay in ears no matter what tips I use. If I chew, yawn, move my jaw at all they fall out."
"I had to get a second pair because the left earbuds in my first set decided that it just didn't want to work anymore. It was on, but it wouldn't start pairing for anywhere from 1 hr to never after it was removed from the case.With the second pair, they'll disconnect while I'm in the middle of listening to music (battery's at 80-100% btw).Unless you've got tiny fingers, the controls are nearly impossible to use. The spot you need to tap to lower the volume is right next to the spot to start a call, and if you tap too fast or too slow, it'll either do nothing or switch tabs. Kind of a pain.Sound isn't too bad, but it's not great either (low volume, low bass).My advise is to skip these and spend the extra $20 for a better pair of earbuds that'll last you longer."
One just one works and if you pick the left one first in your ear thee other one does not work.
"I had purchased a pair of these a while ago, and I wanted a second pair.  When this pair came, it came with integrated USB-C cable.  That's useless to me for easy charging.  If it was a regular USB, I could plug it into everything else that I have that has a USB.  I wish the description was accurate.  I never would have ordered these."
"the ear buds dont stick out far enough to grab them with finger tips, its a struggle for me."
If you sweat at all don't get them one they get overlay sweaty they will stop working.
They are good but I ordered the wrong ones. My son wanted jlab pop
"So far good. Easy to pair, however I wish they were a bit louder."
"Not much difference in them honestly, the old ones My regular ones not the plus have better range, I'll just use them for yard work, and just get the old ones again, they been thru the washer and dryer and still works, I need to stick to the regular ones  no jlab+  the plus isn't better."
While they have great sound and stay snug in your ear if not too active they are a complete PITA to get in and out of the charging case in my opinion. They're small and slick so they get dropped a lot but are so far very durable. I'll stick with the over- the-ear model from Jlab.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            They are affordable and the sound quality is not the best but it’s decent. I’ve had these for 3 months and for some reason the mic on both earbuds stopped working. I can’t receive calls with them and that’s the only reason I’m giving this 3 stars
"Head phones were perfect ,until they stopped working. Unsure what happened."
I liked this earbuds. While it lasted...
"I got these after reading about 50 product reviews, ""Oh my god! These headphones are so amazing! They are just like higher priced headphones and so worth the money!""Took 2 seconds of listening to mustic on them to realize that the sound sounds muffled, and they pretty much sound like a cheap pair of headphones. Which that's what they are, to be fair.I had the JBL Vibe Beam immediately before and was looking for a quality pair to replace those, as I lost one. Now I will be purchasing both anyways, because this ain't it.They are understandable for the price, but don't be misled by reviews claiming these are as good as higher priced competitors. You are spending your $20-something dollars and receiving that value."
"I love that they last a full 6 to 8 hours no problem but they sound so quiet. Don't get me wrong the sound is very clear and good quality but I have the volume at the highest it can go and I can barely hearanything with both in. And before you ask yes they are clean and are charged.UPDATE: I work in a factory and decided to try them for the first time in a very loud environment. When I got home in a quiet place they worked and sounded amazing. I even mowed a lawn and the noise cancelling was excellent, didn't need to turn up the music super high to cancel out the loud noise.Update a few weeks later: Now I can't hear anything. They're on and working and they connect but I can't hear anything"
Sound/buttons not the best
Good price and they work well.. but on the package it says long battery life and 35 hr play time  and that's definitely not happening lol if I constantly use the earphones on medium 🔉 volume it will last me about 7hr I also don't like the type c charging.. I had to go buy a charging box and they cost as much as the earphones. Most annoying thing is left earphone is 20% right is 60%  really annoying. Good for a budget earphone to get you through until you get a better set .
Yes thank you
This is my third pair and I just received it last week and I already lost one of the headphone.  I give up lol the product is amazing tho. It just can easily be lost.
"I loved the color which was lilac, and them being compact; but while working out they don’t tend to stay like I would have liked. Maybe my ears are oddly shaped. The charge stays pretty well though. Overall they are okay for the price. Sound quality is meh. But not worth writing home about."
"They’re great, sound great but definitely not similar to AirPods if that’s what you’re hoping for. They’re good headphones & feel fine in the ear. However, the biggest thing that makes me want to never use them again is it keeps skipping my songs out of no where! The sensitive touch on the bud is really hard to get a hold on, trying to switch a song and it raises the volume, and when I’m not even touching them working it keeps switching my music. As I’m typing this, it’s skipped 4 songs by itself, it’s annoying."
"After some effort, I got these to work.One earbud does fully charge, but constantly says it's at 10%, triggering the low battery notification. To get a replacement, you have to cut up the charging cord. I have to take a bus out to my workplace that is an hour long ride, and ordered these to replace my earbuds that stopped working, so I'm not that interested in going without for 1-2 weeks while I wait for the replacement.When they are working, they are close to comparable with my old Pixel Buds. Battery life is good outside of the aforementioned issue."
"Is headphones are okk, but they're not loud. They don't have that much bass I personally Prefer sound core. One thing I do like is the ability to charge your earphones without having to connect. A wire probably won't buy these again but these are perfect for children"
"This product has one fatal flaw that means I can't recommend them for anybody: if you leave your case at home, there is no way to turn the buds back on if they power off.If you disconnect them to listen aloud for more than 3 minutes, the buds are now useless because they powered themselves off. In older models you can hold for 3 seconds to power them on, but this version no longer allows that. It might seem like a small flaw, but there are plenty of other products at the same price point with all the features these earbuds have and which don't have that annoying issue.If you're looking for a good, cheap earbud, pick something else."
So I bought these for my niece before I knew how good of earbuds these are I’m an AirPods Pro girl all the way but JBuds are fantastic. Anyway these I got for my niece because she’s been asking for headphones and Bluetooth was the easiest way to go so we didn’t have to worry about a doppelgänger I didn’t want to spend the money I spent on my AirPods so I figured we’d try these she loves the headphones don’t get me wrong but they’re just way to big for her. I do plan on keeping these because they’re good headphones. But I’m just going to spend the extra money and get her the JLab Minis I love mine so I think she’d love new ones too. And he minis are definitely meant to tinier ears for like ten more dollars it would be worth the price.
"These are pretty much my daily earbuds. When I first bought these from a big box store - pretty much for the price - I was very surprised at the sound quality. While it's nothing world-changing, it doesn't get ""crunchy"" like my backup pair of a different brand - so that's good enough for me!The only downsides (from most to least importance) are something I hope are fixed in another iteration.Downside #1: While in the charging case, the buds like to randomly turn on and connect - untouched, on a flat surface. This is a massive design flaw and would probably explain my first pair no longer charging the left earbud (either that or a connector issue after months of use). This is a bit annoying as I use a different pair of earbuds for falling asleep, so whatever is playing just randomly stops and connects to the JLab buds when they should just be off/charging. (Edit to update this in October: This is still a finicky issue. No matter how many times I would let the bud magnetically connect into the case, or put it into the case as gently as possible, the bud still doesn't always connect to the charger unless I lightly jostle it. I'll be looking for another pair of buds as a daily because of this massive flaw.)Downside #2: The buds are a bit weird to get a solid grip out of the charging case about two out of five times.Downside #3: The earbuds have only three minutes before they shut off. The only way to turn them back on is by putting each bud into the charging case, and taking them back out. I'd love for a physical button to turn on the buds."
Great product until the 6th month mark and then the batteries started going from 100% charged to dead in 30mins
"I loved these earbuds. They sound great, fit my small ear holes, stay in with exercise. I like the feature that allows you to hear your surroundings while you have them in. They charge quickly and love the built in charger. I would rate these 5 stars except... the right earbud stopped connecting to the charger at about 6 weeks of use. Now my Bluetooth automatically connects when the earbuds should be off and charging, the right earbud is constantly low charge, and even though I can still use the left earbud as soon as the right disconnects from the charger it messes with the left earbud sound. It's really frustrating. It also started 2 weeks after the return window. Disappointing."
"I like these headphones but they aren't great for all applications. Best use case is for listening to music from my phone, as the audio quality is excellent for the price. Great for walks, exercise, flights and such.Not so great for listening to anything that makes me laugh, as even the act of smiling causes them to slip from my ears. Worst case is trying to watch movies or play games on pc, as there's an awful audio delay that makes it impossible to enjoy anything.There are also several minor annoyances. The touch controls are not intuitive and easy to trigger on accident. The headphones can only connect to one device at a time. They will blink if no sound is playing, even if they're still connected. Overall, decent value but definitely not an upgrade to the wired headphones that I was hoping to replace."
"As the title says they are decent when they work and that is the only reason I didn't rate them lower. Eventually they stop charging unless you wiggle them around on the case. Because they stop charging, they'll random reconnect to whatever they are paired to. The app support is a absolute joke. The app is just an instruction manual and you can't change any of the tap functions."
"My first pair of these were great long lasting charge, took a long time to charge first out of the box. Held a charge good sound, great earbuds. I accidentally left them behind on a trip and ordered a replacement pair. 2nd pair not so great, initially charge time was a lot faster than expected, and it only held a charge a couple hours. I’m going to charge them again and hope for better battery next time I use them. If that was just a fluke I’ll update my review. Like I mentioned the first pair were great, hoping I just didn’t charge this one long enough but they appeared to be done charging"
"DAY ONE: Let me preface this by saying that I am incredibly pleased with the sound quality, touch control, fit/comfort, BATTERY LIFE and EQ presets (bass one is awesome). Calls/mic also no problems.It takes a bit to get used to the controls (1 tap left pod for VOL DOWN —right VOL UP etc) but highly responsive. The JBLs are more intuitive but you have to push button in , these just a gentle tap does the trick. I bought JBL 100 TWS (see review) around Xmas and lost the right pod. Thought I’d buy a couple brands btw $20-30. These are the cheapest and BEST in show for every category I listed in the first paragraph.————————THERES JUST 1 VERY ANNOYING PROBLEMThe only way to turn these pods on/ready to pair is by taking them OUT OF THE CASE! So even if you have plenty of battery on your pods, if you turned them off and don’t have your case with you…THAT’S A WRAP!! Can’t turn them on until you get back to your case!! Seems like one of the first things you might program—“ON”.And there’s only 1 WAY to turn them OFF w/out your case: go to Bluetooth settings on device and disconnect pods from there, If you don’t do this they’ll stay on indefinitely.The only other little beef I have is with the length of the USB cord. About as long as my index finger. If this is too short can always by an adapter cord for about $5 to extend the length.————————-OVERALL—they really are the BEST in sound, comfort, battery you can get for under $50. JUST DONT FORGET YOUR CASE. I DEF PREFER THEM TO THE *JBL Vibe 100’s” (in terms of sound) and *they’re awesome too but 2x the price of these.DONT MIND CASE FOR ON/OFF/PAIR? BUY THESE FOR SURE!I’ll update after a few weeks as I did with JBL’s"
"jlabs ear buds work great the casevtho is another thing, the case is hard to open wont stay open and are a pain to get thevear buds out of"
I always buy a version of this brand and they have always been great quality.  This time I purchased the earbuds the right side quit working after a few days.  Maybe I just got a defective pair.
"It's hard to get these out of the case, because there's nothing really to get a grip on. Also there is a slight delay using the touch controls.. There is Maybe a  1 second wait between the touch and the earbuds doing the action (pause/next/etc). Good sound though and I like the app that allows more customization. Also comes with a very good instruction pamphlet for the controls. I've only had them for one day, so not much time with them yet."
Sound wise it's great. Issues with using them while on the phone
"I bought these to replace my past JLAB Pop earbuds, which lasted me a long time, probably a little over 4 years. The news one don’t always charge correctly, sometimes stutter the audio, sometimes get desynced with each other and most egregiously, after about a month or two, the left earbud will start and stop playing audio randomly. I know it’s on even when it’s not playing because the other functionality still works, and I even tried charging it to make sure it wasn’t a result of low battery. Unfortunately, these are very dry buggy, and they have become unusable in a relatively short time, especially compared to their previous version."
"These ear buds are great; I got them to work out in the gym and I get quite sweaty so I needed something that wouldn't slip out. I tested them at my desk at home and sound was clear and calling my friend and chatted for over an hour, and it was very clear on both sides.The bad part is that when I walked in my neighborhood, the ear buds would cut out every other block. I am guessing that the bluetooth devices in cars (busy street) and in other houses would interfere with the reception to my phone. So basically, every other house and cars passing would either cut out one of the ear buds, both, or make the sound output wacky. I got my old earbuds from another brand and walked the same path and they never cut out.Just wanted to warn others, especially if you intend to use them to run outside. I mainly used them in the gym so its bearable on the short walk there and they stayed connected well in a stationary spot.Update (4 months use) - not sure if it’s because of the gym and sweat but these earbuds constantly reconnect while I carry them in my bag. It’s not even me moving the bag but I’ll pick up my phone and see it’s connected to these, which drains the battery. Throwing these out but hey, you get what you pay for."
The jlabs out the box’s was pretty cool and I believe I took the word EVERYDAY at face value I’m a working man that uses his hands for EVERYDAY at work these buds are great for that but I also enjoy hitting the gym after work these ARE NOT GYM ready buds if you wear hoodies or even simply sweat once these buds get wet they always give that feeling they will pop out during your run and I haven’t even touched on the super sensitive control on the buds needles to say DONT USE FOR THE GYM ANYTHING ELSE THERE GREAT
"I have used TOZO earbuds for years. Decided to try these out.Pros: The sound quality if great. They stay in your ears easily even when you're sweaty.Cons: Unless you have toddler sized fingers they are awkward/difficult to grab onto and pull put from the charging case. My biggest complaint is that you can't turn them on/off via the touch sensor. They automatically turn off after a few secs if you turn off bluetooth, but if you want to turn them back on you have to insert then back into the case, then take then back out.I'm going back to TOZO solely for that feature."
"I got this for my little brother as a beginning set to teach him to keep track of his things and keep it charged, which worked well.As far as ease of use goes, these are easy to connect to, and the charger for the case is built into the case itself.The weight is super light, though this is mostly because of the lower quality plastic that its made with.It is super bass heavy, a kinda muddy as well. However, if you are looking for bass pver balance and you arent super into music, these would be a good alternative to something like raycons."
"There are several reasons why I am writing this comment.  First of all you must understand there are billions of people on the planet and few of us will have the same shape to our ears and hoping these will fit everyone simply because a rubber cap of differing sizes is in the box.  I found it a pain in the rear simply attempting to remove the pieces from the charging box because my fingers are too large for the gap the designers felt everyone would have no issues with.  That's two issues already.  I attempted to use these when going to sleep so my music didn't wake my wife.  The only way I could/did change volume, tracks of music or utilize any of the tasks they claim were available were when I didn't want to change anything  when trying to touch the tabs on the sides of each earpiece I couldn't get the devices to do what they were intended to do.  I am also not liking the manner in which the devices are supposed to charge with the small pullout tab on the bottom of the box  this, to me, is a failure point which when the tab is damaged or broken or bent the whole set will become useless as there is no type c connection on the box.  And I could go on but ill stop there.  They didn't work like they were supposed to, they were uncomfortable to wear and seems to be design faulty right from the start."
"If sound is only coming out of one earbud —-> that means they are unpaired from each other. If they unpair with each other, which these do sometimes: 1. “Forget” the earbuds on your device. 2. Put both the earbuds back in the case. 3.  Tap the Left one 7 times, then tap the Right one 7 times. Done. Then they are paired to each other again. If that doesn’t work, wait a couple minutes until they stop blinking and do the 7 tap scenario again."
"I used these at the gym ( about 5x a week). It's been about a year and the right ear bud will no longer charge. Not sure if it was user error. I likedthe sound quality and fit. I chose to not repurchase the ear buds because if they turn off on you (not linked to Bluetooth in time), you have to set them back in the case to turn them back on."
"Maybe I got a faulty one but this one connects to my phone randomly even when the earbuds are inside the charging case 🤔 not a huge problem bec I just have to turn off Bluetooth and on again and it’s gone. Other than that, this is very affordable for the high quality it provides. I only got this because I lost my previous one of the same product (which I bought from target few months ago and did not have the random connect issue)"
"I’ve only had them a couple days, bought as an economic fill in until my Bose EarPods get replaced. Set up was easy, the fit is light and comfortable. Call quality is great and tap functions are plentiful and work well. I also like that you can use left or right individually.Now the “bad”: the app doesn’t function most of the time (so far) and didn’t find the headphones when I open the app. Sound quality is ok with music, I tried a couple genres. The lows fall flat but otherwise it’s a nice sound. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being my Bose QC ultra and gen 1 AirPods being about a 4) these are about a 6.5. Additionally they do not charge wirelessly,  which I feel is an industry standard these days.I got mine for $50 (on sale?) and they’re definitely great at that price, not sure I’d feel the same at full price."
"I bought these headphones to replace another set of JBL headphones that has been put through the wash. Those headphones were the kind that ""plug"" into your ear, and they were exceptional. Great noise cancelation, great call quality and battery life. I loved the JBL app and i loved th headphones themselves. So when it was time to replace them, I went on amazon, typed in JBL headphones and quickly ordered this pair that were a bit more expensive, but I felt confident in the choice (the JBL brand has already won me over so I felt comfortable going with a higher priced one without much research, thinking that the cost would be representative of the level of quality, and the quality would be the same/better as the previous headphones, a pair i bought from kohls for about $30 btw)Unfortunalty In my haste, I didn't notice that these are fundamentaly different headphones than what i had before. These are the kind that ""sit"" in your ear rather than ""plug"" into them. I noticed this right away once they arrived and was disappointed....my fault for not making sure, but still. Here i was. I found myself in a predicament. I needed to keep headphones since I was about to board a plane for a vacation, but these weren't the ones I wanted! And they are kinda pricey. Ugh. I decided to keep them and give them a shot. I tried all the different size fittings and found some that worked-ish. Now it's about 3 weeks later and I'm here writing a review.Ultimately the headphones have a good quality feel, good battery life, etc. And im sure they compete with the other major brands and outperform them for the price. But to me, these and just not good headphones. And I postulate that this design is just plain inferior to the ""plug"" in kind in every regard.These never really feel like they are secure in the ear, they don't seal in the ear to create rich deep bass and smooth mids. When there is even the slightest breeze the wind catches them and sends a blast of whistling noise in through the edge of the earbud. And most dissapointing to me,the active noise cancelation doesn't seem to do diddly squat. On my other pair. The difference of turning ANC on/off was night and day. They really blocked out the sound!. On these, there's hardly a difference. Certainly not enough to justify wasting battery life on the feature.Ultimately these may be fine for you if you know for a fact you like this style, but my opinion is these are, and always will be an inferior style of headphone. And I regret not returning these. Be sure to check that this is the style you want and In my case, they may ""accidentily"" make their way in the washing machine sooner than later."
"I want to start by saying that I don't like wearing in-ear buds, they make me feel very uncomfortable. So I have a few options as an Android user that don't cost too much but still sound good. I bought these on sale for $50, and for the price, the sound quality is amazing, especially on the Bass EQ preset, and they fit perfectly. They are in there, but don't close your entire ear canal and make you feel uncomfortable. However, for some reason, you can really hear the wind while you are outside. If you are listening to an audiobook or light music, you will hear the wind really loud. I played around with the settings and couldn't figure out a way to block that wind noise. Another thing is, the noice cancelling feature is super weak. I wouldn't even call these noise cancelling earbuds. I don't care for this feature that much so it doesn't bother me, but I would not market these as noise cancelling earbuds. All that being said, I will keep these for the sound quality and comfortable fit. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could so I'm going with 3."
"The sound is great and everyone hears me great, also the battery life is one of the best I have had.  I would give them 5 stars, but I have three sets of these and non of them charge in the case very well, I have to hope I have one out of three that charge overnight, today all three sets only had 10% charge so I had to bang them on the table and stand the cradle up and hope one of them charges today.  It is the worst charging I have every had, and that's on all three of them, and they were all brand new when I bought them."
