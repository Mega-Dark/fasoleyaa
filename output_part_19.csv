"I didn't do my homework before purchasing. Seems well built, with some decent features for the price. But only saves videos to .MOV format. Can't do much in terms of sharing without converting to MP4."
"After doing research, I was sure that this camera would be pretty decent for the price but that wasn't the case. It was just delivered so I did a quick little vlog experiment to see what it was capable of and boy was I disappointed. The attached pics are some of the clearest frames from the video. The video is surprisingly grainy, especially since this is suppose to be 4k. And yes, I have checked all of the settings... Also, one of the reasons I ordered this particular model was because it had the tripod mount hole on the camera itself so that you don't have to use the case all of the time. Unfortunately, you can't access the battery/sd card door if you have the camera mounted to anything like that. Just a little bummed out by it. :("
I cancelled the order before it's shipped but the saler pushed to ship it anyway. The product quality is not as good as expected in both video and audio.
"So I bought this, used it for years.  The audio is not good - have to raise it in editing.  The low light ability is grainy so you need a light on it.  Outside in daylight it's good.  The door broke off right after I got it - the one to the ports.  That led to the USB connector melting so I can't put a cable on it anymore.  I wrote customer service and they said ""sorry, you had it too long"" and decided not to send a replacement.  Guess I should have written them when the door broke....  I will not be buying this brand again due to their decision.  The wholesale cost of this camera (guessing $40) just cost them a customer for life.  Sad part here is it would have led to me buying 3 more as my business expands."
Quality isn’t there and the internal mic isn’t great either. It’s ok for a cheaper option.
"I have two big issues with this camera. The image quality of the photos once I upload to my phone via the app are the worst possible quality. they are 640x480, similar to a picture from a flip phone. I have gone thru all of the settings, set it to 20mp and high quality. I have done a factory reset but nothing worked. I am using a brand new memory card, the Samsung EVO that is recommended. I thought it might be an issue with the card so I ordered another. This did not work!.  The other issue is the most of the time when I try to take a picture it says 'Card Error'. I have to power it off then back on. Therefore I missed my photo opportunity. I guess it doesn't matter since it looks like I used a potato to take the picture. This is Very disappointing, I purchased this camera for my Caribbean vacation hoping to use it to underwater photos, sadly I found out once I got there so I wasn't able to purchase an alternate camera. Needless to say I will be returning this POS Looking back I wish I paid up for the real McCoy rather than not have pictures from my vacation! I see some people have had some success with this camera, who knows maybe I got a bad one, but to me it is not worth the risk. My advise is to not believe all of the reviews and stay away from this garbage."
It’s low quality don’t very recommend it just save some money and buy a GoPro button are very hard to push
"I thought that for 1/2 the price of a GoPro I might get decent quality. Instead it is completely unacceptable quality. I have tried all variations of settings, resolutions, frame rate, stabilization (didn't notice any stabilization at all). I'm not sure what to think of the other reviews of this camera. Look for yourself at the capture of a single frame of a video I took with this camera."
"I didn't see and it's not really made clear that THIS CAMERA DOESN'T SUPPORT AN EXTERNAL MICROPHONE so I want to type this out in the most obvious way I can that THIS. CAMERA. DOES. NOT. SUPPORT. AN. EXTERNAL. MICROPHONE.  If you're thinking of buying it to motovlog or for cycling, or anything else that introduces a fair amount of wind noise understand you are stuck with the camera microphone and no way to use a separate mic to help isolate it from the wind.  I'm dropping two stars for this unfathomable oversight by Akaso, and the fact that this is a piece of information you have to dig around to find."
returned did not like the camera....This camera was the Brave 7LE the Brave 7 is better....
"I didn't spend much time with this camera since the audio was so bad I decided to return it. If talking in a normal tone of voice when recording video, I had to turn the volume up on the PC to 100% just to hear anything on playback. Also, in order to transfer files to a PC, you have to remove the battery, then remove the micro SD card and place it in a card reader. C'mon folks... this isn't the 1990's. One should be able to move files via to a PC with a USB cable or WiFI. Finally, I had trouble with the remote not turning off the recording when pressed - the remote turned on the video OK, but I had to hit the button 2-3 times to turn it off. I gave it two stars only because the build quality seemed OK."
I love this camera it is awesome and the quality is really good it feels good and the video quality is really good as well can’t wait to take it to my trip to the blowing rocks reserve next weekend when I go snorkeling will post pictures later also I’m giving low stars to somethings because I don’t know how much water resistance it is yet so when I decide to test it which won’t be soon then I’ll let you know
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I purchased in Nov 2021 (in replacement for my v50) but I let it sat there coz I got so busy doing some editing. After 3mos, i had the chance to use it in an outdoor with few clips here and there. I got home reviewed the clips and noticed that i didnt hear any sound from any of the clips. I figured I must have turned off all the volume from the configuration (coz I dont wanna hear the beeps etc). I ignored and deleted the video clips. I factory reset the camera, used it to take a video of an event, reviewed the footage and DISAPPOINTMENT-NO SOUND- video shaky. Gave it a last chance on this last clip. Unfortunately, return to amazon has lapsed so I'm stuck w a garbage item.  I'll try to contact akasoUpdateContacted support. Was told to reset and I did. I found the stabilization control. Worked. I was told to install Potplayer the sound improved a little bit. Overall, This is something that you can use if you don’t mind the sound. A substitute for GoPro for half the price also half the performance. So I added another star"
"This is my 3rd Akaso POV/action camera. And they've all been pretty good. I chose to spend less this time and try this Brave 7, because I've lost 3 or 4 GoPros -- and GoPros are EXPENSIVE!But after using a GoPro Hero 8 with their latest software and comparing it with this Akaso, the two cameras simply aren't in the same class. The GoPro(s) are a head and shoulders above the Akaso. Picture quality, image stabilization, connectivity, software and just about everything else, the GoPros shine. And even though a GoPro Hero 10 costs three times as much, that's what I'll be going to."
"UPDATE:  after several months of use, I can no longer recommend this camera.  The stabilization just does not work well.  After my latest adventure hiking in the Smokies, I can't even watch the videos without getting nauseated from the jerkiness of the videos.  I had stabilization activated and it was so shaky that I could not use the footage in my project.  The only videos I could use is when I'm standing still and hold the camera as still as possible.  Since I'm well outside the return policy, I'll have to eat the price I paid for it.  If you want a camera that you can actually use while doing action activities, look elsewhere.  This camera will not meet your needs.  Sorry Akaso, After multiple years of using your products, I have given up on trying to like them.  Between poor underwater color quality, image stabilization during any amount of movement, I cannot recommend your products any longer.I have owned multiple Akaso cameras and this one definitely feels like it is made well and solid.  I have tested it above water so far and will test it diving later.  So far I really like the user interface and the fact that it's water resistant.  I wanted something that I could use for diving and if the case leaked a bit it wouldn't fry the camera. the only issue that I have so far is that the battery door and the USB door are pretty hard to open but I get that it's part of being water resistant.  I plan on also getting the Brave 7 when it's released."
"Was getting ready to start back up cruising, and thought it would be cool with a small action camera.  Did a lot of research and settled on this Akaso Brave 7 LE.  Received it yesterday, charged batteries and remote, added SD card, and went out to try it outside.  I guess you could say I was ""blown away"" negatively.  While it said it was recording video in 4K at 30FPS, it looked worse than 720P to me.  In fact, my old iPhone XS has much better-looking 720P video, and the 1080P & 4K modes blow this thing out of the water.  This camera also boasts about 20MP photos.  Not even close.  My 12MP photos on my iPhone are much higher quality.  My intention was to keep from losing my iPhone or getting it wet, while having some fun with an action camera.  No thank you.  From what I've seen in other videos, go GoPro or go home.  So, my solution for cruising was to return this thing, get a $20 Ghostek Nautical case (actually they're on-sale for the iPhone XS for $18 now...and are $50 for the iPhone 12).  The Ghostek Nautical case is waterproof to 20' for one hour.  And, I purchased a $36 folding single axis Gimbal, tripod, and selfie-stick combo.  So, for $54 I served the same purpose, except with much better quality.  With purchasing high speed SC cards, extra batteries, a handle grip, and a carrying case this action camera & equipment was over $200, so I saved myself about $150 that I can spend at bars on the cruise ship.  Good luck!"
"I bought this to replace an Apeman A100 that was lost on a scuba trip. Had pretty high hopes once I opened it. Feels a lot heftier and better built than the A100... But once I took a few pictures and a test video, it was kind of a kick in the gut. Attached an image from outside during noon and a screen grab of the ""4k"" video... My old 1080p ActiveOn CX Gold camera takes better video and pictures. My $5 web cam could probably do better as well. Might get a better image out of a potato.I did email their support asking if this the expected image quality. If anything changes I will update the review, but pretty sure I am just going to return these two cameras.Edit: Support said this is the expected quality. So I am returning the two I bought. Uploading side by side screen grabs from the Brave 7 LE and a $37 action cam also from amazon. The Brave is on the top and the left."
"I’ll try and shorten this as much as possible. My Norton 360 pops up a warning when you go into the editing of the pics you take with your iPhone. I sent the report to Norton and they emailed me back after looking at the file and stood by their assessment. Akaso went from offering me a 25% to a 50% discount for my inconvenience after I sent them the report. Their explanation was that it was a 3rd party SDK ( software development kit) and at this time there was nothing they could do about it. I’m highly suspicious and my Norton has always served me well for years and I have great confidence in their assessment.They asked me to disable my antivirus which I told them defeats the purpose of the pop-up warning. I have not read any other reviews with this particular issue, and I might have pursued it further with Norton had I not experienced other issues with the camera ….constant formatting of the SD card despite trying several of the best known ones….constant disconnecting of the wi-fi, and the last straw was that it wouldn’t turn off, I had to remove the battery.I have returned the camera and would be interested if anyone else has experienced these issues ?"
"The AKASO 7LE is ""ok"".  Its well built and is a reasonable lightweight camera, but its not special!  I found the video quality and picture quality to be good, but ease of use was disappointing. I dont feel that the microphone is very good and there are no external jacks for a mic.  I actually returned the first camera because the mic didnt work correctly. The replacement works, but seems highly susceptible to wind noise. (even with the software correction!).  The software that is installed isnt that easy to navigate and its awkward and fiddley to use the camera.  I find myself spending more time trying to set it up than should be necessary. By the time you turn it on and navigate to the menu, the shot is lost. I find it easier to get my Iphone out of my pocket and shoot with that and the picture quality is near equivalent.  So far I have used it for bike rides, high speed driving and canoeing. Picture and video quality is good, sound quality poor and setting it up to use is fiddley. I feel 40% happy  - hence 2 stars."
"When I purchased this item I got to the ""frequently bought together"" part. And it showed the camera, a 128gig memory card and a mount/accessory kit. So I purchased all 3. I downloaded the instructions for setting up the camera and discovered it will only accept upto a 64 gig card."
"This product is just awful. Sometimes in 1999 it would've been a great product for its price.The video quality is grainy, you can easily confuse 6 to 8 on the plates.If you buy this camera (as I did) to collect video evidence in case you face an accident while riding your bike, then look to GoPro or Dji for earlier models. They are cheap but they are very reliable and video quality is excellent, this is exactly what you need.If you buy this camera to make video memories of your trip, ride or an exciting moment... Poor you... Do not."
"The camera itself functions well and was a lot of fun to use. Unfortunately after about 10 sessions of use, the battery latch has broken off and can't be closed. Prior to this the battery compartment got moisture in it, even though I always used it in the ""waterproof"" outer shell that I also had to replace for leakage. It still functioned after drying out, but with the the battery latch snapped completely off I can no longer trust it under water. The main reason I purchased this model was for snorkeling, so I'm super disappointed."
"I was excited to get this camera for my upcoming vacation, I wanted something that was waterproof and that I could easily transfer the photos to my phone. I mainly wanted this camera for photos, not videos, and I’m really disappointed in the photo quality. And i am by no means a photographer of any sort, I just wanted good quality vacation pictures without having to rely on my phone. No matter how the lighting is and how still you hold the camera, the photos turn out grainy. Not to mention, the camera is so tiny that it’s hard to handle. I’d be embarrassed to even ask someone on vacation to take a photo of me and my boyfriend with it. The camera may be good for people who take videos and not photos, I’m not sure about the video quality as I didn’t even try it. I just thought the camera quality should be far better for the expense. Not what I was expecting, already returned!"
Just received this camera today. Was super excited to be able to record some of my outdoor activities. The build quality and included accessories all seem great. I tried taking a few quick videos just walking around my yard to get used to how the camera works and see the video quality. I'm super disappointed with the image stabilization feature. The video is super jumpy just from me WALKING around my yard. There is no way this would take a quality video while bicycling or riding my utv around. Based on what I've seen this really shouldn't be called an action camera.
After reading the Other Reviews on the Akaso Brave 7 LE I was fairly confident I would be upgrading from my other cheaper camera. However upon receving my device and testing out the video I was sorely dissapointed. Not only did they seem to have the same opporating system but the Brave seemed to have the worst camera sensor I have seen on a modern device for a long time. Switching to different resolutions did nothing to solve the problem and in the case of 1080P 60 FPS to 2.7k 60 FPS seemed to get worse. Vertical bands appear in every setting and regardless of the angle.Not to mention an external microphone I had perchased from the same seller claiming to fit this model was in fact the wrong plug. (Microphone has USB-C Connector and camera has MicroUSB.I was looking forward to having better videos of me riding my Motorcycle but it seems I'll be waiting for better quality video for a bit.
Was so complicated that I just returned it!
Waste of time. Doesnt function as it should. Recorded a 5 minute video and it only saved 30 seconds of it.  Doesnt stay connected long enough to watch a whole video. Video quality is extremely poor.  Download of a video to phone was unsuccessful several times.
"The quality of the build seems solid. The quality of the footage is decent. There is considerable barrel distortion. And, maddeningly, recordings max out at 3 minutes. If you want to record anything longer, you’ll have to contend with about a second of missing content between each 3-minutes recording. If you’re like me and need an action cam for casual purposes, this works great. But if you want to make serious content, then I’d look at the bigger brands."
"Nice camera, small, 4K/30,  pretty good colors and audio but... not an action camera,  NO STABILIZATION.Videos are very shaky and almost unusable. IT IS A NICE SMALL VLOGGING CAMERA but without an option for an external microphone. Good app to connect with cell phones but no Bluetooth connection - Wi-Fi only, easy to load the files to a PC with a USB cable."
"I graduated first in my medical school class so I'm an intelligent person.  This go pro has very difficult controls.  Mine had no readable instructions;  only microscopic print that I could not read.  Then they insist that you install an app on your cell phone (probably so they can track you). The reason I bought the thing was because I didn't have a phone!  Why buy this thing if you have a phone?  Then they say go to their website, but the website download doesn't work for my computer.  Then the camera doesn't work.  I just wasted a lot of money on this piece of junk.  I will never buy anything from this company again."
"I upgraded from a 3 to the 12 and find the menu awkward to use.  First you have two on and off buttons, one on the side, allows you to select different functions, the other, on top starts the photo or video command and start shooting, press again and it turns off the camera instead of just stopping the filming.  The user interface is anything but obvious and user friendly.  I gather that with the added features they had to find ways to incorporate them into the menu.  As they say, if the UI requires you to read a manual or search online, it's bad design"
"Overheating hasn't been a problem, yet. But it has gotten hot. Price dropped $100 since I bought mine within two months - may be worth it at the lower price. But due to price drop and not much of an upgrade, I'd go with something other than gopro."
"Bought this to replace my GoPro Hero 4 for motovlogging. I had it for just over a month and had multiple issues. SD card corruption, audio not working, it's annoying and cumbersome to change the batteries, and the icing on the cake was that it will NOT pair with my DJI Mic 2 bluetooth microphone.Just to change the batteries I have to unplug my mic from the media mod, unscrew the camera from the mount, take off the media mod (which is a pain in itself), replace the battery, then put it all back together.I've been a loyal GoPro user for a long time, but I had to end up getting something else for what my intended use is. The camera quality is great and I love the mobile app, it's just not good for my specific application."
"I have purchased multiple cameras of different formats over many years. This is my first GoPro. It's my last also. Nearly every time I try to use it, It shuts off and when I turn it back on I get a message saying that it overheated. The first time it happened it complained about my video card. I purchased the appropriate video card... Didn't help a bit. So then went online and searched for why GoPros get too hot, and I found a video on YouTube telling me that if I bought a metal case it would help drain the heat away from the camera. So I spent $45 on that. That doesn't help too much either. 1 out of six times it will work for a while. It shuts off every single time. If I had checked it out before my expiration I would have returned it. Don't waste your money. There's something inherently wrong with the way these cameras function. If it was $45 I could say oh well I lost some money and it was a mistake. This was an expensive purchase and I deeply regret it."
"Tried this camera hard to navigate and set up . There is a learning curve for this GoPro, its not for me. I bought a GoPro 10 easier to navigate, longer battery life."
"I was trying to use it for my sons' baseball games and it would just overheat after about an hour and a half.  It wasn't even very hot (80s), but it was in direct sunlight which I expect was the problem.  However, for a camera that seems most useful outdoors, this is a major issue in my opinion.  We have rigged solutions to it like putting a fan on it or covering it, but it's ridiculous to have to turn to an aftermarket solution for this."
"Send back as it is a repackaged unit. Disappointed to open the box and see that all the cables weee unbundled and the camera unit itself was dirty with water spots indicating use.Will buy a replacement direct from GoProReplacing a Hero 12 that is used for auto racing and was damaged to to significant impact, overall happy with the Hero 12, just knowing they are delicate don’t want to start with something someone else returned."
"Main set back is cloud being ill manageable. Its very difficult to upload videos and photos in the social media. Once it gets uploaded in the app, it should go to the cloud and then download in phone. Only then can post in my social media. It is not user friendly. But has good video and picture quality."
"An unexpected problem and an unpleasant problem - the camera turns off due to overheating, after 15-20 minutes of work.The main part of the overheating was “removed” by more gentle settings, it only remains to find metal legs that will work as a heat sink, since plastic ones contribute to overheating."
Great video quality but once it overheats it shuts off and that happens at around the 15 min mark.
Battery life is far too short
"Buy it for the picture quality, but pass on it for the insta360 because it's software and connectivity is absolutely horrendous. Works almost never making it an absolute nightmare to set up shots, sync footage to your phone, or really use it in any way other than a beefed up DLSR. GoPro the company's support is almost non-existent for rectifying offering only canned responses, and if you're hoping this will get fixed with software updates: they've been getting complaints about it for over HALF A DECADE.There are better options."
"Disappointing Firmware Update Experience with GoPro HERO12I recently purchased the GoPro HERO12, excited to use it for upcoming adventures, but I’ve been thoroughly disappointed due to a frustrating firmware update issue. Despite following all the recommended steps, the firmware refuses to update, leaving the camera unusable out of the box.I’ve tried multiple methods, including updating via the app and manually through the SD card, but nothing has worked. The lack of clear troubleshooting guidance and the fact that such a critical step doesn’t function as it should is incredibly frustrating.As a result, I haven’t been able to use the camera at all. For a product that’s advertised as top of the line, this experience has been underwhelming and disappointing. I expected much more from GoPro and hope they address these firmware update problems quickly."
"Camera keeps turning itself off and on after I turn it on.  Contacted customer service who said I needed to buy a different SD card. I am using a Scandisk Ultra card which worked fine when I first began using this camera.  GoPRO is now saying that I should be using a Scandisk Extreme and they said that “yes, it will work with Scandisk Ultra, but it will stop working and you need to purchase a Scandisk Extreme card.”  What?  It works, but then it won’t work and I have to spend more money?  And, everytime I use the camera it tries to upsell me on their cloud subscription, which I have to acknowledge and dismiss before I can use the camera.  DON’T WALK, RUN FROM THIS CAMERA!  There are lots better options out there that perform better and have longer battery life."
DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLERI was having troubles being able to record for a couple races. Maybe 20min at a time. Turns out the battery is junk. Make sure you check the battery when you get it. Mine was 18 months old so it came with a diminished capacity. Didnt know that for awhile and wouldn't you know its past the time you can return it. Beware of this seller. Buy direct from the company I'm sure they will take care of you.
don't buy this if your going to try and video anything in low light or dark sky.  Its not made for it despite all the reviews stating otherwise
"I've used GoPros since the Hero 7. This was my upgrade from the Hero 9. I don't notice any difference at all and, even worse, the 12 does not shoot in Narrow. How do they not improve anything but actually drop features?"
Could not get this to update and work for the life of me. Looking to get back into an older gonpro with less tech
I've tried multiple SD cards and all the app says is that it encountered an error. Gonna be returning this for sure.
"On the second use, I got an SD card error indicating I should remove the card.  I did and discovered water in the camera.  This was after swimming in the ocean in less than 5 ft of water.  Extremely disappointed.  Edit 20 mins later: the entire camera won’t even power on now."
"Touch screen broke after a few uses. Reason why I got it was having water proof camera while kayaking. Not sure  how it broke. Put in my kayak while getting into water and when I went to mount, screen was busted. I bought the GoPro for something that would stand up to physical activity. I guess I got the wrong impression of what this camera is used for. Then found out go pro does not repair its equipment."
"Camera didn’t work half of the camera was missing, there was no damage to the box yet when I opened it the whole front of the camera was missing, wasn’t even in the box does go pro not have quality control?"
Unit failed after immersion in ocean water to a depth of a couple feet.
"No competent customer service and no way to reach the company. After writing an extensive report about the problem and error message on the GoPro contact page, a CS person who had a script and no real knowledge asked me to take a picture of the error message and send it to a link she provided. She told me she had no way to access the information I had already provided.I thanked her and returned the camera and accessories to Amazon."
Opened it and my child droped it one time. Menu screen stopped working. Not worth the money or aggravation. Also you have to subscriptions etc..  just set it up. buy another brand.
"Camera was damaged when I received it, requested a refund and now I have to go take it to the post office. Horrible experience, i was really looking forward to using my new camera"
The GoPro was a fake 😓
Do not buy!!! It overheats and because the firmware is not stable it will turn itself off with no warning
Can't use it if it won't update. It won't update so can't use it. Ha.
This camera was good when it arrived after a while it just frozen as you can see and won't turn back on.
listed as brand new but the seal is open.
The price is exactly the same as last year. Didn't work at all. Had to return.
You would think the 12th version of anything would have all the bugs worked out. These are trash. I thought i had battery issues and after the 3rd new battery and multiple memory cards with same results we finally realized it was the camera. This is supposed to be an action camera and slight vibrations rattles the battery loose and it dies. We use for on track (smooth asphalt) use. I have spoken to several people we race with and everyone agrees these are the worst camera option out there. Save your money and buy something else.
"Here’s the review of the GoPro Hero 12 based on the feedback you provided:---Review of the GoPro Hero 12: A Disappointing ProductThe GoPro Hero 12 is by far one of the most disappointing products I’ve ever used. To start, the battery life is abysmal—it barely lasts, and if you’re expecting to use it for a prolonged shoot or activity, forget about it. It overheats every 3-4 minutes, sometimes even sooner, which renders it practically useless in the middle of any action.Now, let’s talk about video quality. While daytime footage is passable—ranging from reasonable to good—the nighttime video performance is horrendous. Any scene with even slightly lower lighting is simply unusable. The image becomes so poor that you’ll struggle to get anything worthwhile out of it.But the worst part? The constant overheating. It’s a recurring problem. Every few seconds, the camera gets too hot and shuts down. This happens in the middle of capturing crucial moments, leaving you stranded without the footage you need.This product simply doesn’t deliver on what it promises. In fact, it fails at its core purpose—capturing action reliably. If you’re thinking about buying the GoPro Hero 12, I’d strongly advise against it. It's a terrible product that doesn’t live up to expectations in any sense. Save your money."
Im just wondering when gopro will address the overheating problem with temps over 85 degress.  i had mine in the shade and still got an overheating notice on the camera. cant they make them with a fan or maybe white or both?
Camera burst into flames when charging almost caught house on fire and caused bodily injuries. GoPro support only offered 15% off on a replacement.
i upgraded from hero 11 and it was a huge mistake. this go pro hero 12 is awful. doesnt connect to my computer. iphone. macbook. tried hours and hours to find a fix only to realize its a faulty gopro..
"I bought the GoPro specifically to use the labs firmware for long time lapse. Long story short, I've never gotten it to run for more than around 12 hours, regardless of the settings. Even eschewing the scheduled photo functions, no matter what power source I've plugged into, no mater what settings I've used, the camera will inevitably bork itself after around half a day of shooting.As an aside, when you do manage to get some footage I strongly suggest a workflow that eschews GoPro Cloud completely. There is no way to download more than 25 full resolution raw photos at a time. When you're  taking hundreds or thousands of photos a day, that's less than ideal.Given that the Labs firmware functions don't work well, and the standard time lap functions... also don't work very reliably, I'd recommend shying away from GoPro. There are competitively priced action cameras with larger sensors, better battery life, and less of a tendency to self-sabotage. Don't be lured in by the promise of GoPro's feature set, it simply doesn't deliver."
and tricks you into thinking their cameras work and don't just randomly freeze and crash after 5 min
"This camera is irritating. I bought an extra battery & a 3 battery charger seperate from the camera. Even this isn't enough. The camera heats up super fast, sometimes causing the camera to freeze. The previous versions had a known RAM problem that was supposed to be fixed. I've probably spent an additional $200 dollars on top of the price of accessories. A $500 dollar camera that doesn't work. Engineering needs to take a much better look at this design. RAM RAM RAM how hard is it to have enough operating space to run this camera. On top of that there is no zoom and I understand why. I think they really dropped the ball on the GoPro 12. I'll never buy another one. If this is a Quality Control problem they must have been short handed on the day this camera was tested if at all."
Never again will I stray from DJI. To many things to list. Just not impressed at all. The only thing in my opinion that this has over the 11 is no overheating issue. That and a better menu. That’s it.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Won't turn on  after only one use😢 😭... I bought this camera on the 22 of April to restart my YouTube channel only used it once just to test the quality which loved,I even used it in a secured case just to not get it wet. Then i got busy with work, now that I'm ready for another adventure just to find that no matter what I do the camera won't turn on... sigh!!!"
The battery is going to cause burns and explode
great camera but overheats like crazy and shuts down in the Middle of a recording.
"I bought the Go pro after reading a number of reviews and after watching videos of it in action. It works considering I have only used it once but I was disappointed at the video quality indoors, (I haven’t used it outdoors yet). My iPhone 11 does a better job taking brighter videos indoors than this go Pro. Another worrisome point is overheating. The camera shut down due to overheating about 25 mins into a video recording. Not ideal at all."
none of the mounts tighten tight enough to withstand movement. Disappointing. If your looking for quality that can be used while moving these cameras may not be it because of the mounts. Camera is decent but useless without a mount that stays tight
"You can't use audio unless it's outside the waterproof box.  There is a clip for that, but it obscures the screen.  Most of the attachments are focused on the box, not the camera outside the box, which is what I bought it for.Needs a bit more attention to make it equally functional in both modes."
"bought this hoping it'd make a good GoPro-dupe, it was not. Camera motion & quality wasn't anywhere near a GoPro, but this is definitely a great starter-camera for those looking for something better than your average, run-of-the-mill camera recorders without breaking the bank!"
"While all the included accessories are a nice touch, it's all for nothing because the video that comes out of this camera is just really, really poor. Even at the highest quality settings the video (I used the camera to record myself for archery video coaching) was grainy and overcompressed, even in good outdoor lighting conditions. The ""4k"" video setting is pointless because while the image size is 4k, the image quality is blocky and grainy to the point where it still looks pretty crummy even when downsampled to 1080p or lower.I eventually got an old GoPro Hero 9 and even that yielded substantially better quality output. I'd recommend that as preferable over wasting your money on this item."
"Important update (see original review below):I reduced my rating from two stars to one due to the seller's harassment/scam after I posted my original review.They contacted me asking to confirm my shipping address so they could send me a replacement. I explained my shipping situation and made sure they had a usable address. They contacted me again asking me to confirm my address so they could send me a replacement. I answered again, starting with a clear statement that my address is current (just to give the simplest possible answer) and then explained my shipping situation and again made sure they had a usable address. They contacted me a third time... asking me to confirm my address so they could send me a replacement.Obviously, they're disregarding my replies. I believe what they want us to fool me into thinking the ""Yes, this message is helpful"" button will somehow confirm my address, when clearly that is not what it does. They were given a usable answer the first time, so this looks like a scam and at this point is feeling like harassment.DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. Regardless of the awful quality of the camera, the seller's behavior (offering rewards for higher reviews, harassing those who give low reviews) creates a terrible customer experience. Sellers like these should be banned.Original review:I'm a photographer (I sell online, my work has been shown in a gallery, my stock images have been used internationally, etc.) so the first thing I wanted to know was the quality of the images. Camera-wise, this is a very cheap unit, so I wasn't expecting much. I certainly didn't think it would be up to the level of my newest DSLR. I just hoped it was above the level of a toy camera, and that the photos might be worth sharing beyond family and close friends.Nope! The images aren't even close to sharp, they look like they came from a cheap old VGA (640x480) webcam and were then ""sized up"" massively in an image editor, which never looks good, because software can't add that much detail that was missing in the original image. I can't see any way that the sensor in this thing is capturing even close to 4K, so to me that just looks like false advertising.I've noticed seller or manufacturer feedback to other complaints about image quality, suggesting changing the exposure and white balance. There is no white balance setting! (And even if there was, it would affect the color, not the sharpness of the image.) Also, I tried various lighting settings with the exposure at its neutral setting. There's no reason to believe that adjusting the exposure setting will magically make the sensor capture more sharply.I bought this as a hopefully-durable camera for an upcoming trip, because the camera in my phone is pretty bad. Not sure I'll even waste the minimal luggage space taking this junk, it's worse than my phone's bad camera by a long shot. The only thing this camera has over my phone is that I don't care if it gets damaged, lost, or stolen.I also considered using this camera as a dash cam, but I have to wonder if a license plate could even be read in an image from it.So, my money was mostly wasted, although if the accessories that ship with it are GoPro-compatible then this package might have some value. Perhaps I'll find some amusing way to destroy the camera itself to get a little entertainment value from it. Shall I see how it holds up being run over by a dump truck? Hmm, maybe!Other first-impression notes: The documentation is ridiculously sparse. Even the ""full"" manual is way too sparse. You'll have to experiment and resort to online research to answer any questions. (Hint: To open the waterproof case, lift up the black piece along the edge just above the lens, it will then hinge toward the back and the rest will be fairly obvious.) The screw in the mount that the camera ships in was on so tight I had to use vise grips to get it loose. The battery charger LEDs go from red to a bright blue when the battery is done charging -- and the blue doesn't turn off when you pull the battery out of the charger, so unless you really like all that extra blue light you won't be leaving the charger conveniently plugged in.This product is not even remotely deserving of a five-star rating, and any such ratings should be looked at with extreme skepticism. I gave it an extra star just for the accessories that might have value later with a better camera. The camera itself is basically a 1-star camera due to the awful image quality."
"I had purchased the AKASO EK7000 camera with the included 64GB microSD card. I had been dealing with issues from day one, specifically with the camera automatically shutting off randomly.I had originally attributed this to a glitch with the OS, specifically with the auto shut off, and turned it off after seeing that it helped some people with the issue. It worked fine for about a week, but this morning after finishing my daily commute, I found that the camera hadn't shut off, but that there was a message stating ""Slow card"" on the screen.The included SD card that came in the bundle was being rejected by the camera, despite the fact that the camera has only been in service for about 2 months. There should not have been any degradation in the SD card yet, so either the card I received is junk, or the camera is defective, or both. Either way, this is a huge quality control issue, because I NEED this thing to work if I have an accident, and it randomly not working is unacceptable.You get what you pay for, and I'll look into higher quality brands and see if I can get something that will actually do it's job.Update 11/16So i checked for an actual consistency in this issue, and it appears that it happens on sunny bright days. This is logical, as alot of changing colors changing will cause the bitrate to spike, but it also means this camera is not only useless for safety, it has a high chance of not even working for people that want to film their bike rides on a really nice dayDon't be cheap, and order a camera from a reputable brand."
"So far I have just tested it around the property. It's alright.... It does a decent job. Complaints would be sound quality. It's muffled because it's inside a box. No method for attaching an external mic without drilling a hole in the case, thus compromising the waterproofing. Might buy a second case for that. Color goes weird and yellow in some outdoor settings, but I expect I can fix that with editing software. Real test will be how well it does on my prospecting trips, that remains to be seen. But it's probably worth what I paid for it as is.Update: Image quality is far below 20MP probably closer to 6MP Hopefully it is at least serviceable as an action cam for recording my prospecting trips."
"I wanted so badly to like this product!  I wanted to fight the Big Guy (GoPro) and believe that others could do a good job.The reviews of the camera gave it a 4.6 out of 5, but I think it could be because they are not using it like I was planning on using it.Unboxing was not bad. Zero written directions provided, but I learned more on YouTube than I did once I found and printed the owners manual out. The manual was not bad you simply have to read through and have the camera in hand.There were a bazillion attachments, none with directions but I was able to figure out what was what. I had also invested in an accessory kit that had a bazillion more attachments. No directions but again I took the time to work through them.I mounted the camera on the dash of my motorcycle and made quite a few runs with it on. I have to admit the picture quality and sound really were not that bad. The stabilization is ok, not great. I got a lot of shaking when I was shifting gears and down shifting. I will forgive that. The wind affected stability and since it’s on the front of a motorcycle that cannot be avoided and I forgave that as well. I kept reminding myself it was an $84 camera, not a $350 GoPro. I was ok with the you get what you pay for mentality. I am heading cross country and if the $84 falls off my bike I will ok with that. I would cry if the $350 fell off!The interaction between the camera and my iPhone, via WiFi, was fine. I could download the videos and watch them right away on the phone and clear out the memory card so that would have worked for my trip.Unfortunately the camera continues to lock up once the videos were downloaded and I disconnected from the WiFi. I would have to remove the battery every time to turn the camera off. I had read this complaint and now I get it because you have to reset all your settings including the date and time. Again, $84 vs $350. I am a big girl and I get it.The camera gets very VERY hot and the battery last just over an hour. I am not sure how a GoPro heats up but I have heard the battery life is horrible so can’t complain about this on the camera.I would have kept the camera if what I was planning on doing, say a car trip, diving, bicycling were on the list but it is not.The camera and accessories were returned and maybe one day I will bite the bullet and go for the GoPro!"
"I really wanted to keep this camera, however it will not hold the date or time once it is turned off. The 4k video is definitely upscaled. The pictures are low/medium but not up to par with 20mp.  We were simply using it for our e-bike rides to record our rides. It's just like being on a motorcycle, some people just don't see you and pull right out in front of you, and tons of other stuff..... We needed some way to show video if it was ever needed. Thats why we wanted to keep this camera but because it won't keep the date or time, it will not work properly for us. We could not update the firmware on the camera so the camera just didn't work as described. I actually own the Akaso Brave 7 and I have no issues with it, even though it ALSO upscales the video to 4k. I believe it is upscaled from 1080p. There are TVS that do the same thing. The video on these cameras are equivalent to 1080p30 at best. But, they were good enough for our purposes of recording our rides. There are plenty of videos out there on these cameras showing the video differences. If you have image stabilization turned on it reduces the screen size tremendously. If your looking for a cheap action camera to do outdoor, Good Lighting shots and not expecting Great Quality, this might work for you, IF they fix the date and time issue. Most of these cameras are utterly identical on the insides with a different brand stamped on the outside. This camera comes with plenty of attachments for most beginners with action cameras. I did not test the under water case so I can't review on that. The microphone is actually decent. It did pick up the vibration from the tires on our ebikes but when we're just using it in the wide open, it worked good. Another small downside is it doesn't support usb-C. Usbc is becoming the new standard on cell phones so why do these manufacturers keep using old technology.  (Maybe cheaper or they have an abundance of old usb micro connections) My Akaso Brave 7 camera has the usbc on the camera but they left the remote as the old USB-B micro. ??? However, the ek7000pro isn't a horrible camera for its price and will definitely be good enough for the beginner in action cameras."
"I have mixed feelings about this camera.  $75 isn't a small amount of money for most folks, and I understand this isn't supposed to compare head on with a GoPro, but I feel that, for the price, the value is lacking just a little.The audio quality is not very good. It sounds muffled.  I know most folks aren't buying this for Dolby Atmos quality audio, but for 2019, I expected better audio recording.The other con is the video options.  The 4k options feels like 1080p upsampled and not real 4k.  2.7k doesn't even work.  It just records blue vertical scanlines.The touch screen and navigation of the menus leaves a bit to be desired.  It does not feel like a polished UI, especially since you need to use a mix of the touchscreen and the physical buttons.Colors are a little washed out.The 1080p/60fps is probably the best mode and I feel that's what it should be marketed at.  The image stabilization feels very tacked on.  I noticed very little difference between being on or off.I haven't taken any stills with it.I was able to use a 256GB Samsung Evo Select MicroSD card just fine.There are a ton of mounting accessories that come with this camera.  Pleasantly surprised to see 2 batteries included and a remote.In conclusion, I purchased this camera to film skateboarding and to have a small wide angle camera.  1080p/60fps is perfect for my needs and it does a great job with that.  Would I recommend it? It really depends on your use case and what price.  If you want true 4k, image stabilization, and dynamic audio, look elsewhere.Edited 2019-09-27After re-reading my review and using the device more, I've decided that 3 stars is more appropriate.  The video quality just isn't that great, the pictures feel like up sampled video captures, and the image stabilization isn't even noticeable- ie it doesn't do anything when enabled- except zoom in the picture a bit.  And the audio sucks.  And I mean sucks.  I've heard audio suck before, but it's suckiest crucial suck that ever did suck.  I paid the same amount for a dashcam almost four years ago and it has better image quality and sound.While not supposed to go head to head, I feel you should save the money you were thinking of spending on this, for GoPro or something of similar quality, and use your cell phone in the meantime.Edited 2019-10-03I will say I've been in communication with company and they have been very cordial and accommodating.  I don't feel that's worth adjusting the rating for this product, but I wouldn't hesitate to do business with this vendor again."
"This little camera...and I do mean little...is doing a great job so far. Please take this in account, I don’t have a lot of experience with these little action cams outside of borrowing a GoPro from a friend for a day.- It did come with so many different mounting options that I don't think I'll ever need to buy anything else unless I want to mount it to my dog or a rocket ship or something. I've pretty much only used it IN the waterproof case with the solid back OR the one with the slotted back.- The pictures it takes are clear and completely adequate for my use.- I really like the remote that comes with it, it allows me to put it in hard to reach places and still be able to turn it on when I need it on. That has the benefit of not making the mount move (if it’s a tree branch or rope) by pressing on the camera and you can set it up, leave it and still have some control over it. I’ve been thinking about mounting it to the bottom of my jeep to get footage of the steering linkages to try to find the source of my ‘death wobble’ that would allow me to not have to worry about sifting through 10 minutes of footage to get the 30 seconds I want.- I really like the adjustable angle on the camera, it makes it so I can shoot narrow shots documenting work that I’m doing or wide angle for videoing my daughter diving for toys in the community pool.- The menu is easy enough to navigate using the touch screen or the buttons (if the case is on it), that seems like a well thought out feature.- Battery life is pretty sad, but I suppose the trade off you get with such a small camera. Nice that they at least include a second battery.- I did notice that the time and date seem to reset when you change the battery. That’s something that should really be addressed, I’m going to need to start setting up folders for each file when it’s taken off the camera to keep some kind of chronological order to it all.I haven’t gotten into all the various features and uses of this little camera, but I can’t wait to see what other uses I find.  It’s rather exciting to have…. maybe that means I just need to get out more…***UPDATE*** Well, I guess I shouldn't be too upset about that fact that the USB port hasn't worked for about a year and I haven't used this thing in that long. The batteries are shot and the replacement ones that I bought for it are even worse. I'll be looking for a GoPro that I can afford."
"When I got this camera I tried to shoot 4K video and was very disappointed with the picture quality.  It looked pixelated and compressed.  I then tried all of the other resolutions and found one that looked pretty good - the 720p @ 30fps.  Having some experience with high end professional camcorders, this tells me that the CCD chip is a 720 and the camera simply scales everything up to simulate higher resolutions.  That's really deceptive and the company should be ashamed for doing that.  It's false advertising and it should be criminal, too.But, it just so happens that in my particular situation, just wanting to shoot some YouTube videos, the 720p setting works fine.  I really don't need anything higher.  This camera meets my needs and for $75, I got a pretty good deal.What I like about the camera is that it's tiny, simple to use, and very light.  It comes with many mounting accessories, which is a plus, too.At first I was very disappointed with this purchase and felt ripped-off.  The more I used it, however, I started to warm up to it and now think it's worth the money I paid for it.  Had I really wanted to shoot 4K I would have been angry about the poor picture quality.  So if shooting lower quality video is acceptable to you, this camera may be what you're looking for.  I bought a $5000 JVC professional camcorder in 2009 which shoots in 720p and the picture quality is pretty much identical to this little camera.  So, I can't complain."
I found the interface to be incredibly tedious.Takes decent video.
"Bought this two years ago and have used it several times, along with the various accessories. The plus: It turns on, it will record, and will connect via app to your phone. The downsides: It does all those things poorly. If you set it up remotely and set it to record, it'll run for a few minutes and then randomly stop recording. If you don't actually hit the stop button, it wont save what it recorded. Also, battery life stinks. A fully charged battery, after 5 mins of recording, says it drops to 66% I thought based on reviews this would be a prudent choice considering how expensive GoPro's are, but i guess you get what you paid for. I bought this for $80 in 2022. It's now 8/24 and i see it's a lot less... good luck, maybe your experience will be different than mine."
"The camera seems to work fine, though images/video can be a bit fuzzy/blurry at times.  The image stabilization is decent.  The biggest complaint is that when I am running with the camera on the headband I have no idea if it is recording.  Unfortunately the sounds (beeps) when you start recording are far too quiet to hear and there is no indicator on the remote."
"I bought this camera to use as a helmet-cam when riding my motorcycles.  I figured I may end up with another camera on the bars, so I decided to see if something inexpensive would be of satisfactory output quality, and thereby save a lot of money.  The camera comes with an impressive number of accessories, a waterproof housing, etc.  And even two batteries, with a charging caddy.  I was impressed.But sadly, the video quality is only barely acceptable.  I’ve been recording in 2k and it looks pretty dang bad:  blocky and too contrasty out of camera.  Definitely does not look high-def in the least.  The stabilization is unimpressive … practically nonexistent (maybe it doesn’t work at 2k, which makes this camera a waste of money out the gate).So far, this is not too terribly shy of my expectations, since it’s a cheap camera.But worse, to use it helmet-mounted, on a motorcycle, one really needs to use the app.  That’s because it’s very difficult to see if the camera is recording, or even ON, when it’s mounted to the chin of a helmet).  So the app is easy enough to hook up, you get a remote view of what the camera sees, and it has a start/stop recording button.  Excellent.  Except it continually disconnects.  And you won’t notice, because you’ve probably switched to your nav app.  And when it disconnects, it stops the camera recording, and seems to even turn off the camera (or more likely the auto-sleep kicks in).  So to start recording again you have to turn the camera on, reconnect to its wifi, etc, etc, all either fumbling with gloves on, or by pulling over (or worse, fooling around at a stop light) taking your gloves off, etc, to get things going again.  In other words, it is untrustworthy, and therefore unusable for long-term and/or hands-off recording.Given that, even though the video is (barely) acceptable at the price, it’s still not a good bargain.  I ended up sucking it up and just buying the real thing:  GoPro Hero 8.  That’s what I should have done from the start.  As they say, “buy once, cry once”.  Why do I keep forgetting that lesson?"
"Updated: 1/2022:  I was finally preparing to try out the replacement that had been promptly sent few questions asked, only to find that the new housing had the power button at the top of the case but the camera has it at the bottom. I have been unable to use the new case and camera to see if the quality is better and there are no leaks :(Updated 3/2020: After posting this review, customer service contacted me and asked if they could provide a replacement camera.  I received the camera promptly but due to Covid-19, I will not have an opportunity to try it underwater for some time :(.  Customer service followed up to ensure I received it and has been amazing - I wish all customer service was so customer satisfaction focused!  I will update once I try out the new camera underwater!UPDATED: I purchased this camera to replace my bulky, underwater point and shoot for scuba diving. I love the size and since I'm not looking for 'professional' quality, just clear decent colored pictures, had hopes!  I used the underwater setting and all of the pictures and videos came out with way too much yellow and blue.  Color correcting them did not work.  The underwater housing also started leaking, a slow leak, in the lens compartment after the 3rd day.  Fortunately, it did not flood the camera and it still works. I did take it to Africa and was able to get some nice, clear videos - above water.  Love all the accessories that come with it (although I likely won't use most of them).I had to watch a youtube video to figure out how to remove the camera from the packaging, it did not come with a user guide (I had to pull it offline) and I haven't figure out the sound for video just yet.I haven't tried a GoPro, so can't compare but happy with it for above water but not so much for underwater use due to the bad color and leaking housing.  I will try it underwater again if I can get a replacement housing.  I'll try different settings with different lighting, but I am disappointed in the underwater quality."
"I was recording underwater and all was going well, but then it just stopped recording.  Apparently this is a feature of the camera??? I would call it a bug.  After 5 minutes, unless you turn off that feature ??, you have to transfer the recording to memory, or something like that.  I don't know how a person is supposed to do that with the watertight case, and 40 feet underwater.  I'm going to return this for sure!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is a cheap camera which does not live up to the suspicious number of 5 star ratings on its Amazon page. In this case, you get what you pay for; it is not a quality budget substitute for high-end cameras (ie industry-standard such as GoPro). It isn't bad if you want a cheap camera to experiment with first-time amateur POV filming, or for young kids to play with, but that's about it.Pluses: 1. Comes with a *lot* of mounting accessories2. Decent HD images in flat light at slow speeds3. Comes with 2 batteries4. Has touchscreen5. Adjustable view angleMinuses: 1. Electronic Image Stabilization is minimally functional. The video I included shows how much movement there is with EIS on; it seems to particularly struggle around corners and is even worse with helmet-mount (video is chest-mount). EIS on this camera is no better than shooting video on most smartphones (although it is several hundred dollars less expensive, so I suppose that's something). Also, it will not record in 4K with EIS on--automatically defaults to 1080p2. Image quality poor in bright light (loses detail and washes out badly--not evident on included video which was an overcast day) and video capture rate seems to lag the faster you go so playback becomes even more jerky and pixelated3. Batteries run out *quickly* (do not last anywhere near 90 minutes as claimed)4. Touchscreen icons are non-standard and can be confusing, sub-menus are not intuitive, hard to find some features/settings5. Owner's manual has multiple misspellings and inconsistent grammar, doesn't give useful instructions, (seems literally/directly translated into rather than written in English if that matters to you)6. Sound recording is almost exclusively wind noise unless you're moving slowly, commentary nearly inaudible (particularly during downhill rides)7. Date/time stamp on videos changed even though all videos were shot same day; the first 3 recordings showed correct date (Aug 27, 2021) on SD card when opened on my computer, the next 3 showed Aug 19, 2019 for no apparent reason. You have to set date/time at first use, possibly need to reset each time you change the battery although I haven't figured this out yet8. Battery meter on camera is unreliable. More than once it's showed half-full battery but after starting to record, battery meter dropped to zero-charge and camera shut off within seconds. I've used each battery a total of 3 times since I got the camera, so it's not from excessive battery use/recharging/end-of-lifeIn summary, this is a cheap device to mess around with which won't produce high-quality videos for your social media feed, but which you don't need to save up for. If you just want to experiment with POV recording, it's okay for entry-level purposes. If you want to make high-quality movies, this is not the device. I bought it to try POV filming, see if I would enjoy making videos of my MTB rides, so the cheap cost was a selling point. If I wanted to make videos to share (and if I had a reasonable number of followers) I would definitely get a more expensive/much higher quality camera."
"This camera is not it!Save your money.The photos and videos look good on small screens and lower resolution. But when you zoom in or put it on a computer it’s awful. Even on my iPhone 15 pro max some of these shots are just really bad quality.I mainly used this while riding my motorcycle. And 99% of the time the camera DID NOT RECORD even though I pushed the button to record and the red light was flashing and the app said it was recording.I could hit record and see it recording and then start riding and after less than 2 mins it just randomly stops recording the video even tho the screen still shows recording. Or if I record for a whole 30-60 mins straight, it will randomly save different sections of the ride and video and not the whole video. Extremely frustrating when I’m trying to capture important moments and vlog content.The videos that it did record was glitchy and blurry. The photo quality is awful and needs to much retouching. Good luck doing anything in the sun on a bright day.I’m not sure why so many people love this camera. It’s cheaply made and the quality is not there. It might work for basic photos but as far as the video goes, it’s a huge negative for me.I know a lot of people got these cameras for reviews. But even so, this camera is trash and useless and shouldn’t even be an option.I have other cheaper type cameras that work better than this thing. If you are looking for video recording then stay away from this device"
"This is the second Akaso video  camera I have purchased. I have had the same problem uv with both. The camera freezes up and to fix it I have to remove the battery and place back into the camera. Also, on each camera the small cover over the battery compartment snaps.The video camera does take pretty good video but has poor sound qualityI won't purchase another Akaso product."
"Video: Video is mediocre at best. While technically the resolution is in 1080p/4k, the quality is certainly not what you would expect. If you have it outside with plenty of light it looks fine. Indoors or in low light it's terrible. Very grainy with lots of noise. My indoor videos had a noticeable flashing in them.Audio: The audio is terrible. Everything is very quiet and muffled. You have to speak into the camera as if it's a microphone in order to hear anything, and even then it's not great. This is without any case on it. If you touch the camera body, adjust the mount, or click any of the buttons you hear loud noises in the video. With the waterproof case on you cannot hear anything.Quality: Like another reviewers I noticed bubbles in the touch screen. The camera body is very light and feels cheap. It only comes with 2 cases: waterproof and regular. The regular case does not mount correctly on anything I tried. The screw holes are not straight and are not deep enough to tighten up. I did not even tests the waterproof case. It does come with some accessories, but there are no instructions included so I'm not sure what half of them are for.Date: The date and time is less than worseless. It would be better if there was no date/time at all. First, the date and time reset back to the factor date (in my case 10/1/2018) every time you take the battery out. Second, when the camera is turned off, it does not keep track of the date and time. So if you set the date and time to 1/1/2019 at 5PM and then turn it off, then turn it back on a week later, it will still be at 1/1/2019 at 5PM. Unless you want to set the date and time correctly before EVERY video, this is quite a pain. By default the camera adds the date and run time to every video in the upper left corner, so it's not like you can just ignore it. It also uses the date and time to save the video files, so again you have to make sure to set the date every time you use it.I haven't even used it long enough to comment on the battery life.I only gave it 2 stars because 1. It's cheap so I didn't expect much (was still disappointed) and 2. It comes with a remote and it seems to work fine."
"I wanted to record my hikes and bike rides (out doors) - as well as kids indoor sports for review later. I haven't done any GoPro like recordings. I wanted to try out without spending a couple of hundred dollars.I have used the camera for about 4~5 months now... indoors, outdoors in a northwest summer.Outdoor  - video quality is average. I do not get true colors. it's a bit disappointing to see the amazing outdoors shown as if seen thru a colored glass.I get a burr with sound in the first minute or so each time I turn the recording ON. I have gotten around by recording about a minute early and editing off the first minute. The burr disappears after the first minute. I don't think it's interference - happens all the time.Indoor - seems to work fine. I mount the camera with a suction cup bracket. The ""burr"" disrupts the sound recording within the first minute or so - which is annoying.Transferring videos is a pain - everyone has commented - so, I wont. I also remove the SD card and plug it into my computer to transfer videos.basically... If you do want a Go pro - you should buy a Go pro. This is not a replacement.If you can live with shortcomings you can pay a lot less and buy this."
"I tested this camera dozens of times in my house with multiple SD cards.  It worked fine for photos and videos.  I took it to Costa Rica where I intended to use it. While white water rafting, sitting in the boat, the first time I took a video - no problem.  Some water splashed on us and from that point on the camera showed a yellow triangle with the words ""Busy"" under it whenever I tried to take a photo or video.  I tried it dozens of times over the course of an hour with no change.  That night, I changed the battery, changed the SD card and took it snorkeling the next day.  On the boat I took some photos of family and videos of birds flying near us, no problem.  Jumped in the water, turned it on... yellow triangle with the words ""Busy"" - I quit after a few tries over the next 10 - 15 minutes as I wanted to enjoy my time and try to capture the memories of my family in my mind since I knew they would not be captured on this camera.  Not sure if I got a bum camera, humidity was getting to it inside the case... definitely no water got in the case.  Regardless, I never got any of the images or videos I looked forward to.  For the pics that did work, on 4K the videos and photos were a tad grainy and small as there is no way to zoom.  through the camera images look a bit bent, similar to Barrel lens distortion which makes the image look spherized which affects the quality of the pictures also.  Overall, the price is great and the options are decent but the camera not working caused me to give it 1 star.  I wish I had spent up for a reliable GoPro or an expensive underwater camera instead of trying something that sits in a waterproof case and can't handle the atmosphere of a tropical location."
"Used this camera only twice. First scuba dive, it kept telling me ""slow SD card"" and it was the SD card that came with the camera. It would flash that warning and then turn the video I was taking off and I'd have to start recording again manually. Used with the included dive housing.It got 1-3 drops of ocean water in it on that 1st dive. Camera itself is supposed to have some water resistance, so I figured this wasn't a big deal and rinsed in fresh water before drying it and the housing it comes with off with a soft towel.2nd dive I handed it to a friend to record with. It shut off on her after only a few minutes of time underwater, with intact dive housing. After this dive, it has not turned on again, even with fresh batteries, and having been rinsed in fresh water and allowed to dry out.It experienced no impacts, bumps, or physical damage of any kind on either of these dives. It was exposed to, at most, 3-4 drops of ocean water between the two dives and was quickly rinsed in fresh water and dried.This thing is terribly made. I think you could probably get better quality out of a 10 year old Go Pro than what this camera provided me with. Spend your money on a used underwater camera by a reputable brand and skip purchasing this one."
"EDIT: I have been sent a V50 replacement camera by the seller to see if I like it better. I am temporarily upgrading my rating from I to 2 stars until I have a chance to test the replacement and will will update my review if the replacement proves to be better than my original purchase.Original review:I have had a GoPro that I've used for diving for several years but I bought this EK7000 as a backup video camera for underwater use. It looked okay when I got it, but I was not impressed with the waterproof housing, The latch on top did not have a lock and flipped open with barely a touch of my finger. Also, the back screen is a touch screen but you have to set it before you put it in the waterproof housing, as it has a hard back and you can't change anything once it's in there. But no big deal, I set it in dive mode and adjusted all the other settings, stuck it in the underwater housing and took it for a dive. The camera and waterproof housing worked fine, I just had to use a rubber band to make sure the cheap latch didn't flip open and flood the camera while underwater. This is where the negative review comes in. The video quality is HORRIBLE. This is advertised as a 4K camera with a dive mode which is supposed to add some red back into the video. Even set at ""4k"" picture quality, my videos are all green with REALLY blown out whites. I didn't see any way to white balance in the camera settings, and obviously I couldn't change any settings underwater anyway. I shot various things, turtles, coral reefs, fish, etc and tried videoing from different angles to see if it made a difference in the coloration. It did not. All the videos are very poor quality so I put this piece of crap away and used my GoPro for the rest of the trip. We just got back from the Philippines and of course the return window closed 2 days ago so I can't even get my money back. Buyer beware, save your $$$ and put it toward a GoPro or a better quality camera, this one wouldn't be a bargain if it was free. Very disappointed."
Video stops and starts on my Class 50 SD card. Even for 1080p video. Would return if shipping wasn’t so much.
"I really wanted to like this EK7000 Pro but can’t seem to get it to stay on. The weird part is I’m able to record about an hour’s long video when I just have it on my desk, but it cuts at around 40-45min and then records on its own a separate 15min clip until the battery dies out. But here’s the thing, I can’t seem to get it to stay on when I mount it to my motorcycle. From what I could tell, it stayed on for at least 10min as I saw the recording light on top of the camera blinking but by the time I finished my 20 min ride I noticed it was off and none of the footage was captured. Upon further testing and recording at my desk I noticed that it’s very inconsistent on saving footage when the battery is going low and dies out. For instance, I just tried recording a 15min clip and noticed the battery level dropping until it eventually died and non of my footage was saved. I also noticed that I have to keep setting the Date/Time so I just turned off time stamps instead. I tried calling their customer support but they have long wait times and wasn’t able to get through. Hopefully someone contacts me back after this review and I’ll be sure to update it if I can be provided a working product."
Not for me..... Screen too small.✌️🐺
"Overall picture quality is very good for the price point of the camera.The touch screen controls are very responsive and easy to use.First use was on my bike helmet and the video came out better than I expected.Later, I used this as a dash cam plugged into the USB port in the car. At the end of the drive I found the camera had become very hot. Some heat is normal with this type of camera, so I did not think anything of it at the time .The next time I went to use it the battery would not fit. I attribute this to the excessive heat generated when using an external power source causing the battery compartment to warp.When plugged into the USB port camera will turn on but you cannot turn it off with the power button.I can still use the camera as a dash cam, connecting and disconnecting the power to turn it on and off.The only way I will be able to use it as an action camera is by using an external battery pack."
"I got the camera knowing that I am not going to be filming a lot, and therefore did not want an expensive one. SO over the last 18 months I had this camera, I used it all of 10 hours (2 times all together), mostly in my car, recording rides. Recently, I got a kayak accessory that allows for the camera to be mounted on the side rail, so I took the camera with and decided to film some kayaking and fishing.From the first use, I noticed that the buttons on the side, up and down buttons, did not have the same look and feel or the click sound as the power button or the shoot button. The buttons did not click, required 5x the force of the other buttons to work, and were almost impossible to work with while the waterproof casing was on. I did not make much of it, as I did not use the camera a lot, but I think those were faulty from the beginning.On the last trip, the buttons stopped working. The camera is operational only from the touch screen, but the side buttons do not work, which means that I have to open the case every time I would like to change settings. This made the trip very frustrating.I expected more sturdiness form the camera, given the camera is almost brand new (the back-screen film is still on, no scratches, was never dropped), and that I assumed these cameras to be for extreme sports.  Otherwise, the camera does what it is supposed to do, videos are solid, batteries last a while, and if the buttons were not giving me problems, this would be a solid purchase. Probably a lemon."
"I bought this to record my kids' volleyball games. I didn't need anything fancy, but I liked the option to do 1080p at 60fps. It does that, as advertised. It comes with all the accessories needed to attach it to a tripod, or whatever else you want to attach it to. It's inexpensive, but you get what you pay for.While it does record at 4K, the video image quality is not even as good as my entry level Android phone. It is slightly grainy in low light. The audio is poor. It is muffled, even without the water proof case. It comes with 2 batteries and a 2 port battery charger. The problem is that a single battery only lasts about 30 to 40 minutes. I had to swap out the battery in the middle of the games, and I often missed parts of the game.For the price, it does what it is supposed to do and it is durable, so I'll give it 3 stars. Just be aware that it is not a high quality video camera."
"Well for the money you spend on this camera , you will get about what you’d expect. The good thing is that the picture quality on this camera is actually really good and the video quality is also real good when you consider you pay less than 100 for this camera. Where I found the problem was the MIC on this camera is no good, with loud sounds it does distort a lot, , a lot! And also sometimes it would stop recording for no reason at all. And so there you have it, a honest quick review, spend the money and buy a GoPro or a insta 360But, if you’re just messing around the house it will work if you can figure out the glitches"
"I bought this camera as a replacement for an aging GoPro that was working intermittently. Seemed to get good reviews and since it worked with my existing GoPro mounts and accessories I thought I would give it a try. Let me first say this is not a GoPro. The feel of the buttons is cheap, the unit itself must weigh half of what my GoPro does, the accessories are cheap and poorly fitting, and the nuts on the mounts that keep falling off. It provides a number of different video formats but everything is recorded in .MOV format. There is not an option for MP4 even though it says it in the listing and on the company's website. The video quality and sound seem to be OK but you cannot offload the videos to your computer by plugging the camera in via USB. You have to remove the SD card and use a reader to get the videos to your computer. Supposedly you can use their app to offload the videos to your mobile device but I am not going to store this volume to data on my mobile device. Overall the app is junk. After I finally figured out which app (there are multiple) works with which camera I could not get it to stay connected for more than 15 seconds via wifi. I punished my GoPro or years and it held up great. I don't expect this one to last very long. If you are looking for a cheap camera to take some decent videos and then offload to your computer some way I guess this camera is fine. If you expect quality features and functionality and an app that works consistently - keep looking."
"Edit: I received an email from the seller and they sent me a new camera right away. Although I’ve already bought a GoPro hero session and haven’t had a chance to test the new one yet. But packaging was severely damaged like it had been chucked off the back of a truck and kicked aroundI was really excited for this camera for mounting on my motorcycle helmet. I had really good luck with the cross tour 30$ camera for about a year. So I decided to step up.First thing I noticed both cameras are essentially identical. So they use the same parts and are probably made in the same factory. Nbd. Just in case you’re trying to decide by brand they’re all the same nothing new with China. But my screen had bubbles under it like any screen protector I put on myself, also nbd.Picture quality is mediocre at best. Too dark in low light, to light in high light. And even with no filter looks like it has some annoying filter.The camera will randomly shut off after a few minutes and won’t respond to any buttons or anything until I plug into a computer and realize all my good footage was lost.This is unacceptable. Do not buy"
It’s not terrible. Especially for the price.  But it’s not the best thing I’ve used either. It was meant to replace a discontinued action cam I’ve used (Wasp).Pros:-It’s small and light-Has a nice touch screen-Menu is straightforward.Cons:-The phone app. Easily the worst thing about it. Turns off. Cuts off. Won’t save video when it loses connection. It’s a hot mess.-Gets warm fast. Like. Hot almost. Even at a measly 1080p resolution.-Battery gauge is super misleading. Went from full to almost dead in 15 minutes.-Waterproof case feels outdated.-Regular frame case is a mess and lopsided. No dedicated mount forks. Instead you have to bolt them in and get them to line up. Not much faith in the standard frame case either. Feels like it’d pop out without much effort.-Battery door is super cheap and not hinged. Don’t lose it.“Meh” expectations:-Image quality isn’t fantastic-Image stabilization isn’t amazing(Which considering the price isn’t shocking)It’s not great. But if you’re cash strapped I mean I guess? Personally I switched over to an expensive name brand model after toying with this one.
"After mounting this camera to my motorcycle helmet and recording a ride I went to watch the footage. I almost threw up, I felt like I was watching the blare witch project. No stabilization, quality is no good, and the sound is crap. Don't be cheap like me, just buy a gopro !"
"Pros: i like the touch screen, clear lcd, easy to work everything i was looking for BUT...cons: the open frame cant not be trusted to hold tge camera while in motion, the ONLY frame you can use is the water proof one which is completely sound proof, i HATE that!! I use this on a sport bike and i like to here my videos! Plus the videos are wavy in motion! And theres no side cover to cover your plugs amd sd cards like go pros have! They hace no options for anything else like frames or covers...what you get in the box is all you get period!! Poor thought process behimd what this could be used for...im just gonna send it back and stick with my gopro hero 3!!"
"I'm so tired of finding out that the AKASO EK7000 Pro 4K is not reliable, how many times I got back to find out that it stopped recording sometimes a minute into the recording mode or even 15 seconds after pressing record, problem is that by then I'm not aware of the problem anymore as it is on top of my helmet, riding a motorcycle in NY City with an unreliable action cam is doubly frustrating, because when I get back home to review the murderous intentions of my fellows car drivers and it didn't record a thing, I want to throw the action cam out of the window as it failed to record anything!01/05/2021: AKASO support sent a new one. Sometime last year, but I just started to use it again.And this time it works as is supposed to.The only reason I give 3 stars is because image stabilization is mediocre, making some footage worthless.But I have to say that AKASO support was quite helpful and friendly, thanks AKASO!"
"I liked the protective cover and mounting accessories, but the camera itself lasted less than 6 months before it refused to recognize the micro SD card. I tried numerous new cards and it just would not read them. No obstructions, no dirt or dust in the slot - it just stopped working.Fortunately, the mounting kit and accessories were universal, so not a complete waste, but i would definitely not buy again."
"I didn't expect a lot from a camera this inexpensive, and it didn't surprise me. The dynamic range of the sensor - its ability to handle highlight to shadow range - is, to be charitable, poor. The first photo in my samples shows how it cannot handle highlights, like the house at center. The ""natural” view of the lens appears to be the super-wide setting; the ""normal"" view appears to be just a section of the super-wide, and it is abysmal.The quality of the super-wide images look OK on a smartphone, but don't expect smartphone-comparable enlargements even as much as 4x6. The images don't compare to those made with the pioneering Apple QuickTake 100 camera from 1994.Having said that, it is impressive that a camera as small as the Akaso can make photos at all, much less stills and videos at all. Having shot underwater film images with an old Nikonos II 35mm camera, I know that underwater, where the lighting is much less contrasty, it should do just fine for bringing back memories of the fish and coral of my upcoming Caribbean vacation."
"This unit is nice and small, where it performs reasonably well in the right conditions.  I was somewhat disappointed with the image stabilization, or the lack of it.  While it claims it does (and that you need to use a lower resolution setting for that), you can't really see much of a difference.  I feel like I need to get a gimbal to help with the stabilization because the setting doesn't help.The card bundle was nice so I can get started quickly (had to charge the two included batteries first) but it will get filled up quickly even at the 1080 setting, so be aware to take your video out so you can have more space to record, or to get a larger card.  There are now various alternatives out there, I imagine they would be somewhat similar to this unit, but I got this because there was a discount during Black Friday.  It is good enough to be a reasonable action camera, but don't expect too much from it."
"This is every inch a 70 dollar camera. Does exactly what it needs to do, but not with any style or substance. The battery cover is AWFUL. It doesn't come up with a fingernail, isn't attached once you do pry it off, and is hard to get back in. It also requires you to reformat the card if you take it out and use a computer to get files off. If you don't it won't turn on. Had to find that out the hard way- I'm just glad it was a known thing and an answer was out there. If you don't want to spend 3-400 for a go pro, it'll do the job just fine. But if you're going to to be using it a lot, or in a lot of different ways, spring for the name brand instead."
I have numerous problems getting my pics and videos transferred to my phone. It shouldn’t be that difficult but it sure is.
"Update, 9 months later I was out using the camera, I shot some footage, set it down, picked it back up, and it won't turn on. No idea what's going on, tried charging and switching batteries, no go. I have also realized with time that the video quality issue is a really crappy lens, which isn't really important if the camera can't even last a year. This thing sucks!I don't know if it's the image sensor, or the internal compression, but the footage is not particularly sharp or vivid, it's more like iPhone 4 ""HD"". I have been using it in 1080p60, and my cheap point and shoot looks 100x better even though it only shoots 30fps.I'm not thrilled that it isn't rated for any water resistance without the case, I deal with a lot of rain. And the case cuts off the audio.Speaking of audio... I didn't expect it to be good, but it has some sort of board mounted inside by a single tab. I know this because it resonates when you tap it, no matter how you grip it from the outside. So the slightest wrong movement makes horrible noises on the audio.The image stabilization is pretty crappy, but it's about on par with other cheap cameras with optical stabilization. It is better than nothing.Last complaint is that the mounting plate that comes with it is incompatible with the accessories kit that supposedly matches it. Not that big of a deal, you just swap it out for one of the accessory ones.Now if I had purchased this expecting a GoPro, I would have been severely disappointed, it would be a 2 star product. But I give it 3 because I expected less, just not this much less."
"I love the price and the features of this little camera. I bought it for diving, but I had a couple of chances to try it out while snorkeling first, and I was quite happy. However, I took it on a dive today, and when I surfaced, there was quite a bit of condensation and a bit of water inside the waterproof case. I disassembled everything, dried it out, switched the battery, and double checked the seal before the second dive. Underwater, though, it quickly took on water. By the time I surfaced, there was quite a bit of water in the case, and the battery had corroded. Just waiting now to check the memory card, and hoping I didn't lose all of my pictures. Also hoping that I will be able to turn the camera on after it dries for a day or two.  Both dives were around 20m, and it claims to be waterproof to 40m."
"I was looking to buy a Go Pro and saw this one and for the price difference I was willing to try it out. First I thought that there were two major design flaws in my mind. There is absolutely no protective cover for the side that has the cable connections and the SD card slot. To me that is a big deal because I feel like that could potentially get dirt and debris inside the important areas so I am majorly disappointed in that next it the cover that goes over the battery area isn't connect to the camera when take off. I can only imagine trying to change the battery while outside in any kind of weather or terrain and losing that tiny little door so easily. Second I have been playing with it for less than an hour and the battery is almost dead. I have barely done anything with it. I might continue to researching the go pro, the battery life is a big deal to me."
"Bought this to video at the motocross track.  I don't know how they can claim it's 4K because it's not, 4K.  Maybe something got lost in the translation?  At best, this is around 720P quality.  It's not bad but you need a lot of lot of ambient light.  Low-light conditions such as dusk, or dawn, cause the unit to struggle.  I should have done a little better research as Akaso had newer models for not much more money at the time that probably would have been a better buy.  For the price though, it's a solid unit.  It's built well, works well, comes with a million accessories, the menus are simple and the audio is pretty good.  My only gripe really is it's not 4K.  It's a stretch to even say it's high def.  I would definitely buy this brand again though.  I would just be sure to purchase their latest-greatest model."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Not wanting to drop a small fortune on a GoPro I researched action cams and came across the Akaso EK7000 Pro. It seems like a good deal for the price so I jumped and bought two. The camera came in nicely packaged and in working order. I ran a test on it with my kids outside playing around and it seemed to be good. The real test was yesterday when I took it to the river for a fishing trip. The camera itself did fantastic. Good clear footage and it held up fantastic for underwater fish releases. Overall I am pleased with the camera. My only two real complaints are that the mic isn't that great and the battery life on 1080HD at 30fps is only about 25 minutes. I have read that the lower settings, will make the battery last longer. I now have 10 batteries for it.Pros:Cost, ease of use, vivid color saturation, touch screenCons:Mic, battery life***Update***This is the second cam that has done this after being left on for multiple hours. It worked fine Friday morning for 2 hour while hunting. It was left on and used for a third angle POV. Went through 2 or 3 battery changes and periodic recording.Now it will not turn on. Changing my review from a 4 to a 2 as this isn’t something that should be happening. My wonder is if the cam is getting too hot and causing damage. It was warm to the touch but did work fine on Friday 10/9/20.The first one that quit working was used as a chest cam fishing and ran for 3-4 hours before having the same issue."
Seems very decent for the price but a pain in the ass comjnf with no instructions
"I really do like this thing. Works well, easy to set up, etc. Only thing I don't like is the battery dies way to fast. I use it as a dash cam in my car right now. I only turn it on while I drive. I work 10 minutes from my house and normally light traffic. With that said the battery seems to only be good for about a day or two before it dies. Now mind you I again only turn it on when I drive back and forth from work and also when I go to lunch. So it's on for about a total of 40 minutes a day. Seems to me the battery should last longer than it does. Nice that it does come with two batteries. 4k video isn't all that clear and what I would expect for 4k.All in all I give this a 3. Would give it a higher mark (4-5) if the batteries last longer."
"At this price, you really can't complain too much. As expected, the camera works ok but not great. All the problems below are not big issue consider it is a $80 camera.The first problem is the camera freezes from time to time. You need to remove battery to reset it. It happens randomly. When it hangs, all buttons don't work. You can only remove battery to power if off. While played at pool for 2 hours, I needed to reset the camera twice.The second problem is, it uses water proof case. So you won't be able to record any sound at pool when waterproof case is used. (because the case blocks sound)The video quality is fine under sun light. In low light environment, the quality is very bad.I would say this is a toy for 8 years old kid. I won't recommend if you want better video quality."
"Ok so I really wanted to like this camera, but I just can’t. I’ve bought cheap $20 action cameras before and this has the exact same image quality. I figured for the price it would have at least a semi-decent image sensor, but I was wrong. This camera, in no way shape form or fashion, is true 4K. More like 480P scaled up to 4K size. Honestly, if you’re looking for a cheap action camera, buy the $20 eBay one.. At least you know what you’re getting.To put it in perspective, for some reason I still have my old iPhone 3g. I got it out and recorded a few videos and it is light years ahead of this thing.The packaging and accessories are pretty decent, and the touch screen does work. You also get 2 batteries and a charger that will charge both simultaneously.If, by chance, the manufacturer reads these consider this:Ditch the high dollar packaging, remote control, random accessories, and almost useless touch screen. Use those savings to put in a better image sensor and you’ll have trouble keeping them in stock. Everyone I know who owns and uses action cameras/GoPros/whatever’s doesn’t care anything about the package in comes in, a tiny screen that you can’t manipulate anyway, or the cheesy watch sized remote. We need a power button, a record/stop button, and QUALITY video. That’s it. No goofy gimmicks."
"This is my first action camera, so I decided to stay away from a $200+ GoPro and go with something a little cheaper. Overall, I love this camera. As a beginner, it does everything I need it to do. My only complaint is the accessories that come with it. One of the reasons I chose this camera was because of all of the things that came with it. However, once I received my camera and attempted to mount it to a waterproof selfie stick, I was unable to get the initial mount off of the waterproof case. I’ve tried absolutely everything to remove it. So if I can’t remove the mount on the waterproof case, how am I supposed to use the other 7+ mounts that came with it? Very frustrating and misleading. If anyone was able to figure out this problem please let me know."
"Touchscreen is nice.Image stabilization crops out date/timestamp. Date and time does not continue counting once powered down. No direct 1/4"" screw mount on the camera body itself. (Plastic clip housing doesn't actually fit, camera pops out. Had to resort to mounting it with the waterproof case, which muffles sound and negates the pro of having a nice touchscreen.)"
"Based on the reviews, I thought I'd save some $ and give this a try.  If you can't afford to spend $100 more for the real thing, this might work for you.  But here's what you get--4K is worthless.  The image jerks and shakes.1080@ 60fps is merely OK.  It jitters, but not like the 4K settingHelmet attachments are worthless.  They aren't curved for a helmet and the adhesive won't stick long.  If I didn't have a tether attached, the camera would've disappeared into the river.I really hoped this would be a great alternative.  Sadly, it's not."
"As my first action camera I cannot attest to the quality of the pictures compared to gopro but the videos don't look very impressive to me and they're all grainy.When using wifi, you can see the view on your phone until it DISCONNECTS ALL THE TIME. I do not recommend this headache because when it disconnects it won't save the video it was recording unless you manually and constantly pause and record. You will need to be staring at your phone in hand so you know when this happens on various high end phones no matter how close or far and nowhere near anything that would cause interference. This frustration IS NOT WORTH IT to me.The cover that you need to attach most accessories makes it nearly impossible to select the bottom row with a normal fingertip. Even my pinky finger is too big to barely touch the edge so it only takes about twenty maddening attempts.It didn't come with any protective films so I ruined the middle of the lens. I replaced the lens but quality at different depths has degraded so like other junk I recommend not spending good money after bad and just replace it preferably with a better model.I spent 80 dollars for this in Dec. 2018 and it's incredible they still want around 50. I'd go with a cheap 35 knockoff that probably has the same guts with same poor quality results.Pros: It's slightly better than not having an action cam at all."
JUST  recieved it and made a few videos. not a bad camera  this is my second akaso camera first with eis.only bad thing is it seems to eat up batterys really quick like in 25 min. other than that im pleased with it well ok after a few days with this camera i have changed my mind 1. the sound the sound on this camera is really bad when im walking doing a videro i can hardly hear what im saying plus most the time all i hear is a loud click click and other various sounds and when i go to edit it even if i do delet the volume the track skips and screws up thr music. 2 the touch screen needs some work cause have the time i can find the format and half the time it wont show up.i do like the wide screen option but im going to use this  camera as a back up on my trip to alaska next month cause the the  camera i got last yr has superior  video and sound. ill keep the other as aback up.
"Overall an OK camera for the money. The picture quality is very good, battery doesn’t last long with continuous use so glad it came with a backup.The camera isn’t the best for my use, road cycling. I use the camera continuously and the battery dies between 40-60 minutes and my rides are usually longer. The main problem is the the camera seems to overheat in the waterproof case and Florida heat and shuts off. Today, when removing the camera from case, it literally blew out of the case it was so hot!For the money I’ll deal with it as I’ve learned to turn it off to cool down while cycling but not the best camera for continuous filming."
"I purchased this camera on special for prime day to use on my sons go-kart, i was terribly disappointed in the Image stabilization of this camera, video quality is quite good hoewver for a sport that has alot of vibration i would not recommend this camera at all."
"Thought it would be a good alternative to a $400 GoPro/dash cam for my motorcycle.  Battery life is horrible, and won't even stay on if plugged in/charging.  Will turn off 15-20 mins into a ride, even when plugged in."
"Unable to control volume control from device, so high volume recordings like playing music will be distorted, frames per second isn't good enough if your looking to record quick movements with accuracy to noise.Connectivity could be better as the cameras wifi does disconnect if you click back or exit the app.Battery life isn't what it could or should be."
"The camera operates fairly well for this price point. Battery performance is average. Not happy at all with the so called ""waterproof housing"".  From the first time I used it, I noticed small drops of water on the inside and fogging around the area of the lens. This caused a halo effect on some of the pictures. I was swimming in literally 4 ft. of water. Will try to see if I can get a replacement housing that fits. Especially got this for use in the water, so it was disappointing."
"Used the camera for  number of snorkeling trip.  It held out well and was reasonably well to control and the picture quality was coming out well enough. Under poor visibility conditions, moving the camera close up will actually get you a better picture than you see in reality.A few drawbacks: it  is difficult to monitor if the camera is taking a video  and with screensaver coming on you can't rely that a click on the shutter will actually take a pic or turn the video on or off.The battery drains after about 15' - a issue when you are way out.The separately purchased add-on yellow underwater handle took on water and was completely filled with water after about 4h in the water."
"I wanted a cheap alternative to a GoPro. I have a couple GoPros already, so I'm used to the quality of the models and what to expect. I thought I would try a cheap camera as a way to subsidize the costs of my racing program, and wanted to see if I could get GP quality with a cheaper device. Unfortunately that answer is no. A camera in 2019 is the quality of GoPro 1, MAYBE a 2. But I'd rather have a fleet of GoPro Hero 3s before I would consider EVER using this. The 4k looks like hot trash, and the user interface although simple: is simple minded. This is not a ""GO PRO KILLER"" like some people are claiming. It simply a cheap camera you can take if you do not want to spend the money on a GoPro. To be honest, I would save your money and put it towards a used or refurbished GoPro 4. Youll spend the same amount and be a lot happier. Once again, I was hoping to be wrong, but the moment I took it out of the box and it booted it up, it was already pretty clear. These positive reviews are probably being given by people who have not experienced a high quality action cam on the level that GoPro provides. I hate sounding like a fanboy, but its just facts. If GoPro is an iPhone XS, this camera is a cheap Metro PCS android device."
"This is my first review ever. I thought it important to give so people don't waste their money on this product.  They sell this as a GoPro Hero5 alternative but it is not.  My GoPro Hero3 takes better photos and videos!  The photos seem like highly compressed 256 color images.  Like a ""Soften More"" filter was applied then a ""Sharpen More"" filter was applied to the softened photo.  At first I thought that I had messed with the camera settings, when I choose ""Diver Mode"", 5MP photos, and 720p/30fps video settings, so I reset it to the factory settings and left the settings in ""Normal Mode"", 16MP photos, and 4K/25fps video settings, but the results were the same.  I am of the mind that mine must have come defective seeing how many 5 stars reviews it has gotten. That, or people that gave 5 stars have no notion of quality or they haven't had a GoPro to compare it to.  Also, even at the loudest volume the beeps are barely noticeable, the camera doesn't remember the last mode setting, so you have to select it every time the camera turns off. Video sound is bad quality too!"
"I bought this camera as a first-time camera investment. It works well, I've adjusted to the learning curve, so to speak (it's not like my cell phone camera). There are two things I wasn't expecting: first, it gets extremely, extremely hot which took some time to get used to and not freak out about; second, it fell off my dresser one day and broke. The camera still works but the outside plastic part broke so now there's a gap between the sides. Otherwise, for being a first camera to learn the ropes on it works well. It's not great at capturing darker environments so just make sure your space is well-lit."
Stopped working after about 2 months.  Can’t get Them to replace it or get the protection plan to take care of it.  Asurion 2 year plan.  Come complete fraudulent transaction.
"Now, I know I shouldn't have expected GoPro level quality from such a cheap camera, but when I read in the DESCRIPTION that it is 4k, I naturally believed it. Because why would the seller lie, right? Well... It's not 4k. The image quality is decent but the video at 4k is atrocious. It's a grainy video. I understand it's cheap for a reason and that the quality will be low, but the seller is misleading people by saying that the video quality is 4k, because it's definitely not. At least not for me, so maybe I got a defective device? I will end up keeping it because it's okay for my needs but otherwise I would return it"
The waterproof housing leaked on the first use. Not worth the money if your using for water activities.
"Took this snorkeling in Maui and it worked great. Picture was clear and stable. I would've given this product a 4 Star, but trying to get the videos from the camera to any device was challenging and took a lot of you tube videos and messing around to figure it out. It says it had wifi, but my camera had no options for wifi that I could find or figure out. Instructions are vague and instructions online just as vague. It doesn't show you what all the attachments do. I had to you tube a kid saying what he thought they were. Good camera if you a super tech savy."
"There is not an owners manual with this! I was pleasantly surprised to find it can connect to my phone and pull pictures over (which I learned from YouTube). However, it didn't add them to a folder actually on the phone so I couldn't find a way to edit them. There is a learning curve to this. Just getting it off the box is the first challenge. I didn't even open it for a few months because it seemed to complicated. Once I sat down and researched it then it wasn't so bad. The camera did fog up a bit and left spots on the pictures. I would not have been able to get pictures at all with a regular camera though."
"This review is for the AKASO EK7000 Pro 4K. I also own a GoPro Hero 7 Silver and, although the GoPro is better, the Akaso is a good value a much cheaper alternative for those on a budget. The picture is decent but I recommend setting the widest angle possible as it is less than you might expect for a given setting. The audio is also not as good and although the Akaso menu is decent, the GoPro has a very nice voice control system. That said, I am pleased with my purchase of the Akaso as the camera has replaceable batteries, nice included accessories, a decent picture, easy menu and a price less than a third of the GoPro."
"Its decent but nothing special.  The picture and video quality is fair, but I was a bit disappointed.  When using the waterproof case you have to push the front button super hard to actuate, and it started to leak a bit after about 2 hrs of snorkeling.  I also struggled to get the record button to start/stop sometimes.  I had to keep double checking that it was recording and that it stopped.  Screen display is annoyingly small too so I was never sure how much was in frame.  I guess it's ok for casual photography but for what I needed it for, I wish I'd spent the extra for a GoPro"
"The video it takes is pretty good and although I've never owned a GoPro, I think this one has a good enough image. Video images tend to speed up intermittently also, which takes away fluidity in playback.  Video is also difficult to stop.  I've recorded video in areas I wanted to skip because the remote doesn't respond to commands consistently.  The best way to stop it is to stop the motorcycle and turn the thing off.  Picture quality is not good at all.  When viewing on a computer screen, it retains no clear resolution when you zoom in on the picture.  Pictures immediately digitize the image out of focus."
"***UPDATED REVIEW***I can no longer recommend this product. The wind noise is horrible, both in and out of the waterproof case (the case makes it even worse). Customer support will say they have a fix, then when the fix is requested they state there is no fix. Video quality is NOT 1080p, much less 4K does not allow image stabilization. Firmware upgrades must be requested and as stated when requested, they go back and say there are not firmware upgrades (they do not publicly post them). 0/5 stars if I could rate it that....absolutely waste of $80+. My recommendation: save up for a PROPER action camera from GoPro, this knock-off is NOT worth it, especially with the abhorrent customer service (if you even want to call it that).When compared to a Hero7, sure, the Hero7 is going to be a bit more superior with features and image quality. However for my needs (motorcycle ""dash"" cam), this AKASO EK7000 is perfect. Waterproof case? Check. Battery pack(s)"" Check. No need to buy additional cases/clamps/mounts? HUGE BONUS CHECK. Image stabilization? Check. Able to be plugged in and work? Check. We will see how the durability lasts after a few rides, but I am very happy with my purchase."
"...but I think I got what I paid for. I was looking for a less expensive alternative to other higher end action camera brands. It works and can definitely be useful. However, I was a bit disappointed with things like image stabilization and overall picture. Don't get me wrong, if you're on a budget (like I am) this will definitely be the choice for you, but if you're just trying to save a few bucks, you'll quickly notice why other brands cost more."
"I've been running the EK7000 Pro for over a year now and it has held up to every punishment I've hammered it with.  EIS is pretty bad.  I run without the EIS on because of it.  The external mic works decently.  The camera itself is durable, reliable, and performs well.  But now that I am using the V50X, the vast improvements Akasso has made makes the EK7000 Pro look like a prototype.  I love Akasso's stuff and I recommend them highly.  If you are looking for a go-pro alternative, get the V50X and you will not be dissappointed."
"If you are buying this for anything other than water sports it is a fine camera.I bought this camera for a snorkeling trip to Belize. While the camera is waterproof please note the remote IS NOT WATERPROOF, making it very hard to use when snorkeling.  Also, you cannot zoom at all, it defaults to video each time you turn on the camera, so you have to click through to get to camera mode, and the date resets each time you put in a new battery-which is often!I was very unhappy with the camera because the remote is not waterproof. The supplier offered a full refund and I accepted that."
"I picked this up because of the great reviews and amazing price. Of course this is not going to compare that closely to a GoPro 6, 7, 8 etc., or other high-dollar camera, but it just didn't do the job. I was expecting some sort of image stabilization, but with the setting turned on, the playback of a hike was basically embarrassingly unwatchable. It was blurry and all over the place. I took this camera to Hawaii and I have almost no video that's remotely usable. Then the nail in the coffin was when I tried to put it in the waterproof case for snorkeling, water infiltrated immediately and I got like 20 seconds of video before it turned off forever. I contacted customer support about a warranty and they were completely unresponsive. So there you go. I hate leaving bad reviews (2 stars because it's not complete junk, just cheap and overstated). Unfortunate, but I just ordered a GoPro 7 Black, we'll see how spending a little (lot) more money goes."
"As with most things in life, you usually get what you paid for. This is an OK entry-level action cam, or perhaps a cheap backup camera. The image quality looks like a camera from the early 2000's. It's good enough to document something you did, but you won't be impressing anyone with the quality of the footage. The best thing about this purchase are the accessory mounts - all of which can be used with a GoPro.One thing that might be a deal-breaker for some: the camera forgets its date/time every time you replace the battery. This is also mentioned in other user reviews."
"Not a bad action camera but forget using on a motorcycle and thinking you will get good video.  Actually works pretty well when using the Selfie stick and holding it.  When mounted to fairing (using high quality mounts) or any other location on the bike, the image is just too shaky, even at lower speeds.  In short, you are getting what you pay for.  If you have appropriate expectations, you will be fine.  However, there is a reason a GoPro is not $70.  I will use this hand held and go to GoPro for mounted solutions."
The camera is okay. The photo and video quality is not that great. Better go for higher end which costs a bit higher.  Disappointed with the picture quality. A low end mobile camera will take better videos.
We got this so my husband can use the GoPro and I will have something too.  Camera feels cheap and I haven’t used it yet.  Just getting started.
Bought this for my niece to do a cage experience at our local aquarium with the sharks. Read the manual after I put it together I watched some YouTube videos. Everything was great. As soon as we got home I went to download the photos and the camera case was full of salt water. Now she has no pics of her experience!
I bought this and used it for a mouth. I noticed that the video and photo quality were very grainy and not clear. The 4k is still blurry and grainy. I recorded some cooking videos and the images was not as good as I expected. Low light recordings become even worst. The eis image stabilization does not work with the 4k mode. It works with 1080p mode. I have a go pro session (max 1440p) and the image quality and recordings are a lot better then this 4k camera.Other things :It's an action cam so sound quality is muffled inside the waterproof housing.The red led light flashing during recording is a bit disturbing and there is no way to turn it off.When replacing battery the timer and date gets reset and you need to set it back again.Sometimes camera freezes after you turn on. Have to remove battery to reset it.Touch screen works great!The remote control also works great!I
"Camera stopped working 3 month in. Lost all my video and image. We booked a trip to Cozumel scuba diving. We recorded a lot of amazing video and pictures. Unfortunately when we got back and tried to import the videos, none of the video would load no matter what we do. It just says error. We spent hours trying to fix it. We lost 3 hours of amazing footages which we will never get back. Then the second day when we tried to take more pictures and recording, none of them worked. We missed out on all of the images and recording of our experience. We were so excited to see what we captured under the ocean. And of course it is just barely out of the warranty. This is very upsetting. I wish it would’ve just not turned on instead of pretend to work and then lose all of our captures."
Didn't last long. Not even a year old and it's dead. Used it for approx 4 hours total. Batteries drain fast and it gets so hot in the case that it starts to steam up the plastic covers. Save your money and by the go pro.
"Getting this camera was very exciting, the box is very similar to a Go Pro box. The battery life is really good and not many problems with SD cards either. My main problem is quality. Yes, it shoots in 4K but at 25 fps. at such low frames, its pretty much rendered useless (very choppy). At 1080P it's better fps because it's at 60, but its still very loud. You can see the grains very well. But in good light situations, its pretty good. Overall, its an amazing camera, and is very versatile."
Not sure how this cheap cam got so ma y good reviews. It locked up multiple times requiring g battery removal to reboot. Final video was jittery and unclear on 1080p. Not sure it would work at all on 4k. It also captured video in black and white. Had to remove the battery to reboot and correct that issue.
"This video quality sucks if you are looking for 1080p, 2.7k, or 4k videos. The bit rate on the videos a pretty bad. And if you have the money to buy this, just save your money until you can get a GoPro 7-10 new or used. Not recommended for serious people looking for great video quality."
"I so want to love this camera. My wife got me the EK7000 for Christmas. I returned it and purchased the EK7000 pro for the added EIS and touch screen etc. unfortunately, the one that I received is defective. The 4K video stutters badly on playback and the 2.7k 30fps glitches to vertical bars and records nothing but them. The 1080p 60fps seems to work well though I haven’t loaded them onto my pc yet. I will be returning this camera and researching other brands."
"I bought this camera for a scuba trip and the product advertises water resistant up to 130ft depth with the protective case. The case still got water in it at 45ft depth, and the camera no longer works. This was the 1st and only time I used this camera.The camera quality is mediocre, and quite a few of my photos were blurry even though I used the image stabilization feature.Do not buy this product."
"This camera features a touch screen and several shooting modes. It also comes with loads of accessories, which is great for first time buyers. If you are looking for a functional action camera, this is it. However, don’t expect high video quality, because you will be disappointed. Your iPhone likely takes higher quality video than this camera. I see this being a good option for someone who needs a camera for a situation in which it may be damaged, since it is so cheap."
Is the more important piece and is really poor quality thinking about to return the camera
"This unit is easy to use and has nice sound and picture quality...however, it's only good for about an hour of recording while riding (motorcycle).  while it's enclosed in the waterproof holder, no way to hook up power...the 2 pack of batteries is nice, but on 3-5 hour tours of scenic roads, this is disappointing.  It's a tiny camera so I would suggest an option extra large battery pack option for fixed mount riders."
After using this camera I can say I’m not happy with this purchase. I lose connection when the camera is close to my phone. Battery doesn’t last long. Sound quality isn’t good when it’s in the waterproof case.
"Crystal clear video but couldn't get it to work as an always-on dash cam, had to manually press the record button each time and it would only record for a minute then stop, which defeated my purpose for buying so now it's sitting on my shelf collecting dust"
"I bought this action cam for my occasional hiking and recording my tennis matches. There are 2 big drawbacks to this camera -1. Video quality is really poor compared to the mainstream brands like GoPro, DJI etc. If you are not looking into details (and if you are ok with video looking like it is filmed in a decade old cell phone) then this might be the camera for you.2. Battery life is also really poor per battery. I ended up swapping batteries almost 25-30 mins and it has become a nuisance. Worst part is it will not save the video if the battery dies in the middle of a recording. I have lost tons of footage. This forced me to stop recording my tennis matches and even when hiking this kept bothering that i have keep reminding myself to keep change batteries and even than I couldn't get more than 1.5 hours of video!!!Finally, my SD card slot stopped working. It no longer holds the SD card in place and that marked the end of this camera for me as it no longer can record.I REALLY WISHED I HAD SAVED MONEY TO BUY A GOOD ONE AND NOW I HAVE TO BUY ONE!!! PLEASE DONT MAKE MY MISTAKE!!!"
The camera randomly turns itself off so you end up not capturing what ever it is you wanted to film. This has happened to me over and over again while wearing the camera on a helmet. Absolute trash. Just buy an actual go pro so you don't miss those moments!
"The battery life is horrible.  Also, it says it’s MAC compatible - it’s not.  There are some good points - that it comes with a spare battery is great.  Lots of options to mount the camera.  It video quality is not bad.  The negatives are just too great."
"No protection for the lens, missing descriptions of all of options in the manual, AWB setting does nothing (couldn’t get a clear picture of a yellow flower in the sun; washed out; same in video mode), challenging to remember how to get to preview, change modes, change options. Returning."
"The quality is decent for the price. Its quite easy to use but battery life could be better. I have been trying to record my kids soccer matches but 1 battery only lasts about 30 minutes of continuous recording. The quality of the video is ok, not really complaining about that but what I really dislike is that the recording glitches a lot. I looks like a screen that is trying to load. This glitch happens pretty frequently. I expected an action cam to perform better than this and the it doesnt zoom in/out"
"The ""Hiicam Speed 10 Action Camera 5K 30FPS Waterproof Camera Underwater 131 FT with EIS, Remote Control Sports Camera 5X Zoom Without Memory Card, 2x1350mAh Battery, Deep Black"" I received performs like a low-cost camera.The camera itself is easy to operate. You can achieve 5k recording by turning off stability. However, doing that will make the camera useless for action, only ok as a still video recorder.Video recordings are not great. Compression is high, making the content not as clear as it could be. This isn't a name-brand action camera costing far more.Stability is buggy. It is only fairly smooth when slowly panning. Any sudden panning motion will make the image jerk. That happens no matter what resolution I set it to.Are the video recordings clear? Not very. It has a soft focus and needs ample lighting to produce a fairly decent image. If I record in 4k, then resample the video clip using software to 1080p, the image is better, but I lose the whole reason for having a 4k camera.Auto white balance works fairly well. Other settings not so well for white balance, so I keep it on auto.Contrast management is not great. Seeing the sun glare off a tree trunk will  wash the area overexposing it. Sun splashed scenes will be difficult to record.Yes, it comes with a remote, ability to control it using software, and has a cage for underwater video recording. It also comes with two batteries, and a dual battery charger as well. It could make a great starter gift.I was personally disappointed with the quality. However,  for the price, I can't condemn the camera simply because it performs at a level matching its price."
I thought the best thing I could do to test is to film my dog and how she plays with her toys.  The resulting images were very blurry in burst or segmented off a video.  I'll admit it is a good camera but it's not as good as I was hoping for better at this price.
This camera is tiny.I did not realize how small it is.No flash.Not totally happy.
"I'm writing this review after using this tripod for a year.When I set my phone up on this tripod, it is never level. I have used 4 different phones and the results are always the same. I have to meticulously place a stack of coins under one of the legs in order to make it level, regardless of the surface. The stack is typically almost always around 1"" tall. I have also had issues getting this tripod to lock at certain angles. The adjustable parts on this tripod have teeth that need to lock into place to hold steady. It's very limiting for positioning it in upwards and downwards angles. Somehow I always need an angle that's in-between two of the options the teeth allow.I'm giving a 3 star review because of the amount of time and effort it takes to set up because of the two problems I listed above. The remote works well and the frame is sturdy. I will note that I do mostly studio shots. I'm buying a different brand because I'm not satisfied enough with this one to keep using it."
"As a photographer, I have worked with a variety of stands and tripods. One of them has an air cushion/spring and it's properly labeled with safety tags to ensure safety of equipment and people while opening it.That should be the case here too. There is something in this stand design that makes it shoot down immediately into place with really wide base at one point. It's not like a smooth continuous glide that stops with a lower cross base like I would have expected from a smaller stand. None of this is covered in the actual instructions. The edge of my finger got caught in the stand legs as it did this. What a painful way to troubleshoot how to get it open again.I'm used to repositioning smaller tripods while they are open. I wouldn't dream of doing that with this stand because of what happened.It seems like a sturdy stand for what I need, but that spring action or whatever is making it shoot immediately down into a wide base with no stopping point is an absolute hazard. I'm surprised I haven't lost the tip of my finger just now."
"For the most part the tripod works perfectly fine for what I’m looking to do with it, and has plenty of variability with height. I got it to record stuff at the gym and it is definitely perfect for it.The only real down side I ran into was that the plastic that stabilizes one of the feet at the bottom of the tripod broke within two days of me receiving it, I’m not really sure how. I wound up having to use screws to reattach it and keep in functional, but I guess for the cost you can’t expect it to be indestructible, albeit two days is very fast for something to break for no real reason."
"The area where the phone is held is designed poorly. The screw that tightened the ability to tilt stripped off easily. Camera angle/view does not center/align in both panoramic and landscape mode because of the design on how to tighten it does not allow it lock centered. The clips to hold the extensions is not strong, causing the stand to slide down when stood up. The remote was fine and worked well."
"This tripod is very bulky! It has several clips that are used to adjust the height, and that is such a bear to do! I’ve owned many tripods and this one is the most time-consuming for height adjustment. My other ones just extend, without having to unclip and clip anything.I really couldn’t figure out how to use this tripod for selfies if you are holding it in your hand. The legs fold into a chunky and bulky stick, so holding it to take a selfie is impossible. I had to plant it on the ground to take pictures.Also, why no designated remote storage? All my tripods have a slot for storing the remote, and this one doesn’t! I had to use a tie to tie it to the base.3 starts only for the sturdiness. It’s definitely much sturdier than my other tripods but that’s about the only pro among all the cons."
"The unit, for the price, is OK. However the description I think was a little misleading. It is about 18” long and wider than I expected. I thought it said it was 13”. I can still use it so I will not be returning it. It just won’t be as convenient to use for travel."
"I wanted a selfie stick that could also work as tripod, but what I got was a sturdy tripod, that's too heavy and cumbersome as a selfie stick."
"Mostly it is a great tripod/Selfie stick. But The Vertical Angle Adjustment is very tight.  I am afraid I will break it to adjust it.  I 'hit' the big adjust knob in to push it in and it adjusted more easily.  But I had to do this every time.  Also, it has detents that limit the angle so in selfie mode you can't easily get the exact angle needed to position the camera optimally.  You may want an angle between the Detents.  The pole extend locks work very well."
"1. The handle is not comfortable when using this as a selfie stick.2. The legs have sharp edges that can pinch your fingers as you open and close the device.3. If you use the device as a tripod, you can't get a level image unless the device is on a level surface. That's fine indoors, but the whole idea is to be able to conveniently switch from selfie to tripod outdoors, which is mostly where you use a selfie stick. Maybe a ball-head phone adapter is the answer to that problem."
"Bought this to use as a tripod for both my phone and my camera. For my phone it's pretty decent. It's cheap, and cheaply made. You get what you pay for. BUT if you have a large phone or use this with a DSLR camera you'll quickly see that this is NOT very steady and you risk it tipping. I use it for my phone ONLY. The remote is a nice little addition that is quite useful too. If you're only going to be using this with a phone, you should be fine"
"I bought two in preparation  for a project, unboxed the first and was very pleased with quality and stability.  Unfortunately I did not check the second at the same time: the 1/4"" screw mount is not secure and provides a significant amount of wobble, literally shifting anything placed on it side to side at the slightest contact making it useless for my needs."
It’s not the best. It feels sturdy but the a lot of the screw mechanisms weren’t smooth and would get stuck. And I personally dislike the set angles that the top section could switch between. It’s not bad for the price but I think I would want a difference one where I could angle the phone where I want.
"Writing this review really late.  But beware, tripod lasted me maybe 3 months.  Again just getting around to review it cause I needed a tripod and decided I would make this one work with the random stuff I had.  Was not tough on tripod.  Knocked it over once with phone on it and the weight of the phone pulled the legs rear anchor back to the stem away from the stem.  I have a s21 phone and with the fall, the phone holder sustained a hairline crack and over the next few weeks of trying to make it work, flexing the holder, it's barely holding on.  Was really great in the beginning, I told everybody about this tripod and listing.  But went downhill quick.  Good for a go pro or small camera but nothing of value."
Remote missing in the package
"This product works well as a tripod and the remote works. There is no selfie stick. One of the pictures in the add very clearly shows a separate selfie stick, there is not. You must fold up the legs and hold the entire tripod out to use a selfie stick. I really hate being deceived."
Its good for the price
"Holds the larger IPhone great.  The problem is the ability to adjust and aim the phone at the right spot leaves room for improvement.  When you have it at full extension, the pole sways quite a bit potentially causing an issue if you need a slower shutter time."
High price
"I loved this tripod! Bought it in August and randomly broke when I pulled it to extend it up. Only enjoyed it for 2 months which is bad.  Disappointed only since it broke. Otherwise, it worked great and was very sturdy."
"The tripod is good for casual use but if you are looking for something with a head that can move freely to get the phone in an exact position, this is not it.Also, it is not super sturdy."
"Item arrived loose in a larger box with other purchases. Missing the top piece that allows your phone to swivel. Tripod seems fine, but lack of packaging and missing piece makes it a 2 or 3 star purchase."
"Overall, it is pretty sturdy, the remote works well with my iPhone and connects easily. My only negative is that the base doesn't tighten enough. I also would not feel comfortable using this outdoors."
"I've been having to write a lot more product reviews for different review platforms and having this to help me film videos for social media has helped a lot. It's easy to set up right out of the box, and easy to use. I'm still getting used to how to position my phone, but this tripod gives you the option to use it as a selfie stick, as a stationary tripod (and you can position your phone in any position you want), and you can even stick a GoPro cam on this (but I won't be using that option since I only have an iPhone). It's a good little starter tripod."
"Looks nice, the holder is strong, my only complaint is the top wobbles when the phone is mounted. Good thing the remote is included. If it wasn't you'd never get a clear photo."
"While it looks like the tripod will serve my purpose, it is very basic.  The original product packaging is very not a quality packaging - parts were shaking around in the box becuae there was no boxea for the adapter or the remote and no styrofoam or carboard to prevent the items from moving.  The battery did not have a plastic piece preventing it from closing the circuit.  Additionally, the box is not long enough for storaging the tripod with the phone adapter staying attached.  There are not any instructions included so I have no clue about the remote or the additional adapter."
comes as shown. It was easy to use and put up/down. Works great except the remote wont connect at all.
"I love that the tripod is pink, extremely tall feels sturdy and set up is easy, cleans easy enough. I dislike that the accessories are all black throws off the aesthetic and looks like they dont come together; the carry bag being black instead of pink is a downside too. Neither here nor there with remote i have an android both the android and iPhone button snaps a picture very limit features with remote too. More detailed review on my YouTube."
It's ok I have a Google pixel fold phone so it just barely fits in it
With the tripod being so shallow it sways when fully extended. Hard to adjust the tilt but it will stay tightened in position. Obviously better for phones vs regular cameras but can accommodate both. Recommend using shutter delay timer or remote. Be prepared to take your phone case off if it’s too thick to hold it.
It was working well. I would say it’s exactly as pictured. Not sleek but that’s not what’s being sold. I thought it was sturdy. Pretty compact but the attachment for holding the phone constantly slid. I tried to remove my case. Even use a sticky case. Nothing worked so I had to buy a new one.
i dont like how difficult it is to bring the tripod to stand..
"This is a high quality, very stable, heavy duty tripod! It did not fold up as small as I was wanting making it hard to have on the move! If looking for a bigger stable tripod this is what you need! If you’re looking to travel around with it it’s too big!"
"We returned this. While it works great for a phone, it's not lightweight. We should have weighed it before sending back, because we could never travel with it. It gets 2 stars because it works and for the price point, is good. But we definitely can't call this lightweight."
"There are no instructions for using the remote control. Doesn’t work with my iPhone.The lowest section is stuck and doesn’t fold. If these two are resolved, will be a useful tool.The length is good, it’s sturdy and holds the iPhone easily and well."
I’ve purchased two of these and on both of them one of the legs broke off after regular use. Also it is difficult to open sometimes and I have pinched my fingers on multiple occasions. I will not be purchasing again.
"The selfie stick, tripod, phone holder everything is great. Phone holding for selfie mode is little clumsy but usable. I'm wondering why did the wireless remote stopped working. Will they send me another one to try?"
"This is such a good started tripod. I use this to film content for my IG and TT. I'm not sure why but the glue has come apart on the bottom and sometimes the legs will fold out on itself and cause the whole tripod + my phone to fall to the ground. I'm sure I can glue it back myself it's just an inconvenience. I also do not like how long the legs are, when I am recording at a low angle I can see the feet of the tripod. Somethings I do love is how high and low it goes. I like that I can usually record anywhere it does pretty okay on unsmooth surfaces."
Really good Tripod and selfie stick however now less than a year later the remote to click and take pictures doesnt work. When you push it just changes the volume doesnt actually take the picture.
"This is the first tripod I’ve ever had its easy to work and seems sturdy. When I got the package it was missing the remote, which is the whole reason why I ordered this tripod so I could take pictures. I was wanting to take it on a trip but now I have to return the tripod and get a new oneUpdateI reached out to see if they could send me the missing adapter and remote. But I never heard back. So I just had Amazon replace it.I just received my replacement and I have all the parts. I’m changing my review from 1 to 3 stars because it is a nice tripod. But the company was not helpful."
"It gets the job done. It's not super sturdy but it can be made to work. You won't get amazing tilts, angles or versatility with this. If you're taking it to film on flat surfaces with a straight forward shot in calm weather or indoors, this is all you need.If you want over head shots, turning, good angles, sturdiness on uneven surfaces, weather resistance and more versatility, you're going to need a different tripod. Probably one a bit more expensive than this.Remember, if you're using this to record with your back camera, a good chunk of your screen will be unusable and unobservable. If you tilt downwards, you pretty much lose all manual functionality of your phone screen. Your bluetooth remote can come in handy for this but you won't be able to see what you're filming. For pictures it could be okay but would be annoying because you'd have to walk back to the tripod, pry your phone out, scroll through the pictures to check the pictures turned out okay, if someone wasn't in frame you might have to put your phone back in, adjust and do some educated guesswork to get the right position. It may take a few tries. If filming, this is an absolute nightmare. Your frames will constantly be a few cms to an inch off from each other. This is because the tripod is a bit flimsy and will definitely move while you remove your phone to check positions. You can get past this issue by using your apple watch. I don't know atm if other smart watches work like this, but if you're using an iphone with an apple watch you can open the camera app on the watch and use it as a portable view finder. If you do not have an apple watch, you might be out of luck here.Great for casual use and pictures. If using for slightly detailed production or work, you would want to go with something sturdier and figure out your view finder situation."
"This is an okay product. I didn't expect a lot when purchasing it, but it still is below what I expected. The entire piece is very light and feels flimsy. The mount to place your phone into also gets stuck easily, but it feels secure whenever you get it positioned correctly. My biggest problem is that there is no option to face the mount downwards. It can be placed upwards, but not downwards. Therefore, if you want to have the phone camera pointed lower, you will need to elevate on of the legs. You really get what you pay for, which isn't a lot."
"The knob that adjusts leveling the camera has fixed locations. This is bad if you have the tripod on uneven ground since you will need to level the camera, but the camera holder positions snap into notched locations and it is difficult to level the camera when outdoors on uneven ground. It should have been free turning so that  the camera holder could be adjusted until it is level and then the knob could then be tightened to fix the position in place. Now I have to often mess with placing something under the tripod leg(s) to get the camera level."
The tripod holds your phone securely when it is upright. the only issue is that is sags a bit when it holds the phone sideways.
"A very well- built tripod, but you can’t fine adjust the camera angle down to adjust framing which seems like a really important thing."
Does a better job indoors. A little breeze will surely knock it over.
"I bought this to start making YT videos. It is very easy to get started with. The remote control for starting and stopping video is fantastic. I stand about six to eight feet away and turn it off and on repeatedly during a session without a problem.The only issue is getting and keeping the perfect angle. There isn't enough heft/weight to the product so that it maintains the exact angle you need. You can't really crank the controls hard enough to keep things exact. Touching it changes the shot, so you have to make an adjustment, pull your hands away and hope that it won't move at all as you walk back into the shot. It helped pulling the carpet back so the tripod is on a more solid surface.I'd say this is a great product to start with to see if you're interested in pursuing bigger projects. All-in-all, just OK."
"The product would be great for more stationary use but I bought it to take to the Grand Canyon and carry in my backpack.  The tripod on this device make it bulkier that a traditional selfie stick because now you have to grip the entire, while collapsed it's big and heavier to have to hold.  It's not like the picture"
"The tripod's phone holder cannot turn left or right on its axis. This makes it difficult to capture/film different angles.Working in a small, cluttered spaces it's hard to micro adjust your phone to get proper angles as you have to move the whole tripod a centimeter that you may not have."
Did not abuse this thing. Used it to film my golf swing in my backyard. Broke after one month. The legs part of it detached. I was able to glue it back together and it works now. Works fine as a tripod. For what it costs it does the job well enough.
"I'm not happy with this at all. Record my daughters band competitions. It's impossible to position this camera into the position I need to film the field. It only rotates up and down and left and right in 10° increments. It is impossible to properly frame the field using this tripod. It was either too high or too low. If you do need to pan left or right It jumps into these 10 degree clicks. You can compensate by rotating the entire tripod, and for up and down technically you could maybe raise and lower one leg. I can see using this for a selfie stick or maybe recording yourself inside the home, But I would recommend spending a few dollars more and getting something to let you actually swivel to the exact position you need and lock it into place.  I actually had to resort to holding the camera by hand. Very limited functionality."
"The only way you can get the Bluetooth to work for selfies is by downloading an app that is Not free. It’s a free 3 day trial.I have an iPhone 14Everyone is nickel and diming us to death with all these monthly subscriptions.The selfie stick itself does seem decently built, although on the heavy side. I do a lot of shooting on location so having a lightweight tripod is a plus.The only reason I chose this one over the other ones was because of the selfie stick option.Just be aware of that feature doesn’t work And it’s really just Using the tripod itself as a selfie stick.For indoor studio use it would be fine. As long as you don’t expect the remote to work."
"I would not buy this again, if I had to do over.  The stand is very lightweight and wobbly.  Because it has a track (see pic) running down the pole of the stand, you cannot swivel the tri pod part at all, to balance the stand if needed. Also, the camera mount does not let you tilt down at all, which is very limiting.  This was not a good buy.  Sometimes, but not always the case, those YouTube videos you get ideas from don't promote the most useful products in their video."
It works but it is flimsy and not as easy to position as I had hoped. A tripod that works yes. Highest quality...not so much. I did not use the remote control my camera has one included.
"Affordable but one bump or gust of wind from toppling down haha but it does adjust to many different heights and angles, so that’s a plus! Wouldn’t repurchase but did the job I needed it for!"
"So the tripod is fine and the remote control works fine. BUT BEWARE, the first time I opened the tripod legs, they snapped all the way open and caught my little finger between two of of the collapsible legs (see photo). It felt like it was going to cut the tip of my little finger off and I was literally trapped. Without two free hands, I had to yell for my wife to come and help open the collapsible legs to get my finger free. No permanent damage done (other than it hurt like the dickens), but if had been a small child it could have been a VERY bad situation."
"It feels very clunky- like any emotion you make incorrectly may bend something or break something. The phone holder that comes with it is just complete garbage and I don't know why they would even give you such a total piece of crap with this. it demeans the whole purchase. The remote works pretty good, it would be cool if you didn't have to hold down the button to keep recording but you do. It's okay, you'll want to get a different phone holder for sure which makes the overall cost of this increase. I probably won't send it back but it's not my favorite."
"Everything about this tripod and the remote is great. But something seems off about the part that holds the phone. You expect the two sides to open in unison and to automatically grip because of a spring or something… but they don’t. Each side opens independently, and you have to pull them open with a lot of force and then push them closed onto your phone. I'm giving it only three stars because I’m just waiting for it to break or stop working, at which point the whole thing will be useless."
"This is reasonably well made, the legs extend smoothly and the latches are easy to use. It's also lighter than a full tripod of the same height. The maximum height is around 5 feet which should work for most applications.The ""head"" and phone holder could be better. It won't hold a phone in the landscape position so you have to tilt it 90 degrees off to one side as shown in the photo. In that position it's not as stable. The phone holder is spring loaded and adequate but I'd rather have something that locks the phone in place. My other gripe is using this as a selfie stick requires hanging on to the bulky collapsed tripod legs (as shown in the pic) which is far from being a comfortable ""hand grip"" but still usable. It's also heavier than a real selfie stick.As long as none of the cheap plastic bits break I'm reasonably happy with it for the price. It will also hold point and shoot camera and possibly even a small DSLR with a modest lens if it's sitting on top of the tripod (not tilted off to the side).  If it's top heavy, and someone bumps into it, it's likely to fall over unlike a full tripod. But, with care, would work for many lightweight applications. The standard 1/4"" thread mount will work with all sorts of devices, including video lights, as long as they're not too heavy."
"As far as a tripod, it's functional, sturdy, and made well. Supports larger phones and the grip on the phone is tight. 3 stars because it doesn't give you as much range of motion as others I've used. It doesn't rotate forward passed 90 degrees or perpendicular to the floor. For instance, you cant take a picture of something on the floor (if you ever need to do that) When you are trying to experiment with different angles, there are limitations to this tripod."
"I had my first product photoshoot recently and bought this tripod for my iPhone, which I planned to use as a secondary camera. Without the gooseneck attachment, the tripod is reasonably sturdy. Add the gooseneck and extend it in any direction. For me, the tripod would tip as soon as the camera was extended beyond a tripod foot. Since the tripod base is not large, a small adjustment of the gooseneck often left it well-beyond the base. It fell a lot. I tried several ways to stabilize it, but ultimately, I stopped using it. Setting it aside in the corner is always a clear sign that the tool doesn't do what it's supposed to do. I cannot recommend and will not buy again."
"Too bulky to use as a selfie stick as you have to hold the whole tripod, which is awkward and heavy.  It is sturdy and good quality if I didn’t have arthritis it would probably be good.  It’s bulky so if you as traveling you will want to get a carrier for it to free up you hands. Tape the battery cover on as mine kept popping off, thank goodness I always found it.  I had to return it just because it wasn’t a good fit for me. The remote worked good"
This thing is sturdy and tall but the tripod does NOT want to collapse.
"I can't seem to get it to extend to the advertised 62""."
Broke first use. Still can use fine but not ideal
A few dislikes.1. The phone holder cannot be extended when the back is attaced to the tripod head. So you cannot release the phone unless you unscrew the holder at least partially.2. The rotations are not smooth so you cannot lock in place at any point. You can only position where it clicks.3. The tripod head is wiggly. It's impossible to get perfect alignment.
Received this today. The remote is NOT with it.  Since it came from china don't  expect to ever see one.
Missing phone holder but easy to use
"My issue with this was the cell phone clamp. It was not easy or convenient to use. It had to be unscrewed/loosened to open the cell phone holder then tightened again, too much effort. I returned it for a different brand where the cell phone clamp could be easily opened and closed with your hands. Other than the clamp, the tripod was pretty decent."
Wrong advertising. This is not a selfie stick.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This tripod is almost perfect - it’s sturdy and compact, lightweight but strong. Great for horizontal shooting. But no matter what I do, I cannot get the tripod to angle my phone vertically without it being crooked. Something is wrong with the knob and it won’t let the mount lay flat. This has been getting on my nerves for months now and I’ve tried everything with no fix."
"Seems flimsy. Great accessory. I returned this item, because it couldn't be adjusted to hold my livestreaming centered."
"I've had this tripod for 7 months. Every time I'm in need of a selfie stick  I think to myself, did my tripod come with the selfie stick? I go looking for it, then forget about it. I finally got on yo look at the product description again, because the instructions don't refer to it. The ""selfie stick"" is holding the retracted tripod! Oh my gee...the tripod is heavy and very sharp. What a rip off. Better to purchase one of the plethora of tripod, mini tripod, actual selfie stick trios they have here on Amazon. I wish I could return this.As a tripod, it's me, the weight on the bottom will counter with a standard phone case. If you have an Otter Box, or Beetle like I do it will tip if it's touched."
"I think if I was just using this for a selfie stick it would be fine. The reason why I bought it is so that it can rotate as I make videos but it doesn't, it just sits in one position. However, you can change the orientation but it does not rotate."
"The head has ""click"" positions so you can't fine tune leveling. When I attached my phone & locked in the head, it was 1/2 a line off vertical center which was noticeable in the video. The only way to level it was to wedge paper under one foot."
"I just received my order last week. I used it once and it was fine - the tripod appears to be sturdy and good quality material while the remote appeared to be rather fragile although very simple to sync and operate with my phone. Last night my 19 year old daughter was messing with the remote and opened the battery door to it. Now we can't get the battery door to the remote to close and secure the battery in place (nothing was broken either). The remote is very, very cheaply made and could use a significant upgrade. I've gone to the Sensyne website to try to contact their customer support about the issue but they do not have a customer support phone number. Instead, you're only allowed to contact them via email."
"The tripod works great- easy to set up, and intuitive latches and locks. But it is extremely easy to cut yourself when adjusting the base. Particularly on the part around the joint. It’s a deep cut too- watch out for how sharp the metal is on the underside."
"I used this tripod for a few months and I am about to buy a different one. The only pro is that it is light. But other than that it is flimsy, the turning head turns in certain intervals so it is hard to align it perfectly straight, the holder didn’t hold my phone well (iPhone Pro Max 15) and my phone would fell off frequently. It is kind of hard to maneuver it at the angles you want, the handle gets in a way. I am really surprised how this item has so many good reviews."
"Felt cheap and was not very study but it seems appropriate for this price point. I bought this to use with a laser level for household projects and I immediately realized I got the wrong one. Tilting the mount goes in clicks and I needed much finer control over that movement so after wrestling with it for 10 minutes to try and stop it jumping up to the next click-level, I just ordered a different one and returned this.I did test the remote and that seemed to work well but seemed like it might break easily so just be careful. Overall, didn’t work for my needs but I’m sure it can get the job done for some selfies with the family!"
"This concept is GREAT! However I couldn’t get it to stand all the way up without falling back into the hole, yes I tightened the knob and made sure the screws were in place. Maybe I got a faulty one?"
"The product itself is solid, i mean worth the value. This works smooth as a cellphone tripod for taking group picutres or personal photos when there's no one else around to capture it for you.My main problem is product title description says ""SELFIE STICK"" , which is very misleading considering the bracket hinge doesn't move thus unless someone is capable of taking 90° selfies or has 'fantastic 4' hands, this is practically useless as a selfie stick. This is a big disappointment for us as we mainly bought it for that purpose"
I bent one of the legs because i stepped on it. Bent it back and still folds. If your not a lumbering oaf like me I’m sure you won’t have any issues
"Opened it and it didn’t come with any protection other than the box so it could easily break during shipping, directions for the stand and remote are good, the remote works well with my iPhone and can be used for volume as well, stand is nose height to me and I’m 6ft, it’s mostly sturdy, but I noticed it’s tipsy with my newer heavier phone when extended, the grip that holds the phone did let my iPhone 12 Pro slide down a bit but hasn’t let it fall…yet so use a case, overall for the price it’s pretty good"
"The stand overall is stable and provides the support I need to hold my phones camera. Although if someone gets near it, it’s flimsy enough to knock over. The biggest let down is the remote does not work with the app or with my regular camera like the instructions say. You can overcome this easy though if you have a smart watch with a timer. So all in all, it’s definitely worth a buy if you’re looking for something cheap and efficient enough to get the “job done.”"
"My issue with this tripod is that sometimes it freezes or cramps. I have issues opening and closing the middle latch too. When it chooses to work well it’s great, but there seems to be some mechanical QA issues that need work"
"Pretty basic tripod. Wanted overhead shots but it captures the tripod legs in the vid/pictures and it is not straight. All images and videos are shot at a tilt, no matter how hard I try to straighten the camera."
There's a lot I really like about this stand but it has one massively fatal flaw that completely negates all the positive features. The camera horizontal level adjustment. If you want to tilt the camera down or up there are only five settings between the face of the camera being parallel to the ground or vertical. It makes a huge difference when you're trying to frame your shot.
"Works perfect for a stable tripod, if that's all you need. But the top attachment doesn't let you angle your phone downwards or upwards, which is kind of a bummer because sometimes I want to just angle my phone slightly down for more of a top view of something close to the stand. But all I can do is raise/lower the height of the stand, which puts my targeted area out of view."
"I received the package just fine it works and holds up my phone but I ordered this specifically because it had a BT remote so I was hoping it would actually work, but I never received the remote."
"I got the product specifically because it has a remote but when I opened it, the remote was no where to be found. Not in any other boxes I ordered either. Need either a refund or a replacement"
"It’s a pretty good tripod (my first for a phone), but the biggest issue is the base nor the top pivots around and so the screen facing side of the tripod is between two of the legs and the third leg is directly behind. I have found that I mostly need that third leg to be in the front as on uneven ground the tripod tips forward from the weight of the phone."
III thought it was also good for my new iPad 2024 pro M4 but disappointed that I can use this only with my iPhone 16.  Had to return and order one good for both iPad and iphone
"It works fine for shooting straight-on, but it uses a cheap one-direction pivot on top, instead of a ball joint that would let you point the camera in any direction, like on a professional or even a semi-pro tripod. This severely limits the range of motion.It will not point downward at more that about a 5-degree angle, making it useless for shots from above. It cannot be rotated left to right; you have to turn the entire tripod from the base. It doesn't even move freely on the pivot front to back, it clicks into one of about 15-20 fixed positions. You tend to have to adjust the height of the tripod after this to get the picture just right. The phone grip is also pretty unsteady, even a slight bump will make it tilt off level.I am not an advanced photographer or into super expensive camera equipment, but this doesn't even get the job done for some pretty basic stuff."
Heavier than some but otherwise a reasonable value.
"Purchased this product to shoot some videos of us putting together our raised garden and planting some tomatoes and melons. The tripod is somewhat top heavy with the phone attached and I wouldn't be surprised if it tipped over if bumped. It works fine in a stable environment, but if you have any moving parts in your shoot, beware."
I loved this tripod. I’m even considering purchasing again but just bummed it didn’t last long I started using it about 6 months ago and the stand just broke. It was an easy set up and functioned great prior. But seems like the tripod stand part might be on the cheaper side since mine already snapped.
"First the positive - the tripod is easy and quick to operate. It's not heavy, so I guess stability could be an issue depending on the situation.  The remote was handy - easy to use. Some reviewers have noted that it has a short range. I had no problem at 18-24 ft.  So it'll depend on your needs.I do have an issue with the phone holder.  The holder is nice, spring action, rubber grips. But the grips, as shown in the picture, curve in. So what seems to be 1/2 inch allowance is really less than that because of the curve of the grip.  So if you have a thick case or a wallet, it's tricky. I have a wallet on my phone that holds 3-4 cards and just a few ""emergency"" bills. I have to take out some cards for it to fit in the phone holder.My other disappointment is the selfie stick feature.  Would be handy except that there is not much of a tilt. I couldn't get the angle right to use as a selfie stick.So - tripod is good, remote shoot is good,  selfie stick not so much, and phone holder is not deep enough if you have a wallet or heavy case."
The up down tilt has teeth that clamp together to hold the tilt tight. The problem with that is you are at the mercy of where these teeth were molded into the plastic.  The result is that the phone will be either pointed slightly up or slightly down. You cant set it for level. It is not completely adjustable. Yes you can put a wedge under the tripod but it would make more sense to use a different type of friction clamp. The clockwise clamp has the same issue except you have a bit of wiggle room where you screw down the phone holder. To work around the tilt problem l filed the teeth off the clamp. I inserted a thin rubber washer to give it some extra grip. Another issue is they claim you can use it as an extension holder while walking. The issue here is that it is pretty heavy to hold while on the go. I wouldn’t plan on using it that way.  I gave it a 3 out of 5 for being poorly engineered for adjustability and exaggerating it’s uses. Otherwise it is solidly constructed and will work fine for a fixed point tripod with modifications.
"I got this to use with my dslr and it works perfectly for that.  If I fully extend the legs the top of the tripod will stand taller than I am and being a giraffe person that's fairly impressive. It holds my dslr well and is very sturdy. I also appreciate the small level on it.So for a regular run of the mill dslr with no fancy equipment, it's great.  Great for entry level photography.I decided at some point recently that I want to get into night sky photography and for that you need a star tracker. I got the sky adventure mini pro SAM pack which has a 4 lb device.  Since the max pay load of this is 15lbs I figured this would be a good enough tripod to put it on and run out and test out the new tracker.I put the SAM on and it immediately fell over.  I checked everything, tightened everything that could be tightened and no dice.  The dslr isn't even on it yet.So if you're looking to use a star tracker with this or really any night sky photography equipment, keep looking. It was a rookie mistake on my part - i just got really excited and hoped for the best. Oh well.  Live and learn."
This tripod is good as long as you don't use the last set of legs. They are as strong as toothpicks and can't hold anything.
parts are thin
"I bought this based on the reviews, and I thought it would be a good deal, but it's just OK at best.  It's very cheap feeling.  Nearly everything other than the leg tubes is very cheap feeling plastic.  The crank for the vertical adjustment is very awkward and is not smoothly operating.  The tilting head does not lock into place very well, so it can spin freely side to side even when it's ""tight"".  There's a level on the base, so you know your legs are straight, but none on the camera mount, so it really isn't that useful to ensure your camera is level."
"tried to use this but the screw in handle has nothing to screw into when you try to insert it and twist,  it just falls out and won't stay in.  the tightening knob also doesn't tighten to keep the platform from falling forward or backward.  Im returning since it doesn't function properly."
"If you're looking for a tripod for light film production or general photography, this is a good go-to tripod.  It's base is very sturdy and will stand firm in wind or if bumped.  It also has good adjustability.  But if you want a tripod for anything using magnification over long distances, you might consider something else.  My spotting scope image was all over the place when using this tripod.  If I touched scope at all under magnification, it would induce a vibrating image that would take a second or two to settle down.  It made it too hard to fine tune the focus as every time I would touch the adjustment knob, my image would move too much to know if i was focusing or not.  Unfortunately for me, this tripod wasnt a good fit for what I was hoping to use it for.  The head has just too much flex.  It's a shame too because the base was great."
This product did not need my expectation for sturdiness and functionality. It is very lightweight and feels like plastic.
"It does work as a tripod, but it's not as sturdy as I'd like it to be. I'm using this with a fairly heavy spotting scope. And I just feel like eventually it's not going to work, right? It's going to fail"
"Would probably work great for smaller lighter items but doesn't hold my spotting scope securely,  returned it for heavier duty tripod."
"Bought this as a around-the-house backup tripod. It's very lightweight, concerningly. The vertical adjustment is very loose, which I was not prepared for. The tilt is terribly loose and with a super telephoto zoom lens it would not stay still. Replacing the head with something more stable."
"I purchased this product to support a rather expensive piece of electronics, I have purchased similar inexpensive tripods from amazon that serve the purpose, this tripod is very poorly designed and I do not feel comfortable in trusting it. My last tripod that I purchased was the Amazonbasics model and served it's purpose well but unfortunately I misplaced a part and was forced to seek a replacement  My advice would be to pass and keep shopping. there are much better options available than this one."
"The good:It’s high enough for any regular photography use such as family events and self photography.The base is sturdy and adjustable, clips work well.It comes with two snap-in gadgets so that if you lose one (I did!) you can still use it.It’s adjustable in almost all directions.The bad:The mount base on top where you mount the camera is not strong enough, it may works for horizontal positioning, but when trying to use my DSLR camera vertically it wasn’t strong enough and kept dropping. There’s no way to secure it enough to stay in place.  I eventually had to stick a screw in to keep it in place…Other than that flaw, the product works fine, can’t give it 4 stars if it doesn’t serve part of its purpose."
"Adequate tripod if you are shooting with your phone or a small camera. Great height adjustment, hook to add a stability weight. Quick-release mounting plate. Comes with a 1/4"" mounting screw so check your equipment requirements before ordering.While it says max weight capacity is 15 pounds, I put my 11 pound telescope on it. And after checking that every knob and adjustment possible was tight, the telescope still wobbled around like a drunken sailor. So iPhone and items lightweight like that should be no problem. Go with something heavier? I would look elsewhere (like I did) and actually order a heavy duty tripod that is actually built for heavy duty if you are putting any kind of weight on it.I'll keep this just because I can use it with my Nikon and my iPhone (it comes with a phone holder adapter)."
Tripod worked great the few months I’ve had it. Went to make an adjustment on the head this evening and the threads on the handle that controls tilt stripped without any excessive force to it. The female part looks to be plastic and the male part metal. The head is completely useless now after such little use. The tripod part its self is sturdy and works well.
"I only wanted a tripod because i got my first pochade box [ mini set up for painting outside]. I can't afford the $200+ tripods that most art places recommend so I was hoping this "" heavy -duty"" tripod would be good enough. Wrong.My box [ which weighs approx. 7lbs] can't sit straight. I have adjusted all knobs and watched multiple videos from the seller, but the box just instantly slumps forward when placed. According to you tube videos of the same box it should be able to sit straight on a regular photography tripod, but with this one it just doesn't."
"It's ok, however after the first use one of the clips for the hight changing rods broke off so now an entire level is useless."
"So I knew before buying that this was not going to be as stable as my $300+ tripods but after reading some of the reviews I figured it was worth the price at least and I could use it for lighting if it didn't work out for the camera. Turns out I was right. This tripod is great for the super basic stuff and is fairly lightweight for traveling which is nice, however unfortunately it is largely plastic and even with everything as tight as can be, it is not sturdy enough to any kind of timelapse or long exposure photography without getting image shifts and out-of-focus shots due to small vibrations or movement, especially if there's any kind of breeze out.Overall a decent tripod for the average user for holding their phones for social media content and general stuff like that, but not worth getting if you are looking for something stable for professional work IMO."
Most of this is plastic. Even the center pole you can raise and lower. I got a Sunpak I've had over 15 years and that one feels more solid than this one. I'm gonna give it a try. One thing I have changed on it and that's the camera swivel head for a fluid swivel head. The one that comes with it is very rickety and not really good for precise movement. Let's see how it handles!
This was not very sturdy.  Ended up returning it.
This Light weight product was missing the screw in  rubber feet and camera attachment. Contacted support via email and was requested to send pictures for managers approval. Unfortunately they were unable to assist thus returning.
"Save up and just get a better one, this isn't worth 30$, its Extremely light. The whole thing is wobbly, even with a bag on the hook to weight it down. It's almost entirely plastic, and all the plastic is extremely poor quality. The handle is hinged for some reason, and flops around making it awkward to use. the plastic screw to lift the head of it is extremely wobbly, making it useless in any amount of wind. Ditch the handle and keep the screw down and it's passable for light use, I don't have faith in it holding up to much else."
"Bought this tripod to occasionally support a 5 lb. camera when the occasion called for it.I received it and didn't need to use it for a couple of months. When I did, it turns out the tripod is too lightweight and just a bit too rickety for my specific, heavier camera. I later used it for a much lighter camera (2lbs ?) and the tripod was acceptable.I would have returned it, but the time limit passed so I'm keeping it as a backup for my lighter camera."
Some materials where you put the phone are fragile.
"Seems to work good and gets tall, but remember that anything that's not the aluminum leg poles is plastic. Plastic hinges, gambles, and locks and phe plastic makes kt feel cheap"
"works ok.  I have an issue with turning it causing the screw to unscrew, I might need to add loctite"
"I think this tripod is popular because of its cost and not its functionality or durability. I returned mine because a lot of the knobs and clamps didn’t tighten enough to where I felt it could support a camera without falling, collapsing or tilting. It’s probably good for smaller camera bodies and infrequent use."
"I bought 2 of these tripods so when I am shooting I can quickly change angles. Great for transporting and quick setup. The head can only go in one direction like if I spin it counter clockwise it begins to unscrew but if I spin it clockwise it tightens. It has been serving me pretty well and I got my money's worth. It came with QR plates, phone holder, draw string bag and a wireless Bluetooth button."
The quality of the materials are good especially for the price. But the articulation on this thing is a struggle to deal with.This item struggles to pan horizontally which is pretty basic. Even with the tightener loosened the horizontal pan will end up unscrewing the top mount from the body.Maybe that’s just a defect of my particular stand but it’s one that has kept me from using it.Otherwise the build quality is good. If you don’t end up with a lemon like mine I could possibly recommend it.
"The tripod head part had a lot of sticky grease around the joint, so I had to spend some time cleaning it off the plastic. Also, the plate was not made well. It's supposed to be flat, but the rubber part is sticking out because it was not assembled well."
Hard to assemble let’s start there and the legs are very fragile. Came with a traveling bag that was the only good thing. Not for heavy duty camera or phones
"As many have already mentioned, be wary that when you swivel to the right, the top part that you screw into the tripod to hold your camera slowly unscrews and becomes undone if you forget to turn it back to the left top tighten. This is bad because when you're on shoot, you do not think about this as you're constantly taking pictures. I may return this because of this main reason, which plays a big part of a usable tripod for any DSLR camera users."
Lets just say I wouldnt trust my camera with this.. I kept it but ended up going to Walmart buying a different one..
My product actually had parts that already broken off when I first opened it. It does its job though which is alright. It's obviously made of cheap plastic but it comes with those bluetooth remotes which is a plus.
"Finally threw it away. Basically every plastic piece on this thing broke for me starting about a week into owning it. Couldn't actually use it to it's full height, no big deal never needed to use it that high anyway, because one leg just kept coming out because the clamp broke very early on. Now that one leg is completely trashed. I'd barely have called it even lightly used and yet now it's in my trashcan after maybe 4 actual times using it over a year."
The base is very wobbly even after tightening all the moving points! This renders the otherwise okay product useless for the purpose it was created for!
"It does not have a hook as advertised. Considering it’s made of lighter materials, the quality is acceptable. It may not be the most rugged or durable though - but thats what you get from lightweight materials. Great for backpacking."
"I loved this product for the most part, however when I put the camera on it and tightened the bolts down the camera still wanted to fall forward or backwards, even when tightened all the way"
"I used this tripod to film the 2024 solar eclipse in its entirety on solid ground, legs fully extended. There was a very slight breeze that most of the people I was around at the time said they couldn’t feel the majority of the time. Anytime we felt the breeze the video recording became very shaky.  But it wasn’t what any of us considered windy at all.  Pretty disappointed."
Has some weight to it and alot of plastic parts The screws to tighten and lock positions don't stop all vibration from happening so u can get off target easily.
It is not very sturdy and all the crank handles broke off after a few uses.
Was good for holding camera
This is only good if you care about weight. It's very cheap and flimsy.
When I try to pan with this tripod it is just unscrewing the head and it becomes loose. The panning function should be independent of screwing the part on.
"From the Amazon description and review comments, this tripod looked like the one to get for my wife's photography with her new Sont Alpha 7IV camera. I took  its out of the box after it arrived, and I immediately saw that: First, it was all plastic. Not so unusual today for light weight. BUT, it had enormous slop/looseness where the center, vertical support bar meets the mount base so that when you used the hand crank to raise the camera, it moved excessively - the camera was not stable. I'd say that this tripod is not useable for any serious photography. Second, the locking collar for the leg braces where they meet the center, vertical support bar would not tighten - it just kept turning. It would get somewhat snug, but when you applied that little extra twist force to secure it, it would snap out of the threads and keep turning. Not acceptable. Finally, this tripod's smallest, bottom leg extensions were very thin. When fully extended, the legs did not provide a stable, firm base for the camera. Summary - don't buy this tripod."
mounting the iphone was hard to do because it is so tight to open the handles and it’s never straight. But it’s okay.
I haven’t even had this product for a month and it already broke. I was extending the legs and one of the internal plastic pieces broke off and the clamp function to lock the extension in place doesn’t work.The piece slides in and completely out separate from the entire tripod. I thought this was a good product and was very pleased with it until it broke on me in the middle of using it. Definitely won’t buy again.
"I give it two stars bc it functions as it should but it looks like part of the body was refurbished, used or a previous return.Height is good. It has a bag and came with two quick release plates."
"Absolute worst tripod I’ve ever seen. I got this because I needed a fast delivered tripod for my parents house while I was visiting them. Feels like a cheap toy. I actually mounted my Canon R5 with 24-70 2.8 and was nervous with it on there. Please, if you’re looking for a decent tripod, try elsewhere because this is not the one."
"This tripod is perfect for photography and binoculars, but it’s not very stable for a spotting scope.  It had such great reviews so I gave it a shot. As long as you don’t have more than a couple pounds on it, it should work great."
I love the sturdiness of the legs but the part that holds the phone wobbles so bad
"This is the second Joilcan tripod I ordered.  The first had three extensions on the legs and one of the plastic locking elements broke. This one has four extensions, so the last extension is pretty thin and flimsy. I’m hoping it holds up longer than the last one which broke just after the return window. It feels like the closures/locks are brittle, cheap plastic"
Great for the price. My only wish was to have a metal head instead of cheap plastic. The top plate feels cheap.I replaced the top from my old broken tripod.
This is probably one of the best tripods I've ever used. It has a lot of features and has worked well for me but I do have one issue with it. The most important part where the clamp holds on to the phone is not super stable. It's kind of wobbly but other than that everything else it's pretty good.
The first time I used this tripod one of the legs fell off. A piece of the first clip came off rendering the tripod useless. Unfortunately I missed the return date because I was on vacation. My father was a professional photographer and I have worked in photography my whole life so I know how to use a tripod. My personal experience with this product is that it is junk. Hope you have a better experience-
"Looking through reviews, I saw I’m not the only Nikon D850 running into issues with this tripod.My D850 with 24-70mm lens is ~5 lbs, and no matter how much I tighten the “elastic knob” (see product images), I am unable to tighten it enough to hold my camera in place. The camera simply slams down with its weight.I opted to invest a bit more into a different tripod, and ordered the Manfrotto Element MII which has been holding my heavy camera well!Outside of my specific issue, this might work for smaller cameras or phones, and seems to match the quality one would expect at very entry level prices."
"With a max load of 15lbs, I thought this tripod would be ok for my 20x80 Celestron binoculars (5lbs). While I was able to mount the binoculars, pointing them precisely was frustrating. The head of this mount is just not made for this use case. Now as a inexpensive tripod for a iphone or just maybe a lighter dslr, I suppose 4 starts might be more appropriate because of the price. But the 15lb max load advertised, is a false claim in my option."
Every thing supporting it is durable however upper half is cheap and made with plastic which is not strong enough to support your phone.
"This tripod is okay for lighter setups, but unusable for anything as heavy a DSLR with a telephoto lens. It's not very smooth or steady when you try to move it. For the most basic applications where you put the camera on it and leave it there it's okay, but no panning, tilting or heavy camera setups."
The weather assemble these tripods. It comes with many small pieces that are easy to break. This is the third tripod I went through this one was no different from the competitions. It was very sturdy at first and then overtime. The screws became loose and it became harder to assemble eventually breaking. What’s new
"Wish they used a metal plate for their swappable threaded plates. I think it said it supported 15 pounds, but i find it hard to trust that when a 6 pounds mars ii pro bends the plastic piece at any angle over 5 degrees. other than that, it has a great set of features and included accessories."
"I would pass on this tripod if I could do it over again without the hassle of sending it back.  It's too bad the head is flimsy, as the legs seem to be ok.  Pretty close to being a toy."
"The tubes/legs and locking mechanisms are pretty flimsy, but once it's locked into place it feels much better. I will definitely make use of the center hanger for add'l weight to gain steadiness. It will not be my main tripod, but will work for the higher angle shots. It's ok for the price"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I thought I would recommend this item but it totally fell apart on me randomly 3 months after purchase. Of course it’s just outside of the return window.The saddest part is that my old tripod broke like this after MANY years of use. I have not been rough with this at all. Clearly it just isn’t made to last.
"It’s a great tripod, but very disappointed in how the package arrived. This is how the box came… looks like someone opened it and resealed it with scotch tape… they could have at least sealed this tripod in a shipping box…"
"Pictures on Amazon say 19"" when you assemble it for normal use with feet and head it's about 20.75 inches.Not sure how this will hold up in a workplace, when I searched for laser level tripods this came up but with it all being plastic, I am doubting it will hold up longer than a few projects."
Its ok but will not stably hold camera w large or even medium lens
"The tripod seems good and lightweight and the customer support is great, I lost a foot and they sent me 3 new feet right away. Unfortunately my 3 pound camera, lens combo stripped out the head in just a few of months. Plastic parts in there and every time I angled the camera down I would have to make it super tight to keep it from sliding down. Eventually I just totally stopped out those plastic parts. Great tripod if all your shooting is level, but hard to use a lot with it angled down."
"I am warning you so you don’t make the same mistake I made. This thing is not even worth $10 or two at a garage sale. It was broken when I got it! I work two jobs and was unable to return it in the window of time given to return it. I wasted $30 on this. I’m very sad because now I don’t have $30 tripod. These people who sell these things should be ashamed of themselves. Well, I do take responsibility for not having enough time to return it. I’m hoping that by leaving a review I will stop you from wasting your time buying it so I promise you will have to return it it literally is a piece of junk."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Returning this item because the pan head, which screws onto the base, is using the same method of panning.  So essentially, if you pan, you are unscrewing the head and then this creates a gap between the base and the head causing instability."
"This tripod is actually amazing quality. The one flaw it has, it's a serious one. The 1/4 fast plate if just awful. The amount of exposed threading needed to secure the camera to the tripod is beyond way to short to make a secured connection. Very unstable at this single point. The little plastic nub gets destroyed upon first installation of a camera. The plastic is way to soft and the spring may as well not even be there because it's so weak.  Fix the 1/4 fast plate and this will indeed be a 5 star tripod."
Very poorly and cheaply constructed. Composed of softer plastic parts other than the aluminum legs. Unsafe for anything heavier than a cell phone or possibly a go-pro camera.
Tried to use as a tripod for teleprompter but too flimsy - teleprompter wasn't held securely and flopped from side to side.  Problem is with the poor quality of the mount holder.  Spend a few more $$$ and get stable tripod.
"I bought this supposed professional grade tripod for my Nikon D850 before a trip to Thailand.  On day three the center piece broke while opening the tripod.  Nothing was stuck, nothing was forced,  the cheap plastic connector just broke.  But I was still able to use without the center piece.  Today I'm opening the tripod and another connector broke. Again,  nothing was stuck or forced.  It was literally upon opening the tripod.  I'm so frustrated I have to find another in NE Thailand or go without.  I relied on Amazon again and got burned.  So frustrated with garbage like this masquerading as legitimate equipment."
Even for the price it’s pretty flimsy. Spend an extra $30 and buy something a little more substantial.
"This thing isn't worth the money. It's just thin plastic, loosely held together. No matter what you do, the camera will flop and shake around. There's no way to properly firm up the tripod."
"This seemed like a fantastic tripod. It looked like it had all of the features and build quality of a mid to high-end tripod.This would be perfect if all you're putting on here is a cell phone or action cam (go pro, etc). If you are using this for a DSLR look elsewhere. If you put on a lense that is a bit longer, the tripod will not hold it and your camera will point downwards. It cannot tighten enough to hold a DSLR with a long lens."
"King plastic, probably won't last long. It functions as intended though, reasonably light for traveling."
When I opened the box one of the mounts came broken but lucky it comes with a spare so it isnt too much of a problem besides that the set up was easy it has alot of versatility and is very stable it works wonders.
"I read one review that said it’s as nice as their Manfrotto, which is why I bought it….not even close. I have one. Doesn’t even compare. This is very cheap and has lots of flaws because of the cheap material; however, the base is sturdier than some very flimsy ones I’ve used. All in all I would recommend splurging for a Manfrotto if using this for work, if it’s just for fun this will do the trick, but may be a bit frustrating."
"The little button on the plate prevents me from screwing on the iPhone holder, I read it’s spring loaded and supposed to stay flush but it doesn’t work. Now I need to return this and look for another."
I did not expect it to compete with a $300 tri pod but GEESH!!!!! You have to hold to pan left or right because the spin is so tight. It enables if you touch it. Too bad if you want to film kids playing or a sports event. I did not return because I could use it for a vlog stand where it’s use is not meant to move. Nothing more.
"It only adjusts up and down. This is the worst tripod I have ever purchased. It is wobbly af for starters. Second, the adjustment arm only lets you adjust it up or down. So if your not level on the horizontal, your out of luck - you have to start adjusting the legs one by one. Dumbest tripod I have ever bought, do not buy this piece of junk."
To flimsy
"I bought this for a 5 pound pair of binoculars, since the whole top assembly is plastic the binoculars just move and flex all over, it felt like the torque from them was going to break the mount off, I was scared to move the tripod once the binoculars were mounted.  Returned and bought an all aluminum tripod for around 100 dollars."
"Save your money .. plastic .. not satisfied at all and it’s crooked , doesn’t sit flat or adjust camera level"
I read the reviews and thought I had picked a good tripod.  It worked well when my camera was level but the first time I had to point the camera at a downward angle to get a macro shot it wouldn't stay in position.  Just kept dropping.  I tightened it as much as I could but it is plastic so I was afraid of breaking it.  Added another washer behind the tightening knob and it seemed to help some.  Put the flash on top and it was even worse.  I guess its true you get what you pay for.
"Used 1 time only and it broke the 2nd time when I needed to use it after 40days, but what did you expect from such a product being sold on Amazon.  Amazon really need to test these products before they allow such items from being sold on this platform.  Now i am out $30....super upset."
It says it’s sturdy but I definitely would trust it to hold my professional camera and big lens. A phone sure.
The weight of my camera and zoom lens was too much for this little guy. If you plan on shooting with anything heavier than a cellphone maybe look elsewhere.
Not actually height it says it is. It's really short and I'm not that tall
It seems kinda wobbly and hard to get it to lock in solid and straight.
Feels cheap and does not operate smoothly.  Ended up returning it.
I was excited to use this tripod but it developed a crack near the panning arm during the 3rd use.  It is effectively useless now.  I can't return it because I am outside of the return window.  Disappointing product
"The camera sags when i try to point it at a downward angle. Not sure how to tighten it any better, just seems it can’t handle the weight of a lumix g85 with a sigma prime lens. This is not a very heavy combination.  Basically, i can only use this for shots straight ahead. For some reason it doesn’t sag. Not worth it for me, i have to buy another tripod that can handle a not al camera weight without sagging."
"We received the product and immediately set it up. Product seemed to be of decent quality and was relatively easy to set up. Took it out to shoot on the next day, and it immediately broke. Going to super glue it back together, but that is going to take away the ability to pan horizontally without just picking up the tripod and moving it."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It came defective, when I put the camera it can’t stabilize. Also scratched the bottom of my camera 👎🏼"
"I had to returned because it's not as described by vendor, it can work on light weight maybe less than a pound"
Product was made cheap was broken and I don't think it's strong enough to hold what I want. Returned.
I mounted a manfrotto fluid head the tripod and there is so much wobble up and down at the mounting point it’s impossible to use for video. I didn’t expect much being it’s pretty much all plastic but the reviews were ok so I gave it a shot. Wish I would of spent the money and got something better.
"Unfortunately the legs are not held very securely, meaning the height of the tripod can adjust with very little pressure on the legs, and this makes it very difficult to keep the tripod level.Otherwise it's full of nice features like 4 adjustments per leg giving a lot of room for height adjustment, however the tallest setting isn't very tall compared to other tripods I've used"
"The top part is very cheap plastic and doesn't stay put well. The phone holder clicks in place with a little plastic button that broke within 5 minutes. The phone holder doesn't have a microphone mount. The base is very stable, so I may just keep it and replace the top part. It's pretty cheap, so if you plan to use this more frequently and especially if you need the phone mount, I would choose something with higher quality."
"It’s ok, but just ok. Major plastic material and the neck is wobbly. (There is a guy who’s created a video about this). But it works."
Just not very nice but it’s cheap so ya know.It was just not easy to use and made setting it up annoying! Returned it for something more professional
There is a  part that is not working SMOOTH WHEN RAISING THE CAMERA otherwise its ok
Overall I like this tripod for things that are not heavy on top like my phone. It’s easily adjustable but when i put my spotting scope on top it’s too heavy and it doesn’t keep the scope level.
not steady for pictures
"I would stay away from this product if you are using this tripod for something other than with your phone.  I had purchased this to use with my new Canon camera and the head of the product would not tighten enough to not fall forward.  I suppose if you have a camera that does not have a lens that extends this would work as well, but otherwise steer clear."
"I gave this 2 stars only because it will work, but I won't trust my camera equipment to it.  I was looking for a small stand for my Insta360 camera and sometimes my DSLR.  All parts of this stand are  plastic, except the aluminum leg extrusions.  It felt as though it was going to break just cranking the middle post up.  I rarely return items, but this is just too cheap.  It is a $30 stand, and has the quality of a $30 stand.  I will order another stand and will make sure that the important components are metal."
Im a full time content creator and I bought this for on the go filming and within a week of using it the entire top section that connects to the stand itself completely broke. I’ve had to purchase another tripod of a different brand.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            First of all zero Stars don't be fooled by the one that you see here. This thing is a complete mess I don't understand how people rated it so high. Honestly, it's sort of nice looking from a distance but very poorly built and the plastic is cheap and I know it's going to break with the slightest pressure. The center extention pole is super wobbly no matter how much you tighten it. Also I've only got the legs extended one level. I would not extend the legs all the way for sure seeing how wobbly it is at this point. Also the quick release connection super wobbly and the PIN is very small not allowing to attach anything tightly, but it wouldn't matter because the 1/4 inch connection is loose in the plastic casing and the whole quick release in itself does not tighten enough into its slot. I mean I get it, it's very cheap but you don't even get what you pay for here, this thing is useless. Steer clear of this. After experiencing this I wouldn't get anything from this company."
"So I ordered this based on reviews. But I’m thinking a lot were paid or free product reviews. This thing is loose all around. Within 10 seconds the crank handle broke off. Very stiff and hard to operate. You get what you pay for I guess. I do like how tall it gets, but the adjustments are very crude and stiff.Spend another $20 and get a better product"
"The quality is so poor. I was really disappointed, but the price was too low to hope for the best lol."
"Low quality, head broke with my camera attached… do not buy this"
"The legs have  holes in them for feet to screw into. One of the legs have no threads for the foot to thread into😡 great example of why I don’t like shopping online. The hassle of returning the item, then waiting for a new item to be delivered or to receive a refund. Super annoying. Seems like a decent product aside from this issue I have"
"The manufacturer used very cheap plastic. You can only mount a camera on the top of the tripod, using their very cheap plastic and ineffective mounting system. This is nothing like a professional grade tripod. If you use any heavy duty cameras or telephoto lenses in particular, You should completely avoid this thing. I unboxed it, tried it out one time, figured out It was never going to suit my purposes, And began the return process. This is absolutely a lightweight consumer tripod. Professionals beware."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This thing wobbles horribly! See video! How is anyone suooosed to see anything with this being the “professional mount” of a camera, or optic? Don’t waste your time or money. It will disappoint."
"Very cheap and unstable, don’t waste your money. Spend more and get more. Pass on this one and you will be glad you did."
"The top piece which is supposed to hold the camera was poorly designed and does not anchor properly to the tripod. This is a design flaw, rendering the product virtually useless."
Can’t take good pictures or videos
This tripod arrived at my door open used and dirty.  Also the orange is more of a dull red.
"Not stable, don’t waste your money"
I returned this item one day after purchasing it. The head is so stiff and squeaks when you use it and because it's plastic lubricating it does basically nothing. Not usable for a photographer. I could just put a light on it but then what's the point of buying an adjustable tripod if I don't use the adjustment. I returned it and bought one for $20 more which is three times the quality of this product. Go for a metal construction. The plastic tripods at this extendable height are all pretty much the same poor quality. Buy a cheap metal one and you'll get way better build quality without spending too much more money.
"This tripod is OK for a trail cam, but if you want something to use with an SLR forget it. There is far too much lateral movement in the head which you can't lock out. To be honest I am seriously disappointed with it."
"Product specification states weight limit  4kg.. but not really .. my camera with lense weigh around 1.6kg, it’s failed to hold it in straight position , otherwise it’s a good product"
"The device feels cheap and weak with a very plastic feel. The crank mechanism for the centre column is all but unusable, very awkward to use. I'm returning it for poor quality."
Its not as stable as the ad mentions. Havent been able to ise it at all because it is very small in height even when fully expanded
This product works really well. Seems to be really durable. I had it fall on me a few times while out filming in the wind and it gets a little frustrating. I wish the base went a little wider. Love the ability to pivot up or down for the angle but wish more room to pivot the angle down if need be. But otherwise works really well light and easy to carry and folds down small to store away even fits in my backpack which I use while out filming. It holds a phone camera really well. Also the Bluetooth button works so that is a plus so you can have it set up and start it when you are ready.
"I've had this tripod for a while, and finally decided to use it. The set up was easy, and sturdy for the price point. However, after only taking about 5 photos using the shutter, the button came undone and misaligned. It appears the spring that is behind it has come undone, and now this is useless.Update: The seller reached out and offered a full refund of the product. 5 stars for customer service."
"The tripod is great! Very sturdy and the range of adjustable heights is excellent. We used it to take family holiday photos and the remote broke after about 5 clicks… it just stuck. I tried to outs with it, but the button remained stuck down so I threw away the remote."
"Poor quality. 2 orders in same box. You've got to pickup your game. I use Amazon for convenience, not to buy junk that doesn't come as advertised! Disappointed!Also, a return takes up my time and money, so much for convenience."
"This is definitely a sturdy and well-made tripod. I wanted to love it, and I did - except for the spring-loaded phone holder. I didn't realize this is a common feature of these types of tripods, as this is the first I've bought. I have a larger phone with a case on it, which makes it extra wide, and it took A LOT of strength and dexterity to try to get my phone into the holder. I pinched my hand getting it both in and out of the holder as well, there's simply no way around doing that with this type of spring action. And the amount of pressure being exerted on my phone by the holder, I didn't like that either. I feel that you would definitely need to use a phone case with this holder, or else it might damage your delicate phone or crack your screen. I'm returning and opting for a tripod with an adjustable knob on the phone holder so I can better control the pressure exerted on my phone as well as not pinch my hands using it. Since my main use of a tripod would be for casual, home-based social media posts and not outside usage, I feel I could go with a different holder from this one and it would be the better solution."
Almost all plastic construction besides the parts that had to be metal. It's held up so far. But even folded it is extremely long. It doesn't fit into a standard bag unless you remove the head. I have a large bag and it has to go diagonally in the bag even with the head unit removed. I get that it's cheap but it could easily be smaller when folded
Phone holder is slippery when used with phone case on S24 Ultra
My phone doesn't fit well in the holder because of my case.
"This feels like a nice well made product. It's heavier than some others I have tried which is a plus. It locks in nicely, and has a good adjustable height. However, the one thing that could use improvement is that the mounting head is not aligned square on the frame of the pole in relation to the legs. :( This may not be something others have experienced, or it might, or it may be a 1 off, but the tripod is set so that the legs do not align correctly with the mounting portion. By this I mean that if you set the legs so that you don't trip over the 3rd leg, or so that it's square with the item you are capturing, the mounting head is 60° off center. :(For me this creates a tripping hazard which I didn't previously experience with other tripods. Past tripods have always had the ability to either rotate the pole/shaft within its mount area or were already squared to the set up. This one has 2 deep grooves which on one hand make it very stable, but on the other has locked it into this misaligned setting that cannot be corrected. In my opinion it's a flaw and why I give it a 3.5 rating instead of a higher rating."
"Brought this on vacation so we could take hands-free photos. It worked well enough, once I got the remote to correctly hook up to my phone via Bluetooth. (The first time I tried, it didn't connect.) I do wish the tripod was a bit heavier duty though, as I was outside and several times it felt like the wind was going to knock it down during use."
"This is a really nice tripod stand. I like the easy adjustments for height, pitch, yaw, etc. The only issue I have is that with my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra the phone with case is really big for the jaws to open enough to hold it. So I have to take the case off."
This tripod is difficult to use. As a live streamer I need to be able to take my phone on and off easily and unfortunately you can’t with this. The phone holder is extremely tight and it disrupt my live streams when I’m trying to take it off.
"This item is very cheaply made the remote is the worse and broke the first day, their customer service was good though"
Works ok only problem the things that keep it tight don’t stay tight
Easy to fall over when extended.
"Good design, worked great the first time I used it. However, since using it it tips over and will not hold my phone straight. It’s like the top part that holds the phone doesn’t tighten enough. Disappointed"
decent item. only bad is that you cant much adjust the tilt on the camera holder.
Great tripod. Nice and durable. Like how tall it gets. Only downside is the remote. It’s pretty cheap. It was working fine but stopped working a week after use. I’d recommend it. Maybe I just got a bad remote.
"The remote door does not close to the battery is not in contact to work. I can't figure out how to fix it so I am going to return it. I was able to hold it down and it paired fine and did work, but that isn't practical at all. And since it is a great feature, I don't want to keep just the tripod without it.  And the tripod seems fine.Like most stands or tripods, the clamp is tight (a good thing) but a little tricky to put the phone in when it is in a case is used and it is wider.Not sure if I wish to reorder or look elsewhere...."
I liked that it was tall and easy to deal with
"The tripod itself is easy to use, the height of the tripod is great, the little remote is handy, and the small travel bag for it is useful also. However, this product is too cheaply made for your cash to be used on. I only used mine once and left it safely in my room for a few nights. I tried it out again to film and it fell apart immediately due to some plastic piece inside of the tripod breaking in half. I’d love the product but the cheap price is too good to be true and has a chance of breaking for reasons out of your control."
Liked nice light extendable 64' tripod.  Simple to use Liphisy.  Didn't like spring loaded jaws for phone holder.  Very difficult to open and insert phone.  Other tripods have easy to use screw based adjustable jaws.
"Easy to adapt to take with you, too useful to record."
"The remote broke *literally* the first time I tried to use it.  It wasn't mistreated, worked fine for half an hour, then the button got wedged and wouldn't depress.No tilt on the tripod is a letdown as well."
Clip won't hold onto my galaxy s22
"The tripod I ordered is not what I got. It it NOT the one in the picture, did not come with a clicker, and does not stay upright no matter what I do. The one that came is 24 inches tall and the feet are only 3 inches, so it just falls right over and cannot stand. Do not buy this product."
"The shutter remote doesn’t work, it’s cheap. Changed the battery, it never pairs. Ever."
"The first time I got the tripod out of the package to use it, the Bluetooth remote was broken.  The button was pushed in and there was no way to get it back out. The tripod itself worked fine, but I wasn’t able to use it because I needed the remote to snap photos :("
"I got my finger stuck between my phone and the extender for less than a second, I bled for over two hours and had to get stitches in my finger.  The camera also doesn’t move up and down so you’re very limited with movement. Overall, not the best product."
Both Friend and I tried several times to use this. I considered returning it because the spring to hold the phone snaps close on your fingers before you can put the phone in. I only used it one time because of the difficulty to get the phone holder.
Dislike the bulkiness.  I did not use the item.
Item connected for one use and never connected again. Does not come up in Bluetooth settings as an option to connect to. Waste of money.
"This was initially a great purchase, but after a month the remote stopped working."
Its cheaply made. Its junk. It fell apart immediately. Save your money.
"Pretty good, but remote did not work :/"
The tripod aspect works perfect- no issues there- but the Bluetooth button to take photos literally only lasted a few times. Of course I didn’t know this was going to be the case so when I was about to use it for the 5th time it wouldn’t work - very embarrassing! I tried changing out the battery but the cover won’t come off so now I have just a tri pod stand for a phone with no button which is the whole reason why I purchased it in the first place
"The tripod itself appears like it is sturdy and is quality-made. But what I have an issue with is the phone holder. No matter what I did, my phone just kept popping out. I took my case off and it still kept popping out from the pressure of the holder. I ended up losing my phone because the holder couldn’t hold my phone properly….. so this is the most expensive tripod I’ve ever owned"
"Don’t waste your money. I immediately returned it. I can tell the phone holder wouldn’t last more than a few uses. Overall, just poorly made, cheap junk."
"I bought this trípode and barely have been using it, the remote control is not working any more, the button gets stuck, also, the trípode doesn’t stay still! Terrible product!"
CAUTION the slightest wind will tip it over. The shutter worked good the stand is very flimsy but works  for simple shots. Definitely not for a pro photographer. we had 5-7 mph winds and I had to secure it down.
The remote on off swith is plastic and broke after the 3rd time using
Tripod is sturdy but remote won’t work on iPhone 12 and 13. Garbage! Would not recommend if you’re looking for a shutter remote for iPhone
Trash! Arrived missing essential parts. I hate I missed the return time frame $20 wasted. No stars if I could.
My product came with 2 missing items that I would love to have by the way
Awful quality of remote
Can’t return as we were on vacation. Remote clicker stuck the second time we used it :(
takes very little to tip over tripod ... legs could have been a little longer for stability
"Website looked good, but phone holder very awkward and single pole tripod not stable … also remote didn’t work?"
"Just tripod, not camera stand and no remote was included in the box"
Barely had this for not even a month and it already broke
I haven’t used it and is already damage
Came apart as soon as I took it out of the box. Haven’t even used it once
"Very unhappy, didn't get the Bluetooth remote with it."
"Returning now, remote is not working"
"This is my first tripod for a cell phone, so I can only compare it with the ones I used to use with full sized cameras. This one is considerably lighter duty. The footprint is not very wide, and at extension it becomes increasingly shaky. The camera stabilization in my iPhone will probably limit the effect, but it’s a bit disconcerting, and more of a factor on a windy day, or bouncy floors.  The stand is otherwise sturdy, with easy to use and firm locks for each section. It collapses to a nice small package. Unfortunately, you have to take the camera holder off to fit the stand into the carry bag, and there is no dedicated spot for either the holder, or the remote.The standard 1/4 threaded peg is a bit fussy to use, and the plastic tilt head screw holds the tilt in notched increments rather than infinite positions.  The camera holder is very thick plastic and a bit clunky. The spring that holds the phone in place is quite strong, and it makes getting the phone in place somewhat awkward. The holder looks like it has a slot for an external flash attachment, but the instructions don’t mention it.  The camera holder, while crude and bulky, can be used with other standard tripods and supports, which is handy. The phone clamp rotates 360 degrees on what appears to be a pivot that can be tightened with a knurled  knob, but the knob doesn’t seem to turn. I’m afraid to use too much force for fear it will break. The friction is currently sufficient to hold the clamp in place anyway.  No mention of it in the instructions.  The instructions are minimal and not very helpful, especially when it comes to the remote. The remote seems pretty terrible. Pairing and re-pairing with Bluetooth was no problem, but what happens when I push the button is quite variable and inconsistent. Sometimes nothing happens, sometimes it starts a video, even though the camera is set to still (a longer press seems to make that more likely). Sometimes the button is very touchy - barely brushing it takes a picture (or three). Sometimes there seems to be a delay. Very frustrating, and completely unacceptable.  I realize that this is a rather low-end device, but that’s no excuse for the lousy instructions and flaky remote. I’m disappointed."
I got this tripod mostly to have something to set my phone on for group photos when family comes over. It works okay. The BT shutter is handy to have so I don’t have to set a timer in my camera app.It folds down fairly compact. I like the thumb locks vs the twist-style for tightening sections. I wish the feet were more adjustable for uneven terrain. The phone holder works okay and rotates for portrait and landscape shooting. The spring is strong.I wish there was room for the phone holder in the travel bag.
It doesn’t turn and it doesn’t allow you to make the adjustments your need for the shots
It broke as soon as I opened it
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The Liphisy 66"" Tripod is a good beginner tripod at an affordable price.Pros:Folds away easily into its carrying bagEasy to adjust heightTension grip cell phone holder that can easily hold an iPhone 15 Pro Max with a caseRemote control that can shoot a photo or video (to start recording a video, simply press and hold the capture button. The video will stop recording once you release the button).Cons:Okay stability indoors on tile and carpet.My tripod fell over twice outdoors on a pea gravel driveway, and the lawnThe biggest con is that the phone mount only adjusts forward and back (180 degrees). If you want to swing the camera to the side (horizontally), you'll need to pick up the entire tripod and rotate it... which is a bit annoying considering that it's not very stable to start with.Overall, I am very underwhelmed with this tripod. In my opinion, the best item out of this kit was the remote control. This tripod will do in a pinch if you need something to hold your phone - but there are better tripods out there."
"It’s great for the price if you need a cheap tripod to beat up but if you want a sturdy tripod, this is not for you. I toss this in my travel bags because it’s light and fits well but I don’t expect it to hold ready with my heavier lenses on"
"A bit flimsy. The vertical post tends to wobble a bit at full extension. Adequate for my light iPhone. But definitely not for heavier cameras. With the obvious flimsiness, not too confident that it will last long. But you get what you pay for."
"For the price this is great, however you get what you pay for.  If you have a small camera then this will likely work just fine but if you are trying to mount something larger or heavier on it then I would buy a different one.  I have a spotting scope for hunting and wanted to set up a tripod in my living room to mount the scope to look out the window across the fields.  This tripod will hold the scope, but to try to clamp the scope in position so it won't move in order view an animal in the field I find it hard to do.  Once you have it clamped and let go the weight of the scope will cause the tripod clamps to either flex or slip and you lose your position.  Obviously a much more expensive tripod made for a spotting scope would be the answer to solve this problem, but I was looking for a cheaper option.  If you are using this to mount a normal camera then it will likely be fine for your application."
"Purchased this as a mount for a spotting scope used for long distant observations.  It is not steady enough for a moderately powerful optical device.  Probably great for photography indoors, but choose differently if long distance viewing is your interest."
"The legs are a bit stiff, but when you extend it, it's a perfect eye level height, and I like the colour"
I didn’t get a bag with the tripod.
Works ok but not very sturdy.
"We needed a tripod in a pinch because we couldn't find ours after moving and this seems like it would work and was fairly inexpensive.  There isn't anything wrong with it perse it's just cheap and doesn't have all the functionality we were looking for, but if you are looking for something basic that will do the job this will get you by."
"I guess the tripod is ok, it’s very light, and obviously cheaply made.  But, the mounting plate is wobbly (for my camcorder) and that’s a deal breaker.  Returning."
Got a better one as soon as I could
"Be warned that this cannot hold still a camera at any angle other than straight forward. It can shoot at 90 degrees, especially close up. But it isn't able to hold still an upward angle or a long zoom for even a second. This is why pro tripods are much more expensive unfortunately."
"As for this tripod, it's not what one needs for an expensive professional grade mirrorless digital camera. It's fine for many consumer grade cameras. Three stars for this tripod."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Very lightweight. Do not rely on it for heavier lenses or cameras. Swivel up and down is herky jerky, but side to side is okay. Telescoping legs stay put but will bend with any weight. Great for backpacking with lighter weight camera setups."
"I have been a run of the mill character dabbling with video and camera equipment here and there for at least 10 years. Nothing serious, I mean I have owned a number of compact cameras and 3 or 4 video cameras, all run of the mill consumer items. For different activities and at one time or another I have also had different accessories to go along. One thing that most anyone can justify is owning a tripod, and I have owned a number of cheap tripods over the years. But these cheap tripods fit the bill for my needs at the time. Recently I purchased the most expensive camera I have ever owned, which is still just an entry level basic DSLR. (Nikon D5300). I ordered this stand with the camera, and I was dismayed from the moment that I unboxed it. The Nikon is only a $900 camera and lens, but that is still way too much money to go setting on this stand. Aside from the fear I have of the possibility that the the shoe might accidentally get sprung out of its seat, stability is not this tripods strong suite when you are trying to take pictures. This tripod is suitable for compact cameras, internet cams, maybe small video recorders, handy cam type stuff. This stand IS NOT suitable for even the cheapest entry level DSLR cameras. If you are going to spend $600 to $1400 on an entry level camera setup, you owe it to yourself to buy a decent tripod. Something in the $100 - $150 range at least. I ordered a Manfrotto mono pod and will likely get a proper Tripod a bit later on.I was about to ship this stand back for a refund the same night it came when I found a job for it at which it excels and makes it well worth the price.I mounted my external flash on it and it is perfect. The tripod gives you the ability to hold the flash in nearly any position you could ever want. (For a total armature). You don't need to worry about vibrations or anything else when all its doing is sitting quietly in a corner holding your Flash. As well, it's a pretty darn good Mic stand as well. My rode Mic pro mounts to it as well and for that reason, I think I am actually going to order a second one for the flash and the Mic. What makes this tripod so excellent for these duties is precisely because they ARE so cheap. If you need a fast cheap way to hold  multiple flashes, and maybe a mic or two, it's hard to see how you could get anything better for the price.Compared to other tripods in this price category, (I have owned a few over the years), this one is actually a pretty good. I can't say that its the BEST of the cheap stands on the market, but it is certainly better than all but maybe one other stand that I have owned, (for cheap stands).I would say this stand is suitable as I said previously, for small compact cameras, net cams, small handy cam type video cameras, external flash's and mic's. This tripod will give you some pretty good flexibility. However this is not the stand you want for even entry level DSLR camera and video equipment. So,,,,4 stars for small consumer products, 4.5 stars for external flashes and mics, 1 star for it's advertised 6.6 lbs capacity for cameras and Video equipment. If you average those starts out, I think a 3 star overall rating is fair."
"This is a super lightweight tripod… and it feels like it. With my DSLR on it, it’s a bit wiggly at the joints and the first time I tried to use it, I was not at all confident my camera wasn’t going to tip. It would likely be fine for flat floor indoor use with a lighter weight camera, but I was not able to use it outdoors on even slightly uneven ground with any confidence. If you love your camera, get a better tripod than this one. If you don’t care about what you’re putting on top of this, then cheap is fine."
I liked the tripod very light weight however arrived without the bag and was missing the piece to attach the camera to the tripod???
Not bad for fifteen bucks and has all the functions you will need in a smallish tripod but it can be hard to use with heavier devices or when I am trying to pan and scan for birds. Would be good for portraits with a smallish camera or for an application where you don't use the functionality much beyond holding something up.  For an iphone or light ring it is all you may need. For a small spotting scope it may work for target shooting but less so for birding.
"pic #1 the new Amazon tripod locking peice,pic #2 my old one in the center"
"If you plan on using this tripod for portraits or still shots, set the head and forget it would be ok, but if you are trying to track something like the moon or something in nature I would not recommend this tripod.I was using a Sony A350 with a 200mm MC lens, nothing too heavy."
"I find the best use for this is with the legs retracted fully and sitting on a desk or countertop for hands-off support of a very very lightweight camera. Price is cheap. So is the item but you really do get what you pay for. This is an extremely flimsy platform for any camera and would be appropriate only for use indoors or in a very stable location, free of winds or any possibility of disturbance. The camera can not, repeat, can not be moved or adjusted while filming ever. The controls are for adjustment, not for movement during filming. Once set, and if not disturbed, this is a way to have hands-off support of a lightweight camera and is not for more traditional tripod use in camera operations. Notice in the description they warn the buyer not to use this device for an expensive or heavy camera. It is flimsy even by lightweight tripod standards - BUT if all you need is a way to set and hold a light video camera steady on a shot, possibly on a table or countertop, then this is a low cost and very portable tool."
"The tripod itself is very nice, but the attachment/mount area is extremely flimsy."
"It’s light, it’s very adjustable and seems like it would be worth the money I paid for is. Needed it for an event. Well it showed  up with no quick release plate. No way to attach my camera to it. I can send it back, which costs me my time and gas. If I have to go out to return it I may as well just go buy one on that same trip. Also they don’t seem to know if they sell this part separately. Which would be a game changer because instead of returning the entire thing, they could just send you the part and people would buy extras. But what do I know…sigh. Also I just know I’ll be waiting for a new one and it won’t have the part either."
"Really nice tripod with one issue which reduced it from 5 stars to 3 stars.  The screw that holds the shoe locking lever in place is an 8x32 screw with roughly a 1/4"" shoulder on it.  Since the shoulder on the screw is of a larger diameter than the threaded end, it bottoms out on the tripod head and the shoulder and acts like an axle for the locking lever to pivot on.  The problem with the screw is the shoulder is a hair too long which means the lever floats to much and doesn't lock the shoe down tight enough (the shoe wobbles).  On my tripod the threads on the screw were stripped and the locking lever wouldn't stay locked in place.  Apparently when the screw was tightened at the factory the shoe locking lever wouldn't snug the shoe down tightly so they over tightened the screw striping the treads.  Even if the shoulder had been the correct length there still would have been another problem.  The screw threads weren't long enough to catch the nylon locking ring in the base of the nut the screw threaded into.  Since the screw threads don't reach the nylon locking ring in the base of the nut, moving the locking lever would have allowed the lever to loosen the screw over time.I got around the stripped screw by using a longer 8x32 screw (w/o the shoulder) to snug down the lever so that the shoe would lock down in place but not so tight the lever couldn't pivot.  Since the screw threads do engage the nylon locking ring in the nut the lever movement can't loosen the screw.  I also used a nylon washer between the screw head and the locking lever to reduce the friction.  Not as pretty as the factory set up but it is more secure.  You can see the new screw and nylon washer in the in the shoe locking lever along with the factory screw laying on the tripod head.  in the second picture you can see that the screw goes completely through the lock nut.The shame of this situation is a 5 star product is reduced to a 3 star product due to a minor oversight in design which posed a real danger to anything mount on the tripod.  I use the tripod with my chronograph for checking the spec's on my reloads.  Due to it's length (roughly 12"" long) I needed the shoe to mount securely in the tripod and be stable."
Good product for the coast. Perfect for the occasional use would definitely look for an upgrade if I needed to use it everyday.
"Decided to take the gamble and ordered this.  The adage ""you get what you pay for"" truly does apply here.  The construction is very cheap.  The tubing is extremely thin-walled.  It wouldn't take much to bend them!  The whole thing is very loosely put together and not very stable.  I would not use this thing outside if there was even the slightest breeze.  Any sort of wind loading will push it over.  I sure as hell wouldn't put my expensive phone or even more expensive camera on this and trust it to not fall over and damage something!The original tripod I bought probably 10 years ago was at least ten times as heavy, MUCH higher quality of materials and overall just a MUCH BETTER piece of equipment.  Unfortunately I lost that and had to order this pile of sh..tuff.  That one was not that expensive, maybe $50.Save your money and move along!  If you are looking for a tripod to hold something worth more than $50, look elsewhere!!"
"I dont need a super stable tripod for my intended purpose, however it would have been since if this cheap, floppy tripod at least came with a second adapter plate.Probably going to send it back"
Rotating camera from side to side is a little rough. Otherwise works great and easy to set up
"The legs are quite wobbly if you use a DSLR or it's windy. Very flimsy build. I have to take every picture with a timer, press shoot, then let go of my camera and hope that it stops wobbling before the shutter clicks. Would not recommend for anything but maybe a stationary GoPro video setup where you're not touching the camera while it's doing its thing..."
"20170723It's OK. That about the best I can say for this little tripod. It has features that mostly stand out as detriments. First, the strap is adjustable, but it allows for so little adjustment, it might as well have just been fixed in length. Second, it has a quick release plate, but the plate is not easy to attach to the camera, and the plate is wobbly when attached to the tripod. The overall effect is to make the attachment wobbly, and inconvenient to use. It would have been better to just have had a normal post to attach to the tripod with.The tripod is very light, but also short. That could be an advantage in a few situations, but mostly, it is just short. I took it out for an early morning shoot Saturday. The wobbliness was even more noticeable with a camera and telephoto lens. For the price, I expect I will keep it around, but it will almost certainly be relegated to either holding a light camcorder, or a speed light.I will be taking it with me on my upcoming tour of New Mexico, and I will update this review if anything more comes up.20170813 I'm back from my trip through New Mexico. The tripod proved to be far less useful than expected.  The ""quick release plate"" was probably the worst feature of the tripod.  As noted previously, it is very wobbly. What's worse, it is quick release, if you don't want to change anything. The attachment is very small, the metal flap for screwing the bolt into the camera or other device is tiny. Overall, the tripod is barely worth having. Having had it for more than two weeks now, I've yet to really find a good use for it.  For the most part, this tripod is now used for holding a generic flash clamp.  It is also reasonably useful for holding a very small camcorder.  Nothing heavy.Recap:  this tripod is very light, but not practical, because of the wobbly ""quick disconnect"" plate. Amazon could've made a serviceable tripod if they had not tried to add so many features on to the tripod.Amazon, I suggest you ditch the ""quick disconnect"" plate, and replace it with a traditional thumbscrew.  Form over function has no place in photography equipment."
"I bought this tripod 5 years ago.  I used it rarely, only for occasion when I wanted to do some video with my phone and I needed to do something else while making my video.  It wasn't the most solid or sturdy I've ever used (3 star instead of 4 or 5) but it got the job done.  It is lightweight, which is good news/bad news.  Good:  It's lightweight and easy to carry around and work with.  Bad:  It's not super solid.I needed it today, but couldn't find it.  I'm sure I loaned it to someone long ago and now it's gone forever.  So, I planned to simply buy it again.  We all know what's happened with infation.  This seemed a bit extreme, even for 5 years.  Was 24, now 36.  Literally plus 50 pct.  Ah, well.  It's a decent product -- at least it was 5 years ago.  I'll buy it again unless I can find something else is better and less expensive."
"You're getting what you're paying for here. There's going to be some issues that you will notice. It will feel very lightweight and you'll notice that there may be some scratches in the paint of the tripod legs from the piece in the middle that locks in the little notch at the very bottom. It does extend, but using this feature feels cheap. You can feel the metal kind of grind a bit. There's that sound and feeling that makes you think that if you keep using it, it probably won't last too long or that you have to be really careful.Now, being careful is something to absolutely take note of. It can be turned around for simple panning shots, it can be pointed down to be used to film something on a table, so it does a lot of things that are very nice things to have with something as cheap feeling as this. I question the raving reviews that this thing is getting in all honesty. You have to learn the limits of the tripod. Remember how you can point the tripod down so you can film something on a table if need be? Be careful when twisting the knob. Going too far and the screw will fall out. Along with the other piece at the very end. Of course I didn't lose it, but this has happened to me. The same thing will happen with the other knobs on the tripod. There's no limit, so you can just accidentally have it fall apart on you. You can even unscrew the handle! There's even some glue left over on it from being put together. I wouldn't be surprised if you could accidentally pull the legs out just trying to extend the height of it. But that seems to be the only part so far that this can't really happen with. Only time will tell.I've been harsh on this product. And for good reason. Because in my experience, AmazonBasics is the go to for very nice products with better build quality than this tripod for the price. I guess I should've bought the slightly more expensive model despite not really needing the extra height? I'm not sure.But if you're looking to just stand something up and have it stationary, that's fine. It really does that just fine. Even the height extension does work better than everything else, and I guess after experiencing some of the issues with the other features that this happens to have that I completely didn't expect to have issues with, I'll be only using it for that same purpose as well."
It is flimsy... I guess you get what you pay for.
"Good but too fragile.  Once setup with a small pair of binoculars mounted, another family member was walking by and accidentally bumped into it, and one of the legs broke.  And that was the end of it.  Replaced it with the 60 inch version, much sturdier, and that has worked out fine for many months.  Yes, very cheap, but too fragile for any but the most gentle usage."
"I needed a tripod quickly (and cheaply). This worked out for the event I needed it for, but I do not feel that it would stand up to repetitive use and movement"
"Great tripod, easy to travel with, but the crank used to increase the height of the tripod broke. It looks like a part that can be easily replaced but I cannot find a hand crank anywhere."
Kind of cheap and flimsy but you get what you pay for. I got a Joilcan for a little more $ and it is way way better!
When turning the camera on the tripod it makes the picture shaky.
"This is the lightest large tripod out there at 1lb. Based on my research. However for me I needed to replace the head With a Small Ballhead (see previous reviewer instructions) and as a previous reviewer stated, I marked the legs to extend 1” Shorter on each segment and I added an eye bolt to the bottom of the center column So I can hang some weight on it. The purpose for me was to have a tripod lighweight enough that I can take on a week long backpacking trip and it did that. I took it without any mods and when I came back made the mods.  As it is, it works but the mods make it better for me. I feel the leg section clamps may break easily so I am careful.  My hike was pretty dusty and sandy so i could feel the grit getting in the legs and will make a point to keep the legs clean.  I have a Sony Rx100 on it. I used to carry a self sized Joby gorilla pod for a long time but this is almost the same weight and so much more versatile especially for group photos on my hikes.  I won’t hesitate to put this in my pack in the future.  I know i can’t dig it into the ground or snow as the legs won’t take it but it is weighs a pound with the head!  Anything heavier than this i just won’t carry on a backpack trip and i have a Benro etc and they are just too heavy at over 2 lbs.  We will see how long this lasts but at this price and weight it lasted me through one week in the backcountry and has paid for itself. For any other purpose such as a day hike, I have plenty of high end tripods, to choose but for backpacking this is the one i will pack and not regret."
"After first use I kept the base that screws directly onto the camera on the camera between putting the stand in the bag and taking it out of the bag a week later the lever that holds the camera in place and usually is resting against the base that attaches to the camera had snapped off. The camera wont stay in place on the stand without the lever. I managed to figure out how to manipulate the spring when I place the lever over it and get the camera to stay on but overall the quality of the product is not very strong. It is very light weight which makes it easy to carry. It's so light though that a good gust of wind can blow it right over if you're not nearby. It has a level built in so you can make sure your camera is level. I would appreciate directions for how to tighten specific features since loosening everything still makes swiveling left to right jerky and tightening everything still doesn't prevent it from moving up and down. No directions were delivered with mine. I'm still able to use it but it needs to come with a warning label regarding how fragile it is and directions to make sure the lever doesn't break off and/or to allow the user to get the most out of the various settings that are possible. Without these it is easy to accidentally turn it into a piece of junk, especially if your used to or expecting sturdier equipment."
"When I have my video camera attached and I try and slightly move the handle to scan or pan a view, it wobbles and the movement translates to a jiggle in the video. This is for very light weight cameras."
"You get what you pay for. OK for picture, no way for video."
"I just got into DSLR photography and everyone advises you to get an expensive tripod. Personally I think that's a load of crap. When it comes down to it a tripod is a tripod and this is a great buy. With 2 separate leveling bubbles to level the stand and a decent swivel this tripod is a steal for $20. I'm 6'1"" and when fully extended this tripod brings the viewfinder on my Nikon D5100 at almost exactly eye-level so it works good for me. No this isn't going to be the strongest most sturdy tripod you'll ever find but personally I dont throw my tripod into rocks or try to tackle it so it works just fine for me. The legs extend effortlessly and the locks on the legs seem to be of decent quality as I haven't had them slip or sink down at all. Also comes with a nice handle for moving it around while you're shooting. The top extension does drop a little if it's not tightened right away if your camera is heavy or you're using a heavy lens. But that's not really a big issue for me as I crank it up and just tighten it right away. If you're super picky this might be a problem for you but in all reality it's no big deal. The feet of the tripod have nice pivots to get an even stance when on the ground.Overall I give this tripod a 4 out of 5 stars. I'd give it a 4.5 if I could. It's a good tripod for the price you pay but if you're picky and a perfectionist with your tripod this isn't the one for you. However, If you're new to photography or just want a cheap tripod that'll do the job and do it well this is a good deal for you. Can't beat it for $20.Update: Well... I now see what people are speaking about. Slowly but surely different pieces started to give out on me. I dropped it down to 3 stars just because it did what I needed it to do and it was cheap. Although I will say you're best off getting something that will last. Lesson learned."
"I have two sizes of AmszonBasics tripods and both of them far exceed all expectations I had.  I'm not an expert in tripods but the quality and the strength and steadiness make them appear to have cost five times what I paid for them.  I use the larger one to support a large brass catcher for my rifle and I use the smaller one for my spotting scope.I'm not a person to gush over products and I'm often disappointed with them but in this case these tripods should both cost much more than Amazon sells them for.Update 9/5/18Unfortunately I have to update my initial review after using the tripod very lightly between five and ten times.  I use it to support a brass catcher that has never exceeded 2-3 pounds and it continues to work very well for this, however the issue that’s appeared is that two of the three legs will not fold flat against the center post without popping out at the hinge therefore the tripod cannot be inserted into the carrying case.  I had noticed from the beginning that folding the tripod was somewhat difficult because the piece which holds the legs and which slides up and down the center tube when it’s folded and unfolded didn’t slide very easily and would often bind thus requiring a bit of force to fold.  It’s quite possible that something inside the hinged area where each leg meets the upper piece might have broken due to this force.  Regardless of how few times I’ve used the tripod, it’s over a year old and can’t be returned for replacement so I’m currently deciding whether to purchase a better tripod or repurchase the same one and be extremely cautious when folding and unfolding it.  It continues to function as it should but the inability to completely fold it and insert it in the carry bag makes it awkward and difficult to transport unless I let the legs pop out and then pop them back in before using it."
"Very very very lightweight. But that makes it concerning that it can fall over. Feels very cheap in the hand, but i guess it can do indoor photography well. Not super tall (im 5'5"" and its about to my chest , maybe a little less). For the price though, good stuff"
Ive gone through several of these over the last few years. they seem to break easily at certain stress points from moderate use.  keep this in mind and dont plan on keeping it for more than a year or 2 if you use it regularly.
"I suggest to stay within the 80% of weight limit. (3.5 lbs) It's light weight and compact, perfect choice if you travel.The mount head has many plastic parts it is not as sturdy as I wanted it to be. The camera drift slowly in some angles."
"Purchased this to use with a Canon DSLR camera; unfortunately, it's a very lightweight tripod, and is not very stable with a heavier camera/lens combo.  If you are in a pinch and want something to use occasionally with a light camera, it ight be suitable.  But if you are using a heavier camera/lens setup, you may want to look elsewhere."
It does not come with the top Mount for your Phone or camera. It also requires much more adjustments to get the height just right compared to my last tripod
"I was actually impressed with this tripod, as it is my 1st, and it got the job done. However, after one year of moderate use the thing LITERALLY started falling apart! I am anal with all my camera equipment and like to keep it in good shape. I never dropped the product, or anything crazy just regular ""tripod use."" Two of the aluminum bars that are attached to the tripod lost a screw and magically fell and now the tripod cannoit balance properly without it. Despite this deficiency, I still went along and used it because, hey the tripid is cheap in price. The last straw was when one of the tripod legs literally snapped off while I was capturing a long exposure. Luckily, I caught my D750 before it fell face 1st , my 24-70mm would have likely shattered! This is unacceptable quality. Anytime a product literally breaks apart through light use is a huge red flag for me, as it should for anyone. I am a loyal Amazon customer and RARELY write reviews, but after my camera almost broke because of this cheap quality product I felt obligated to write a review.. Amazon if you are reading this I demand a product replacement.Buyers beware of possible tripod leg snapping, it could cost you alot if your camera or expensive lens breaks!*Update.  Amazon replaced the product free of charge when I called customer service to complain, the operator even told me I could even keep the broken tripod ( I threw it away immediately). The only problem is that about 2 weeks after that I got an email from Amazon stating that I need to return the broken tripod or I would get charged for the new one. I called Amazon back and let them know what was happening and they fixed it (again). I have upgraded my score to 3 stars and not 1 only because Amazon replaced it for free, it was still a headache, but for $23 your not gonna get pro quality tripod. So for the price, I suppose your getting what you pay for."
"I am an outdoor photographer,  so maybe I need something a little more rugged."
Like the size of the tripod but the sturdiness leaves a lot to be desired.
"I wanted to use it as a base for a model rocket launch pad but it was too flimsy for that. My larger rocket (about 4' tall, 12 oz in weight) wanted to pull the latch out of the tripod head. Just too much torque due to the length of the rocket. Seems it would be a good tripod for small cameras or cell phones."
"It's kind of flimsy in the field but lightweight enough to do the job when all you need is stabilization, such as shooting panoramas or even timelapse ""selfies"" to document a work procedure in stills or video unattended. Two of the rivet-like pins came loose after only a couple of weeks, but they can be replaced with #4-40 bolts if you use aircraft style safety nuts to keep from losing those, too. I'd get a heavier tripod for where rock-solid stability is required due to wind loading or similar things that would shake a camera, or with a longer lens than about 250mm. It jiggles too much in the slightest breeze for time exposures through a telephoto lens, but it gives nice night exposures with shorter lenses if shielded from wind.Good for a lightweight tripod to carry where a high dollar heavy one would be too cumbersome, where if you break or bend it, it's not a huge loss to replace it. It's probably excellent with a lighter weight camera and lens assembly. With the legs fully retracted, it's great on a workbench to photograph repair or assembly procedures when writing a manual. The legs have enough different extension capability to level and stabilize the camera in rugged mountainous terrain to get those special shots that might be impossible to do handheld. Combined with the remote control wireless or wired shutter triggers, you can shoot pro quality scenes on a very low end budget.If this one finally breaks beyond repair, I'll probably get another similar to this because I'm not ready yet to invest in another heavy Bogen tripod that someone who doesn't always look before he backs up an SUV might run over like happened to the last one. I could buy more than ten of these for what it would have cost to replace the Bogen."
"PROS - This is a basic set up tripod. It does what its meant to do and at this price its good for it. It does has some good craftmanship, again, for the price, and its lightweight. Very easy to use and carry around.CONS - Heres where I get specific....if you want to do some telescopic , ""zoomed"" pictures its a mess of a tripod. Its unnoticeable when you are shooting regular photos, but once you start to try to get zoomed pictures or use lenses, you will notice how flimsy the tripod is, which it in itself, its contradictory, cause I purchased it for exactly that same reason. I needed to stabilize my camera enough to get good crisp ""zoomed"" pictures. Instead, you will have a super hard time centering the camera into a zoomed object. Any small movement you do trying to adjust the camera will JOLT the tripod violently and you will lose your centered object and will have to re-adjust. it will become an endless cycle of centering, shooting, re-adjusting, getting your bearings, closing your fists in anger, then repeat... I tried loosening the adjustment bolts, creating counterbalances and even lubricating the pieces to see if they will move more smoothly, but it did not work. I guess since its just plastic, against plastic, held together by plastic bolts, its just how it will forever be.In conclusion, the Tripod is super effective if you just need something lightweight to do some regular shooting. Its great to take into a hike, to shoot some landscapes, etc. But if you need to take photos with thelephoto lenses I suggest you look for somethign a bit more sturdy."
This was not one of my favorite stands because if you hold anything heavy on it it will not hold up so be careful when buying this product
It works but really flimsy not great quality
Love that it has its own carry bag. The stability isn't very good on uneven ground. It does have a easy to use and comfort about it.
"- cheaply made, two legs retract easily, one leg has to be pulled firmly into place.very flimsy, and  bit unstable due to it's thin design.+ lightweight with bag"
"I have slightly mixed feelings on this tripod, but credit where it's due, Amazon made something pretty usable for the price.Pros: First and foremost, all the parts fit together well. The aluminum and plastic feel sturdy and of as good quality as can be expected for a micro-budget item like this. Even with the legs fully extended, there is no noticeable wiggle in any of the joints. The whole thing is lightweight, and it comes with a carrying case that I hadn't even noticed was included.Cons: All the screw joints and similar have that cheap feeling of imprecision. They do their job fine, but they either grind here or there or don't slide smoothly. Unfortunately the pan handle on mine also came bent; not so much as to be unusable, but enough to be noticeable. When I unscrewed it to see the extent of the damage, I nearly lost the nut that it attaches to as it fell out - it's just lodged in a small slot, rather than being encapsulated in any reasonable way. I also wish the legs spread a few inches wider given the height and weight, but at this point I'm just nitpicking.At the end of the day, for the money, this is miraculous. In all honesty, I don't know how they made a full fledged tripod at this price that isn't literally one-time-use. I didn't need this for anything more than a quick way to hold a point-and-shoot, so for those needs, it performs admirably. If you really needed all the features that are avaliable here and you needed them to work flawlessly, you're looking at $200 or more usually, so at 1/10 of that, I can't complain. I'm leaving this at 3 stars because I think that's representative of it's general quality, despite the value for money."
Does what it's supposed to
"At full extension, the sturdiness of the tripod is questionable, especially with the thin legs. But at ~$16 USD, it isn't too bad."
"Received this tripod as a free gift, and for a complimentary item, it's surprisingly decent (Why did the guy refuse a free pencil?He heard it had no point, just like some free items!). However, the build quality is notably cheap. While it might suffice for smartphones, it lacks the stability needed for my mirrorless camera. Good for occasional use but not ideal for serious photography. You get what you pay for, even when it's a gift!"
I like it because it's lightweight. Cheap quality and materials. The auto release function doesn't work well and is constantly getting jammed.
"I loved this little tripod and used it to take video of my niece's wedding with my phone.  However, the second time I tried to use it, months later, one of the legs was stuck and would not open up, so I tugged on it and the bottom third of the leg fell off--whatever was holding it on to the rest of the tripod broke, making the whole thing unusable.  I know I should blame user error but I did not tug on it that hard.  So if I could rate it for durability, I would give it zero stars.  And I would buy another and try again (because I did really like it) but the current cost is above the amount I am willing to waste on something that does not last."
"Here's a short version of my review:Pros:Light but durableGreat for casual photography (family pictures, simple straightforward shots)Simple to useCons:Not the greatest for serious work (work that includes various heights/angles)Now here's my more detailed review of this productI'm currently a 3rd-year college student majoring in photography, and I've loved photo since I was in middle school. The only tripods I've ever used were the ones I've checked out from school (which can be a pain) and have always wanted a tripod for my own convenience.I also love Amazon, and thought, ""Oh man, why don't I just buy one off of Amazon?""So after browsing through the reviews of this product, I decided to order one. Now, I'm not saying I absolutely hate this tripod--it's a VERY good beginner tripod.But, for people who take their photo work on a more serious level (doing conceptual work and etc) and are looking for more versatility in their tripod... You can probably skip this purchase. Don't get me wrong, though! It's lightweight and considerably handy. I can definitely see myself taking this tripod out for a hike (and it includes a hook at the bottom for hooking on a sandbag or some other hookable weight) and it wouldn't weigh me down. I love that!But.. I was sincerely disappointed at the shallow length the three pegs extend out to. And I also wished that the height of the tripod would reach higher. All in all, great beginner tripod, but it's certainly not a tripod I would use for more professional or fine art work.(I also had to figure out how some of the tripod worked when I first got it. But after a few minutes and some patience, I understood it easily.)"
"The tripod is cheap. It feels nice, is very light, it will fullfill its use if you have a camera which is not heavy due to the objective, you can use it. However dont expect it to last if you use it heavy"
"I bought this for a gift.  I had ample time to test it before I gave it away.I consider this to be a starter tripod for someone new to photography to see if they would want a better tripod.  Good tripods are expensive.  Before buying an expenisve tripod, I wanted to see if the person to whom I gifted this item would even use a triopod.The tripod is stable if there is no wind.  It is stable if it is not in moving water.  It has a camera plate with a quick release.  It is easy to mount a camera to the plate and mount the camera to the tripod.One downside of the tripod is the stabilization device at the bottom that holds the three tripod feet apart.  This devide limits the use of the tripod.  For example, the tripod can’t be set with anything in the way, such as a rock.  Suppose that you have a pefect composition for a landscape photo if the camera on the tripod is placed just so, but the just so position is not possible, because there is an object in the way of the feet.  A tripod with no bottom hinderance would take care of this problem.  Disregarding this limitation, the tripod is okay for careful handling use.For the price, this tripod is fine.  (What would you expect for $21?). It does not have a robus build, so it needs to be handled with care.  It would be easy to strip a screw or break someting."
"I purchased 2 of these one for me and one for my girl, they’re fine if you’re just starting but maybe want to upgrade in the very near future, it’s honestly pretty cheap and if you’re just starting it’s fine but angling my camera just how I want it can be annoying, small tunings can turn this tripod to make your camera tilt further than what you wanted"
"This tripod is cheap and does the job (especially if you don’t need to adjust it very often) it may be a decent item to start with and I don’t necessarily regret the purchase.That being said,The leg adjusting plastic pieces feel like they are ready to break straight out of the package. Be EXTREMELY patient and careful with this cheap product.There is a little nub on the top that scratches up the bottom of my camera, which has little ridges. Not only is it annoying, it practically breaks off every time I use the tripod and isn’t long for this world. It also prevents me from closing the preview screen on my camera when it is fully mounted. I don’t totally know what it’s purpose is besides helping stabilize the camera in a mounted position maybe? It gives me anxiety and I hope it finished breaking off soon ha! It’s rare to want a product to break, but I think it will be more functional for me once it does.Bc of the price and weight, I don’t really regret buying this yet. I didn’t have very high expectations going in, so that helped.I bought this just to get comfy with how tripods work and the height range and stuff bc I’m a beginner. It’s a great way to acquaint yourself on the cheap if you are just starting out I think.I now feel like I could make a wiser choice when I upgrade to a higher quality product (they can be so expensive) so over all I think it was a good way to go."
It's not that stable if you have a heavy camera or a big lens on it. It's not the most stable tripod. If you're using the kit lens with your camera you're fine.
"Whether you're worried about theft or dropping it out of a boat, this tripod is definitely fit for the budget, but I mounted my chronograph on it and it is anything but stable or durable by feel. Small cameras and gopros, this is your ticket, but I wouldn't even put my canon T6 with a moderate lens on it. Better than nothing, get what you pay for. Legs slide out smoothly and have plenty of adjustment. Zero assembly out of the box, ready to use. Color and finish is all pretty good, locks and handles could be better but again, get what you pay for."
"The leg clamps are pretty thin, and made of a cheap plastic. Works for what I need it for, although I assume it will eventually break, which is okay because they are cheap, and I am not using it in the traditional way anyhow. The plastic that the clamps are made of is also used for the mount plate and what not, which as I already said is kinda cheesy. For those of you who will use this in the traditional way, the level is a bit hard to see, it's kind of tucked under a bit, and will be harder to see with the camera on. The panning / rotating lock-knobs are also cheesy plastic, but for $15 you can't beat it when you need it. The legs are kind of thin, wish they were thicker, but again... $15 so no real complaints. The legs are rounded instead of rectangular, rounded rectangular, triangular, or any other shape, so they will dent easy, and at some point start to bend and break easily. Legs could be straighter / sturdier (robust and solid) but again it's only $15 and it will definitely work for many applications. Cheap products mean cheap to replace!! Comes with carrying case, which is perfect for me. Not very sturdy for anything over a couple pounds. Try to keep it light, and be gentle. As long as you don't put anything heavy on it, and you are gentle and careful with it, you'll be fine. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a tripod but won't use it TOO much, or to some one who needs a stand type item and doesn't mind rigging something together to work for their needs, like me!"
Came with the spirit level piece missing. Doesn’t seem very durable. Will be returning. Overall seems ok though.
"The tripod is a decent size and  would be effective, but when you mount the camera on to it and try to move it from one side to the other or up and down, it does not move easily. The plastic levers are stuck and this is very frustating. A little more care from their design/production team, they can get rid of the problem. We couldn't use it and so had to assign someone to just hand-hold the camera and take videos and shots."
"This came missing the quick release adapter that attaches to the camera. We chose to keep it because we didn't want to spend much more and my husband could 3D print a replacement part, but it would be completely unusable otherwise. As far as the quality goes, it's about what I expected. It's not the most stable but not bad either. We bought it to hold our baby monitor camera while traveling and it worked perfectly for that."
I set my go pro up and do Timelapse's in my yard. Nothing crazy.  One of the black pieces/enclosures on the legs has slipped and now won't hold the leg in when retracted. So I've taped it.It's 20$ and 20$ quality really
"When this first came I fell in love: it is beautiful and lightweight and comes in a nifty carry case. Perfect price, too, because I just occasionally need a tripod for table-top shots and I'm far from being a professional photographer.Unfortunately, this has several major drawbacks, Number One being the finger-pinching, ouch-inducing locks on the legs that you have to open to adjust the height and close again to lock it. The only way to do this without getting a major cut or bruise is to hold the leg you're working on and position your fingers so that you pry the lock open without getting anywhere near the pivot point, which is difficult since it is less than a finger's width away. Meanwhile the rest of the tripod is falling over—bad news if the camera's attached. If you try to do this without holding the leg, you are probably going to get pinched. My hands are a bruised and cut -up mess from my first two sessions since the intuitive way to operate the locks is to put your hand over the lock and use your thumb to open it...one handed.The other major downer is that one leg doesn't fit in the top fitting so if I lift the thing off the ground to move it a few inches the entire leg assembly falls out, again causing the tripod to tip over and risk smacking the camera on the edge of a table. I had to put electrical tape on all these joints and I guess I'll have to take it off to disassemble the tripod so it will fit in the case.Buyers should also be aware that once you lock the camera in place, you can only pan left or right (with difficulty and with tipping the tripod). It does not pan up or down so the only way to do that is to adjust the legs...again, pinching and tipping.So I'm giving this 1 star for price and another for the appearance and case, but I find the tripod lacking in ease of use and basic functionality."
used tripod twice and then it broke.
"I make videos and take photos when i go on outdoor adventures, this tripod is not sturdy and heavy enough, especially when is windy or you're on a uneven surface like grass or dirt/rocks. Legs are weak and skinny. Almost broke my camera lens 4 times because the breeze pushed it. I think is good for indoor use only."
I gave this a shot because of the number of good reviews.  I do have to agree with several of the negative reviews about build quality.It is very light.It is easy to setup.The material is very thin and does not seem very sturdy.If you need a stand for cell phones or cheap point click cameras or camcorders this might not be a bad unit.  But if you have anything close to a DSLR this is definitely NOT a good idea for you.  I have concerns it will hold up very long under the weight/usage stress.To be fair I originally got this knowing I may have to return it but it was stated to be well built and very light by many people.
"Received my tripod today having gotten it the day expected.  I wanted to offer some initial findings in hopes of helping others to decide on this product.Positive: Very lightweight. Decent carrying case. I liked the simple snap-clip set up for the leg extension. Simply open the clip, pull leg to desired length, clip shut. Small, but decent, level about chest high. Easy swivel arm. A hook for possible weight if desired.  Just the right height for my 5' 3"" stature with room to spare.Negative: There are no instructions included with this item.  Be prepared to spend some time figuring out how everything works for set up.  Sounds like it should be easy but there are a number of adjustment knobs.  Speaking of knobs, as I was pulling the tripod out of the plastic protector, a knob fell to the floor.  It was the knob for the arm that rolls the upper rod to adjust the camera height.  I hope that made sense.  Important enough to send it back?  Probably, but I simply got out the super glue.  While this item is lightweight, that does equate to lower quality.  It's fine for me because I am not a professional and simply needed something for the few times I need a stationary tripod.  Consider the cost vs quality when purchasing.  The last thing I wish to note is the screw where the camera attaches seems shallow.  I had to work a bit to get the camera to attach properly before securing it with the appropriate knob.I hope this review helps.  Thank you."
"This Tripod is suppose to go up and down and side to side.The way this tripod is built, the up and down motion if fine and very smooth, but the same cannot be said about side to side motion.When I put a video camera on the tripod, I almost have to hold the tripod with one hand to stabilize it, and with my otherhand I have to move the camera handle to go side to side during any kind of sports activity.The manufactured product has too much resistance, and I have to exert force on my hand to move it, causing the movement to come tomove of a jerk..  I tried loosening the top plastic cap, but it is shut, no movement.  I can tell the plastic is put together too tightsince I am getting white plastic flakes from all the wear I cause while moving it side to side, or even trying to spin it aroundto loosen it.  It is November 2015, I had it for over 2 months, I hate this tripod.Last night I tried to record kids musical and as I was moving the tripod from side to side, I heard creaking sounds coming fromthe tripod assembly.  Stay away....Update on Nov 9th 2015I contacted the warranty department, and I have received a replacement in 2 days.. great service.After opening the new tripod, the swivel was still little rough from side to side.I decided to run manual regression test.. I spun the head left and right dozens of times, in circles....After this, the plastic shavings came out, and the swivel works with low pressure from the hand.I have attached 2 pictures to show the amount of shavings that have come out... it looks like the moldin the factory might need to be re-done....Update on March 13 2016One of the legs has come out from clamp socket.  I have manually pushed it in with some sweat and effort.It was working fine again, but with time, another leg has come out.I have to say this is a BASIC tripod at its best.  it will fall apart after 12 months of consistent usage."
"I'm disappointed that the crank handle broke off.  It's a nice, stable, lightweight tripod but the parts are plastic and easily damaged.Hey Amazon - can we get a replacement crank or other parts as they break?"
"Nope, don’t do it.  Pay more for something else, this thing makes me hate photography (and I love photography!).  Things won’t tighten that should tighten.  And getting decent angles is a nightmare.  It, it just makes me sad.  I’m finally biting the bullet and buying another one so I had to take the time to do a quick review to save y’all the same trouble (I with I’d read this very same review :)).  Think of the money it would have saved, just buying a better one the first time around?  Do that.  :)"
"I bought this tripod for filming fitness classes with an iPad. The price was tough to beat and it looked sturdy enough. Additionally, the health club I work for bought several of these units for the same purpose. As stated in the headline, this tripod is easy to use and is fairly lightweight. The one major issue with this tripod is that there is a flaw in the design on the legs - they easily break. The joint between the 2nd and final leg extension consistently fails after a short period of time. This has happened with every single one of the tripods at my health club and with my own. Every single one of them failed within the first 3 months. At the club, we now keep the tripods fully extended with the iPad's permanently mounted, but it is cumbersome to store and to carry to each of the studios as you can imagine. I recommend, that if you plan to use this item fairly regularly, go with something a little more expensive and durable. I am now purchasing another tripod (different manufacturer) to replace this one."
"I loved the weight and how this tripod works but sadly it is too loose.  The fittings don't get tight enough to keep the camera from moving all over the place.  When I am shooting bird photography the camera is just not stable enough to take really good pictures.  The joints all have a little bit of movement in each one even after everything appears to be very tight by hand.  The camera itself will move back and forth at the main connection making it move around too much to get a really good in focus picture.  I was taking pictures of a Kestrel across the street today and couldn't keep the tripod still enough to really lock into the bird and take a good still camera shot.  The unit is nice and light weight and it folds up and out very nicely.  The carrying case is nice as well.  I just wanted to let you all know that it is loose before you buy it and perhaps look at the other options that they offer.  Thanks,  Tom"
Flimsy and unstable. Buy better than this
"Most of the tripod is solid and well made. I can extend it well, it's relatively tall, and handle is nice and it feels pretty sturdy for its mostly plastic frame.But i'm having trouble putting an actual heavy camera on the Tripod.For my small camcorder it's not a big deal because the weight is low(and it attaches fine to my camcorder), but the screw that tightens the platform at the top doesn't line up correctly and thus can't screw in. It seems like a manufacturing error. Normally I'm content with AmazonBasics quality but this one sorta failed in a semi catastrophic way.So if I put my camcorder on the stand, then angle the camera at up or down level(like if I point the camera downward to film my dog, but take my hand off the handle), then the camera would droop the rest of the way down, like a deflated balloon. This is because the tightening screw won't resist the movement because it doesn't line up with the inner hole.Again, it's sorta okay for me with my camcorder, but when I tried putting my GF's heavy Canon camera and I pitched the camera down a little and let go, it instantly dropped all the way, giving me knowledge that I won't be able to use the stand unless I stick around holding it(which defeats the purpose of a tripod), and that I probably shouldn't put an expensive camera on an AmazonBasics 25$ value purchase Tripod anyways.I should have gone through the return process to get a new one, but I am a procrastinator and it's never going to happen. I am left with a 2 star rating AmazonBasics tripod that works if I'm only trying to film the horizon or ants immediately below my Tripod."
"The weight of this tripod is a blessing and a curse.  Being light, it is easy to carry.  But being light also means that wind plus the weight of a camera will cause the tripod to tip over very easily.  I know because it has happened to me twice.  I mount a trail camera on it, and the next day I find it lying on the ground.  I finally had to tie a cement block to it to keep it upright.  Being light also means that the overall sturdiness of the tripod is very flimsy.  When I go to adjust the legs or the orientation of the camera (level/plumb/ direction), it feels as if something is going to break or a screw is going to strip if I'm not careful.I'm going to keep this, but if I ever need another tripod, I will not buy this again and I would not recommend it."
"This little tripod is light and handy, quick to set up and take down. BUT! I used it 3 days a week for 10 weeks and one of the leg clips has already broken. My velbon lasted for 15 years of heavy use before a clip broke. Not sure I would purchase this again."
I purchased for a portable projector but when I screw the projector on the tripod it’s very wobbly and doesn’t stay level.
"Definitely a case of you get what you pay for, but I almost want to say in this case you don't get enough for you pay for. Long story short, this cost $17, but it feels like it should cost $8.I wasn't expecting a great tripod, but I was at least expecting something that felt like it wasn't going to fall apart. This thing feels as flimsy as a bunch of empty Pepsi cans stacked on top of one another. Everything about this tripod is flimsy and rough. Granted it does the basic job of holding the camera, once you have it set, you better not touch it at all or better hope there's not even a slight breeze.The tolerances of this tripod are so loose that even just pressing the record button on my camera is enough to mess up the shot I set up. The legs are so loose, that if I pick up the tripod the legs immediately want to collapse inward. Now I don't know if this is an issue with all of these tripods or maybe I just got a bad one, but I will not be buying one again to find out.I've purchase cheap sub-$20 tripods in the past before, none of them were this bad. In fact was trying to replace a cheap tripod that is broken with this Amazon Basics unit. The broken tripod is better than this.If you are setting up a camera that will not be moved at all and you will be controlling it via remote, this should work for you. But, if you need to move the camera often or are using the buttons on the camera itself, I suggest you get something else.I've always been a fan of the AmazonBasics line of products, hopefully this isn't a sign of things to come from future products."
"I bought this since I need a tripod for photos now and then. The first thing I tested was the crank for the vertical shaft. It extended fine, but on GENTLY cranking it to bring it back down and one of the teeth inside snapped with barely any force on the crank. Won't be getting a replacement, will be getting a different brand."
When putting the tripod into a verticle shooting mode it broke. Couldn’t handle the weight of my 4 pound camera
"I was pleasantly surprised at the stability, quality and ease of use with this tripod.Being cheaper in cost I assumed it would be a little too light weight causing it to be wobbly... and when you're going to stick your $1500 camera on that bad boy, YOU DONT WANT IT TO WOBBLE!  So I got it hoping for the best nut prepared to use it for my phone at worst.The legs easily extended, firmly lock. It's a great tripod.Now it's not without fault...it IS very light and needs to be on firm even ground. It's not good for grass at all, so I couldn't get it a 5.Overall, perfect for hard flat surfaces, sturdy, easy to use and super lightweight.Not for grass or windy conditions."
"Edit to add: After a month of use, it's already started to fail. I used it outside in the cold and one of the levers to secure the legs broke off. Pain in the butt so expand or collapse that leg now. Cheap brittle plastic as expected.Original Review:For the price you pay, you really can't expect much, but this tripod stands and delivers (get it... stands... ha). Ultimately, I don't expect this tripod to last me very long, but after spending hundreds of dollars getting equipped with my first dSLR, lenses, and other accessories, I figure this will work for now. If I get 6 months to a year out of it, I'll consider it $23 well spent. Construction seems on par with what you'd find with any big box store value oriented item, which is all Amazon Basics really is. Legs slide and secure easily enough but can be tricky to dial into place on uneven ground. It holds my relatively light slr in place with the 18-55mm lens attached and I think it could take a little more weight without an issue. Folded up, it's light enough and compact enough that it won't be too much of a hassle bringing it around places, but it's definitely not travel sized. On top, the mount is fairly straight forward, but this is where I'm guessing failure will begin. The plastic feels cheap and brittle and it doesn't move around in a smooth manner. The quick release lever is also big and bulky so it gets in the way of my lcd screen if I want to spin that around, but this is a common issue I believe on many tripods. The level sits right underneath the camera as well, making it hard to see. Overall, this gets the job done for one hell of a cheap price."
the product is a little flimsy for my leopold binoculars i will find out how they hold up when i’m scouting!
"Not very sturdy and the fact that you have to screw your camera directly onto the tripod rather than clip it in with a removable screw platform is unwieldy and time consuming. That being said, if not being used in an area with significant risk of toppling over (uneven terrain, around children or pets, etc.) the value is alright and will do in a pinch. I bought this as a backup for my main tripod and do use it, just not when my main tripod is available."
"I almost sent this thing back because I couldn't figure out how to make it go up, and I didn't need a table top tripod. The instructions are seriously awful. Seems like a decent quality product once you figure out how to use it. Maybe it's more intuitive if you have photographic experience."
"It's OK.  Bluetooth control works well.  Won't articulate much past 90 degrees to get more of a ""downward photo""."
"Not tall enough, very hard to lock the phone( i hurt my finger doing it). Besides that it’s fine"
"When we first received there, everything was great. I was able to connect the remote to the phone. But after the first usage, we weren’t able to connect the remote back to the phone and since the instructions are very, very limited, we literally just use it as a stand now."
"I have to return it which is a major inconvenience. It didn’t come adjustable, which is frustrating. It was like 16 inches max. I tried reading the manual and going through the directions. Mine might be missing a feature which seems to be a relatively common theme for this company judging from the multiple reviews complaining of something similar (missing a piece that’s central to the use of the tripod).Never again."
Doesn’t have the option standing and film in it in 45° down can cut your fingers when you’re folding the tripod
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It’s cheap material and design. The pole was shaken when apply a little force on it. What you pay what you get.
"It sucks that this didn’t come with all the parts because it seems like it might be a good tripod, but it’s missing the attachment for the phone. :(I’m happy to fix the review if I get a replacement with all the parts."
Does the job
"I recently purchased the TONEOF 60"" Cell Phone Selfie Stick Tripod, hoping to find an all-in-one solution for my smartphone photography and videography needs. While there are some aspects of this product that I appreciate, there are also a few significant drawbacks that ultimately led me to return it.First, let's talk about the positive aspects. The remote control and Bluetooth connectivity are incredibly easy to use, making it simple to control your smartphone from a distance. The pairing process is straightforward, and the remote is responsive, allowing for seamless operation. Additionally, the 60-inch reach of the selfie stick is impressive, providing ample distance for capturing wide shots or group photos.However, my main issue with this selfie stick tripod is its stability, particularly when recording video. I found that the device tends to wobble, which can be frustrating when trying to capture steady footage. This wobbling is especially noticeable when using the tripod in the vertical position, which is a significant drawback for those who create content for social media platforms that favor vertical video, such as Instagram or TikTok.Another problem I encountered is that the tripod works best in a horizontal position, rather than vertical. When attempting to use it vertically, the camera angle is slightly off, requiring constant adjustments to straighten it. Additionally, the tripod does not lay down at a full 90-degree angle when filming vertically, which can be inconvenient for certain types of shots.While the TONEOF 60"" Cell Phone Selfie Stick Tripod does have some positive attributes, such as its easy-to-use Bluetooth connectivity and impressive reach, the stability issues and limitations when recording vertically make it less than ideal for social media content creators. If you primarily shoot in a horizontal orientation and don't mind the occasional wobble, this product might still be worth considering. However, for those who heavily rely on vertical video for their content, it may be best to explore other options that provide better stability and more versatile angles."
It’s a really good tripod for the price but when taking overhead shots the feet are shown and I don’t like that… not to mention the angles only go so far and only one sided …. But it definitely works great and better than a few I’ve used before so I would recommend
"The push button used to open the tripod is stuck after 3 weeks of use. Other than that, I really liked the product. It is sturdy and easy to use. But now I can’t open the tripod :( wish it can be replaced, but the return window is closed."
"It is compact and it is easy to pull up, but the minute you put your phone on it it keeps tipping forward"
When in landscape/horizontal position it’s not level. This is actually a pain when recording videos. You’ll need to slightly adjust it in post. On iPhone when shooting video you can tell by the white/yellow line in the middle of the screen. It’s off.
"I like the sleek design of this selfie stick. Everything folds up so that it is smooth and easy to pack. I like the tripod's strength. I did not have the stick collapse while I was using it. The remote is small and fits well in a pocket, maybe too well as it is so small it is hard to find in deep pockets. What I am not crazy about is the weight of this stick. Too heavy to pack in my purse and carry around for several hours. The other feature I am not fond of is that the angles of the phone have to be manually set, there is no remote swivel function so I am constantly bringing the stick back in to readjust the position. I do like the rechargeable feature. I don't have to worry about using up a lot of batteries."
"This is a pretty good tripod for the price. The bluetooth clicker connects within seconds to my phone and responds well when clicked to capture photos, the stand is easily adjustable and allows me to take photos and videos from angles I otherwise wouldn't be able to, and it's also compact and portable, so I can take it anywhere on the go! One drawback about this product is the lack of sturdiness. The phone holder itself tilts when my phone is in it (see images), so oftentimes I have to edit my photos and videos to accommodate for the tilt.My iPhone 13 plus the case just seems to be too heavy for it. It's also not super sturdy when it's fully extended - it has been easily tipped over if my dog nudges it, and that's one thing I think is misleading about the product photos. Overall, I would recommend this if you just want something inexpensive and portable, but if you want something really sturdy and durable, I'd probably look elsewhere."
"I took this to the park to take a photo of myself with my kids. The wind blew it over, resulting in several scratches to my phone case. Thankfully my phone itself was fine. A heavier base would have helped to prevent this.The remote is neat. It took 10 seconds to take the photo, which was weird. Not sure why it did that. It'd probably be a good idea to test it out ahead of time instead of potentially missing out on your desired image.I will keep it. It will be useful for indoor video capturing, such as my kids' school performances.It does hold my phone well, even in its case. Samsung Galaxy S21+."
"At first, I'm really happy about this product because it is stable.  But one thing has made me so disappointed that the remote (important) part died after a month even with a full charge.  So I had to use my waving of my samsung to capture instead of using the remote.  I wish the manufacture did something better.  May be it just my defected product.  Hope the seller will contact me soon."
The remote don’t stay it’s always falling out in my bag somewhere
"The button at the bottom to spread the legs is very difficult to press . The Bluetooth button falls out too easiest . Almost lost it twice already… the phone holder cannot fold the other day. It will fold downwards towards the front facing camera . Risk of it dropping out of the hood . Good concept but if those improvements get fixed, it would be a very good tripod!"
"This is so perfect, except that it holds the phone at an angle so pictures are crooked. I've tried tweaking it, but the closest I can get it to hold the phone correctly is to nudge one side of the phone up higher than the other after it's been insert. Even then, it's still a bit crooked.Other than that, this opens and closes easily and is very sturdy. The remote connects to my phone quicky, and it's been so fun to use."
"Very compact and easy to bring with you everywhere. The remote is also a great feature to use if you need hands free. However, the sturdiness is not so great it’s easy to shake and you’ll see it on camera, my phone also is a bit unlevel when filming or photographing. Other than that this product is great to use for any content creation."
"My daughter used this a few times a week for the past 2 months to video hitting lessons. Holds a simple iPhone X so nothing too large for the stand.Tonight, the super tiny screws that hold the bottom of the phone holder to the spring-loaded back/top portion broke, rendering the stand completely unusable.Tried to contact the seller to see if they can make it right and it’s impossible to find a way to even contact them.*UPDATE*. I guess seller saw this review and contacted me through Amazon. They sent me a replacement which arrived within a few days and my daughter is very happy. Good customer service once you’re in touch with them!"
"There are a lot of things that bother me about this. For starters you can only lean it forward a certain amount, and only in one position. Mine doesn’t hold my phone up perfectly straight either, it tilts a tad to one side and if you’re using this tripod to make good content, it will frustrate you. What I do like is that it doesn’t take up much space, it’s easy to travel with, and it’s decently sturdy!"
Product broke pretty easily. I thoroughly enjoyed using this tripod product it was very convenient. I used it a lot for building my personal brand. Unfortunately one time when I opened it like I usually do one of the rods for the base snapped. Now the tripod won’t stand up. This was outside of the warranty period so it’s not eligible for a replacement
"I guess this is my own fault for assuming the phone could be rotated, but the only way this stand can be used is with the phone in portrait- which is good for landscape photography but not much else."
"This isn't a neat selfie stick/phone stand. Unfortunately the integrated Bluetooth remote controller doesn't keep a charge for very long so yeah it sucks. It's like the battery can't hold a charge. Dies with in a few minutes after being on charger for like an hr. The manual says after the red light turns off it's full charged. Well full charged means in my case, just a couple of minutes and it dies. So as a selfie stick it sucks. Using the stand for video and controlling the video via the phone is fine, just don't plan on using the Bluetooth for very long."
"I purchased the stand in early 2023 and it is early 2024.I used remote less than 5 times and it was sitting on the stand all this time in my house.I tried to use today and it does not even pair to my iphone14.I plugged it to charger thinking maybe batter was out because I did not use it for many months.Initially it shows red led light but in a few tenths of seconds later, it turned off.I disabled and enabled bluetooth on my iPhone to search for this remote with and without charging cable plugged, but it does not even show up.  Very disappointed.  There is no customer support either."
"It shakes a lot when stretched all the way out, making video not stable so not ideal for content creation. Also, when using the phone’s front camera, attaching it to the adapter side that bends the most, to capture more of the overhead shots, it gets in the way, so you’re unable to tap the bottom of the screen."
"Everything was great with this tripod, but after a couple of uses the wireless remote fell out of the tripod and I couldn’t find it. I also made sure it was clicked in the tripod. I would luv to find a way just to reorder the remote, but can’t find contact info for the company to email them. Otherwise a good product for the price, but I bought it because of the wireless remote that came with the tripod."
Seems like the price point may be bit higher and the closed stick is 11.5” which is super long to fit in a small purse. I was hoping for it to be like 7-8” but it’s really long so not sure if this is travel friendly. Quality feels nice and seems durable. Will be using on trip and will update review
it’s a great product and I love how portable it is! love the rubber grip at the bottom too. but 3 stars because my photos and videos come out a bit tilted and they are not straight…
my remote is connected to my volume instead of taking a picture. like the sturdiness of the tripod but i also needed bluetooth remote
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The tripod overall is amazing, great concept and extremely compact my only big complaints are that when you extend it all the way it is extremely shaky and you have to wait a few minutes for it to stop shaking and if you touch it it shakes all over again. Second, if you want to film portrait mode like for tick tock videos it is not efficient at all and does not hold your camera well enough for you to be able to use the controls properly."
"the phone holder is kinda flimsy i have a iphone15 pro max and when i have it on portrait the phone is kinda crooked because the phone might be too heavy for it, not sure if i got a defective product or if all of them are like that"
The Bluetooth remote is not reliable. Eventually we gave up and just put the phone on a timer to take pictures
"1. It really hard to pull the cellphone holder for my iphone 15 pro max (which is 3.02 inches in width).2. It's shaky when setup as a tripod even in room(no wind) condition, took 20sec to stabilize."
I loved this thing but it broke after 1 trip. The plastic piece where the phone goes snapped off the tripod itself. Very disappointed
"Pros: the stick idea is nice. The remote is nice if you don't have a stylus like S-pen.Cons: Would not put my $1k phone in this. Tested on my Pixel. It is wobbly, my little do could easily knock it over. I definitely would not use it outside (which is where I mainly wanted to use it).The legs are cumbersome to open, but you aren't support to force them. Meh.The part that holds the camera swivels weirdly and is not a real 360 swivel if you want to do portrait or something. Meh.Getting your camera out of the holder feels like surgery (if you care about your phone. And your fingers.Sending it back."
"Hoping this review prompts the seller of the ""TONEOF 60"" Cell Phone Selfie Stick Tripod,Smartphone Tripod Stand All-in-1 with Integrated Wireless Remote,Portable,Lightweight,Extendable Phone Tripod for 4''-7'' iPhone and Android (Black)"" to send me a replacement remote since i can no longer get it to charge or work after only using it a handful of times. If they do I will change my rating."
I had my tripod / selfi stick for less than a year and one of the legs broke from its silver holder. Can't stand up anymore. I tried to tape it back together but it doesn't work.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Turning your camera from horizontal to vertical should have been easy and not cumbersome. This one does because of one major design flaw. The only way you can turn your camera from horizontal to vertical is by moving your camera upward to give space at the bottom to turn. I don't have to do this with my other selfie stick. I guess they want you to do this with their selfie stick. It's absolutely imbalance to hold the camera at the bottom part. I don't even know how long this selfie stick would last since you have to keep moving your camera upward every time you want to take a vertical shot.
"I know everyone’s obsessed with this tripod, but it’s not as great as I was hoping. The legs most definitely show up in your shot if you need a bird’s eye view, even though I had heard from multiple people that it doesn’t.I also wish someone would come up with an easier way to mount phones onto tripods in general. Is it just me?Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate that you can bend the phone multiple directions, but also, it only bends all the way forward in one direction so you have to pull the phone out & turn it around to get the view you want sometimes. Its an OK tripod. Not as revolutionary as all the content creators say. One day someone will beat this design, I’m sure of it!"
"So this is a decent tripod/selfie stick. I use it as a tripod to film videos from my phone while playing guitar. I knocked off 2 stars because its jammed and I can’t return it to selfie stick mode. Pretty sure if I force it I’ll break it. That being said, I don’t use it as a selfie stick anyways so it just stays in tripod mode in the corner. That’s what I bought it for so it does its job. Just beware it may jam. I only returned it to selfie stick mode like twice and kept it in tripod mode for a month straight before I noticed this."
"it’s portable and convenient but not that strong and sturdy enough to hold an iPhone 14 Pro max, it’s keep wobbling as I put my phone on. The pink one I bought from another store on Amazon too, which cost $20, cheaper than this one but they are sturdy except the height is not as tall as this one. But spending $20 to get the pink, I think it’s fine. But $25 for this? I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND"
Not exactly what i was looking for. Very easy go carry around but too light and not much support
"So far looks solid.  Until I go out with it, might be on the heavy side."
Was missing charging cord. Not sure if it should have been in the package or not
It’s not level so the video/photo will be slightly crooked
...when extended from the floor. The wobbliness becomes especially bad when you tilt your phone camera down on the subject to be recorded. I liked how it had a remote control but the wobbliness was just too much since my phone camera's picked up on it and I don't want my YouTube viewers dizzy. I've decided that I am going to ask for a refund.
"The build quality seems ok (I would still prefer something much sturdier, but this one is tolerable at least).  However, the adjustable head totally ruins it for me.  The part that grabs the phone doesn't have any way to squeeze to open like all decent phone holders have now.  The real downer (pun intended) is that the front/back tilt of the head is severely limited such that you can get very little downward tilt.  For 99% of my intended use, I wanted to set up the camera and point it downward toward a table or the ground.  The photo I've included shows the maximum downward tilt.Furthermore, there is no way to make minor left/right tilt adjustments, so you can be assured that your shot is going to be crooked.  Even if I could tolerate the previously mentioned issues, this one is a total deal killer."
Unfortunately I was not able to use on vacation as planned as it did not hold a charge and I missed my return window.
"I thought it had features that it definitely doesn't. Was it my fault for not reading closer? Maybe. But the features I'm wanting should be common place and I assumed they were. Lesson - don't make assumptions and avoid this tripod if you are wanting a tripod that does everything. This one only allows for horizontal picture taking. That's pretty disappointing.If you need one that's basic and folds up very compact quickly, this is what you want. Does that very well."
"Fully extended, the tripod is extremely unstable when adding a big smartphone like the iPhone 13 Pro Max. It will continue to move after you touch the phone, so no night shots will be possible on this fully extended rig. Also, outdoor wind will mean the phone will be constantly moving, again, important for night shots.For daylight, indoor use, it will do the trick.The phone clamp is really difficult to operate, impossible with just one hand. Also, sizewise with the iPhone 13 Pro Max it's completely at the limit of what it can extend as a clamp. It most probably will break because of these maximum extensions.Overall, feels a bit rickety compared to a real ultralight carbon-fiber tripod. The only advantage is the small packed size."
"Tripod extends and packs away very neatly and looks great. It works well and is relatively sturdy. The remote is said to work from 10 meters, but will barely work from even 5 feet. The only time it works consistently is when it is right by the phone, infuriating if you are outdoors just few feet away and can't hear the camera shutter. You think you took some photos and none were taken."
"Yes, it is easy to move around with when traveling but it is not a sturdy tripod. I had to learn the head way as the tripod fell on slight inclined surface and broke my phone's screen $300+ loss :(Also, the remote works fine but battery doesn't last long even if fully charged. Won't even last half a day out even if you switched it off when outside.Won't recommend it."
I like the design it is sleek and looks real nice and looks expensive as well ; but it’s not really stableIt can easily fall over by the slightest wind
"I use this to record tik toks and it works pretty well. I have an iPhone 13 plus, and when I put a clip light on my phone, the tripod isn’t strong enough to hold my phone up. Also, when I extend it to the full length, the tripod is kind of wobbly. However, I love that it includes a remote and isn’t too expensive! Overall, I think it’s a decent option but there may be better options out there"
"I originally didn’t know what the difference was between the two models that they had available. I got both on accident, but now I definitely see the difference. This specific model only rotates up and down and seems to be in a horizontal position for the phone the entire time. Definitely recommend the cheaper option because it has more of a variation on how to place your phone."
Very adorable and durable! Easily take it anywhere you go to make content! I loved this purchase.
Pros:•Easy and compact  • Good overall value for the priceNegatives: • Only use for indoors. The base is not wide enough to support the phone on uneven surfaces or even light to moderate wind conditions will blow the whole thing over.• The mount barely secures my iPhone 11 Max with case. They need to improve on the clamp design.• I would not recommend using this as a selfie stick. The clamp that holds the phone is not very deep and it does not secure the phone very well.
"This tripod is designed so well. It fits together and comes apart like some Japanese automobile. It's just too bad they made so many of them before the size of the phones got bigger. My phone is 8cm or 3.25 inches wide and it doesn't fit. Almost, but not quite. And that make this well engineered tripod totally worthless to me. Also, if you do buy it, be very careful to make sure your skin doesn't get in the hinge mechanism, when you close it. It snaps shut and if your skin is inside...you have to push the release button to get your skin out."
"This is a good tripod thing. There is a few problems with it though. If the phone is too heavy it begins to tilt to one side making video almost impossible to shoot. It also is very easy to topple over. Since the top is very thin, a slight breeze can cause it too fall down, I do not recommend use if meant to record something for a while if you can’t hold it."
I did not read the description carefully.  it is not a rechargeable battery remote.
"Purchased just before our first European vacation. Fully charged the remote, went to use it and was able to take 4 selfies. then the remote went dead.  attempted to charge the remote numerous times and it would not charge.  Had to throw entire stick away, you cannot use it without  remote.  Too late to return for a refund.  Total piece of junk."
Only use this maybe 1-2x per week at the gym for simple videos and it broke after just 6 months. Super bummed cause I love how sleek it is in my gym bag and really light walk because I walk to and from.
"I’ve only had this for about 3 days and it seems to be great except for the one reason I have to return it. Part that phone sits in doesn’t recline all the way back, so if you have to shoot something from over head it will have to be at an angle. It reclines all the way forward but only halfway back. I wish it did otherwise I would’ve kept it."
"I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max. After using it for four months, mostly to show my baby on FaceTime calls with my family, the top part cracked and broke. It couldn’t take the weight. Also, the swivel worked fine in the beginning but after a while portrait mode wasn’t keeping straight."
It’s light weight and can be blown away by strong wind. Good to use as a selfie stick and remote is problematic for me.
"I really loved this for a while, but I noticed that it doesn’t keep my phone straight when I film vertical and it gets really annoying because it throws off my framing. It’s definitely not the most sturdy, but that honestly didn’t bother me much since it’s so compact. I can definitely see why some people can’t stand it though.Otherwise, the design (compactness) of it is the best when it comes to traveling. Definitely going to try and find another tripod that is similar but fixes the vertical issue"
"Easy to use and set up as well as light weight and compact when folded up. Removable remote makes taking pics and vids easier when phone is on tripod. Phone mount is a bit finicky to hold phone in place with case on. But once it's in it holds phone well. The other issue i found with the mount is that it's a tricky to angle phone down past a certain point when it's being held in portait mode due to the way the mount is fastened to the stand. I use it for holding the phone in place while on Zoom video calls for now. Also, tripod legs feel like cheap plastic. If you're looking for a no frills tripod/selfie stick then this will do."
"I was excited about this tripod bc it’s very compact, easy to carry around and looks aesthetic but once I started using it, it didn’t work as I wanted it to. My phone seemed too heavy so it was tilting to the side and the most important thing is that it doesn’t rotate in every angle to get the shots I want. Will be returning it."
Worked great for about a month and then the clicker stopped working and wouldn't charge anymore. The stand itself is wonderful unless it's a windy day and you have it all the way up. The weight of the phone on top will cause it to topple over so be sure to add some weight to the bottom. If the clicker was still working this would have been a 5 star review. The stand itself is a great size for hiking and it's lightweight.
"I liked this tripod, it was nice and tall.  But... I had it extended and then took the phone off and pushed down on the phone mount to collapse the extended pole while the tripod was sitting on the ground.  The tripod legs jammed and I could  not get them to fold back up.  Later that day my wife tried to fold the legs and in the process broke the phone mount.  I was finally able to get the legs to fold but now the phone mount is busted so I can not use it."
"I want to love this tripod soooooo bad. It’s sturdy, great design, sleek and not too heavy. The biggest draw back which is super major to me since I use it to take my own content is the remote doesn’t work half the time and won’t connect to my phone after the original connect. It will disconnect then I can no longer pair it until I get back home and charge it. Then it does the same thing the next time I use it. It pairs… I can take about 5 photos then all of a sudden it stops working and I can no longer pair it. If it wasn’t for this major flaw then I would easily give this tripod 4 or 5 stars. That is a major draw back for me though."
"The Bluetooth button stopped working after 2 months of using it consistently. Before it stopped working, it was a great product. I originally purchased it because of the Bluetooth button I could click to record videos/take photos, without it, it’s just another stand."
I love everything about this little thing…except I can’t get it to *work*. It won’t pair with my phone and I can’t even get anything other than a little red charging light on the clicker and even that is only sometimes. Kinda bummed because I was really looking forward to using this a bunch!
"I like that it's compact but it doesn't hold the phone very well and the part that does hold the phone is so short and practically holds the phone from the very bottom making certain angles such as aerial, impossible"
"I love the tripod feature, and the Bluetooth remote works great with my phone. But I bought this product for the selfie stick as well, especially when traveling, but just trying it out in my living room shows me how unstable the stick would be outside in a windy location. Returning."
I loved the tripod size and easy to use but was not able to get it to pair to galaxy phone.
"i liked how portable and sleek it is and i loved the design concept. it felt pretty sturdy at first .. BUT i was taking pictures on a rooftop and the wind blew it down…luckily my phone case protected my phone. another downfall is that it doesn’t work with my boyfriends phone, he has an iphone 13 pro max with a thick otterbox case on it.overall, i can’t say i would recommend this.the fact that it fell down, and that it doesn’t hold my boyfriends phone is enough for me to return it and find something else… sorry."
After placing a phone in the holder the stand will be shaking forever. It's impossible to stabilize it.
As described but was too heavy.  I returned it.
"I couldn’t wait to use this on my trip to Australia and New Zealand, and tested it out a few times in advance. It worked great!  The telescope feature, the tripod stand…but it broke my first day in Australia!  The top section holding the phone came out. I tried to contact Toneof on Facebook and online but the SUBMIT button wouldn’t work, and nobody responded to my FB request.  I WISH they had replacement parts available since I don’t need the whole setup!  But I DO need something fast and reliable. PLEASE TONEOF—respond!  I love the product but can only give 2 stars."
"I bought the Tripod 2 years ago. It worked very well in the first use. However, I the remote doesn’t work now even if I charged it overnight. I’m so disappointed."
"I love this as I can carry in my person and extend it and set up in seconds. I also like that I can extend different heights and the holder of the phone tilts. Not as sturdy if it's windy. Sadly, the remote never worked which defeats half the purpose of using it. So, if the remote is not a big deal, then its ok."
Too much weight to travel with
"It’s ok product and light, but shaky."
Remote worked first time but will only change volume after that first time. While i really like the set up. It is very stable! But not being able to use remote is a huge minus. I have iPhone and while there is a trouble shooter fix it’s for android phones and doesn’t work for AppleUpdate:  they sent me a new one and so far it works great
"I received it today, read the instructions and tested it out.I'm a 6'4"" tall male, and I didn't find it very easy to set up and use.The remote was very hard to remove for charging.It is extremely difficult and took some two handed force to get an iPhone 13 into the camera holder.I am worried that with all the force that is required to operate that it will break easily in a short amount of time. So I am returning it now, the same day."
my remote stopped working and the whole stick is now waste.i emailed but no help
"Remote control stopped working after just 5x of use. The power light won’t turn off. Even after the battery was drained, once it’s recharged, the power light will always be on (steady light). It won’t connect to the bluetooth either. There is also no option to get hold of the seller. It would have been a nice stick."
"This tripod is really good if you want horizontal shots! The tripod never holds my phone straight in the vertical position; it's always slightly tilted over. Also, if you want to capture an overhead shot, the only way to do so causes the record button to be covered by the phone holder. I wish I knew these things before making my purchase. Love the Bluetooth capability with the remote."
It broke in a month.
The stand itself is amazing does everything you want it to do and more.The remote is a piece of ****. It only works when you’re right next to the phone using iPhone 13 Pro if you’re farther than 1 foot it won’t work at all. What’s the point?
Once you open this tripod. You can not close it for the life of you. I have tried to close it for travel and it just doesn’t close up. Something is wrong. Will be submitting for replacement.
This product worked very well until the remote fails to recharge.  At that point the unit is useless.
I got this tripod 18 months ago.  It worked great until it broke this weekend.  It would no longer hold my phone in place.  I noticed the top piece made of plastic that slid up and down on spring cracked.  The top cap is made of plastic and I figure with the constant pressure of it holding the phone and also being the point where you pushdown to close the tripod caused the plastic cap break.  This seems to be its failure mode.  I threw the thing away and will be ordering a new one.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I really liked this tripod at first. It’s easy to use, portable and looks so chic when it’s closed. But there are two things I didn’t like. A. The springs in the phone holder is so tight. I understand it’s to keep the phone sturdy but it has scratched my phone cover and I have hurt my fingers several times. 2. The phone holder only goes back in one direction and only half in the other. I’ve passed the return date so I guess I’m stuck to this."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Great concept and idea I just don’t like that. I have to rotate the whole base in order to get the pictures and videos I want this would really be a disadvantage when it comes to unlevel places from the outside it feels very good quality or at least somewhat of a decent quality but then whenever you have, the actual holder that holds the phone it kind of feels like it might give out and it might break. I just don’t like that I could rotated 360 so for that reason I’m returning it also please be careful because it will snap whenever you’re closing and you could pinch your fingers. This would be definitely a tripod you would have to explain to someone because if not, they would break it. I’m not knowing how to use it"
You have to be 3feet from the pole for the button to work
"In just 32 days, the remote is lost. It always kept falling out. This means the tripod is basically useless if I film using the back camera on my phone. Plus when my phone was in portrait mode, it was never fully upright, causing it to be tilted/slanted a little.I contacted Amazon support about this item and they refused to help. They told me to contact the manufacturer, and kept sending the link to this page, but there is no way to actually contact them since the ""Report an issue with this product or seller"" link won't work for me!I IMPLORE YOU TO FIND ANOTHER, BETTER OPTION."
"It closes weird and sometimes not fully but still cool. Also, it holds my phone at a weird angle sometimes so u gotta toy around for it to be centered held …"
It’s not a bad product. Just not useful if you want to use it to record IG/TikTok videos as the head that holds the phone does not turn. Other than that it’s a good phone holder to just watch videos.
"While the tripod stand/selfie stick felt sturdy and durable, the remote control was flimsy and broke after one use."
"We bought this selfie stick in March 2023, worked great till end of June, now the remote doesn’t work? Does anyone know a way to reset?"
"I disagree.  The tripod mode worked ok, ish.  The selfie mode, not so much.  The problem is, at least with a large phone (iPhone 14 Pro Max), the mounting device, that clamps on to the phone, is quite flimsy and weak. It wobbles when moving at all, and is only cheap plastic.  It also won't work in portrait mode on mine as the clamp doesnt have enough room without having to fudge it a bit, and again, same wobbleiness..  I returned mine..  save your money"
Great if you need it stay in one spot only. It does move but id rather spend more on something that has more mobility with the phone. The phone holder it self was hard to get the phone in. I liked the remote option. Light weight but not for me.
"The Sensyne 60"" phone tripod doubles as a selfie stick, offering flexibility for photos and videos. Its lightweight design makes it portable, and the sturdy build ensures stability. The remote works well, though the extension could feel slightly wobbly at full height."
I bought the selfie stick for my Samsung S24 Ultra. The phone holder doesn't feel secure. The phone moves around. Afraid that I would lose it.
"The Bluetooth was exceptionally easy to connect to my iPhone 15.I took a few practice shots with the remote but the next time I attempted to use it, the remote no longer functioned.  I can't say if it is the battery, or the remote itself, but the indicator light not longer lights and it will not connect.One thing I did not anticipate I would want in a selfie stick of this type is a swivel head.  The phone clip will tilt and rotate as advertised but I realized after my first set up and test of function that a swivel would be awesome.  I now know there are selfie sticks with a swivel head, but the trade off is in how the upper portion  then does not slide completely into the tubing for storage."
"I'm using this tripod with my iPhone 14 Pro Max. When I use it in TikTok, the remote start doesn't start recording. It only works when using the phones camera. Sometimes the legs of the tripod are hard to get open. It holds the phone well, but I would think if doing any type of activity, it would fall out. So for a tripod to stay in place and using the phone's camera, it works well. I'm not returning it so it must be worth it."
"I purchased this selfie stick with high expectations, especially because of the convenience promised by the integrated remote control. Initially, the selfie stick worked perfectly, and I was quite pleased with its performance. The stick itself is sturdy, extends to a decent length, and is lightweight, making it easy to carry around.However, after just a few weeks of use, the remote stopped working. Despite troubleshooting, including changing the battery and ensuring it was properly synced with my phone, I couldn't get it to function again. This was particularly disappointing because the remote was a major selling point for me.Even though the selfie stick is well-built and functional in its basic form, without the remote, it loses much of its appeal."
Needs to be more sturdy. Bought a different brand that was sturdy.
"This tripod does its job well, it’s sturdy and has a big height range. I love the remote so you don’t have to keep hitting your phone to turn the video on/off which then jostles the whole thing and briefly makes it shaky.My only complaint is that to get the best range of motion for filming something downward, you need to flip the tripod 180 degrees from its intended position. You also need to then put the phone onto the attachment backwards, so the screen isn’t accessible, you have a hard time seeing what you’re filming, and you risk filming the one leg of the stand that is then in the frame if you tilt it too low. This makes it difficult when wanting to sit the tripod onto a surface like a counter or floor and film something on a counter or tabletop, like if you’re cooking something for example. It’s hard to get a direct downward view, you have to keep it tilted enough to keep the leg out of view or at least then crop the leg out. This tripod is therefore best for filming yourself as you’re talking, or for filming things in front of you rather than on a downward, especially straight down, angle."
"I used to use the traditional tripod for my phone, the one with 3 legs that telescope out from the top on my hiking trips. However it got damaged and I started looking for another. I liked how this was a selfie stick + tripod in 1.Initially on the first few uses, it worked great. The handle is a bit big but it worked great as a selfie stick. However when I started to use it as a tripod, I saw the flaws.The first flaw is that the tripod let's are short and ate the base. If you telescope the stick out, it will sway with even the slightest breeze. So if you're trying to record a video, your video is not stable and will sway.The second flaw continues on the first. In extreme windy conditions, this thing will tip over. This is where I learned the legs are not very strong. In a moderately window day, I was taking some pictures and the wind knocked it over. Well low and behold, one of the legs broke off. And that was the end of this accessory."
Went through battery twice just sitting in the corner waiting to go on vacation
"As the title. Downchecks on the remote:* it takes 30-45 seconds to pair with a Pixel 4a smartphone running Bluetooth 5.0. I suspect the remote uses Bluetooth 4.0 for widest device compatibility. Pixel is fully charged, selfie stick battery is at 50%, so it's not a low-power issue.* If the phone's screen saver goes on, the connection drops. Which is as it should be. But the pairing is also lost, meaning you have to re-pair the remote and your phone AGAIN before you can use it. Huge problem for on-the-go filming.Nice tripod, but the remote provides only annoyance."
"I am a professional photographer so I do expect more from my gear than the average user might. I do like the light weight and long reach, however, there are a couple of major design flaws that caused me to return it. The phone holder is only angle-adjustable in 2 dimensions - tilt forward, or rotate the phone horizontal to vertical. It does not pivot around the pole center, so you have to rotate the entire stand to change that angle, but what if the ground surface doesn't allow that? Also, if the ground is uneven at all, you'll have a hard time leveling the phone and getting the exact framing you want. There are bump stops on the head where it does rotate which prevent you from making a slight twist off center (if you needed to compensate for slightly uneven ground). You have to have it centered, or at least a 1/2"" or so off-center or more. It's a bit hard to explain, but if you use it on any sort of uneven, unlevel, or angled ground, you'll have a problem getting it ""just right"". The remote works well and was easy to set up, but the way it clips to the stand makes it easy to accidentally trigger when carrying in a pack, or it pops off very easily when you don't want it to."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                It says it fits an iPhone 11 for 360 rotation it does not fit the iPhone 11 you cannot get a straight up and down picture perfect for a book bag or school kids not for vacation
"BUYER BEWARE: I bought this product primarily for filming DIY videos, which often requires the camera to be pointed down at what I'm doing, and this product just doesn't cut it. Neither the extender nor the top piece that holds the phone swivel, so it's impossible to take videos or pictures facing down without the leg being right in the way. It's BEYOND frustrating. Who designed this?!?! I'm so mad that I didn't figure this out before my return window closed, because now I'm stuck with it. I've been able to make it work by getting creative, but it takes me twice as long to do a video since I'm trying to implement work arounds for this issue and the whole reason I got it was to make filming easier. So far it's worked fine as a tripod for filming things directly in front of the camera, and I haven't had issues with the bluetooth yet, but I've only used that feature twice. I would return it if I could and purchase a different product that fulfills all my filming needs."
I purchased this tripod almost exactly one year ago and absolutely LOVED it for taking photos/videos while solo traveling. However after about 10 months the mechanism to close the tripod stopped working. It’s now reached a point to which I can no longer close it and will need to leave it behind because it won’t fit in my bag. Such a shame because I love this thing so much. If only it worked properly.
"This is a cool product in theory but in use it feels so cheap in some parts. Let's start with the good; The selfie stick part of it is REALLY secure. I wiggled that stick a lot and my phone would NOT budge. So if you are taking a picture with it, you don't have to worry about your phone falling out. The remote is also really nice. It has its own spot on the stick and its range is REALLY good. The only HUGE problem I have with this stick is the tripod. The tripod is VERY unsecured which sucks. It feels like if you use it in tripod mode that it will fall over. When I set it up for a test photo shoot it would not stop wiggling side to side till I held in place which is NOT a good sign. The legs aren't great and to get them out for tripod mode is also really awkward too. If you want a selfie stick and don't care there's a tripod (or its an added bonus for you) then this is great but if you want both then maybe look into other options."
You have to make sure your case fits in the mounting pad they have or it will pop out. It does not swivel down very much at all so forget about all the angles you think you might be getting. It is ok to use but don't think of this as a really nice Tripod. Lots of plastic looks very chenzy. So it is ok for light duty but don't think of this has some sturdy device.
"It is a great tripod however the remote stopped working after two times of usage.  Batteries have been replaced and still doesn’t work!!  I can not give a good rating on the remote!  UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE, I emailed the product merchant and they did something on their endas I have changed these batteries at least 25 times with no luck.  I got a response email and they wanted a short video, so I changed the batteries AGAIN to take a video and now they work.  I don't know what they did but it had to be through the Bluetooth.  Hopefully the remote CONTINUES TO WORK!!!!  NO, the next day it has AGAIN  stopped working- Great tripod, but unreliable remote!!!!"
"I loved the concept of this tripod and it worked pretty good when I got it but I will say it’s very light, therefore not sturdy. It could blow down outside. Since it is so light, if you set it up and even walk near it, it wobbles so you have to wait until it stops moving. The stand that holds your phone is decent but a little unsturdy as well so it can make your phone go a little crooked. I went today to extend it and it just completely broke and came apart. I made it work while I had it but I will definitely be investing in a higher quality tripod next time."
"This tripod was great and super portable! It was super convenient to carry this around during my trip in Canada. I was able to capture a lot of pictures and videos, BUT THEN it just broke after a week of using this. So I'm not exactly sure how durable this would be. If you're pulling out a lot, I would be careful. You may not have a tripod on next use. At times, it was very hard to close back up. So that could've been the reason why mine broke after a week. Since this tripod is so light, you might need some weight to hold it down if it's very windy outside."
"I thought I read this will fit iPhone 6, but it’s quite the struggle to get phone to stay in grip. Tripod is nice and sturdy and telescopes well."
"I purchased this selfie stick for my vacation with the intention of taking great photos. The stick itself is sturdy and easy to use, but the remote control is of poor quality. It stopped working after the first use, but I was able to obtain a replacement within the 30-day return policy. I would recommend this selfie stick to anyone who does not mind using their phone's timer, but I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to use the remote control because I do not know how reliable it is.Here are some pros and cons of this selfie stick:Pros:Sturdy and easy to useExtends to a good lengthCompact and easy to carryCons:Remote control failed on the second useRemote control is not reliableLegs seem to be fragile, time will tellOverall, I would give this selfie stick a 3 out of 5 stars. It is a good product, but the remote control is a major disappointment."
"It worked great but the second time using it the legs got stuck in the out position and nothing we did could correct it. I guess it still works as a stand, hence the two stars, but it’s not as portable and we can’t really hold it as a selfie stick anymore so it is pretty frustrating and now only half as useful."
"I purchased this to record and share gardening videos amongst friend and to do product unboxing reviews for them. Unfortunately, I didn’t open this until after the return window. I’m so disappointed there is no swivel option on the top. What that means is that for my up close videos, I will ALWAYS have the stand leg in my videos. Even though there is a great deal of maneuverability, without the option to slightly turn the top you will always get… Ready, Set, Action, STAND LEG IN VIDEO! I just wish I had tried this out sooner. Alas, I was attempting to be proactive and get ready before gardening season.I will add… if you want this JUST for selfies or to set on a solid surface for say a group photo, it would work for that.I gave it 2 stars because it doesn’t work for my needs. But if it were just for selfies I would give it a 3 star review. I guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and find a replacement. I added a picture so you can see my issue."
It’s a good build for the price and like the button so you can get a pic alone or in a group
"It is a good product. I enjoyed really used it during my trips. However, in multiple times. The wireless remote control fell, until I lost ot when I was saving inside the original box. The company doesn't offer an replacement."
"Got this stand for a trip last> Arrived on time and very convenient to carry. However it was REALLY hard to open the tripod and close it when I didn't need the tripod anymore but just needed to use as a selfie stick! After one extension, the legs are stuck now and I am unable to collapse the legs anymore. Total waste of money and couldn't even use it on our trip which was a great disappointment and we lost on so many memories and pictures.I somehow managed to get it back home with the extended legs but will be returning it somehow. Hopefully there is a selfie stick + tripod that is easier to open and collapse.Total waste of money and time :-("
"This was the first time I bought a tripod for smartphone, and boy was it a disappointment. It worked well for the first 3-4 uses. After that, it didn’t close completely. No big deal, but then I extended it a, small piece of plastic fell out, and the product came apart in two as I tried extending it. Each joint is supposed to have a “max” extension, but one of the joints came apart before the rest of the joints were able to fully extend. I carefully fitted it back together and extended it section by section. I then placed my phone in the holder, let it go, and each section compressed back down under the weight of the phone. In other words, it didn’t stay extended. I might as well have placed the phone on my bag and started filming.Terrible quality. Don’t buy"
"Perfect product for the first several months before it becomes loose, especially for the stick. I used it for video shooting but the height of the tripod slowly becomes shorter and shorter during the process so I have to adjust it back constantly. $29 for less than a year usage."
"If you're buying this, it better be for smooth, level pavement.The legs don't rotate, nor are they adjustable. So if you're on an incline, with your phone on top that acts as a high center of mass, it will tip very easily."
"While the telescopic body and compact size maybe attractive, it is very flimsy and doesn't allow to point the camera at a right angle. I had to return it as I couldn't record my daughter's drama show due to the stand being all shakey."
"This is the third remote controlled tripod that I've bought. The first one was smaller, and best for handheld or taller surfaces. The second had a lot of pieces and was heavy, but was sturdy. This one is light, but is huge, even when compacted. When fully extended, it seems a little wobbly, as far as the vertical stick, not the base. I guess this gives it some wiggle room so it doesn't just blow over. The remote seems to work well, the few times that I tested it. It was easy to pair with my phone. I'm not 100% that I'm going to keep it, because it is such a large item."
It is a great tripod if you have a smaller iPhone & not the pro max. Because my phone is so large it doesn’t move or rotate fully or extend down.
"It shakes too much, you cannot rotate it without moving the whole structure. Is not practical"
Stand broke and will no longer retract after a month of using it.
"The clip to hold the phone has next to no depth. It will work with most phones IF it is just the phone without any case. Some thin cases may work. Using a batter pack case is out of the question as it is too thick for the shallow clips to hold.Bluetooth is fine on one phone, but when I unpair and try to pair to another phone, it does not even see the remote. Not sure if this is an issue with my phone or the remote, but most bluetooth devices work on that particular phone.As for the general usage as a selfie stick, it does allow for some good angles and the tripod feet are nice.Just a pain to deal with removing the case every time I want to take a shot. Gets to be time consuming and clumsy. You may have better luck with a thin phone and/or smaller case."
"Good clasping of phone, however the tripod is very difficult to open. Also this is heavier than I was looking for."
"I actually like the product and would have rated it a 4 or 5 if it weren't for having to replace the remote battery constantly.  Although the tripod/selfie stick isn't used daily - probably every few weeks, I always have to replace the battery in the remote when using it.  I even tried to remove the battery in-between usage and I still need to replace the battery."
"The attachment simply does not accommodate an iPhone Pro Max in a case. This iPhone model with a thin case is just too big for the stick, it cannot grasp the edges of an iPhone Pro Max inside a case. This is disappointing because I do not want to remove my iPhone Pro Max from its case every time I want to use the stick. It’s inconvenient, cumbersome, and risks damage or loss. I need to return this item. I have yet to find a selfie stick that can accommodate an iPhone Pro Max comfortably."
"I like this stand, it came in handy for what I wanted to try but the only problem is the part that holds the phone doesn't swivel up and down. You can only have the phone pointing straight. also I used it in a small space and wished the base wasn't so wide, it made it very hard to not knock the stand over or bump into the legs. All that said I love the length of the stick when extended and shooting the selfie."
"The size and physical convenience is nice, however, I find that I have to click the button many times, and doesn’t always work. Also, I have to put a new battery in it every time I use it. Wish it was chargeable."
"I like the tripod part. I’m sad the remote does not work. I changed the battery and it still did not work. It doesn’t even the on. The tripod will have to work on self timer, I guess."
"I've been trying this tripod with a (6.7-inch) Pixel 7 Pro, and it doesn't hold the phone securely (it only fits in landscape mode - portrait far too large). Also, when fully extended, the base is too small/short, and everything gets tippy, and wiggly. Not heavy and stable enough. Nice compact size, but isn't going to work for me, even at the very attractive price. Maybe with a much smaller phone ..."
"I will not tell you what I experienced. Instead, I'll tell you what I observed.1.- Assuming you know about Laws of Physics, if you have the weight of a cellphone at eye-level sitting at the top of a broomstick and at the bottom of the broomstick there is flimsy and light in weight piece of plastic that weights much less than the cellphone, a breeze can easily push your cellphone and make it go down to certain death when it hits concrete.2.- To attach your cellphone to the top, you need three [3] hands. Two [2] hands are needed to keep separated two [2] pieces that hold your cellphone, but how do you place your cellphone between the two [2] pieces if your hands are holding both pieces apart?No, guys... I am not an idiot to risk dropping my US$500.00 cellphone from the top of a toy in exchange for what... in exchange for selfies?! Well... the heck with selfies... I take them the old-fashion way!"
It's to big to carry in a purse and bigger than I really prefer.
"REAL REVIEW: Cheap china product. Must be delicate with the phone mount itself, it’s only mounted on with a single screw and about 1/8 inch plastic mount. Probably a great tripod if you don’t plan on moving it around much. Although if you plan on ever using it more then 5 times I would shop for a better product."
I like the concept but the legs are very cheap. It also hurt my fingers to open it.Every time I try to open the legs I am scared that it going to brake. But once you set it up it nice.
Ordered it last night and got it this morning. Super fast delivery. It extends well and sits on the ground balanced. Overall perfect product to this point. Then…My wife tried to retract it. Couldn’t. I found a bunch of videos showing people retracting it back to a stick. Followed their movements. Couldn’t. The nice ladies at the ups store where I was going to return the product tried and couldn’t get it to retract. They said they couldn’t return it if it didn’t retract and fit into the original box. I said the reason I was returning it was because it couldn’t retract… They laughed and said they’d find a spare box.Surprisingly not mad or even annoyed at this point cuz this defect is kinda laughable.Patiently waiting on the replacement which should arrive tomorrow.God. Please let this one retract🙏
"It appears to be made well. I tried to take a picture on some grass by the lake. I had trouble getting it to stabilize at full extension.  I also have a card holder on the back of my wallet, so the phone holder doesn’t quit hold my phone securely. The remote is a great feature but you do just hope that the picture took. There is no way of telling except to check your phone to see what pictures were taken."
"Make sure u get a couple of extra remote controls WITH HOOKS. That way u can have it on your keys. Sadly I lost the remote on the 2 day of my vacation, it worked perfectly while it lasted tho. NOT STURDY for windy weather AT ALL, it'll keep staggering. Have in mind that the base is way too width and it will ONLY work on a flat surface. And u might have to carry it on a backpack, cuz it's kinda heavy and I think it's a bit longer than 1ft. Good for long exposure photos"
Although since it is actually a “selfie stick” and not a tripod. This factor should not be the only one to consider when buying!
Broke after a few months of owning it. The collapsing mechanism failed to close with nothing stuck in it.
The product is a good quality  but hard to use...
We couldn't the stand  to open up
"This is really cool but the remote doesn’t stay on well. Mine fell off and I lost it, so one of the best features of the stick isn’t available!"
I like the concept and the compact design. I love that the remote has a spot on the main frame. My only complaint is that it can only hold the phone in a horizontal orientation.
"Non rechargeable batteries and the thing is huge. The phone holder could be better gripping especially if you have a larger, heavier phone.Bought as a gift and she likes it."
"I bought the product 8 months ago I just use it once and remote battery is dead after one use, I replace battery and work perfectly, but it did not work after that, basically remote is useless, you can you tripod.Now I have to buy new remote and I just waste money on battery which seems like not going to fit in other remote."
"Would have been great if I could turn for videos. Instead I had to lift the entire thing ul and turn that way.  No good for videos. Oh and the remote was not as helpful as I'd hoped.  Lame, returning and looking for better one."
"Can't get the remote to actually take a picture all it does is zoom in and out. No settings to change it, no support videos, nadda. What is the point of a selfie stick if the remote doesn't work??DO NOT BUY !!!"
The cellphone has to ve free from the tube so we can manage the cellphone still on it but it is not possible
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I am not sure why this only works in my iphone photo app to  stop and start photos but does not work on here for reviews.  For this reason, I could not give this product a high rating"
"It’s a good selfie stick, but the size of an umbrella to pack or carry."
"The description sounded good and the reviews weren't too bad so I took a chance. You win some, you lose some. This was a loss. I wanted a device that was not too heavy or big to use as a tripod for my iPhone 14 Pro. Turns out I can take better photos holding the phone in my hand. This tripod is not stable and the holder for the phone has a restricted pivot that interferes with some positions needed to take decent photos. The remote is OK and was easily connected via bluetooth. A button push takes the photo but that is all the remote can do. Kind of lame. Maybe the only positive was the construction of the unit was decent, the telescopic tripod stand slides in and out easily and the folded unit is very compact."
"I purchased a Sensyne Y60 Selfie Stick on Feb 23, 2024. The remote stopped working around Sept 1 and now the selfie stick is nearly worthless. I’ve taken good care of it and put it back in the box after I have used it.I’m going to replace it with another selfie stick for an upcoming vacation."
"Advertisement not accurate. Advertised that it bends far back but it does not. See photos for details. Stand not stable. Wobbles and waves in light wind. Stand also cannot spin so of you want to turn it, you have to move the whole stand. Material cheap feeling but is to be expected for price. Remote keeps shutting off. If hadn't thrown packaging away, would have returned it."
"Not great weight distribution in the legs. It feels so fragile the taller you make it with the phone on it. It shakes are not the most sturdy, but gets the job done. I wish I could return it, but I missed my window"
"Mine broke after a week. Worked fine, but super fragile. Not worth it."
"I received this item for Christmas and just opened it for the first time a week ago.  Started out well, but quickly went poorly.  The tripod extensions have come apart, the tripod collapses under the weight of the phone and the item does not fully fold up after one use.  The only piece that works well is the bluetooth remote.  It's pretty much just several pieces of junk, and will be going in trash, with the exception of the remote.  Would not recommend."
Please do not buy this selfie stick.  I thought it would be great...looked great...not flimsy or cheap...good reviews....  Wrong!!!!  It fell apart the first time I used it.  The legs came apart form the body.  Weird lubricant was visible.  Unfortunately I didn't use it as soon as it arrived because it was purchased ahead for an event.  I contacted the buyer....no response. Was the one I received defective?  I'll never know. It's still sitting in the box.
"I only used it once, and the remote fell and got lost."
doesnt stand up well  and  not made well
Extends easily…fits my iPhone. Just can only tilt left or right and that’s it. Bluetooth does NOT worth. Can’t get the battery button to open for anything. So it’s just a stand so not worth the cost for it.
The concept is good but the stand is difficult to use. The base is difficult to open and when trying to adjust the telescoping arm it doesn’t always move very easily. It’s difficult to place the phone in the holder as well.  The remote is also difficult to remove and place back on the handle. If I could I would return it but I already removed the tab for the batteries
It was too heavy. I sent it back. Not really easy to use
I was on vacation with my family. Which are irreplaceable. I changed the battery and it stopped working I went on YouTube to make sure I was doing it right. And then I went to the menu manufacturer. Both of them told me I was doing it correctly. And it stopped working. I need it for it to work it stopped. It failed me. Don’t rely on it  because it was my vacation I was extremely disappointed.
Update2: May 2024. The replacement remote stopped working even with new batteries after 7 months sunce they replaced. I had used it for 3 trips since then. Suddenly middle of my trip it stopped working and it keeps flashing red. The support says they ran out of remote and directed me to buy a new remote from other sellers. What it means is i hv to keep a remote separately without being able to attach to the stick. It is useless option to engage two hands for a selfie IMO. They are good in responding but a poor quality remote that renders the selfie stick a wasted money.Update 1: Oct2023. The support prompltly responded and replaced the remote free of cost.Original review: Exactly after a month this stopped working when connecting to Bluetooth blinking couple of times...Have contacted support. Let us see what they do. The selfie stick is otherwise very sturdy and comfortable. I will change the rating and recommendations once I hear from the support.
I have a Samsung s22+ and the remote ONLY works for videos on the standard camera. In any other app the Bluetooth remote controls the audio for some reason. There hasn't been a way to get around this that I have been able to figure out. Does not work with TikTok/YouTube/Snapchat
The tripod legs were hard to pull out.  We had to use a screw driver to pry the legs apart.  We realized we would have to carry a screwdriver along with the selfie stick.
"If you're just taking selfish than maybe this is a good option - it's smaller than what I ended up with, but it's very wobbly and very cheap feeling overall. I returned it."
The stick is too big to handle
Was great. But already broke.
"I like the size of the tripod both when it's folded and when it's set up. As a selfie stick it's easy to carry and as a tripod it goes up pretty high considering the portable size.The remote control is the problem. I purchased this in December 2022 so I've seen a video where the battery cover is different, but this thing is impossible to open so I can't replace the battery and it's been dead for over a year. I've tried to use a flat head screw driver and other items and I can't get it to open. If you buy this tripod and the remote's battery cover looks like mine, return it to save the hassle and stress."
used goods . No good
"I didnt even get to use it. I opened it up. Expanded it and attached my phone, the phone set at a slight angle and it wasnt strong enough to sit level so I returned it."
"If you want a rather heavy tripod, you might like this. Unfortunately, it pulled apart the second time we tried to extend is (and no, we weren't pulling hard on it or overextending.) It's kind of complicated to figure out how to extend it - Looks like a big tube."
"It’s very nice and easy to open/close but it’s very unstable. It moves just by walking around it when using it as a tripod. That doesn’t work for me, so I’ll return it, but if you’re mostly getting it as a selfie stick then it should be fine 👍"
I can't even rate it as I received the box with no instructions except what is on the package. How do I even open this is not even explained.
"Remote works well..The phone holder does NOT rotate 180 degrees. It rotates just as shown in the product photo, maybe 0 to 160 degrees.  I needed 180 degrees..The phone clamps almost didn't extend far enough for my Google Pixel 6a with a heavy duty case on it and to avoid the control buttons, the offset phone caused the holder to rotate a degree or two under teh offset weight, and not be level..Fully extended, the telescoping section is incredibly flexible and wobbly.  Also, any light wind will catch and blow the top-heavy phone tripod over.  This isn't worth the $20 price..NOT RECOMMENDED!"
Sturdy but not the most functional tripod i’ve used. Not really what I was looking for.
"We bought this product as a phone camera tripod for a 73 day cruise around South America and to Antarctica to mitigate effects of my tremor.  It functioned well on our cruise balcony.  The problem was that the tripod legs were permanently stuck so that we had to leave it on the ship as trash and could not pack it to go home.  My wife and I and crew members watched YouTube videos on the product to try to see what we were doing wrong trying to collapse the legs.  But it was just plain stuck and would not fold for any of us.  Our conclusion is that this is a one-time use product, probably fine as a selfie stick but defective design as a tripod.  Buy something else if you want a tripod."
"I order two of this,( recommended from my son college professor for media) all my son college class have the same microphone and work awesome for interviews anywhere with noises canceling, before we purchase this one some student let my son trying their with success ,we have video outside with really a winding day the only sounds was the voice of the student. Well we ordered two of them,because the first one failed to work well the second was the same thing. The only difference from the one we order in amazon ,the other student the purchase from the Hollyland website,so we going to do that."
"First order never showed up, ordered it again and only half the order was in the box--just the selfie stick no tripod."
"Yes, it compact and easily transportable but the plastic used to construct the tripod is extremely flimsy. The company says it can handle 15lbs of weight but it struggled with a 9lb set of binoculars. Being subjective, I cannot image it would be too long before pieces start breaking off or equipment coming off the mount unexpectedly."
"Bought this for it's height. It is tall. But, when I mount my 60x zoom scope to it, the plastic pieces have trouble being steady with the weight, for photography. Good for lightweight applications, but if device mounted is over 6 or 7 pounds, not the right one."
"I got this to hold a microphone for measuring room acoustics. It works. It's cheap. It feels cheap. Gets the job done, but I wouldn't buy this to put a five thousand dollar camera on it."
This is a good stand if your using standard camera and lens but using telephoto lenses the weight off balances the tripod. Can be adjusted to work
I really wanted to love this thing. Easy to set up. Seems sturdy enough. Has a leveler bubble to ensure legs are all same height. BUT it doesn't fit phones with cases on them!!! 😢 I am a clumsy person so taking my phone out of the case is a huge risk. I only use my phones to take videos of my artwork so I'm quite disappointed in this.
Missing part - no holder for a Phone
"This would be an easy five star rating, because it is a well designed and manufactured tripod. However, the adjustment for the tilt forward and back is non-functional.  Even my small game camera if slightly tilted forward will droop all the way down. If they would make a small correction to this, it would be perfect in function and Price."
It’s worth it for the price but you get what you pay for
This is a good tripod for lighter equipment. I bought it for use for a spotting scope but it’s too heavy for the base and difficult to lock in a sighted object
Have a Nikon Z6 and put an 800mm lense on and tripod couldn’t keep it up- no support
"The “head’ which allows the ability to pan and tilt is very poorly designed in my humble opinion. So much so, that I went back to my cheaper priced tripod which is considerably more stable and easy to work with, as well to not have the “head” wobble on me when attempting to pan left to right.I would return the doggone thing, but I’ve already thrown the box away… UGH!"
Poor quality plastics. Isn't sturdy.
"As received, this was a fine tripod. I quite enjoyed using it. However, one of the linkages for one of the three support legs snapped in half while I was setting it up after about six months of use, rendering the product useless unless I ship the broken product back to them for repairs (with the shipping cost coming out of my pocket, of course). I wasn't abnormally hard on the tripod but it did see its fair share of use.Meanwhile the crappy tripod I purchased with the camera I bought is still going strong about 3 years later.I would go with a different company."
"This comes with some assembly required, including the top piece that you mount you camera to - it needs to simply be twisted/screwed on. But, when using this tripod and turning my camera to the left, instead of just a part of it rotating with the camera, the entire piece rotates and quickly loses tension, causing it to be too loose to stay in the exact place I position it. And if I were to keep spinning it left to capture something in motion, it’d come unscrewed and come apart. This is the second time I’ve ordered this and both purchases have this issue, but I have a friend with the same tripod without this issue. I don’t know how common this is but it seems very common to me considering I’ve had an 0:2 success rate. Otherwise, the rest of the tripod works fine. Nothing too fancy (as you can probably tell) but it does the trick."
"I didn't like the fact that the bottom part of the tripod is not made out of rubber or a more stable material. I used on a wooden surface and it was too slippery.  I tried returning the product without leaving any review, but when I go to do to the return, the only option shown is ""I'll Ship & Pay"". There's no option for them to come collect it, I have done returns in the past. The thing that really confuses me is that it was supposed to be free return.I hover over ""How does it work?"", it pops up the following:If the total cost of item(s) to be returned is 7,500 yen or more, please return them using a delivery service that allows for shipment status tracking such as a home delivery service, Yu-Pack, or the Japan Post collection service.This is on Amazon.com, the US site. Yet it's talking about Japanese Yen for some reason? I wonder if it thinks I'm in Japan and that's why it isn't offering a collection option for the return."
"Not for me, legs are a bit weak for what I need the tripod for."
"Got it today and was very excited. Only to be let down. The pan handle that threads into the head has no threads to thread into. I thought I had it all put together, only to find my phone flop forward and almost crash to the ground due to it not being tight since there was no way to tighten it cause there are no threads for it to tighten into. I immediately filed an exchange, but the exchange was going to take extra time to get here. So canceled that and filed return instead,  and just order another one that will be here in the morning. I'm willing to give it one more try, but if the new one is faulty, my review will stay at 1 star and I will add to this review. Crossing fingers!Update: seller messaged and only offered me 10.00 refund so I could order a new head from their store. The head is 9.99 plus tax, plus the extra shipping time. No brainer to refuse that offer and return the teipod. Kinda ridiculous if you ask me. I'd stay away from this tripod!"
"Broke after less than 2 months. I only ever use it indoors and am very careful with it as I use it for work multiple times a week. After less than 2 months, a small piece in the arms broke off when undoing the clasp to adjust height. Seems as though the arms/clasps all rely on very thin, fragile plastic pieces to work. Now that mine snapped (just from the weight of the leg), it is unusable.Had this product less than 2 months. Return window is only a month. I'd recommend looking at another brand if you want something that is gonna last."
I’m an actor who self tapes a lot and unfortunately this tripod didn’t even last 2 years just filming inside. Back leg started to stop locking into place. Very unfortunate
"I've been a commercial and editorial photographer for 50 years. I worked with 8x10 Deardroff's, 120mm Hasselblad, etc. I now just shoot the products for our own retail shop. My old small format camera tripod finally gave out. So, after seeing reviews of this tripod, combined with its cheap price, I thought I'd give it a try. Bad mistake.Most people are 'right eyed'. Typically a tripod should tilt to vertical to allow a person to simultaneously view what they're shooting with an open left eye.This tripod tilts the reverse, covering your left eye.The center post is ridiculously unstable. It shacks forever.The leg clamps and all adjustments are cheap plastic that need so much force to adjust, I can see this thing snapping right away.I returned and purchased a more expensive, much higher quality tripod.Classic example of 'you get what you pay for.'I gave an extra * only because delivery was exceptionally quick."
The legs won’t screw on mine properly and I can’t get support from them so idk
I bought this as a replacement for a tripod that I had used for many years successfully. I was struggling with this one from day one. The head was so loose and not stable but I needed a tripod so I continued to try to make it work. If I wasn't worried about pollution I would have thrown it in the ocean. I finally just ordered a new one.
"It's like a normal tripod. The entirety of the tripod itself is great, however the device mount is very flimsy. If you turn the mount left, it will loosen the screw rather than pivot like other tripods. When the screw is loosened, your camera/device becomes vey flimsy and is noticeable both visually and on recording."
"Product looked amazing at first when unboxing, unfortunately, one leg was loose, even when tightening it down, it would slide back in. Had to use duct tape to keep it held and wont be able to collapse it to fit in the bag."
"False and misleading advertisement. THIS IS NOT A HEAVY DUTY TPIPOD AT BEST IT IS MEDIUM DUTY. It required a10 lb. weight (on the center line) to stabilize tripod DO NOT BUY THIS TRIPOD IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A LIGHTWEIGHT /HEAVY DUTY BECAUSE IT IS NEITHER, I WILL NOT RETURN AS THE TPIPOD DID HAVE SOME ADD-ONS THAT JUST (barely) MADE ME DECIDE TO KEEP TRIPOD"
"For the price, you might as well get the 15 dollar Walmart special. This tripod has horrible wobble and the vertical setting is absolutely even worse. Sure, the legs are sturdy, but that’s about it. The pan and tilt head has almost 1/4 inch of play all locked out and if you elevate it you get almost 4 inches of back and forth play. The elevation tightens up with the set screw but that is not likely to last very long and just shows the poor quality and fit of this item.Don’t bother."
"I had it for a little over a year without much issue, but I was just setting up my camera gear as usual when the mount for the tripod head itself snapped and dropped my A7 to the floor. My camera and lens assembly was less than half the advertised load capacity, and now I'm stuck with a very expensive repair, all courtesy of this tripod."
Not as sturdy as some of the slightly pricier models in the same brand.
"Worked great for the first two months we had it---used it about 6 times with no problems---in the third month of periodic, light use one of the legs will no longer stay extended.  We expected to get more than 2.5 months of light indoor use out of this tripod."
"It does the job, but if you want a secure tripod, look elsewhere.I just needed a budget tripod but this thing feels very flimsy. I can’t imagine the locking mechanisms will last long for the legs and the crank for the center post is very wobbly…makes me nervous to extend it very far.Nonetheless, it’s worked ok so far but I would probably go with the cheaper Amazon basics tripod next time I’m looking for a budget tripod."
"For the price I should have just gotten the ONN at Walmart, saved $10 and still had a wobbly tripod."
"Being a cheap light tripod, a few parts broke pretty easily and quickly. Functionally it's good, though. You just get what you pay for, I guess."
Looks like a great tripod but I’m trying to assemble it and one of the feet is missing a screw piece…
"Received faulty product. The top part where the camera attaches was stuck together by glue. After screwing it on top of the tripod, and screwing and unscrewing the camera, it instantly came off. I guess the glue had dried up. I would not recommend this tripod."
"cant film vertically, doesnt support camera weight vertically, ruined my videos :("
"Cannot believe that's what I saw on the site. I am very, very disappointed. It's frail and not attracted. The Tripod with the Ball is just classic and Number 1 for me. Right now, nothing like the Ball type."
Get what you pay for. Just bought this for a spotting scope. If you rotate left it unscrews the head every time. No way to tighten it up and get it to rotate left.
The product overall seemed decent quality for $30 but it was missing one of the three plastic footings that screw into the bottom to balance the stand. I went through all of the packaging and only two were in there. I am thinking about making a return.
"The product was fine, but the box was horribly damaged."
"They worked fine for like 6 months (I bought 3). Then one completely fell apart. A couple months later the other one fell apart. I did not abuse them at all but the legs fell apart and there's no way to fix it other than to make them not expandable by gluing or taping the legs, which defeats the purpose of them going with me out in the field in my gear bag."
Not fully 72”.  Cheap plastic.  I expect it to last maybe a month.
"Watch your fingers when you take your phone out of the phone mount!  The tension is too tight and it snaps back as you release the phone.  If your fingers are anywhere close, they can get cut and or badly pinched."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            There is a piece that did not arrive, I liked the rest of the tripod, but the idea is that the entire product arrived"
Overall this is good. The one thing they could improve is the 1/4 plate you connect with camera. Every time i have to disconnect it from the camera if i want to use the camera on a gimbal.
The tripod did not work well for our spotting scope. It wobbled to much even though it was  several pounds under the max weight.  The jiggle made it extremely different to view.
"Side note: good customer service and follow up.  I changed my review to 3 stars. I suppose it would work well supporting most optics, however would advise against trying to support celestial binoculars or heavy cameras."
I wanted cheap. It's okay except that the mounting at the top is not really level so I have to fool around with the telescoping legs to level it out.
"This for the new NT70 tripod. Nothing special, but is functional. Was hopeful it would be a step up, but it's pretty basic with allot of plastic. May have been better served with the Endurax 66.. I will use it for basic positioning of a laser level and that is all... But, it is a step above the Amazon Basics 60"""
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Took the tripod to an event and used it for the FIRST time in there (after about 20 days of have received it). It went fine on that usage and put it back on the bag. Tried to use it a second time the very next day and found out that the top lock for one of the legs have broken inside and is no longer holding that part at all. It's still somehow usable if I'm careful enough, but it would never reach it's full high."
"I really wanted to like this tripod.It's lightweight! It's quick release! It's a great height! It seems sturdy!But...It is SOOOO cheaply made.The tripod legs were incredibly difficult to unlatch for extension. (strike 1)The tripod did not come with the feet.  (strike 2)The crank for the top part seemed stripped and would not effectively raise and lower! (STRIKE 3!!)So close, yet so far. I could have lived with the latches for the legs, as they probably (??) would have loosened with use. But the missing feet and the broken crank for the top are just not livable. Returning ASAP.Save yourself the issues. Buy something else."
All though it is metal the legs have a ton of play and just doesnt seem high quality
Most of the screw heads have bad threads and cannot be tightened. Not sure if I can recommend this.
Have the Hulk drop by and tighten every bolt and it still wobbles because of poor design.
"Bought used but this is more used than what I believed. It's covered in sand, bolts and screws are rusted and the rubber deck where the camera sits is torn"
Doesn't seem as sturdy as advertised. Pairing with a Nikkor ed vr ii which should be well under the weight limit with a d850.Tripod came largely dissassembled to be missing important pieces like the rotating head with no instructions that it would be like that.
"Used it for the first time to watch the eclipse. The center column would not go down - the handle just spins. Wrote to the company and got no response except, ""Thanks for the email."" It was a gift, so if code the first time I used it was 5 days after the return period end. Never even had it out of the box until that day. Don't buy it!"
"I purchased this for my team, and in less than 2 weeks of use, the lock for the leg broke, causing it to fall and damage our $1000 camera in the process.Unable to return/replace."
This looked like a good deal but after getting it everything is made out of plastic. Turning the handle to raise it up is very stiff and hard and feels like it is about to break from trying to turn it to go up. Not what I wanted or thought this was gonna be. It was a Christmas gift to myself and I hate it but I don’t want to send it back because then I would have to find a new one to replace it that’s metal and I have no clue when that will happen as I need one now. It will work for now as long as I don’t have to raise it up to its full height potential.
"The tripod itself is a very sturdy, lightweight & compact tripod but the head of it renders the thing unusable. It’s very cheaply made and to replace it with a good quality head wouldn’t be worth it.Spend your money on a credible brand"
The mounting part is made of cheap plastic . It came dirty and doesn't feel as sturdy as it looks.
the head is garbage unless you clamp it down in one spot to take a picture or a static video. the pan and tilt are not smooth at all. it is lightweight but made of the cheapest plastic that breaks at room temperature. it's not stable at all. the thing is not worth the cheap price. I put a better fluid pan tilt head on it and was almost ok with the legs. but one of the leg clamps fell apart when adjusting it. I used it 4 times before it became useless.
"Product specifically states it is compatible with gopro yet does not have any mounting system included to allow me to attach gopro directly. I will need to rig up some way to attach it or use the phone mount, which blocks access to touch screen on back making adjustments to settings and shots not possible."
"I've used it once or twice in the couple of months I've had it.  It's not been dropped or shaken, but the head has significant travel."
The one I received wouldn't tighten correctly which made my camera prone to move around in even a light breeze. Also didn't like how you can go left and right without loosening it up so the camera wobbles more. Wound up returning.
Bought this think it was good for the priceClamps fell off as just a few months making the tripod useless . Stability of the legs is pretty bad its not evenly grounded to the floor. Re-command looking at other tripods with higher quality  that don't use plastic clamps .
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Very flimsy and cheaply made material. Can’t get anything tightened down on here due to the screws being shorter than the insert. I thought being the price that it is it would be at least half way decent. Worth maybe $15 great for a kids toy. ⚠️UPDATE⚠️ tripod has BROKE.
There are plastic molds on the top where the camera goes that don’t lay flat and pinch creating a tilt in the camera. Leading to having to always hold down the camera on the left side just for a straight shot. That and the horizontal knob is terrible. I took it out while running through the manual just to find that the catch for the screw was uneven inside the tripod. I had to battle this thing for 15 minutes just to get it back in because of poor details and manufacturing.
You can only rotate it in one direction or it loosens itself up until it's off. That's pretty frustrating and I find myself doing that often while trying to track stuff. Besides that works well.
The top part doesn't rotate which means you have to physically rotate the tripod if you want to pan the camera. Which is totally insane. It's also pretty flimsy. I'm buying a different tripod because this thing is ridiculous.
This tripod looked promising amongst the sea of tripods as the stand and base seemed sturdy. The installation instructions were unclear and incomplete and the adjustable height clips were also very tight so opening and closing required a bit of elbow grease. Unfortunately there was a defect on the phone mount and the phone holder swings around loosely on the stand.
The head of the tripod keeps coming off too easily when I move it left or right and its heavy for my liking.  I have return it.
This tripod is not for a dslr.  It is too flimsy and will not suport the weight like it claims.  would work for lite phone camera.  Too much plastic.
Already showing issues can’t hold up my Sony x7
I’m so bummed because I thought this tripod was perfect from the price to the height. But when I finally opened it to use it I was so disappointed to see the legs messed up like in the picture and the black piece is broken. There was also a random washer that fell out of the bag when I opened it so I’m returning it tomorrow.
"Absolute trash. It's only been a few months and one of the legs just snapped as I was adjusting. Along with that, weeks before, two of the legs would not stay put even with the clamps locked so it's been useless for a while. Don't waste your money."
I was unable to attach the screw-on foot since it seems like the rod wasn’t properly threaded. This is a big problem since the tripod can’t be balanced if one of the feet cant be attached
Got this for a spotting scope. It will not support it very good. There was a part missing in the package. I emailed the company with no response.
Customer service is like talking to a rock. Product missing parts and appeared to be used and repackaged. Do not buy Chinese products if you can avoid it. C.S is non-existent.
"A used, damaged and previously returned item was shipped to me."
"Unfortunately the handle attachment wouldn’t screw in so I ordered a replacement, just to find the exact same issue happening again.Frustrating experience because the tripod seems well made but the fact that both of them have the exact same issue is not acceptable."
"I bought this as I needed a taller tripod, and going off the other reviews I had hight hopes. Unfortunately this tripod is not sturdy and is very cheaply made, even the standard camera mount is slightly different in size.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend this."
"Normally tripods have a spot to attach a camera, no, there’s no threads where I’m supposed to screw it into my camera, max about this"
Waste of money.  Leg locks are junk.
Cheap plastic.  Returning.
Was really looking forward to using this until I was struggling to put of the leg bottoms on. Doesn’t screw and that particular leg is faulty. Would not recommend.
Um I have no idea to build this so I give up I was half way tho
Very chip made it you can get better one for less money don’t waste your money
Not sturdy enough for my needs (spotting scope).
I have purchased three of these Victiv T70. The first one last12 months. The second one last 4 months and the third one last 45 days. I am very careful with them and they still break for no reason. There will not be a fourth one. I am going to another product .
"Not very pleased because the 3rd time I had this out, the plastic on the clamps broke simply from opening and closing the clasp. Not very reliable, was hoping to at least get a season out of this. This would have never lived through a full hunt"
Haven’t even owned a year. The spring snapped out of place where it holds the camera. Can’t put it back without bending the spring causing it to not hold the camera properly. irritated I wasted over $30 on this junk product.
Did not like that it was broke and made with cheep plastic in its legs. The plastic was to act like a stoper so the legs did not come apart. Well it did on the first unboxing. It was verry thin and cheep.
"While a complete package with features, I found the unit to be a bit too light, not very steady. The flex extension for the phone is about 9 inches too short, but if it was longer the base would need to be more substantial. It gets circular... Finally, I have had some issues with the camera remote button device.  Could be my low level of tech expertise but nonetheless, if has been quirky. Summary - You get what you pay for and long term I think perhaps spending more $ to get a more substantial unit might have been the route to go."
"A little tipsy at first. It eventually broke on the bottom after about a month of use (just at home, nothing crazy). So unfortunately it doesn’t do me much good now. Overall it’s okay. Not fantastic, tips over and broke but was decent when I had it"
"Tripod is easy to screw together, but gets stiff at times. Fits my phone with or without a case though which is nice, and the shutter remote was easy to connect via bluetooth."
Using the gooseneck and the tripod topples over due to the unequal weight distribution.  Not sure how this would hold a professional camera but I bought this specifically for the height and multiple angles I can achieve.  Definitely not easy to use if outdoors or camping.  The base will need something to hold it down if you plan on using the gooseneck.
So helpful but it really needs a wider base to be able to support it using the arm on top
It’s just off balance and broke easily.
"When I purchased it and I put my camera onto the camera holder, the weight was not distributed right and the stick would tip over so I would have to put it up against something for it even to stand up. The bottom of the stand already broke just from a teetering back-and-forth. I would say that it’s not a good design at all."
"This is a decent product but unfortunately, it has already broken and I have not even had it a year."
"It’s okay, the neck is weak if you have a more heavy phone, I have A iPhone 11 pro max and it falls over"
"Unfortunately, I neglected to try this out before the return window closed. I bought it to video myself playing piano & when I extended it up, the weight of my phone makes it very tipsy. As well, I have a pop-socket on the back of my phone & the part that grips your phone barely has enough space to go around it. I’d save your money & invest in something sturdier. Legs are very flimsy & not heavy enough to hold it up."
"I bought this based on the good reviews. Unfortunately, didn't work for me. The head is tilted and does not stay straight. The conversion from selfie stick to tripod is not convenient at all. Something doesn't seem right. The product is quite heavy and not portable at all. I don't see the point of flexibility of the gooseneck except for the height."
"This thing is constantly falling and the little switch to hold your phone in places constantly droops to the opposite way randomly, I feel like there should be a better way to make this function"
I like the height but it broke too soon of using it. Only had it for a month and a leg broke In mid process of a video shoot
I used this with my iPhone xr. The gooseneck is quite solid but must take care not to bump the stand or make it too tall. Falls over easy.
"The tripod attachment (for your phone) does not center at all when screwed in.  It’s too far up, down, to the left or right.  Never centered.  The weight of the phone with the next extension tips the tripod right over and there isn’t enough bottom weight for it to keep it standing.  I like the ability of the height but overall everything was meh.  Really disappointed because there was some good reviews but I can’t get past these really important things to make working easy."
Had the stand for 2 months and the goose neck part won’t hold up on its own anymore. The bottom of the base seemed to come loose and it won’t stay stiff. Go a different route and don’t buy this stand if you want something that will last.Edit: was refunded a new one. Was offered my money back but decided to give another shot since it’s at a good price point compromise to competitors
"If your phone is larger it might weigh it down a lil bit, but if you take the phone case off & use it then it may work better. Other than that, there’s no major issues."
This product is so lightweight that there is no stability to it. It tips over IF you can get your phone to actually stay in the part made to hold your phone. The other reviews are true on this one - Don't waste your money or time on this item!
its nice but i have to weigh the legs down (which can be an annoying thing to have to do every time) otherwise my phones weight will tip it over
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I had my small DJI mic adapter plugged into my phone and this flimsy tripod fell and broke my adapter along with my phone case.
"This tripod just isn’t a good feet for me. Way too many parts. It says it doesn’t come with the phone mount holder but there was something in the box that looked like a phone mount.Very top heavy on its own so when I tried putting my phone on it, it tipped over. The legs are flimsy.It could be a little bit challenging for some people to assemble it."
I bought this and had high hopes from the good reviews. The stand itself is very lightweight but unfortunately that means your phone weighs more than it. When I go to adjust it and use it to hold my phone I have to have something heavy on the stand or it falls over. Very easy to put together and maneuver but sadly not practical if you have to add something to make it not fall over when using it.
Bottom not weighted enough it falls over without putting something heavy enough on base of tripod other than that it serves it's purpose
"The tripod is sturdy but it doesn’t come with good instructions so I couldn’t get the remote to work and to get it to look down like is shows in one of the photos I have to leave a part a little loose. I’m sure there is a better way but again, really bad instructions. So if you just want just a regular front facing tripod or you already know how to work these things because you’re not a beginner then it’s all good otherwise the only pluses are that it’s sturdy and comes with a bag to carry everything in."
"I have iphone 15 pro, and this cannot hold it pretty much.  it doesn’t stay steady, so my videos are not stable. The bluetooth clicker is not working!"
I wanted to buy a stand or tripod to take pictures on my phone for when I go on vacation with my boyfriend so we wouldn’t have to ask people to take pictures for us and also so I wouldn’t have to bring my Canon camera and tripod and I loved how it came with a button to use to take picture from a distance without having to ask anybody to take our pictures for us. The quality is great and the button allows you to take videos as well which is a plus. The only down side is the bottom of the stand that sits on the ground isn’t as sturdy as you would like because it’s a little weak and can be wobbly
I absolutely loved this tripod but the screw that keeps the gooseneck in snapped and it can no longer be used.  Very bummed
"I’ve seen some other versions of the tripod that are just plain simpler and can compact smaller. This doesn’t work well in the sand and often will keel over. Pulling the legs back in is sticky and I’ve smashed my fingers a few times. Wish I had tested it more before I kept it, I probably would have returned it and gotten something else."
"im a content creator, after one week the tripod broke. the neck on the pod is not sturdy at all"
Not in love with this. It's not very sturdy and falls over with a stiff wind. Would not buy again.
"I was looking for a tripod to do videos and I came across this one. At first it was fine and I really liked it but after a couple times of using it, it wasn’t as sturdy anymore. It was a bit difficult to setup as well, and it didn’t come with directions so I had to figure it out myself. Maybe that’s why it wasn’t as sturdy, I might have missed something. It’s easy to carry around but it is big so it’s not my ideal tripod. I do like the remote control tho, it was easy to setup on my phone and it worked right away. I no longer use this tripod because it broke after a month so i’m on the hunt for a new one. Overall, it’s an okay product but probably not worth it if you create content on a daily basis"
"When the stand is fully extended, it will not hold your phone in place without your phone and the stand falling over. Get a different stand because this one is not sturdy sturdy."
Can't get the angles I want bc the bendable phone holder wilts. Not strong or sturdy at all....
It’s a nice idea but the stand isn’t very sturdy and just tips over in allot of positions.
"I don’t know what I expected for the low price, but this tripod is very wobbly, the extension pole is weird, my iPhone is almost too heavy for the holder and hard to get positioned.  I would recommend not buying this and maybe spending a little more, what I should have done."
Bottom plastic fell out so the tripod just goes straight off the pole.  Seemed sturdy at first but unfortunately mine has broken.  Got maybe 4 uses out of it.
The bottom came apart from the top about three months in.
"I love how easy it is to adjust,  but I'd you are looking for something with height, which this has, just know it falls over easily when you are using it to it to film when extended past a certain point."
"This tripod stand was perfect for my phone, providing a solid stand for taking pictures and videos. However, one day I noticed it was rather wobbly, and I looked at the bottom to see that part of the bottom of the stand had come apart. This occurred after very light usage, mostly staying in the same place, and occasionally being moved. I was never rough with it, and never used anything other than my cell phone on it."
"I was really excited to use this. However, once you clip your phone in, if you have it fully extended, it  falls over and is not balanced at all. It would work great if it has more weight on the bottom legs. Very portable. Folds easily. Would not buy again since it was so unsteady"
It constantly wants to collapse on itself. I think I flunked a job interview because of fidgeting with this thing.
"The parts on this just seem very fragile. I would recommend a better tripod that can last unless you are just keeping for quick use. Not worth the value, but does seem easy to use."
Can’t support the weight of a cell phone. The whole reason I bought it was for the bendable arm so that I can film at different angles and it couldn’t even hold my cell phone up if I bent the arm to do overhead videos.
"It’s ok, definitely cheap. You need to weigh the base done or manage to get the perfect angle or it will fall over"
I know a lot of people love this. But I’ve found it bulky and not the easiest to manipulate.
So it was all well and good to hold at an upright angle….but when I tried to use the gooseneck to hold over my table sideways for a tutorial video….the tripod kept tipping over…and the phone wasn’t able to stay in same position without drooping. Very disappointing
"For the first month, this was a great little tripod. But then, as I was adjusting the height one day, the stand at the bottom snapped off (I was using a very small amount of force, nothing crazy at all!). I'm extremely disappointed because it lasted just long enough for me to not be able to return the item. Would recommend going in a different direction, toward something a little more durable and higher quality."
"I was super excited for this tripod, as I am a content creator for trading cards. So I needed a flexible tripod to change the angle of my shot. This is not sturdy when using the flexible arm thingy lol. It continues shaking for at least 10-20 seconds after I touch my phone, or the tripod in any way. You may have a different experience, but it’s not sturdy until it’s left alone for a little while"
"If you want to swivel the phone clamp, say if the feet have to be in a certain position, you can’t. The phone clamp screws into the tripod. So if you do swivel it, it immediately loosens the phone clamp and it starts to wobble. I imagine this is not a big deal for most people. But it’s kind of important for me. Otherwise, it’s not bad."
Top part that holds phone very unstable
I was able shoot creative angles and I love the easy attachment for my phone but it broke in 2 months!
"This tripod mount does work. The only problem is that the base is so weak that it cannot support the weight of the actual phone. So if you’re going to use the gooseneck, unless you properly position the legs specifically, the stand will tip over. It’s definitely a limited solution. it works fine. That’s about it."
height adjustment tightening clips broken after 5 months
not very sturdy my phone ways it down and won't stay in place
Geta loose & wobbly after use
Bought for a birthday gift and was only able to give it to the person recently.  The item is extremely flimsy and won't stay upright.  Very short return window and now we are out money and stuck with someone no one wants.  Extremely disappointed.  DO NOT BUY THIS!  Look for something heavier.UPDATE 9/30/22: we may have not liked the product but their customer service is excellent!  After my review they reached out to me right away and asked how they can help.  They gave us the choice of trying another tripod or getting a refund. Quick response. Thank you for your help!
"I bought one and within the second time using it, it broke. The bottom piece fell off and where their smaller pieces they disappeared and I couldn’t fix it. So I returned it and got another one and the exact same thing happened. It’s extremely hard to use it without this piece that just falls off. It’s at the very bottom and it’s secures it so it won’t fall over without that piece. You can adjust it. It just keeps falling. It is literally unusable. I would just go ahead and buy a different brand instead of wasting your money on something you can use one time. Other than the bottom, it worked good but you obviously can’t use it without the bottom. Unless you wanna invest in buying the piece repeatedly then Don’t waste your money !"
Great design and portability. One complaint about a piece that keeps coming undone. Small dial and bolt that comes loose and never quite stays locked. Frustrating. Going to get some crazy glue!
I do a lot of content involving having the phone sort of bent over in an aerial shot of whatever it is I’m doing and this tripod is constantly tipping over due to the weight of my phone. I have an iPhone 14 Pro with a slim case and it can’t even bear the weight of that? I wouldn’t repurchase this but I guess it does the job if you don’t ever plan on using the bendable top
This products base doesn’t keep your phone balanced. It falls forward every time. It looks great but without a phone it stays still but the moment you put the phone clipped on it falls. Not worth your money
"Bottom connector of the middle main tripod to base piece came unglued after one light use. Also when extended all the way up, and adjusting the bendable wire, it was extremely tipsy and kept falling over with a $1000 (not super heavy) iphone attached. Kinda defeats the purpose of a tripod if it wont tri."
"I was really disappointed with this product after only two uses. It lacked the sturdiness I expected, and each time I placed my phone in it, the entire stand toppled over. It became quite frustrating, as I had to find something heavy to brace the base just to keep it upright. Overall, it did not meet my needs for reliability, and I was left looking for a better option."
"I did not like that tripod was broken after a week since I bought it. The gooseneck is very difficult to navigate, it does not follow with efforts. Just wasting time and money. Very upset"
Easy to put together and the adjustable neck is great but legs are flimsy which makes it hard to stand up straight/stay put and the bottom broke after 3 weeks. Never used the remote control as I was streaming baseball games.
The stand does not stand up well when a phone is attached.
I need this product for my sons Speech teacher because ZOOM is the only way to get a hard of hearing specialist— this product did work for about two sessions but not flexible or portable I’m not sure if using this more than 5 times makes it not work then not worth it.
Bought one and it broke. Thinking it was my granddaughter’s fault i  bought a second one.it broke and its just garbage. Not right that someone can sell something so poorly made
It’s been a month I purchased this 10/26/24  it’s 11/30 and the whole thing has fallen apart. Now I can’t do anything about it besides purchase a new one. Great
"The concept is awesome except if you have a large phone, it tips it over. The base isn't wide enough. I used a galaxy s23 ultra and it tips it over on the flat floor in the house. I can't use that outside and the slightest gust of wind will make it useless."
"It falls over with an iPhone 13. It will not hold any weight, and I can't imagine it would hold an iPad or tablet. It's going back."
The cheap plastic is so fragile it couldn't stand the stresses from its own mechanism. It broke within a minute of using it. Don't buy
"Not helpful at all, the flexibility of the next back is way to flexible"
"I love everything about this TriPod EXCEPT the piece that holds the phone! U have to stretch it out & hold it stretched out as u r trying to force the phone into this piece. Also, the lil piece is thin, so if u have a ring or pop socket on back of your phone u would have to put this piece above it which covers up the camera lens on back, or below it which makes it hard to position phone to be steady where u need it to stay. Please make this piece more manageable / adjustable! It won’t allow me to post a pic but I’ll try to post it after I submit this review, if I see an option to update this review."
"weird, and not stable or strong enough to hold a phone"
"The item could not hold the weight of my iPhone 15, 15 pro, 11 or 11 pro. The goose neck is not strong enough."
"This completely piece of junk! Once you remove the battery cover, there’s absolutely no way to put it back on properly!"
The top part that holds your device broke where it anchors to the legs. I was able to do a quick fix but it keeps breaking every other use.
"I have an iPhone 13pro max, when I bend the wire to get a certain angle it doesn’t stay it goes lower than where I have it and it tends to tip over. I believe this is due to the weight of my phone. Maybe it would work better if I had a lighter, smaller phone."
It broke the first time I used it. The bottom part broke and cannot connect to the legs anymore.
"There was a weird sticky substance all over the box that contained the tripod. Had to immediately wash my hands & throw the box out. Not sure why they would pack and ship out something like that. But the item itself is fine, packed within a holding bag for the tripod & very easy set up!"
"This product did me wrong never fully tightened up, and the flex part snapped on me. Smh"
This is not stable at all! fell by a wind and broke my iPhone 🤬
I think this would be fine for table top use but fully extended it’s too unstable and falls over.
Loved it at first but then it broke within the first ten uses.
Only one negative: the way you have 5 to pull the lever to lock your phone in can ruin your phone case or turn on the emergency alert. Very tight. Can snap your finger. Don’t like it. Everything else works well. Love the remote
The remote stopped working after I made one video. I can't get the head to tilt down...I thought it was more flexible. Not the best.
Poor build and the extension is floppy. My phone is too heavy for it and it doesn’t work.
"I loved this when I opened my package, the first day I used it I was so excited and it worked great. After a couple days of using it the bendy part started losing its hold and my phone would just slowly sink and not stay in place, and then the feet broke and won’t hold. So sadly, it’s getting trashed. :("
"I ordered the 86in with gooseneck and remote and those items are not in the box. I got a selfie stick instead, I guess."
Without Wireless Camera Remote Shutter nothing there but photo show said but here nothing
"Came with missing pices so I re-ordered and then it came AGAIN Without that darn gooseneck. Only holds the Phone sideways, over all this product gave me a bad experience and even not that good."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I really liked the design of this product but I could not figure out how to adjust the width of the phone holder to fit my iPhone. It's presently stuck at 2 1/2 inches, so I'm unable to use it. Is there a button I'm supposed to press to adjust the width? I noticed there are screws, but I would be surprised if I need to manually adjust it. Perhaps this is broken?"
"The ratio of the tripod base to height is somewhat low. When using the tripod to support a typical cell phone with the flexible arm, the setup became unstable and fell over, resulting in a broken camera/phone mount."
It does not come with a record remote kinda sad because now I have to go back and forth to stop record or to start
I stand by my previous post and do not care to edit it
This tripod worked great for a month and then very quickly the arm that hold the phone lost its integrity and now slumps with the weight of the phone and has a slight bounce to it. It is extremely difficult to get a level shot now because i have to angle it in all sorts of weird ways to get it not to fall. The footage has to be stabilized now and can sometimes be unusable.
"I bought this so I could make vertical videos recording my workspace with my phone from above. The tripod is flimsy and tips over when I use the flexible arm. It can’t even hold my phone. It’s a pointless item, very upset."
"For the price it has you can't ask for much, however the lack of solidity is noticeable and affects its use.THE CENTRAL AXIS WHERE THE TRIPOD LEGS ARE CONNECTED IS MADE OF SEMI FLEXIBLE PLASTIC!! It should have been made of aluminum or metal, to give rigidity to the tripod, but it is made of plastic, this generates more oscillation in the whole tripod.If you unfold the whole central post the camera will oscillate because the post is very thin.I recommend using it only for photography, the head it has is a ball joint, therefore you will always have to straighten the horizon manually and you will not be able to do vertical pans, only horizontal onesI must buy an additional head that allows me to do vertical and horizontal pans. END.Por el precio que tiene no se le puede exigir mucho, sin embargo la falta de solidez se nota y afecta en su uso.EL EJE CENTRAL DONDE SE CONECTAN LAS PATAS DEL TRIPODE ES DE PLASTICO SEMI FLEXIBLE!! debio ser de aluminio o metal, para darle rigidez al tripode, pero es de plástico, esto genera mas oscilación en todo el tripode.Si desplegas todo el poste central la cámara va a oscilar porque el poste es muy delgado.Recomiendo usarlo solo para fotografía, el cabezal que tiene es de articulación de bola, por lo tanto siempre tendrás que enderezar el horizonte de forma manual y no podras hacer paneos verticales, solo horizontalesDebo comprar un cabezal adicional que me permita hacer paneos verticales y horizontales. FIN."
"Quality build is average. Hard to push the clip to release, raise and lower legs. I suppose price was low and you get what you pay for but I hoped this would be a little better quality.  Authentically pleasing but will probably have to replace within a year based on how cheap it feels and how hard I have to press to release leg locks."
"I'm sure that you can load this tripod with 8kg and it won't fall over, but actually holding a heavy camera & lens combination without slipping is a different matter.It holds my Nikon D3200 DSLR & Nikkor 55-300mm lens, about 1.5kg, just fine without the camera slipping.  It's clunky to adjust without a pan arm, but I expected that.It's a different matter with the D3200 and my Sigma 150-600mm Contemporary lens -- a combined weight of about 3kg -- the ball head can't hold its position.  You have to guess way high, let it settle, and then adjust the legs for fine tuning.  It's a lot of work.I could probably buy a long Arca rail for the Sigma and adjust the position for better balance, but that defeats the purpose of having a portable, light-weight tripod."
It's fine for the cost and delivery.

I HATE tripods or anything really, with extra buttons or knobs that don't do anything.The knob I am turning in the middle is supposed to hold the stand from rotating, also when it's tight, the stand shouldn't wobble. Not only does the knobs not tighten it.. It doesn't do anything! Anyways.. Needless to say, I'm probably going to return this and try a different one."

The material is alao sturdy as I wanted something for my camera with relatively heavy lenses.The stand itself felt well built.  The 1 part I feel can be better is the slide in/out mechanism for the screw on base.  That is really a subpar design.  The base screw dropped out multiple times for me as I was trying to undo it from my camera - nearly lost that screw twice which would have render the stand useless.
Don’t put too much faith in it. It’s alright for the price- just don’t turn your back if the legs aren’t on level ground
The black twist part to loosen the gimbal keeps falling off.  Seems like what was supposed to hold it together was cheaply glued on.  I can still use it but its extremely annoying and falls off all the time and I'm lucky I haven't lost it.  I'm hoping I can get that part replaced so I can continue using it.
"Clearly used, works, and was on sale, whatever I guess. Gets the job done. The product is good,  sterdy and what i was looking for."
"Read the great reviews so decided to buy this tripod. I have a Canon Rebel T1i with EF-S 17-55mm lens and a BG-E5 battery grip, total weight is 3 lb.-13 oz.  The ballhead locking lever is extremely difficult to tighten when my camera setup is turned vertically or 45 degrees, it keeps slipping down because of the weight.Also the tripod legs are too thin to support the weight, noticeable shaking when two or three legs are fully extended.This tripod is good for GoPro's or small point and shoot type cameras, not for heavy camera setup."
"After ordering, I immediately returned this budget tripod. As a professional photographer, after close inspection I figured out that the construction was quite poor. Plastic does not hold up under serious use. Just say'n. This tripod is only for occasional and casual use."
"Illustration and product description indicate quick release lever locks on legs, item received has compression type turn locks on legs.  I prefer the lever locks as in my experience, the lever type is easier to keep clean and is more forgiving in dusty environments. This is not a total deal breaker as the tripod seems to be well designed and from good materials, however, I am disappointed due to the misleading information."
"The tripod is nice but it was missing parts, including the mount plate. Luckily I had another that worked."
"Very flimsy, could not support more than 1 or 2 pounds"
Broken & unable to use after less than or a week or it arrived broken I am not sure whichIt also was a little dirty but packaged  like it was brand new
"I've only had this for a few months, and while I liked the product in use a few times, the plastic clamps on the legs did not last long.Similar cracks exist on all three legs so the tripod is almost unusable in all but the shortest settings."
Leg on the tripod gave out one week after the return period. Fortunately my camera survived the fall. Unable to contact seller through their website. I would like a refund.
"When I unpacked  that gimbal, it just fell apart"
"A good small little stand. But not comparable to Manfrotto, for instance. But way cheaper, of course.Still good to have with me on small trips"
Not that great and road proof... Need more quality when on the go.
The size is so good.. but the quality is not that good.. I am using it for spotting scope. Not good in stability. even the plate is plastic. I really don't recommend this product..I could pay more for better quality
"Light and easy to carry around. Not super sturdy because of its plastic components so I'm extra careful handling it. It hold my DSLR camera but is a bit wobbly. In the future I would invest in a better and probably more costly tripod, but for now, this one is ok for experimenting and learning."
"I really wanted to love this tripod, but really regret buying it and only did because my old lightweight broke. It's a sturdy tripod, well made for the price and fairly lightweight. It does fold up to be really compact but that comes at a cost- putting it up/taking it down takes double the time and effort. The head comes off way too easily. The ""quick release plate"" is definitely not quick especially for any night/astro photography(I used to be able to do my old one in pitch black, I need a torch for this one as you can over losen the bracket and it then doesn't grip). And the very worst thing about it is the feet, due to it being so lightweight it doesn't take much for it to be knocked over especially on uneven terrain, I smashed a lens with this tripod on a small pebble beach and it wasn't even on its tallest legs or a heavy/long lens-cup feet or the option to buy them as an add on would have solved this.Things I do like are that you can use it as a regular studio tripod or turn it upside down and give a totally different angle, and how lightweight/compact it is for travel i can fit it inside a travel backpack."
"As someone who is currently filming at beginner level to test out with Dji Action 4.I admit that I had not plan very well to purchase this due to good cost pricing got my attention however, I felt this tripod was good in control environment like at home studio. I was intrigued more about the inverted tripod to have a low angle shot for creativity purpose. I haven't tried it yet.For the limited equipments, I am on a budget.  I researched the possibility of Quick release with camera being released from tripod usage. It will make your life quality a bit easier.Unfortunately, my needs changed due to experiencing out of control environment that answers for efficiency and time to set up quickly, and finish, ready to go for the next scene. This is where the tripod had delay my potential from requiring certain efforts and patience.It is a tripod for a budget-friendly needs. However, good in it's own. Not for simplicity, but rather complex one. Because of the legs and more knobs.For the bag, as someone feels defeated about the included packaging and was about to return this. I feel the bag had shrunk size or not flexible to put it back and, it did not fit the tripod as originally packaged. The material of the bag was not good either. There were indicators with friction burns on my hands, attempting to put it back inside.I would not recommend this tripod for a event that is uncontrolled environment such as crowd of people and lots of movement going on to film momentum.While tripod is definitely should be about being stabled in one placement. I would have liked this tripod if it was actually made to be efficient, ease to set up and transport with the bag included."
"Overall it is a very good tripod but I had some problems.The ball head is really good and it supported my equipment with no problems. You can easily adjust the angle and rotate it freely. If you need to change your view angle quickly it's easy with this tripod.It is a little bit too bulky in my opinion but it is very light. It is not easy to fit it inside its own bag.When windy it is not stable so you might run into some problems when shooting under windy conditions, specially with long exposure photos. It did not fell or anything like that, but it shakes a lot which impact your photo quality.I used it in very cold conditions (-25°C) and in 2 weeks, the plastic piece that serves to hold the leg extensions broke, so now I can't use the maximum extension of it. Of course, being a plastic tripod it suffers more with the cold, but I did not expect it to break so easily.I would give it a 4 stars considering the tripod quality however when I contacted the company informing that it broke in just 2 weeks of use, I was completely ignored. So, for that, I'm giving it a 3 stars."
'Quick release camera shoe is a screw knob which is not really quick release.  Would prefer the spring loaded thumb latch.  I like the ball swivel but again it has a screw knob instead of a control rod.
"I recently purchased the SMALLRIG 72"" Aluminum Camera Tripod, and unfortunately, I have mixed feelings about this product. While it does have some decent features, it falls short in several crucial aspects.Let's start with the positives. The adjustable height range from 17"" to 72"" is convenient for various shooting scenarios, and the lightweight design does make it easy to carry around during travel. The ball head and quick release plate are also useful for quick setup and adjustments, which saves time during shoots.However, there are some significant drawbacks that I cannot overlook. First and foremost, the stability of this tripod is quite disappointing. Even with a DSLR camera and a moderate lens, I noticed a fair amount of wobbling and vibrations, especially when fully extended to its maximum height. This compromises the quality of my shots and leaves me feeling uncertain about the overall reliability of the tripod.Furthermore, the build quality is not up to par with other tripods in this price range. The aluminum material feels somewhat flimsy, and I've noticed a few loose components that don't inspire confidence in its durability over time.Another issue I encountered is the limited payload capacity of 15kg/33lb. While it might be sufficient for lightweight cameras or smartphones, it falls short for professional-grade DSLR setups or heavier camera equipment. I had hoped for a more robust payload capacity to accommodate a wider range of gear.Additionally, I found the tripod's leg locks to be quite stiff and challenging to adjust smoothly. This can be frustrating when you need to set up quickly or make on-the-fly adjustments during a shoot.Overall, the SMALLRIG 72"" Aluminum Camera Tripod has its merits with its adjustable height and lightweight design, but the stability, build quality, and limited payload capacity leave much to be desired. Considering the price point, I expected a more robust and reliable tripod for my photography needs. If you require a dependable and sturdy tripod, I would recommend exploring other options before settling for this one."
"It's a tiny bit wobbly when extended, but ok for what i'm using it for.Alu legs and joints is plastic, ball head is plastic, ball is alu.."
Would give 5* but the ball head droops at 1.5kg weight load. Supposedly holds 8kg. Anyone got any suggestions?Will re review if there is a fix
"I have two issues with the tripod. Firstly, Heavier than I was expecting. Secondly, The phone adapter. The adapter doesn't fit my Samsung galaxy s23 ultra."
"I bought this tripod for a hiking trip in Iceland. I needed something lightweight and this seemed to fit the bill. I tried it out before I left and found the parts to be very fragile and flimsy. That said, for the price, I would have been happy if it just lasted for the trip, but it did not. The first day I tried to use it after I arrived, I discovered it was already broken. By the time I got back from my month long trip, it was already too late to return it. If you don't like throwing your money away, don't waste your time with this tripod.I give it a ""zero star"" rating, but the system doesn't let you do that, so that's why there a one star rating."
Bit plasticy with the clips and a bit wobbly. It works fine but it's definitely not manfrotto!
"I have 1 of these tripods and it works fantastic, I ordered another and the left to right swivel doesnt hold its almost like the screw is too short to clamp down or there is too much grease inside"
"I purchased this because it was one of the top search results when I searched for ""Manfrotto"". When it arrived, I found it was not Manfrotto-compatible. I don't know if it a bug in Amazon's search engine or what, but if you're expecting something Manfrotto-compatible, don't waste your money on this."
"Purchased to replace an aging Velbon tripod. This one had a good price and decent reviews. I am really not impressed though. I use a Nikon D5100 and this tripod does not feel sturdy at all, especially when the legs are set to anything other than the first lock. I will be taking it in the field this weekend and will update my review if I am proven wrong. The ball head seems sturdy, that saved it from a lower score."
Wouldn't support the camera on its side.
Tripod is good but arrived without any accessories. Contacted the company who said they would look into it but no further reply. It’s been over a month.
Really Bad Experience.There are more quality product in other brand with affordable pricing but k&f product quality according to price is not upto expectations.
This is the tripod I got straight out of the box and it has clearly been used before.
"Bof, pas professionnel"
"Cheap material. Wobbly. It broke down after two days of use. That thing in the picture supposed to hold the camera when you want to use the camera upside down. I did use the tripod for two days reassembled 3 times and broke. The ad states the tripod stable for an 8kg camera. I use a Nikon D750 with a 16-28 Tokina lens, less then 4kg altogether and the tripod still not stable."
Ball head failes to hold the sigma 100-400 it drifts downwards so where do they claim it holds 7kg 7KG of lies???
The media could not be loaded.
"So I got this tripod to replace the old ring light that I’ve had for years. What I was looking for - a good tripod that’s easily transportable and easy to use, and that’s compatible with both my phone and camera. After using it a few times to film something on my phone (I haven’t tried it with my camera yet) these are my thoughts:What I like about it - it’s easy to use, I love the color (I got the white), can be extended or used as a small tripod, the price is decent, the grip is good (the phone stayed in position)What I don’t like about it - it’s very lightweight, so it’s not very sturdy, I found that my phone would shake and move while filming, which is so annoying. And obviously, there’s no light, so you need a source of light, but I knew that buying it. So I really wish it was sturdier than it is, so that’s really my only complaint. But I guess you get what you pay for."
"This 71"" Phone Tripod & selfie stick had great reviews and the price was great, so I made the purchase. I have to state that I seriously disagree with those that claim this tripod is sturdy, stable and great for video.  When it's fully extended, it's very wobbly and my phone makes it top heavy - a bad combination.  The phone in the verticle position won't sit straight, it tilts and there is no mechanism to tighten or adjust that issue.  The legs and phone holder are a cheap plastic, so I doubt the longivity of the product.... I actually worried I might break the tripod legs just opening them up. It's very lightweight.... which is a pro if your just looking to use it as a selfie stick - it's a negative if your using it as a tripod, which is why I purchased it.  A breeze of 10mph might topple it - especially if using in an extended position. The remote is a handy feature, but it is very tiny and feels flimsy - I feel like it would be easy to lose and easy to break. To be fair, there are some pro's....the remote is very easy to connect to your phone's bluetooth, and my phone responded quickly to the remotes button release for taking a picture. They include an extra battery for the remote - that's nice.  The shorter the tripod is, the more stable it is - so if you're not needing it to be extended very much, it might be ok for you.  Unfortunately, I need it mostly extended for time delayed photos.  Finallly, two things worth mentioning....One,  it's only 71 inches in height IF you include the plastic camera holder in the full verticle position in the measurement. From floor to top of the extention is only 65 inches. Two, the extension is a pull and push - there is nothing to lock the tripod extension in place at different heights. Overtime, I suspect the extension could loosen and not stay in place. I am an amatuer photographer and just wanted an inexpensive tripod to play around with, but even so, this is a disappointing purchase. If you want a truly stable and durable tripod - this is not it, but for $19.99 you get what you pay for."
The little thing when spinning to hold it was so loose that I lost it in the first day now I don't know where I can get a replacement for that small plastic item
"Pros:The max height of this tripod is very high and it’s easy to adjust making it very versatile. It also compacts very well making it good great for on the go footage. It is also easy to adjust the angle of the phone without having to unscrew anything.Cons:The stand is quite thin, making it less stable. I found that video footage was shakey at first if I didn’t let the tripod stop wobbling before recording. If you plan to use it outside, wind might be an issue. Also, getting the tripod legs out is not super easy to figure out."
It's okay and if it's a bit windy it will fall....very flimsy and you definitely can't use the full length as advertised! Very wobbly and thin at the top. But I still use it if you don't need the full length...
"I wasn’t able to use it, piece missing."
"Use with caution if you don’t have the money to replace it. I’m lucky i had a separate attachment that would fit, or else trash. The control does not stay in place where it’s suppose to go on handle, so i would keep the remote somewhere else that is safe."
