"Setup is abysmal. Ive set up a number of portable AC units, and this setup sucks. Cutting right to the point, these are the issues I have with this machine in order of nuisance:1) The window insert is cumbersome, poorly designed, and leaks like a sieve. I had to position the unit vertically in my window, which may have been more difficult than a standard window, but it took me over two hours before I was done. I had to cut the window insert down to size (which the directions do list as a possibility) and that wasn't difficult. However, extensions that slide into the primary piece (the one containing the two vent holes) are narrower than the primary . This means that when the window is setup with the primary insert in the middle, any extension above and/or below are narrower by 1/8"" causing massive amounts of air leakage, and are actually large enough to let in some flies and mosquitoes.2) In relation to my previous point, the AC doesn't contain any weatherstripping, foam insulation - nothing other than the insert. My final setup ended up requiring me to place four wood shims - one to plug each gap - and then place duct tape around the perimeter of the window insert to both help hold it in place (because it wanted to wobble) and to seal the leaks.3) It doesn't have the cooling power of other 14k BTU 'portable' units. Im not comparing it to window units which cool much more efficiently. I used an infrared thermometer to check the air temp coming out, and even pointing straight into the core the lowest temp it registered was 52 degrees. Every AC unit that I've ever used, both window and portable and my car, pump out air cooled to between 34 to 40 degrees. Im guessing this has something to do with the ""eco-friendly"" coolant that they advertise.  In either case, while it did keep my 500sqft space relatively cool, it could never get my indoor temperature colder than 74 degrees, even running all day on high while set to its lowest setting of 61 degrees.4). The fan stays on all the time. There is no energy save mode, so instead of shutting off the fan like many units do, this one continues to run the fan and only shuts off the compressor. I can't attest to energy efficiency - I'll just say that sometimes its nice to have quiet when its cool enough.5) To use the dehumidifier setting, it directs you to remove the intake hose. It can use the fan setting by pulling indoor air through an air intake on the back of the machine (i.e.,  as a closed system without the use of hoses) but for some reason the directions require you to remove and cap off the intake hose before you can use that function. It does, to my surprise, come with caps designed to fit over the ports in the window for when you remove the hoses, however (and this is a big however) the hoses are surprisingly difficult to detach from both the back of the unit and from the window insert. You have to push down HARD and turn the hose in order to release the tabs holding it. If you just try to pull them off you could very easily break the tabs which are necessary to hold the hose in place. Further more, after my explanation of setting up the window insert, try to imagine using the same technique I just described to remove the hose from the insert. Two of my four shims fell out because there was so much movement as I tried to detach the hose.6) There are a couple of pieces that IMHO should be included, but instead are noted in the manual as available for retail purchase through the company. My main gripe is an intake air filter. This is a dual hose unit so one hose takes in air from outside but has no included filter except for the ""pre-filter"" and dust filter than every unit has. That means you can suck in pollen, bugs, or any other impurities that may be present where you live.7) I don't love that the air comes out of the top, but thats not terribly uncommon and my star rating doesn't reflect that. The AC that Ive replaced this with blows from the top too, but the air comes out much colder.PROs:1) It did cool there air enough to be tolerable, so if 75 is the coldest you ever set it then this shouldn't bother you.2). It is a very nice looking machine if you ignore the hoses (and the duct tape in my case). It has a sleek design, a very nice interface and LCD display, and it easily wheels around on floor or thinner carpeting.3). I have no doubt whatsoever that it is one of, if not the single most efficient portable AC units available. Dual hose units will always be more efficient than their single hose counterparts, plus this is manufactured in California which has much stricter efficiency requirements than the rest of the country.Bottom Line: I think this machine is probably well suited for a climate like California, where it is manufactured. If you live somewhere with mild winters, not many bugs and not especially humid, than this could be a great machine for you. Perfect if you are able to set it up and just leave it there year round. The hose caps are included so that if you store the machine during winter, you can just cap off the ports and not worry. Thats not an option for me in New England. Even if i sprayed foam insulation around the insert, its still just a piece of plastic.I really liked the idea of an energy efficient, dual hose, portable AC. In the end, however, I returned it and replaced it with a single hose 14k BTU. Im guessing it draws more energy to cool the house, but unlike this Whynter, it cools well, assembled quickly, and comes with everything you need for setup. If you're going to pay close to $500 for an AC unit, it should contain everything you need.One last thing I'll add, is that its super heavy - about 100 lbs, and trying to repackage everything to send back is no fun."
"First off - there are some really great reviews on Amazon for this item which cover most details. I won't rehash them - but simply add a couple of additional points and my impressions of it's cooling ability. Realistically though - a portable A/C unit should be your last resort. Central air A/C, roof/window mounted evaporative coolers, or window mounted refrigerant-based coolers will all outperform a portable unit - and possibly be more efficient. However - there are situations for which those options do not apply, and thus the Whynter ARC-14S.Home & climate information: I live in dry Colorado, so I haven't needed the drain hose. I've used the unit 5-10 times on days that have reached 90 - 102 degrees outside. The unit is in the living room of a single level ranch home, with two ceiling fans positioned at opposite ends of the floorplan. These two fans, running on low, provide good air circulation throughout. I also have a whole-house fan installed which I run overnight, and that I'm quite impressed with. You can read my review of that product here:  QuietCool ES-2000 Whole House Fan        Back to the Whynter ARC-14S. First - the bad:1. It's got to be tough to design a window mount for so many various sized/constructed windows. That said - Whynter just gave up and shipped something that's about 50% effective. It works, but you have to add some material (foam, gorilla tape, whatever) to provide a seal around the borders of this thing so that when you shut the window - it keeps wind, water, and dirt from getting in. Disappointing.2. The remote. If I turn the unit on manually, the remote has no idea what the settings are. IE - the remote might think the fan is on when the A/C is actually on. You have to cycle through the settings a bit to get the remote caught up. I never use the remote - it's a waste of time if you don't use it exclusively.3. The display temperature isn't consistent. If the fan is on, you'll get the ambient room temperature. If the A/C is on, you'll get the ""target"" temperature instead. That's just a silly, inconsistent design that was likely never user-tested. I purchased a small portable digital thermometer which helps me assess room temperature.4. It's loud. Yes, I know others have mentioned this - but it bears repeating since the product claims ""quiet and efficient cooling"". It's the most obnoxious appliance I've ever owned.From my previous comments, you might be thinking I don't like the Whynter ARC-14S - that's not true. It's just that this unit is pretty rough around the edges; like a best-man showing up at the wedding in a tux, but unshaven, unkept hair, no cufflinks, crooked tie, scuffed shoes. Similarily, Whynter concentrated solely on cooling power and curbside appeal, hoping people would dismiss it's shortcomings. And shortcomings it has aplenty. All said, does it actually cool effectively?I have the ARC-14S in a 13' x 18' living room which has double french doors leading to a office. The living room has an open walkway to the kitchen and hallway that cannot be closed off. I generally run the living-room ceiling fan on low to circulate air during the day.Use #1: Cool the office. When it gets too warm, I turn on the ARC-14S. I use a freestanding  Honeywell Tower Fan        to gently push air from my living room into the office. This method cools the office 5 degrees very quickly (30ish minutes), and further if I run the Whynter unit longer - though I generally prefer shorter cycles. An air circulator, something like the  Vornado 630B        , will do a lot better at pushing air into those extra rooms.Use #2: Cool the living room only. For this, I close the double french doors to the office and turn on the ARC-14S. The unit cools my modest sized living room quite rapidly - providing a comfortable amount of cool air which is circulated around the living room by the ceiling fan.In pure cooling terms, it makes things comfortable on the warmest of days, and I'm happy with that aspect. However - it is finicky. If I'm home and can turn the unit on JUST AS the interior temperature starts climbing into uncomfortable levels, the unit cools quickly and adequately. However - if I return home after being gone all day, say at 5pm when the interior is very warm & stuffy, the ARC-14S struggles to cool things down. This is a pretty normal scenario for using the Whynter unit since it seems designed to cool-on-demand, vs. hold a room at a constant temperature. Take note:  the Whynter ARC-14S has never hit it's 61 degree target. After two solid hours of operation, set for 61, the air coming out was 65 - and the room was over 70. Information on sites like consumerreports.org support the observation that ""portable A/C units fail to cool to advertised temperatures"" - so understand the compromises if you decide to take this path.For very limited scenarios (smaller rooms, good air circulation), I happen to think that the Whynter ARC-14S is a good option. It's a fraction of the cost of central air A/C - though it performs at a much lower level. If you keep your cooling and energy efficiency expectations in check - the ARC-14S should work out well for you. Direct comparisons to window-mounted units will result in disappointment. While the ARC-14S cools my modestly sized living room and office well enough, I find it loud, brash, and too rough around the edges to merit more than three stars."
"Bought this as an emergency backup for power outages on the Texas Gulf coast.  It is large and heavy but has nice coasters on the bottom, so pushing it around our wooden floors was very easy.  No way this baby is going upstairs.  It blows cold, but since it draws air from outside the house the incoming air is pretty damp.  It's definitely better than nothing during a hot summer power outage.  Just something to keep in mind if you live in humid areas.  We ran it a few days in our bedroom after the power came back.  Humidity in the main part of the house with central ac was about 50%.  In the bedroom with this unit pumping in additional cold air (with hoses attached to window) the humidity was closer to 63% due to the moist air it was pulling from outdoors.  It does dehumidify (outdoor humidity that day was 80% due to a rain storm, so our bedroom was a little drier than outdoors) and probably works great in parts of the country with low humidity.  Dry climate would be ideal.  It's a little loud.  When the compressor is off it sounds like a fan.  When it kicks on its not terrible but it does have a rhythmic low droning that annoyed me at night.  One minor beef is that the drain plug is at the very bottom of the unit.  It's not difficult to reach, but the design seems to require you to tilt the unit to get all the water out.  At 80 lbs, its a bit of a chore.  Other than that, we store the unit in the closet.  Again, its an emergency backup and better than nothing.  Would probably work great in dry climates where humidity is not a problem.  Blows nice and cold and not too loud.  If you don't have to mess to often with the drain, this could be a good unit for you.  Not sure if I would buy it again, but all these portables will suffer from the same limitations due to the way they operate, and this one got good reviews by others."
"I am so dissapointed in this AC. It has a great consumer rating and came with a remote, so I had high hopes, but it completely failed to meet them.  Do not buy this unit. There are quite a few, frankly baffling design choices that make other ACs far better options. Will it cool a room? Kinda? But you can find a unit that is half the BTU that does a better job.Problems:1 - the thermostat has a 5 degree +/- envelope in which it will shut off the compressor and keep the fan running on low to save power when it nears your target temp. Problem is that means the unit is constantly shutting down the cold air to blow hot air through itself back into the room. You can actually feel the heat spikes when it happens, as well as smell the moisture from inside the unit.2 - speaking of moisture, the condensation release plug on the back is on the very bottom of the unit. On top of that, there is only one. Most units I've used had a second one near the top. This means if you want to empty the condensation reservoir by hand like I do, you can't just tip the unit back. The plug is against the floor. On top of the the air hoses don't slide off the unit like most do, they lock in place. That sounds good on paper, but it means when you go to empty the reservoir the thing is stuck in place and you have to literally raise it up somehow to get a pan or cup under the water spout. And those locking air hoses get stuck, at least on my unit, so they are a bear to get off. I am always worried I'm going to break the locking clips.3 - for some reason the air vent points straight up instead of forward. I know in theory this means the hotter air in the room raises up and pushes the cold air that's being shot at the ceiling down, causing circulation. In practice tho all that happens is the cold air mixes with the hot air before you ever feel it. If you put your hand more than two feet away from the vent you literally can't feel the cool air anymore.4 - For some strange reason as the sun sets every day this unit completely stops working. At dusk every night the inside temps are consistently and suddenly higher than the outside temp despite the unit still running full blast. I have no idea why this happens. Because of this we have to shut it off at sunset, just after the hottest part of the day, and open the windows.Before this unit I had a QVC brand one that was by no means a good AC. It was rated at almost half the BTU this new one is, and yet it did a far better job cooling the room. This one bottoms out at a set 61F, but on days when the outside temp is in the low 90s it has never been able to bring my inside temps below 72-74 degrees. By contrast the QVC unit only went down to a set 62 degrees, but  always kept the room temp around 64. Now I'm not saying to get a QVC unit. After all I replaced it because it died on me and it was way more expensive than it should have been. But the fact that this unit performs worse than the old one does, and has all the added design flaws on top of that, should go a long way to show you that you can find better units for nearly $100 cheaper."
"Pros:- AC works great! it cooled my room quickly and efficiently- Dehumidifier works great too and it’s easy to drain- Love that it has wheels- I like that you can see the temp on the remote as most AC remotes I’ve had don’t include that- Easy to install! Besides the window kit issue mentioned below it was very easy to install.Cons:- Inaccurate website description concerning window kit. The window kit did not include a small extender so I had to buy a saw to cut one of the large extenders down to size.- Bulky for a bedroom.- Loud! I’m used to the noise of a window AC and while this was only a smidge louder, the noise also constantly fluctuated, so it wasn’t a loud white noise that I could just ignore.- Remote and Unit didn’t sync. The remote would have a different temperature and setting reading than the unit and they wouldn’t be synced to read the same temp and other function settings.- Remote not bright or illuminated well to see display screen. Impossible to use at night unless you have lights on.- Buttons on unit are not easy to see. You have to be very close to the unit to see the symbols etched into the buttons, which makes them kind of useless. For future models of the unit I recommend that the buttons should have darker etched symbols or lit up.- Over priced considering the issues I’ve mentioned aboveIn the end I’m going to return it, but if you are looking for an portable AC for somewhere not your bedroom this is a good option is in-window units aren’t possible"
"I bought this to cool a family room area and appreciated the dual inverter system. It worked fine to bring down temps when outside 90 or less and not too humid but when temps rise outside it can't keep up and maxed out unable to bring inside temp below 80 despite running non-stop.The issue is instead of recycling indoor air and  progressively reducing the temp, it is trying to cool down the outside air it constantly draws in without any benefit of air return. It's like trying to air condition the room with a window open.  Temps get over 100 in the summer here so I can imagine it is of no use when constantly trying to cool 100 degree air to below 80. I got so fed up I finally decided to disconnect the air intake hose and let it draw from inside air. What a difference that made.  Now instead of trying to air condition outside temps nonstop it is able to gradually bring down inside temps by cooling down air that reduces in temp as recycled. Just like a centeal ac system recycles inside air to progressively bring down temps, letting if draw from cooler inside air brings down temps faster and with less strain on unit.I would not recommend a dual hose system if you live in an area where temps get above 95 in summer. The dual inverter is nice to prevent water accumulation but the 2 hose system actually leads to inefficient cooling and non stop use trying g to reach a temp it can never achieve."
"The good: It coolsThe Bad: It is too loud (even on low setting) to stay in the same room with it, and the fan never shuts off! It is heavy and bulky.The window kit is extremely leaky and poorly designed; have plenty of painters tape on hand! The control buttons are hard to read It should come with an insulated exhaust hose! It should come with a filter for the intake hose!It's just a really unpleasant unit to have in your room. I would like to be able to cool the upstairs of our small house with it during the day and quickly and easily pull the vent kit out of the window to take advantage of our wonderful cool night time temps, but until I make big modifications to the window vent kit it is such a big hassle! I have to re-tape all the gaps and holes each time.Please think twice before getting this unit! I am not sure if I will work around the problems, or send the unit back. I will give it a day or two and then decide.One correction: The fan will shut off, but it takes a half hour to do so. I never saw this fact in the manual, but Whynter customer service explained it to me.I also forgot to mention that a 1.5 cm piece of hard black plastic rattled through the fan and flew out of the cold air vent at a high velocity when I turned the unit on for the first time.My experience communicating with customer service has been frustrating, because they don't seem to get the photos that I send them and they don't seem to comprehend the details that I tell them.Since the unit seems to be working normally, and I have had enough hassles, I think I will keep it.However, I do not recommend Whyntner products based on my limited experience with them."
"The air conditioner itself seems to work well, it does cool down the room we have it in. I'd want to use it for longer to really put it to the test. We've only used it a few times right now. However, the instructions for putting it together were not accurate at all. I eventually had to give up and just put it together myself. They gave me screws to use for the intake and exhaust hoses, but they literally were too short and effectively useless. The construction itself feels cheap. Like the actual working parts inside seem like they're in good condition, but the plastic that the air conditioner is made out of and the parts are pretty cheap compared to the other portable A/Cs we have (Black and Decker and another brand). It also uses a lot of energy (but really all portable A/Cs do, so not sure you can get around that). I do think having two hoses helps, because unfortunately due to the way our apartment is laid out, we need to have it in our kitchen which can get pretty hot, even though we try not to use the stove/oven during the hottest of days. This definitely seems like it has an easier time cooling down the space, but since it's only been used a few times the jury is still out...stay tuned to see if I update this review, I guess, lol!"
"I searched high and low to replace my 2019 LG 10,000 BTU AC after it started to requiring a daily dialysis of draining.After spending hours researching, I learned there’s no perfect portable AC: they are loud, they can leak, they can up a lot of room, they aren’t attractive, and they will work in varying levels of success. A window AC is the actual solution, but that’s not an option because of my window.Finding this Whynter is probably the best I can do.Pros:- I’m cooling a 250-300 sq foot office with a vertically sliding window: cools it well- I appreciate the carbon filter for the poor air quality in Denver, while I also use an air filterCons:- It's loud, though not as long as other units (at least this one stays continually on). Don’t be fooled by the pictures: this isn’t “whisper quiet” or “almost as quiet as a library” or “so quiet a baby could sleep through it.” It’s more like “tolerable for a portable AC, adjust expectations accordingly.""- It’s HUGE for the space, and the dual exhaust feels like it takes up infinitely more room. The external exhaust hose gets HOT, and I can feel it as I stand at my desk.Are there other Mideas, Whynters, LGs or other brands that are better than this one? Not that I’ve found. The only other one I find on the list of repeats is the Midea Duo, and I haven’t tested that. But even that one has leaking issues according to reviews.Sigh. So I’ll try this and see how it goes."
"I thought, ""How could I go wrong???"" with an AC with over 10k reviews and 4.5 stars?!I went wrong by not reading enough of the reviews, or enough of the older reviews, and by not looking through all of the images from reviews.When I unboxed this unit, it was immediately noticeable that something was very wrong with it. One side of the front panel was just open, like a mini-fridge door that's not shut all the way. I found photos (after the fact, of course) that look exactly like the unit I received, broken in the same place, and, in one of the photos, a man is holding the EXACT SAME piece of plastic that I fished out of the fan on the unit I received.The entire front panel of this unit does not fit. Like, it's not the correct panel for the unit and should be on a slightly smaller one, because it lines up fine on one side but is not wide enough to line up on the other side where the back panel is screwed into the front panel - those screws are visible on the broken side with the broken bits of plastic they were screwed into on the front panel still on them. It's more than obvious that the panel isn't the right size and yet the manufacturer/assembler forced it anyway and this is the result.In addition to that, this is listed as a 14,000 BTU unit yet the ENERGYGUIDE sticker right on the front of the unit says 9,500 BTUs. So. Did someone stick the control panel for a 9,500 BTU onto the body of a 14,000 BTU unit? Is that why it very clearly doesn't fit? Who knows? From many, many other reviews, I gather nobody does and Whynter isn't very forthcoming with anything even close to resembling customer service, so...I am disabled and unable to do anything with this weirdo broken unit and Amazon has been kind enough to ship a replacement without requiring the return. Otherwise, I wouldn't be up a creek without a paddle, I'd be in the ER with heat stroke.After getting all of this dealt with, I actually hooked the unit up and turned it on (which is when I found the plastic part because it immediately started rattling and I shut it right back off) and... well... it cools, alright. I can say at least that much about it. Again, though, going from some of the other, older reviews, I suspect this unit is going to fail in the same way many of theirs did, and the issue could be mismatched components.Anyway, be wary and be ready to start the return process if you decide to buy one of these - unbox it very carefully and check it as well as you can without removing ALL of the packaging. That was my mistake. I work the night shift and sleep during the day and my apartment building was not built to stay cool, it was built to stay warm, and it really does! I only have 3 windows, all on one side and in 3 different rooms. I was so excited to finally not be a hot, sweaty mess every day that I got home from work at 7am and methodically opened everything, the window kit, all of it, to get ready, and THEN discovered the broken panel. Unboxing is one thing, and it was a really hard thing for me to do, but RE-boxing??? Uhuh, no way, I cannot do that without extreme pain and risk of further injury.So, thanks again, Amazon, for making this right for me.Whynter? Get yourself together."
"This product was very difficult to set up, nothing like the cute video. I had to cut the window inserts, which required help. The instructions had me trying to twist the caps onto the accordion tubes the wrong way. After ten minutes of fighting with it, I tried the opposite direction and it worked, but by then the accordion  had retracted and caught my arm, pinching it so severely that it left a bruise for almost a week.That being said, it works great! It cools almost instantly, but the fan kicks into high gear so often, even though I set it for low, that the noise is annoying. I can't imagine sleeping with this in the room.I couldn't return it because of the adjustments I made to the window extenders, so I gave it away. It's not for me. If there are two of you putting it together and fitting it into a window, or if you're leaving it stationary for the season, this might work for you. But it's not easy to do alone."
"I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this item. Many sites recommended this, as did many reviewers, which I did take into account. I knew I should get a dual hose unit and while I knew they were bigger in size, for just a bit more money, I was under the impression the performance warranted it. It seemed obvious to me that while a portable AC unit (single or dual) is expensive any way you cut it, better to have one that did what you wanted or else a slightly cheaper one was still hundreds of dollars of wasted money. The video on this site really made me feel at ease, as if yes, I CAN DO THIS! I'm a WOMAN TOO! Well, I will tell you, while I knew this was 100 lbs, you don't actually think about what that feels like once it is dropped off at your door. It's really heavy. This machine is SO TALL. I'm 5'3"" and it was just a monster. It is a pretty machine. It's not ugly. But it is SO BIG. So much talk about cooling off a SMALL ROOM. Think about that. Imagine a mini fridge in that small room (one stacked on top of each other, really) and do you have space for that? Even still, I went ahead with the assembly. I spent over 40 minutes trying to get the attachments on the tubes. I wanted to crush them and throw them out the window. It hurt my fingers, it frustrated me and I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. The video made every step seem so easy. It wasn't. I am glad I got the extra foam tape because there are gaps in window if you use the extension, its small but its there. So you need the tape. Unsightly though. Maybe try to get cream colored instead of silver. I read a review and put the piece of construction paper to act as a pseudo-wall between the exhaust hoses. I positioned the unit (thankfully on wheels) and turned it on. I have a side sliding window so I realized that I would need to get curtains or some other cover and that made me sad because its just another thing to do/get. It makes no sense to have so much sunlight streaming into an already hot room, which I can't use the blinds now. But for this review and for my initial set up, it was night time, so I wanted to see what this machine can do. I mean, DUAL HOSES, right? I put it on 73 at first (it was about 90 all day and currently at set up time, the room was about 75 with fans going). I turned off the fans so I can get a good sense of chill. It did feel like a colder fan. But it did not feel like AC. I let it go for about 40 minutes. Came in. Again, just felt like a cooler room but not AC type of cool. I put the temp down to 69 and came back in an hour (had the fan speed on full too). It was just ok. And honestly, I just hated the sight of it. The tubing, so bulky (I wish they were thinner tubes but I understand that is not practical), and it just took up so much space. It's a big big machine. I turned it off around 10pm when I went to bed and it was just ok. The noise was loud but not bad. You could get work done with it and you could be on the phone. Some sleepers might like it (those who prefer high fan sounds vs light humming sounds). The next morning, I came in, and of course. sun streaming in, the room was getting hot. I tried to adjust the tubes to look a little neater and they came apart from the connectors. It was so hard to get them to connect again. I thought about just duct taping it and never doing it again. But then for a $600 machine, why do THAT. The whole point of this was it looks cool and works. I put it on and in an hour, it really didn't blow my mind. So, this was morning, sunlight coming in and I just decided. its not for me. The bulk, the tubes, the so-so chill. I honestly think maybe a smaller single hose, that is at least  a bit better than a fan might be better. This was supposed to be SO COLD. I didn't get that. So for me, it wasn't worth the money or the eye sore.  Two stars because if you are doing this yourself (and around 5""3), its really hard to take out, assemble and even harder to try and get back in the box to return. All cut up and in pain. I did remember to drain it, which alot of water was there for just my little bit of usage. And you should take that one review to heart. A shallow dish (about half inch off ground) is best with a tube. It's too heavy to tilt to completely empty and it will go everywhere. If you are concerned about your fancy floors, maybe get a mat/rug to put under this. It will leak if you aren't careful when you empty water."
"The problem with the timer is so egregious, I have to give this two stars to warn people about it.To the good, this dual-hose A/C is extremely powerful, and it is able to completely cool my 600 square foot apartment all day without incident by adding just one strategically placed fan on low. Two hoses means we don't have to deal with door suction when closing the bedroom door. The problem arises when we go to bed.According to the manual, ""if the set temperature is within 5⁰F of the ambient temperature, the unit runs in fan only mode. This saves energy and prolongs the life of the compressor of the air conditioner. Once the set temperature is achieved, the compressor will turn off and THE FAN RUNS CONTINUOUSLY to circulate the air within the room."" (emphasis mine).What actually happens in that it runs until FAR below the set temperature, then it switches to fan only mode (and yes, I can easily hear the difference), and then some time later, the unit turns off completely. So, a typical night for us is: we go to bed with the A/C on, set to 72⁰.  It cools the room down to 65⁰ then switches to fan mode. I fall asleep some time during that process. I wake up some time later to find the room is 75⁰ and the unit is off. I hit a button on the remote and it comes to life, and I go back to sleep, only to wake up later to find it off in a warm room. This happened SIX times just last night. So either the manual LIED or I have a DEFECTIVE unit. I don't have a good workaround for this and consider this to be a real problem that affects its usability. I will be attempting a return here pretty soon because we can't keep getting awakened by an air conditioner not doing what it's supposed to."
"When it's cooling, this machine is great. The problem is, half the time it's not cooling.The instruction manual says it has a 5° ""cushion zone"", and within 5° of your desired temperature, the compressor will turn off and it will be fan only.This means if you want to set it to 61 (the coolest setting), it'll actually only go to 66, at which point the compressor will turn off. When the compressor turns off, that's when the sour musty smell begins.My first thought was mold or bacterial growth, but I just received this unit literally yesterday. It has been less than 24 hours since using it, and whenever the unit isn't actively cooling with the compressor on, the fan emits a sour musty smell.This wouldn't be a problem if the unit would turn off the fan when it wasn't actively cooling, but that's not an option. The fan stays on all the time.This also wouldn't be a problem if it didn't have that stupid 5° cushion zone, and it actually cooled down to 61. When you have a large room, you need to set the temperature low so the opposite end of the room still gets cool."
"All the reviews or videos that I looked at discussed how quiet the fan is when it’s running. None of them mentioned that it actually gets a little bit louder than that when the compressor turns on, so it’s definitely not as quiet as the reviewers in those videos are saying. It’s not a dealbreaker But if you’re looking at this for how quiet it is definitely consider that when the compressor kicks on it does get a bit louder.It does cool very effectively. And the hoses are not as flexible as I thought they’d be from looking at the other reviews as well, they are pretty stiff.And for the window kit, it mentioned that it’s from like 20 to 60 inches, also read somewhere that it can be trimmed. The kit is made from a very hard plastic, not trimmable. And I could only use the part of the kit the hoses attached to, both extensions were too long and would block where the hose would go if I shrunk it down to where I needed it. So I’ll have to be looking into someway to modify its fit or another kit all together."
"I purchased the ARC-14S to hopefully replace a dead dehumidifier and dying window AC with a single unit for a 1000sqft finished basement.  I purchased it on recommendation from a family member that owns one and loves it.  Unfortunately it doesn't work very well as a dehumidifier for me.  I tried it on dehumidify and cool modes, with all kinds of configurations of the hoses connected out the window, but unfortunately it was never able to get the humidity below 60%.  It either made the room warm up to 80F and 70%+ humidity, or it cooled the room down to 68F and still 65-70% humidity.  I even contacted Whynter support and they basically told me to use different configurations of hoses (exhaust on but intake off, exhaust off but intake on, both on, both off) and while some were better than others, none worked well for dehumidifying.For cooling, it works great.  It's able to get the basement down to 70F or below within a few hours.  So if you need an air conditioner and can't manage a window unit, this is good.  But if you have humidity that you want to remove, it's not that great.Also of note, it's a massive power hog.  I wish I realized it before I purchased it or I probably wouldn't have bought it, but it draws up to 11A/120V, or about 1300W.  That's a lot.  Unfortunately the only place that I can put it are either on a circuit with my kitchen's microwave, or with a refrigerator.  I opted for the microwave circuit because at least then I would notice when that circuit trips, rather than not noticing for a while and losing our second refrigerator worth of food.  I will have to add a circuit for just the microwave, and that's not a problem caused by the AC, but just an unfortunate that it is so power hungry.In the end I'm going to have to purchase another standalone dehumidifier and just use this for cooling as needed."
"I bought this AC unit and to be fair to date 6-12-2014 I don't know just how good it cools. I live up in the mountains and so far this year we have only had a couple of warm days and have not needed this yet.When I received this unit I let it set several hours in place before I plugged it in and fired it up. Reason being is to let the oil in the compressor settle to the bottom because I had it fairly leaned over on it's back in the box it came in getting it up the stairs of the house to the room I wanted it in.After the better part of four hours sitting in place I powered it up. It sounded fine for the first few seconds until the compressor started up. The compressor was fine but the outer plastic casing/cover buzzed like you wouldn't believe! After pushing and pulling here and there on the cover in several places it would quieten up. But as soon as I let go of it, back to buzzing like mad.Long story short this is not the easiest thing to return just by it's size and weight and where I live, so I took the cover apart to see if I could find the problem. I found two things. One was one of the screws that hold the front and back covers together was broken off. It had to be done at the factory when they put it together and over torqued the screw so it busted off the mount it went into on the opposite cover.The biggest thing I saw wrong with this is inside there are three what I would call supports that look like ribs that come across from one side to the other. One at the bottom, one in the middle and one at the top. They had what looked like door weather stripping insulation on them to keep them from touching the front cover. This material is very sub-par in my opinion! Very cheap and takes no effort at all to collapse it with your finger. Just by luck of the draw I happen to have some of the very same stuff only this was made by 3M and is a very what I would say dense foam rubber and was 5/8 inch width if memory serves which is just about exactly the width of what cheap stuff is that came with this unit. I peeled the tape off of the weather stripping I had and just stuck it right on top of what came with the unit just for the extra thickness. I put the front cover back on and screwed it back together. I used 1/4 inch hex head screws as the Phillips head screws that came with it were cheap soft headed screws that just started eating the heads out upon taking the screws out. The piece that was busted off inside I just left it off. It seems fine without it and I figured that if I epoxy'd it back on, it would be a matter of time before it got weak and broke and then have it start buzzing.After getting it back together I fired it up and nice and quiet like it should have been from the get go! Now to be fair I have not really used it since but at the time I ran if for a few hours and it stayed nice and quiet. At least as quiet as a unit like this is going to be.One other thing to mention, The front LCD panel on this lights up in blue which is fine but I think the manufacture ought to just have it light up for five to ten seconds when you start it up or make an adjustment to it like temp, fan etc. then go out, other than have it stay on constantly! We have this unit in our bedroom and I had to put a piece of black duct tape across the LCD screen because otherwise it glows like a spot light. In the daytime it would be no big deal but night time, it is! The remote has the exact same LCD screen display on it so I don't care what the unit itself is showing since the remote shows the exact same.So, I don't recommend this unit! I base that on how cheap I saw it to be made internally and by the lack of proper dampening. At this time I cannot tell how well it cools as I have not had the chance to really put it through it's paces yet but will edit this in the future as the summer approaches.By the way, the room I have this in is right at 300 sq ft. So it should cool it with no problem. Especially since I have external window coverings that keeps the sun off of the rooms windows.Also wanted to add, in the booklet that comes with the unit it mentions that if the unit is quite noisy it could be the outlet it is plugged into does not have sufficient wiring or rather heavy enough gauge wire to handle the amperage draw which definitely can be true but not in this case. If memory serves the unit max draw is 10.8 amps which would be initial compressor start up but then drop down afterward. The outlet I have this plugged into is 20 amp with 12 gauge wire about thirty feet from a 200 amp panel. Definitely not the problem with the units covers buzzing so much.By the way, The unit I received is not like the one pictured here. Shape is the same but where it shows it being silver is a black or more like a dark charcoal gray. I like mine better actually!"
"I ordered this to replace two Midea Duo units that failed - one in less than two seasons, and the second in less than one month!I had high hopes for the Whynter based on the product page description, reviews, and Good Housekeeping rating. While it lived up to the hype on quickly cooling down my office (I use it in my upstairs office where our new central HVAC system can't seem to keep up with the 100+ degree Texas weather.), it is just too loud for my use case. Even though Midea's quality control is terrible, and their customer service even worse, Midea's Inverter Compressor is measurably quieter than the rotary compressor in the Whynter ARC-14S. I measured the decibel level in the mid-60s for the Whynter and mid-40s for the Midea with both on low.Maybe I got a defective unit. Either way, I'm sending it back. The search continues for a portable/supplemental A/C for my office that is reasonably priced, performs well, and is quiet enough to have on during meetings."
"I have mixed emotions about this AC unit.First, the good:1.  It was easy to assemble and get the unit up and running, and it does cool the space as advertised.2.  I have not noticed my electric bill going up much, so it seems to be pretty efficient.3.  It does not seem to be any louder than any window unit I have had, so it is not hard to be in the same room with.4.  It pulls lots of moisture out of the air.  Very good for people in Florida.Next, the not so good:1.  After 1 1/2 months of use, it kept filling up with water, requiring draining.  The drain is VERY close to the floor, so it is hard to get any reasonably sized container under it.  It holds a substantial amount of water, so you need to be ready to get the plug back in the drain hole to empty your container, or you get to mop the floor.2.  Upon reading the manual, it said that if the unit fills up frequently, you should contact customer service.  Upon doing so, they indicated it was probably the condenser fan, which apparently blows the hot exhaust air onto the water to evaporate it for exhaust, had probably disconnected or failed.  They offered to send a replacement fan. or to accept the unit for warranty repair.3.  Please note that while the unit has a one year warranty, you are responsible for shipping it to California after the first two months.  You are also expected to keep the 'box' the unit was shipped in for return shipment.  I use the term 'box' because the packaging essentially fell apart after the shipping straps were cut.  The styrofoam was all crushed beyond re-use -- I know, that's what it is there for, to crush and protect the unit.  Finally, the box would require half a closet to store.4.  I had asked if there was any sort of drain kit available, and was directed to another website for the kit.  A white, corrugated 84 inch hose was shown, for a price of $20.  I got a 12 inch piece of vinyl tubing.  (To seller's credit, after I complained, they did ship the white hose.)  I took the measurements from the piece of tubing, and wen to the hardware store and bought a 20 foot piece of 1/2 inch vinyl hose for about 9 dollars.  At this point, I'm not real pleased with customer service -- why couldn't they have told me to get a piece of tubing, rather than telling me I needed to buy a $20 ""kit?""5.  Because of the warranty provisions, recognize that you are going to be out of pocket a significant sum if something breaks after the first 2 months -- paying for packaging (unless you have a lot of room to store the box, and can also fabricate something to replace the missing styrofoam) and shipping a 90 pound unit to CA.6.  I also bought a square trade extended warranty, which has more rational shipping policies, but it does not kick in until the manufacturer's warranty expires.  So, I'm hoping nothing else goes wrong until after the first year is up.So, I'm cool for now, and keeping my fingers crossed hoping it survives to the end of the year!"
"This unit is HUGE, HEAVY AND HARD TO SETUP IN CASEMENT WINDOW! Check dimensions.  You may have to rearrange your room around it since it has to be by a window.If you have a traditional horizontal hung window—get a traditional window air conditioner.  If you are NOT handy and have casement windows, hire a handyman to install—so much adaptations and modifications needed to block the open window.  IT DRAWS A LOT OF POWER AND WILL TRIP THE CIRCUIT BREAKER IF SHARING A CIRCUIT WITH SOMETHING LARGE LIKE AN ATTIC FAN OR MICROWAVE.  You only have to vent the exhaust tube outside.  The intake tube can suck room air (spoke to a representative to confirm this).  That makes installing only one vent out the window a bit easier and the metal frame to hold tubes is pointless for a casement window.One positive thing….It cools the room fast and effectively.  (It does not cool more than one room without fans etc.)"
"I have only been using this unit for a few days so far and I am happy with it performance overall, but there are some issues.I have owned many portable units and have done a lot of research in my purchases of these units. The dual hose system is a MUST. Without it, your pulling cooled air to the outside on a single hose unit to cool it. This creates a vacuum bringing warm into your room and home to replace it though any openings.When shopping, watch the ratings on portables as there are TWO. One is it's actuall size rating and the other (lower number) is it's ACTUAL cooling rating. This is because portables are less efficient than window units.For this unit:PROSIt is able to keep up with the higher humidity here well unlike others I've had.It has a higher actual cooling capacity to physical rating than others I compared.Dual hose design allows fast, far more efficient cooling. I am able to keep this unit set higher for same cooling than my old.Climate control setting stays in range.CONSThis unit is noisier than others I've owned but not unbearable.The remote is pretty cheap. Buttons are sloppy and I've already noticed they sometimes don't always change a setting on each press. In two cases it also operated button next to it. Will have to call company.Hoses don't even come assembled like every portable unit I have ever owned.Two BIGGEST fails:Window install kit is VERY small. Every other unit I have owned included kits that extended up to 72"" and one was even larger. Larger windows are most common now so this is just them being cheap.The biggest fail of all is this company NOT including a pre filter for the air intake on this dual hose unit. I was shocked to find out they make you pay an extra $33 for this 100% necessary part. This part stops your unit from sucking in fine dust, pollen, bugs etc from outside. At over $500, it's RIDICULOUS this isn't included.They include a generic so called ""carbon filter"" for ""odors"" which will do nothing as it's horribly thin and that its even cut too small. They could eliminate that and include the essential part that costs them 43 cents to make.PS I bought the filter at $33 as I don't have time to mess with making something as others do, and don't want crap in my unit. I got it today. It's cheaper material than the units vent hose couplings. It fits loosely. The so called filter screen that's inside is cheaply installed and looks like it will fall out in no time. Complete ripoff and horrible this company does this to it's customers. I doubt I would buy from this company again. I will update after using this item longer."
"At first glance, this looks like a mega beast of a portable AC. It looks quite posh with its digital screen and sleek curves. Don’t let that fool you.  I got this to replace a one and a half year old 8000 BTU window unit from Medea. According to the specs, and even the reviews, this should’ve been sufficient to cool an RV. Not only did it fail at this, it performed worse than the failing window unit it was replacing.  As you can see from the graph in the picture, this used quite a bit more energy than the old window unit. And that is saying something because the old window unit is an energy sucker. I thought because the main unit would be out of the sun and inside the cool RV, we would be saving energy on top of energy. Boy was I wrong.  Initially, I was horribly surprised by the size of the unit. But that is my fault because I didn’t check exactly how big it was. It is a enormous. If it was hollow, I would have no problem fitting my 5’4 lady body into the unit. It is incredibly heavy, and if it didn’t have wheels, there is no way you would wanna move this anywhere. It would definitely not be portable. I’m questioning whether this is technically portable as it is with wheels.  The hoses are of substantial quality, and I was impressed by their heavy duty-ness. They bend any which way you need them to, and they are quite long. The portion included for attaching to a window is maddening. There’s no way you’re going to get an airtight seal with what’s included. We used a portion of the Styrofoam that came in the packaging to seal this part to the window better. You’re going to need a lot of duct tape, and even then this is not going to be a strong fit for any window.  I had this AC running in the same place the window unit was, under the same conditions, using exactly the same items as the days previous. There was absolutely nothing different about the days that I switched the AC’s, besides, the AC itself being switched out. The outdoor temperature was also quite similar. Disclaimer: we live in the desert and it’s currently 107. I do not have high hopes for any air conditioner under these conditions, so I took that heavily into account. I ran the old window unit on max cool, lowest temp, highest fan, which is what I put this unit on from moment one.  As you can see on the day that I plugged it in mid day, there was already an energy usage increase. The next day, when this AC unit was used solely for the entire day, you can see that there was another increase in energy usage. A substantial amount. Essentially I paid $400 more for a larger unit that takes up more space that is less efficient and doesn’t cool as well.  I have no clue why this unit has such great ratings. Besides the fact that it looks nice, after you get over the sheer size, there is nothing to write home about. There are actually many things to complain about. I plan on returning this, which will be a feat in and of itself."
"This unit definitely does its job cooling a room. We have this in our 434 sq ft master bedroom as we like it in the low 60's to sleep, but have the central AC set to 70 for the rest of the house. This unit has no problem keeping the room at 61 even in 90 degree weather, and I haven't noticed a drastic spike in electric usage. (I frequently monitor our meter) The unit also surprisingly hasn’t required the condensation tank to be drained. Our unit has run every day from 7PM-6AM for 2 months and I just drained it for curiosity sake and only got about 12oz out of it. That said, the unit certainly has its fair share of cons as well:- Very loud. After 2 months of the unit seemingly getting louder I got out the dB meter I use for setting up stereo systems and the unit averaged 73-77 decibels with the compressor running. (think hair dryer, vacuum, loud restaurant) Anyone that claims they can hear the TV across the room with this thing running simply isn’t telling the truth. I had to hang speakers directly above our headboard and use an external amp to hear the TV over the unit running. The unit is completely across the room from our bed and still frequently wakes my wife and I up.- Window mounting hardware is AWFUL. I can’t understand why the window mount isn’t accordion-style like the rest of the industry . . . or come assembled. Fortunately for me, I have a radial arm saw and some construction experience, so I was able to cut everything to size, get it assembled, silicone all of the joints, buy and install weather stripping, and buy and install security hardware to keep it in place, but it was no picnic even with the correct tools and knowhow.- As other reviewers have mentioned, the cool intake and hot exhaust ports are literally side by side with no barrier. This unquestionably leads to poor performance and excess electrical usage. I ended up measuring the distance between the mounting panel and the window screen and installed an exhaust tunnel to direct the hot exhaust air away from the intake.- Connections are loose / have gaps. I ended up having to silicone nearly all of the hose and coupling connections due to the fact that they mate rather poorly.- Whynter charges a whopping $33 for the 50 cent optional intake filter that should be included for free with the unit. That said, you should either pony up the money for it or slip a thin mesh between the fittings. After about 500 hours of use ours was rather filled up with pollen and dust.- Complete lack of instructions."
"My central AC broke and while awaiting for the AC repair guy (over-booked at the beginning of the season), I thought that buying a portable unit would be a stop gap solution to the week-end heat challenge. A window unit did not seem like a solution (I tried a few times and dropped a few) as I was looking at the movable feature. So, I carefully reviewed the portable AC units and this unit came up at the same rating than the  LG Electronics LP1414GXR 115-volt Portable Air Conditioner with LCD Remote Control, 14000 BTU        on ConsumerReport (rating 52) but the Amazon rating gave a better edge to this one so ... I decided to go with this one.The unit has a few drawbacks and I will start with those as I think customer should be aware of those:- First, please take note of the weight: it is 100 Lb and hard to carry by one person. Moving the unit to an upstairs will be a challenge. Its competitor noted above weighs 71.7 pounds (1/4 difference makes a big difference). One thing to consider.- The windows kit is simply awful and clunky - I worked on this for a good 45 mnts before making really air-tight and actually stay in the window. Forget about that promo-video with a smiling woman (your first hint you are being tricked), it will not be as easy and ""simple"" - it will require insulating foam (buy it right away). The two vent design is also very poor: the exhaust is essentially next to the intake making the flow inefficiently sucking back in the hot air expelled. I did not plug at all the intake. Also, the hose fixture is not very flexible, the unit will need to be a foot away from the wall as a result (imaging this in your leaving room).- The drainage is of poor design - putting a flat dish below the drain?? Really?? I would have wished for a removable drawer like the  Frigidaire FAD704DWD Energy Star 70-pint Dehumidifier        or at least, a high up reservoir with a tube for drainage. So, I do not recommend using it as a dehumidifier myself ...- This unit is NOT silent  - but none of the units are (so don't get your hopes high).Now, on the reasonable side- It works :-) , the cool air comes relatively fast, if you turn the unit off/on, it comes back with the previous settings, the remote is easy to understand and use (though I do not use it).- The unit covers for 500 square feet alright and in fact, I have an upstairs with a master bedroom and an office (more that 500 sq ft) and it cools fine - note that I am not trying to chill things at 70 F here, but more of a 77-78 F (or < 80). For this purpose, it works just fine.- As far as you can carry it somewhere, the unit rolling is easy and smooth (no streak on wood floors or terrible thing like this)- The directional air-vent is functional (not impressive but fine)- Very easy to access the filer, clean and replaceOverall, I feel this unit should have a ""Ok"" rating as it would have deserved from being more quiet and with a hassle-free window kit (their ""easy-install kit"" is not easy and not practical, poorly designed) but, passed the problems, it also works reasonably well. I opted to put the unit in the room I am not in and since all my windows are of the same size, the initial work on the window fit turns out to be very handy."
"I am reviewing the Whynter 14,000 BTU Dual Hose Portable Air Conditioner (ARC-14S)(and NOT THE SELLER). I live in NY. The AC came nicely packaged - no damage and shipping was EXTREMELY FAST... I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLER! (Shipping was free also) Super!From the raves I read - some comments were honest but those who over rated the item - I DEEM THEM LIARS! First of all, the item is huge and a bit heavy... (huge here means the item is TALL ... BUT IT'S NOT WIDE) most people said that so that's not a problem and it's true. The setup was not too bad... viewed on Youtube how to... However, the COOLING SYSTEM FOR SUCH A HUGE AC SHOULD BE BETTER, ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE AC IS 14,000 BTU! Note the ""HUGE"" here means it's very tall almost half of my Grandfather clock - LOL! But it's not wide... it's more on the slender side (smiling).The room where my computer is and where I spend most of my time working on my computer - the size of the room is about 12 x 12. It's upstairs also. Today the temp reaches 100 and I had to use the fan to go along with the AC to give a comfortable feel. ONE OF THE GREAT DRAW-BACK ALSO IS THAT THE AC BLOWS UP TO THE CEILING and there is no way one could position it to direct the air down or across the room.It cools the room but not adequately - it needs a fan to help it out. I find a small widow AC does a better job than this big AC. 14,000 BTU should push more air.Mobility is fantastic... the wheels are super in moving the item around - the greatest prob is that it does not cool adequately. It does HUM but not to the point where it disturbs or stop on from sleeping either. It has a nice glow of blue light and if you are like me that need a night-light in the room, then this is great... no prob. The item is very very slick and beautiful... could be placed in any decor and fits it beautifully - very shiny and nice!Draining water is not a prob either. I have had this for almost a month now and I have not had to drain the water yet. Guess that's coming up. I did find out too that the drainage tube is way down on the floor so one would have to get this up on a block to drain or use a very thin basin to do the draining.To be fair and honest... I would only give this a three stars since it DOES NOT COOL adequately. For all the other things like: not have to drain often, nice glow light, mobility and the nice slickness (slender) this makes up the stars to three - NOT COOLNESS! I have no afilliation with seller, Wynter, Amazon (only purchase from here...) and this is my honest and true review. I am not paid and I used my own hard earned money to purchase this therefore, there is no need to lie or give a dishonest review.God bless you and direct you as you make your choice based on my honest review of this item and seller."
"I cannot begin to express how disappointed I am with this product. I recently purchased the Whynter Eco-Friendly 12,000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner, and I love it (see my review). The 12,000 BTU was for my apartment and it worked so well that I decided to invest in the Whynter 14,000 BTU for my 400 sq/ft office.  What a mistake!To give this unit credit, it does work - like a 9,000 BTU unit. Definitely not worth $500. (If it was $300, I would give it three stars).My office is 400 sq/ft with a vaulted ceiling. This unit did not bring the temperature down one degree. If I stood directly in front of the unit, the air was cold. However, if I stood two feet away, I felt nothing. The main problem with this unit is that the cold air shoots straight up and back. I tried placing a fan on the unit to get the cold air to move forward instead of up, and this helped a bit, but not much.I was determined to give this unit a fair chance. I figured that it was the high ceiling that was preventing the cold air from cooling the room. So, I swapped the 12,000 and the 14,000. I brought the Whynter 12,000 BTU unit to work and took the Whynter 14,000 unit home.I was amazed at how awesome the 12,000 BTU unit worked in my office. Within two hours it took the temp down from 80 degrees to 70 degrees and kept it at 70 degrees throughout the day.The poor 14,000 unit did not help my apartment much. The 12,000 BTU got my apartment down to 65 degrees. The 14,000 unit couldn't get my apartment below 75 degrees.My advice: Save your money and buy the Whynter 12,000 unit. It works!***UPDATE***I've had this until for a couple of months now, and I finally got it to work properly.  It happened quite by accident.  I was so frustrated with the ventilation system that I taped a plastic ""hood"" on top of the vent to keep the cold air from shooting straight up.  This helped a bit, but not enough.  I then decided to take the vent-piece out.  When I did so, I accidentally broke one of the pegs off the vent.  Out of disgust, I shoved the vent back in the unit upside-down and backwards. To my amazement, the unit began to cool my apartment.  The cold air now shoots forward instead of straight up. (see pic) The unit now takes the temp in my 400 sq/ft space from 80+ to 68 in less than an hour.I raised the unit from one star to three stars.  If the vent had been designed properly to begin with, and the price dropped $100, this would be a five star unit. (I can't feel the difference in cooling between this unit and my Whynter 12,000 BTU - which cost $100 less.)"
"Overall, this AC units works well, but after two years, there are two major cons:First, the hoses and window unit are so clunky and not well designed. The hose should not be round at the window end, but oblong, with a smaller profile. The window piece is easy to put in, but a real pain to take out of the window. The sliding piece is stopped by the screws and thus we had to take out all the screws to get it out of the window. Second time I was so frustrated I just yanked the damn thing out of the window, almost breaking it. Extremely poor design with no product testing.Second, the hose hookups into the machine are impossible to pull out. This is noted by many people online. You have to pull so hard, its ridiculously difficult. Even online videos say pull hard. But this isnt a normal pull hard - its really hard. Like putting your knee on the unit and almost breaking the attachments. There is no way to fit my skinny fingers into the clasping unit to even try to help the removal process. Extremely bad design and very disappointed.Exept for the entire hose system - which is a major part of set up and breaking down - its good. But I would not buy again if I could find a better design.Also, buy the separate filter for the intake hose. Why isnt this include? Its a cheap piece of plastic that they sell way overpriced at $25! That also really pissed me off. When you see how much it catches, you learn it shouldn't run without it. It should be included.Not ""whisper quiet"" as advertised - not even close! Loud AF."
"It's never cooled the room although it's kept it from being sweltering hot. For some strange reason, the sir blows up instead of out, my ceiling does not need to be cool! Now, it runs for 5 minutes and shuts down the surge protector. Nothing else is hooked up to that circuit so we can't figure out why it keeps shutting down the surge protector. Now it isn't even staying on 5 minutes!"
"I have had this unit for 2 weeks and all of a sudden the plug stopped working. I have put in a case with Whynter but when I called they said “please be patient we will get to your case in the order it came in.” It is the dead of summer and we are currently in a heat wave. I am a little nervous that they have so many pending warranty claims. I watched a lot of reviews and read up on so many a/c units, I had hoped this unit would last for a few years not a couple of weeks."
"This ac unit does what it is supposed to do better than any similar unit I have owned. 5 stars if those were the only criteria.  Very awkward to drain. Bending down to unscrew the drain cap, which is literally 2 inches above the floor, then having to tip the unit backwards to empty the drain pan all over the floor, since there is no receptacle shallow enough to fit under the unit and catch the water. Not to mention that on my unit the “fill light” is not evident.  Great cooling, great dehumidification, fairly quiet, bad drainage design."
"We got this for our bedroom to supplement our central AC. We use this unit exclusively when the outdoor temperature is below 80 degrees. When it is hotter than 80 degree outside  and set the Central AC to 78 and this unit to 66 degrees for sleeping.Our bedroom is about 500 sq feet with 20 foot high vaulted ceilings, we do have a ceiling fan. We set this to 66 degrees about an hour before bedtime and it gets to that temperature quite quickly.We are very happy with the ability to cool our large bedroom, however, there are many design flaws that need be worked around.1) This unit is LOUD! The sound meter app on my phone (can't say how accurate a phone app is) reads this unit at 62 decibels 5 feet from the fan (which is where we are sleeping). It is white noise so we have gotten used to it after a week.2) The blue LED light on the front is BRIGHT! I would be exaggerating to say you could read by this light - but not by much. The hack we used on this was to put a stack of about 6 post-it notes over the light. It blocks the light but you can still lift them up to see the display when needed.3) The compressor stops completely when the reservoir is full, but the warning light has not come on. The instruction manual states that a warning light will display when the unit is full, but that has not happened. I simply woke up in the middle of the night on the third night of use drenched in sweat. The fan was blowing, but no cool air coming out. In the morning I checked the reservoir and it was full.It took less than three days to fill using only 8 hours a night with humidity of around 60%. This just using the cooling function, NOT the dehumidifying function.4) The reservoir is ridiculously difficult to empty. It's at the bottom of the back of the unit, the clearance to put a container to catch the water under the unit is less than an inch. Even my shallowest cookie sheet doesn't fit, and it if did it would overflow. It takes two of us to drain with my husband tilting and lifting the unit and me holding a receptacle to catch the water. It drains at least a couple of pints so you need a large enough receptacle to catch it and use caution to not overflow. Other reviewers have posted several hacks that include purchasing special plates from Ikea and hoses. I would think this type of thing should be included or the unit better designed - why not just leave about 2 - 3 inches clearance? Or let the hose go out several inches so you don't need to put a receptacle under the unit? Or build in a removable reservoir?Overall, it works well enough for its purpose and it's too heavy and inconvenient to return. I think we can hack it enough to overcome the flaws. But I wouldn't buy this unit again and I can't wholeheartedly recommend it to others."
"Slightly over a year ago, I purchased a Whynter ARC-14S after having read many good reviews.  I live in Northeast US.  Used for a couple months last year (starting in August) and it worked fine (I kept the air inlet inside the house for hopefully increased efficiency).  This year, I began using in June with higher dew points than last year.  About two weeks after the one-year warranty expired, the unit wouldn't start.  I replaced the filter and then thought to drain the unit, which I did outside but the unit is quite heavy and I am 76 with a bad back and some straight lifting was required, which was unpleasant but necessary.  On the path through the house, I noted puddles of water left along the way.  When outside, I unscrewed the cap, tipped the unit and saw water coming both from the drain and the adjacent entry point for the power cord.  I drained as best I could, returned the unit back inside and it worked sort of ok for a couple more days until it stopped again, this time with more water on the floor even though the drain cap was on.  I rolled it outside again, this time removing the outer shell (front and back) via about 15 screws (three different lengths) going into plastic threads.  I saw that the waffle-like base contains multiple chambers, each of which was filled with water, none of which seemed to communicate with adjacent chambers except by overflowing.  I tipped the unit on its side to remove all water I could see, reinstalled the casing and returned the unit inside.  This time I placed the full unit inside a high-walled black tub and left the drain cap open.  That particular day was quite humid and the unit seemed to run ok (about 6 hours) until I went to turn it off and noticed the floor somewhat damp and water ""spitting"" from the vent.  The next morning, the tub had about 1"" of water in the base (I had the AC unit on 2x4s).  I screwed the drain plug back on, lifted the unit from the tub, rolled it outside again (at one point, I built a wooden ramp to at least avoid the inside-to-outside lifting).  This time water again flowed from everywhere when I tipped the unit.The unit seems to work ok but requires draining (and lifting) every day.  This morning after leaving the plug installed, the bottom of the plastic tub had about 1/2"" of water (that is, not coming from the drain) (so just leaving a tube connected to the drain and running it outside would still result in water overflowing inside the house).  I have been in contact with Whynter and they have provided some guidance but with the warranty conveniently expired, their compassion only extends so far.  They have advised that annual interior cleaning would help but I am quite skeptical of this after such a short operating history (and did not notice any obvious dirt or dust on the coils when the unit was disassembled).  I also believe that annual removal/reinsertion of the aluminum screws into the plastic threads would eventually strip the threads.  Thus, I am left with having to drain the unit daily when in use as my back keeps getting more sore and I keep (for some reason) getting older.  My expectation is that I will pay our local trash man about $100 to haul this off in the spring.  But perhaps spending over $600 for a few months of cooling one room is considered a good value by some.The only ""good"" thing I can say about this unit is the help I've received from Whynter (albeit not really helping very much).  It will come as no surprise to anyone having read this far that I will not be purchasing another Whynter unit."
"It's big, it's heavy, and the piping is ugly. The pipes also quickly collect dust in the dry climate we live in. What's worse is that the pipes easily become detached from the socket in the window if you try to turn the unit. The air cannot be directed horizontally-only vertically or near vertically. It doesn't cool much better than the old window unit we had which was only 5000 BTU. All in all, a bit disappointing."
"This AC unit was amazing when I first got it. Probably the best unit I owned, cooling my large bedroom very quickly. Then suddenly about theee a half weeks after having, the unit needed to be drained. No big deal as that happens some times. Unfortunately since that day it has needed to be drained every 30 mins to an hour, making it impossible to use at night when sleeping. I contacted Whynter who told me to send the product back as it seems the self evaporating feature stopped working. Problem is this thing weighs just under 100 pounds and I obviously don’t have original packaging since I’ve had it for a month now. Really unfortunate and feels like a waste off $500+. If it kept working the way it was the first 3 weeks it would’ve been 5 stars but that is definitely no longer the case. I am having to put the unit on a heavy duty stool, attach a hose and let the way continuously drain into a bucket so it would shutoff and I can sleep through the night. If the unit hadn’t been so expensive I’d buy a different one but unfortunately can’t just lose the $500 I already spent.My advice— don’t buy. Find something more reliable that can run for more than 30 mins at a time."
"Received this unit  last Friday when the temperature inside and out was in the 90's.  Excellent, heavy duty package.  No problems there.  It was easy to get the box off and get the unit off the cardboard and foam base despite its 100 pounds weight.  Also inside the main package was another box containing the window kit, hoses, and adapters.  Missing were the manual, remote control, and screws to fasten the window kit together.  I went to the Whynter website and downloaded the manual there so I was able to get the unit set up in about five minutes and blowing cold air.  I also found a customer service phone number.  The phone was quickly answered by a young lady who, I assume, was located in the US.  No accent, at least.  After explaining the missing items, she showed her lack of customer service skills.  She failed to offer any apology for my problem nor did she show any interest in whether I was able to get the unit installed and operating.  She did offer to send me the missing parts ... after I sent her a copy of my Amazon invoice so she could verify my correct shipping address and register my warranty.  When I asked her to confirm that she was requiring that I provide my invoice BEFORE she would ship the missing items, she again said it was so she could verify my correct shipping address and register my warranty.  I pointed out that it was not me that was having a bad day and failed to put everything in the box before it left the factory.  When I asked why she couldn't take that information over the phone and get the missing items shipped, she again repeated the same excuse.  Only after I said that I would contact Amazon to arrange a return so I could purchase a different brand did she finally agree to take my information and ship the items.  She also took my email so she could send me a tracking number.  Today, Tuesday, I got that tracking number.  The estimated delivery date is next Monday!  I didn't even know UPS offered a delivery service that slow for a package that only weighs about one pound.The A/C unit has operated fine so far.  It dropped the inside temperature 10 degrees in less than an hour. While noticeable, the noise of the compressor is not intolerable.  I only hope the unit continues to function well as I can only imagine the hoops I will have to jump through if I have to call customer service for warranty service.  Amazon should offer to teach a class on how to provide exceptional customer service.  Whynter could learn a lot."
"It cools quite well and will get your room down to a good temperature fairly quick but still has issues with negative air pressure so it's always doing more work than it should... Two pipes are good, but optimally you should actually be using only them and not the room's air.Also, we got a bit of colder weather, and now my room is warmer AND more humid than the outdoors, indicating an issue with the unit's ability to vent the water. This isn't really surprising, it had a leak in the bottom early on (and probably still leaks humidity through there) but it's pretty annoying for a unit this heavy and supposedly powerful to need this much tinkering with to get it to function on par with dropshipper garbage."
"This A/C unit worked great for about 2 summers. Then, for the 3rd summer the fans still work, the compressor still works, but the air doesn't blow out cold anymore. We regularly cleaned the filter, at the end of each summer we opened the stopper to drain any condensation, and stored it in the cover that it came with."
"Let me start with the pros1. Cools pretty damn well :-) kudos!2. It operates much quieter than I expected it to3. Pretty nice design aesthetically pleasing4. Easy to installNow the cons1. STUPID DESIGN FLAW: Temperature sensor is too close to the exhaust hose (See below for more details)2. The window fixture has exhaust and intake very close and there is a high probability that the intake may suck in some of the hot air going out thus severely downgrading the efficiency. I would prefer a 4 to 6 inch clearance between the two. I am planning to make a custom fixture later to solve this problem.3. The hose connector on the body of the AC is parallel to the body, so the hose connect at an awkward angle that hampers the airflow into the indoor intake vent, another energy inefficiency.4. The cold air vent has to be opened manually (not a big deal just a teeny tiny inconvenience)5. I think it uses the full 1500 Watts (I will use a power meter later and update this), when I connect it in the same room where my desktop is connected it caused my circuit breaker to trigger (15A; US voltage[110vrms]). Usually home appliances are limited to 1300 Watts.Regarding the design flaw (1), the temperature sensor is hooked to the indoor intake side, too close to the outdoor exhaust hose connector. The outdoor exhaust hose connector gets very hot when indoor air is sucked around the hose it gets warm and this hits the temperature sensor thus the unit never turns off the compressor. When my room temperature reached 76F, a temperature setting of 78F did not turn off the compressor and the unit kept on spewing out cold air. It only went off when I adjusted it to 81F, so I thought I can set it to 81F and can get a 76F cool room. But that didn't work very well either, because after the compressor is off the outdoor exhaust hose cools down and the air sucked in reflects the room temperature. So, the unit will turn back on only when your room temperature hits 81F.They could have used a little longer wire and connected the temperature sensor on the other side (near the outdoor air intake hose side) for a 500$ product this is an unforgivable design flaw.For now I'm planning to put some thick insulation around the outdoor exhaust hose and see if it helps."
"I am not super into this type of project. Installing this was a project for me. I did put it together by myself. The directions were just ""okay."" They could have been better. There were a lot of parts. I had to screw screws, twist on end caps, saw a piece to fit the window -  putting it together was a chore. The exhaust hoses (there are two) are hard to adjust due to the angles of the end caps (I had to attach the 4 end caps too!).  The air conditioner unit sticks out to far into the room. I think it is unsightly.🤷‍♀️ It does seem to work well though, I am happy about that, but I am not happy about the way it looks and how much space it needs."
"When my window unit went south, I decided to try a portable and this seemed to be the best. However, it doesn't cool nearly as well as I expected. I'm cooling a well-insulated garage of 400 sq. ft. The footprint is much larger than the unit itself because of the room required for the exhaust hose at the rear of the unit. The exhaust creates a tremendous amount of heat. I'm going to put a dryer vent in the wall to shorten the length of the exhaust as much as possible to try to eliminate the heat radiating from the hose. If I were given the choice again, I'd go with another window unit."
"Our original unit was purchased in 2022. Went to set it up this year and the compressor would not run. The fans ran fine. Reached out to support and our support rep was very helpful. Though they could not fix it they were able to replace it under warranty. The whole replacement process was completed in 2 weeks. It is important to note their warranty is in two parts. First warranty is for one year, but the compressor is listed has having a 3 year warranty.The first 2 seasons we used the original unit it worked great and compared to our other portable units is very quiet."
"1. Goes down to only 61 degrees.2. Window Extension Unit is a pain to work with, it doesn't seal properly unless you get creative spending more.3. The hoses need to be re-design, they are the joy killer here. difficult to bend to shape, the connectors do not stay in place, they don't screw in properly as soon as you move the machine, they pop out.4. The Vent is not as flexible as it should. Only up and down and maybe 45 degrees range.I really wish I would have waited and now I'm stuck with it."
"*** Important addition to my review ***I think this is not a 14,000 BTU A/C unit.  If you look at the product info, it states that the unit's max power consumption is 1250 watts; two different sources make this seem equivalent to 4265 BTU.  I don't know how they rate these portable units, but the power consumption number does not support the rating.http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/air-conditioner-calculatorhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BtuI knocked a star off of my review upon discovering this.  If anyone can correct or comment on this, I may re-adjust back to a 3-star review.*** Original review ***Rather than give you guys a subjective analysis, I'm going to give you test results.  I am using this unit to cool a 150 sq ft apartment bedroom in Seattle, WA.  The outdoor temperature on weather.com was 88 degrees throughout nearly the entire test (the starting temp in the room was the same).  I am measuring temperature using a digital thermometer I have on a window fan unit that I set inside the room away from the cold air stream.time (min) -- temp (deg F)0 ----------- 8815 ---------- 8530 ---------- 8245 ---------- 8160 ---------- 8075 ---------- 7990 ---------- 79I will say that the actual temp felt cooler than 79, but we'll go with the objective measurement.  Excel gives me the best fit to an exponential that flattens out at 78 F, so it looks like the unit can cool 10 degrees below the natural temp.  The time constant is 36 minutes.The temperature flattens out due to heat getting back into the room from the outside environment, and I would tend to think that this loss would scale with square footage.  But the size of the air mass that the unit is trying to cool (and that is gaining heat from the outside) is going to proportionally affect the rate of temperature change, and this, too should scale with square footage.  I expect then that max cooling will reduce with square footage roughly linearly.  That comports with at least some of the reviews I've seen and makes the 500 sq foot rating seem generous.  Below is a table of approximate cooling:room size (sq ft) -- cooling (F)100 ---------------- 15200 ---------------- 7.5300 ---------------- 5400 ---------------- 3.75500 ---------------- 3There are of course a huge number of variables that dictate exactly how much cooling you get.  Not worth listing here.  I'm just trying to give you a guide.  If I had to take a wild guess, most apartments are more alike than different.--- WARNING: DO NOT READ BELOW UNLESS YOU ARE A GEEK ---I think that the temp of an apartment under cooling should follow a differential equation of the form:T' = -E*W/C + (S/I)*(N-T)/CT [F] is temperatureE is a dimensionless efficiency constantW [BTU/h] is the heat removal of the Whynter unitC [BTU/F] is the heat capacity of air in the apartmentS [ft^2] is the surface area of the apartmentI [F*ft^2*h/BTU] is an insulation factorN [F] is the natural temperatureThis has a solution:T = N - E*W/(S/I) * [1 - e^-((S/(I*C))*t)]My bedroom has a surface area of 630 ft^2, and the air inside has a heat capacity of 14.3 BTU/F.  The time constant in this formula is I*C/S = 36 min = 0.6 h. So,I = (0.6 h)*(630 ft^2/14.3 BTU/F) = 26.4 F*ft^2*h/BTUThe cooling capacity is E*W/(S/I) = 10 F. So,E*W/(630 ft^2/26.4 F*ft^2*h/BTU) = 10 FE*W/(23.9 BTU/F*h) = 10 FE*W = 239 BTU/hThe thing is rated for 14,000 BTU/h (manufacturers use BTU as a shorthand for BTU/h).  Per the entry at the top of my review, at 100% efficiency, the unit should be a 4265 BTU/h unit.  If you're measuring the air output, it wouldn't surprise me if the real number would reflect 20% efficiency within the unit.  The actual output, before considering the efficiency of ejecting the hot air out of the room and whatnot, could easily be ~1000 BTU/h.  At any rate, I measure composite efficiency (E) at 5.6% using the 4265 BTU/h figure."
"Update on July 10.  The original unit failed within the first week and I returned it as noted on the June 26 update.  I figured I got a bad unit from a good factory given the incredibly high overall ratings (and over 5,000 ratings too).  The replacement unit arrived a couple of days ago and was defective out of the box.  The working machine is covered in a kind of clam shell wrapper with two pieces of plastic.  The seam on one side had an eight inch long and one inch deep compression on the front piece.  I could put my finger through the opening.  The machine did run, but since it vibrates that long break on the outer shell cannot last long until it begins to rattle itself open farther on the connecting seam.  I have never had the experience of buying two consecutive items where each one fails immediately.  Yet this product gets extremely high star ratings and ""most helpful"" positive reviews.Amazon is once again providing amazing return service and will send the original pickup team (not UPS) to get the unit off my second floor (100 pounds and fifteen steps).  I've ordered a Honeywell model instead and hoping they have better quality control.I did note that if I switched the type of reviews on the page from ""most helpful"" to ""most recent"" many reviewers noted the same problems I've experienced.  You might want to try viewing more recent, especially on manufactured products.Update on June 26.  The unit is defective (the fan doesn't run after the compressor shuts down) and Whynter told me to return it.  Amazon sold the unit and is providing it's great service.  I had to destroy the packing to get the appliance out of the box, but the return service will take the product, package it, and carry it away.  So even if you get a defective product, if you get it through Amazon, be assured they will handle the problem.Just got the 14S model of this portable A/C unit.  The largest problem I've encountered with the unit is my age.  At 70 I am not as strong, flexible, or smart so the very easy installation process took me and my wife longer than expected.  Please read all the instructions.  Also.  It really matters (at least to me) the sequence you assemble the hoses and components.  Get the right sequence and installation is easier.I had two minor problems with the unit and emailed tech support and got clear solutions the next day.  That is a plus.  The unit is running now and working fine for its first operation.  Sound level is good to my ears, steady, surprisingly quiet for the work, and smooth.  It's a more pleasant kind of white noise.I replaced a great Honeywell unit that is no longer available.  After 8 years (!!!) of great function, it was starting to act old (the thermostat got weird).  I read external reviews on this Whytner unit which were positive across a ranger of consumer websites.I doubt you will find this review since as of June 2021 there are over 5,000 on Amazon.  Given the 4+ Star average rating, you will probably find the most negative reviews at the top of the page.  I'm sure some folks do have serious problems and sometimes the factory makes an error, but so far so good with this one.  And again, a lot of positive non Amazon consumer websites that do not appear to be ""sponsored"" reviews."
"My comments on effectiveness of this unit.  4 days worth so far as follows.DAY-1Ordered using Prime.  Delivered fast and shipping was free.  Impressed with packaging.  Simple to set up.  Now.  I'm sitting in my family room waiting for a couple hours for it to cool down.  It was 79 degrees outside today.  After a couple hours it is still that temperature inside.  Sun has already gone down.  Google says it is now 72 outside.  So after waiting with no cooling inside,  I open a couple windows and turn on a couple box fans.  Less than 10 minutes later the place is cooled off.Bummer.  I was hoping the over $500 spent on the portable a/c (incl tax) would work better than two $20 fans.  I plan on trying this earlier in the day tomorrow before the heat gets through the walls.  I hope I can improve my rating........DAY-2Update.  Pretty much same temperature outside and inside today as it was yesterday.  Family room was 80 degrees by noon. AccuWeather listed 78 today.  But with sun coming in windows and heating up the walls, it actually ends up warmer inside than out.  So, curtains closed, nice and shady, I turned on the A/C and set it to 75 to see what it could do running full blast.  In about 90 minutes, it had lowered room temperature to 79.  And that's where it stayed all day, till a little after 5pm when I gave up.  Same as yesterday, I turned off A/C, opened windows, turned on the two old box fans.  In just a few minutes, the temperature in the room dropped to 77.  That is the temperature it was outside at the time.So this A/C unit apparently can't cool down a 400 sq ft room more than 1 degree cooler than the temperature it would be with no cooling at all.  Yes.  The walls and ceiling are insulated.  And the windows have double-pane glass.  I am disappointed because I really wanted this A/C unit to work as expected because this summer is going to be a really hot one (So. Calif).DAY-3Debating if this A/C is worth keeping.  Light gray coloring around front corners of top vent.  Like stress.  No problem, I guess.  Plastic doesn't seem to align on top right.  No biggie, I guess.  Moved A/C unit into master bedroom.  It's half the size of the family room at 206 sq ft.- 3:20pm.  77 in bedroom.  AccuWeather says 70 outside.  Normally all I would do is open a window and turn ceiling fan on.  Instead, left the room all closed up, doors and windows and curtains, turned on A/C full blast, set to 68.  Just me, my laptop, and one light on in the bedroom as I watch the temperature.- 3:45pm.  Temp in room dropped 3 degrees to 74. Not that it's important with the room all closed up, but AccuWeather says it is 69 outside.- 4:15pm.  Bedroom temp at 72.  BTW it's 80 in family room (all closed up) and 78 in living room (one fan in window) and still 69 outside.- 5:15pm.  Bedroom is 71.  Nice. But not going to get to 68.  All other temps in house and outside are the same.  Shut A/C off.  Opened the curtain and window.  Turned ceiling fan on full blast.- 5:45pm.  Using only ceiling fan and one window open, the temp is 72.  Hmm.  The A/C unit at least beat that by 1 degree.  But that is not making me happy at all.My thoughts on the A/C unit from today?  It is ALMOST powerful enough for a 200 sq ft bedroom but not for the size room advertised.  It is way too large and noisy to be used in the bedroom.DAY-4 left unit turned off.  read other reviews looking for any hope.  gave up.  drained it.  packed it up.  setup return."
"I now have four of these units and am basically pleased with the way they look and cool, however, they seem to develop or even start with sound problems. One that I've been using for a few months has developed a hollow roaring sound like air is going through an opening somewhere. Checked the tubes and they are connected fine. It is somewhere inside. Very annoying.The unit I got less than a month ago came to me making the terrible grinding sound. It sounds like an old motorbike.I have another one that sounds normal and works the best of all of them.My fourth one arrived with cracked pieces inside that you can see where the hose attaches so I haven't even tried to connect it.I've been reluctant to contact Whynter because I've heard you have to pay for shipping both ways and being disabled I have no idea how I would pack these and get them somewhere to ship or have the funds to do it.I wish they would also do something to make the filter panel stay on better. It does not latch well and I've had to put tape on all of them to hold the door closed. Also, the filters are pretty cheesy. Dust starts accumulating on the fins pretty fast and I try to clean the filters and vacuum the fins once a week. Once the dust gets on the fins it can be nearly impossible to get it off. I use a dry toothbrush as I vacuum to get what I can.I do like the dual hoses and like the small opening required in the window versus a full sized window a/c.I wish they would insulate one of the hoses and label it and the hole for it so the heat from the super hot air doesn't go into your room (counterproductive). One hose gets VERY hot.Buttons are easy to use once you get used to them. Back lit and easy to read. Wish it showed the actual room temperature instead of just showing what it is set at.If I could give 5 stars to Amazon alone I would. They worked with me for almost 2 weeks when UPS could not manage to get this from a Dallas warehouse to my Dallas home. UPS was the worst ever. Amazon was incredible making this right for me. They eventually shipped out a new replacement unit via Fed Ex and it arrived very quickly. Unfortunately, it was delivered upside down with the cracked housing around the compressor. I don't have the heart or energy to deal with getting it replaced AGAIN. (this is the one I haven't installed yet)So if you can get this unit delivered without incident or damage and you get one that works without some loud sound issues, you will be pleased at the cooling capability."
"This unit is big, bigger than you think. The hoses are big, bigger than you think. It works well sometimes. Only after a day or two of use will you notice that you’ve had a terrible night or woke up hot over and over with the Whynter ARC-14S. The unit, on cooling mode, will automatically turn down its fan when the set temp is reached (the manual does not mention this). The unit will sometimes, at its discretion, turn the fan off completely, for hours, and allow the heat to rise up to 5F before it turns the ac back on. Don’t worry though, the fan will turn on between medium and high every 15 minutes for 30 seconds all night long while the temp rises. Just to “circulate the air”. Yes, I wrote to tech support and they said that was normal and the fan nonsense was to “circulate the air”.No, this is not an energy saving function that can be turned off. The Whynter ARC-14 has a mind of its own and does what it wants when it wants. Sometimes it’ll turn on and off constantly and keep the room within .1F Other times you get the high temperature fan nonsense I described above.It does cool well. It does not require draining in most climates. It is made fairly well. It is powerful and affordable… I hate it and I do not believe it works properly at all. Sent it back. Got a wonderful Midea unit with a dual hose to replace this Whynter nonsense. The Midea is smaller, quieter, faster, has a cool app and just works in every way. No regrets!"
"I read a lot of the reviews here and was excited to find this unit. I decided after last summer this was the one to get. I put off my purchase till the end of February knowing summer was on the way. I felt if I waited any longer, the price would go back up. (It did.)I received the unit on March 6. Set up wasn't a problem. I immediately noticed the air isn't directional. It shoots straight up which was annoying, but I have box fans to move the air where I want it. The air was cool but not frigid like I hoped. I expected more ,but thought ""this will do.""I'd used the unit intermittently without any real issues - until around a week ago. The unit began cool for the first minute or 2 and warmed up. This got progressively worse and now the unit is essentially useless. It moves a lot of air but it's HOT air.Ofcourse I did some trouble shooting. Hoses and filter were unobstructed, setting was correct, desired temp setting was where it needed to be, etc. All correct.My return time with Amazon had expired so I called the manufacturer. Customer service was very friendly and wanted to help by emailing trouble shooting tips etc. When I asked how long it was covered by warranty she told me the full warranty expired after 2 months. Now I have a ""limited warranty"" till a year after purchase. That ofcourse means money out of my pocket for shipping to and fro as well as whatever other bogus fee they make up.So to sum it up, I have a $400 paperweight that actually heats my house better then it cools it. Quality control is all over the place and they know it otherwise their warranty would last a lot longer then 2 months. A full 2 month warranty sounds absolutely ridiculous. Recent customer reviews also reflect a problem with quality control.Frankly, this is one of the worst purchases I've ever made. I do not recommend it. If you do decide to purchase this product do so with an extended warranty from the vender (If possible.) It got 1 star because I had to give it something to post a review.Give the Honeywell 12mn's a try."
"We purchased this Whynter Portable 14,000 BTU Air Conditioner for our room, which is 430 Sq Ft. We endured two hot summers with this machine and we are regretting our purchase. This air conditioner works fine when temperture is around 85F, but when the temperture increase to 95F or above and persist, this machine stopped working. What was cooler air became warmer and hotter air coming out. Because this air conditioner also generate a lot heat, after 95F, it can no longer cool the air enough to work. Manufacture website also said that the operation range is below 95F. Unfortunately, when the air conditioner is needed the most. When it was 95F and above, we simply shutted down the machine and turned on our fan and counted the hours."
"I am in an old home that is brick, so the house stays cooler than most to begin with.  So I figured this would be good to cool my 600 square foot upstairs.  We originally had a window unit that was huge and kept the upstairs almost cold, as well as pushed the cold air down the stairs and I didn't have to run the downstairs window unit as much.  Not the same with this.I am not saying this doesn't work because it does.  Yesterday it got up to 90 and the upstairs in the one room that this was blowing into stayed 73.  But what is surprising is that it doesn't really remove the humidity as much as I thought it would.The other rooms were definitely warmer, although I didn't record the temp. (I may do that today.).  I have 3 bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs.  Two of the bedrooms actually have door between them, and that stays open.I also found that blocking out sunlight really helps to keep things cooler.  I taped aluminum foil to the east and west windows, and I have blackout shades.  So that helped.  But the rooms are almost caves now.Also, on the unit itself the exhaust hose gets pretty warm, which in my mind heats up in the room.  I just took some bubble wrap and wrapped the exhaust hose and that helped as well.I also have a fan running 24/7 blowing the cooler air around.Bottom line, this doesn't work like a window A/C.  Other reviews have stated that and I am confirming.  If you had a window air conditioner that did the job, and thought that this would replace it, it won't.However this unit does cool.  Just don't expect it to be a window unit.  My main reason for buying was to have an air conditioner that didn't stay in the window during the winter.  This will come easily out and store in a closet, keeping our windows closed.If you are looking to use this just keep all this in mind.  Most likely I will pick up a small window unit to cool one of the additional rooms, which should give me enough to match the previous window unit, but still allow me to close the windows in the winter."
"Important notes:-No it is NOT an equal replace of an air conditioner (e.g. window units).-""Portable"" simply means you can move the unit around from room to room.  Nothing else.-Know the dimension of the room you are cooling.  This is very critical as results will differ.-Portable AC still requires venting so it needs to be by a window.-Compare your cost to cost ratio.  It maybe more expensive to buy a portable AC then it is to replace your existing unit.Portable AC units does NOT replace an air conditioner such as window units and are inferior in every way except for portability (which is what you are paying for).  You should be careful and know what you are getting when you buy a Portable AC.  Despite the high BTUs it does not (and will not) give you desired results you would expect regardless of what companies state.  Do not buy this thinking it be the same as walking into a friend/family's place with ac (assuming they have a window unit or central air conditioning) as you would be deeply disappointed.Then why so many high positive reviews?You must understand that although it fails to give similar results compare to other types of AC it however STILL cools down a room.  If it's 90 degrees out, a room that's 80 degrees with a portable AC on (set on the coolest option possible, which is 62 degrees) is still far better then living in a hot room.  Therefor companies, such as Whynter, have done no wrong as the products they make still does what it was built to do.  That is why they can get away with what they are doing as they haven't lied, but simply meant it in a different way and can count on consumers to simply accept it, as a room with some AC capability is better then no AC.What you need to know.It cools down your room to ""livable conditions"" but will not give you a chill.  I've tested the unit in big and small rooms with accordance to Whynter's compatible room chart.  The unit takes a long time to cool a room down despite the 62 degree thermostatic control you can set it at.  So it is crucial that you know the dimension of the room you are trying to cool down.  What I get from reading many people's reviews is that they typically cool down a small bedroom which, of course, if your using a 14,000 BTU unit it will get the job done.  But if your trying it on the biggest possible room (500 sq ft.) or more it will suffer.  The fan in these units are weak and I suggest you use another fan along side this unit to help circulate the air to get better and faster results.  I've read a tip that if you pair up an ""air cooler"" that it helps the portable AC unit.  I've done this and it does help but that's an extra $100-200 of additional expense.On a 90 degree day at around noon I've tested on a roughly 550 sq ft. room and it takes 2+ hours to chill about 5-7 degrees at max and final room temp at 85.  On a room about 300-330 sq ft. room and it took 1 hour to chill 8-10 degrees and final room temp was at 82.  Note that these room's temp would not drop any further no matter how long I run the AC.  The results were not great."
"Expensive and bulky but it works. The tubes don't connect well and pop off at the slightest touch. But it is at least easy to keep clean unlike a full HVAC system.Update- after 2 months the air blowing out smells off, pretty sure it's growing mold inside. I went to go clean it but the screws to the case are hard to get to. I had to order a special longer screw driver to open it."
"This unit is poorly designed for several reasons. First, the instructions warn you not to extend the hoses more than necessary. They say extension of greater than 9"" may affect functionality. I do not see how it would be possible to extend the hoses less than 9"" unless your unit is backed up directly against the wall, meaning this is not truly a portable AC. It is anchored to your window as much as a window unit.Second, the window panel is made for an enormous window. It consists of two overlapping pieces you extend to fit the window frame. Each piece is 20"" wide to fit the two hoses. At a minimum, they have to be extended to about 32"" to accommodate the hoses. The instructions say you may have to cut the other piece to make it fit. The instructions should say you will definitely have to cut the other piece (unless you have extremely wide windows). My window frame is 26"" so I just used duct tape to seal the remaining 6"". This is incredibly ugly. I wish the company had simply designed the window panel better since the unit is reliant on windows and can foresee great variability in window design.Speaking of, my third issue concerns the listing. It should emphasize how the air conditioning function of the unit relies on a window. It is shown in photos being used without being attached to a window, like when it is by the baby's crib in one photo or near the woman reading on the couch. This is misleading.Fourth, be prepared for the unit's size and weight. It is extremely heavy and bulky. It will not be easy to store or move.Fifth, it will not work with casement windows. It only works with sliding vertical or horizontal windows.TLDR: Overall, I think I have to return this and elect for window units that are better designed for actually using window frames. The listing does not properly advise you on how much this item relies on the design of your window. Ideal specifications needed in the windows in the space where you want to use the unit should be listed so you can decide if this is right for your space before buying. If you don't have a place to put it, it doesn't matter how well it works."
"It cools the room when you can get it turned on.The problem is that the remote control doesn’t work. I installed the batteries that it came with then even changed the batteries with a fresh pair. I was able to get the correct temp, fan speed etc to display on the remote, so that is not the problem.It just failed to sync the information with the air conditioner."
"Reply from customer service: ""Thank you for contacting us about your Whynter ARC-14S Portable Air Conditioner. We are sorry to inform you that the long-and-short window kit extensions package has been phased out and is no longer available. The unit now comes with two long extension panels. We apologize if the product details on the website were not updated. You may cut the window kit to your desired length and you may use a handsaw or tablesaw.""Yes, because people who live in apartments frequently own such a thing, or would know how to use one.This response was received August 27th and they have not adjusted the copy on this page to reflect that either."
"I would imagine most readers of this review faced the same perplexing questions I did when shopping for a portable AC unit to combat this miserably hot summer. There doesn't seem to be any one unit or brand that stands out above the rest...The reviews on any given unit can range from enthusiastic raves, to calling them expensive paperweights...So, in a nutshell, it really is a crapshoot, and you sort of roll the dice with any of these machines I think...Now, specifically on this Whynter unit, here are my observations:First of all, it is a bit overpriced for the build quality, design, and ease of assembly. The window kit (as noted by others) is complete garbage, and you are pretty much forced to make your own if you want to optimize the unit's already somewhat mediocre performance. (See photo)  The hoses didn't want to screw into the plastic vent pieces too well, so get your HVAC tape ready to use liberally. It has a very cheap feel and some ill fitting parts like the filter on the back. For something that purports to cool up to 500 sq ft, this thing barely cools down my 320 sq ft, master bedroom after blasting for about a half an hour...Now for the ""glass half full"" portion of this review.  Does this AC ultimately provide (some) relief from bruising, sleep depriving heat in a small space? Yes it does...While your room won't get ""cold"" as it would with a central AC unit, a mini-split ductless, or even a good quality/high BTU window unit, it will take the edge off the heat, and make life more bearable in your home. Just don't expect miracles...I live in a condo, so I had no choice but to use this type of set up due to HOA restrictions...I haven't had any complaints about the noise it generates but these things are pretty darn loud...I can't speak to durability really because I have only had it a couple of weeks, but I bought an extended warranty, (which I never do) just in case. I also put a water heater drip pan underneath to protect my hardwood floors, just in case things go wonky and it decides to leak. Make sure you insulate the exhaust hose, and put it above the air intake one.  To summarize, you are hedging your bets with just about any of these portable AC units.  This Whynter unit seems probably slightly above average, but only time will tell. It gets (a somewhat subdued 3 star C+ rating.)"
"I had high hopes but ended up returning the unit. I needed this to cool on demand, a relatively small 72 sq ft utility space that sits unoccupied for periods of time that could get upwards of 120 degrees inside. The quality of this AC seemed good but its cooling capability was not there.After researching it turns out these units generally have a maximum temp operating range of approximately 93-95 degrees. So the until will turn on and fans will blow but the compressor will not engage. This unit is huge and heavy so it is not very mobile unless in an open, hard surfaced floor.The exhaust and intake tubes do not seem to connect well. The connectors and design is good but the actual mechanical connection points might be slightly off not letting them lock in, not sure. Not a big deal once installed but if you have to shift the unit they fall off."
"It was amazing when i first got it then i stored it away for the winter got it back out for this summer and it cant even blow out air colder than the temperature outside! Filters are clean, pan is drained, tubes are in the window correctly and in the ac correctly. Compressor turns on and nothing is damaged. Talked with a tech that works on ac units and said it should be working and couldnt figure out what was wrong with it. very sad that it died especially one month after my warranty expired. really disappointed as these things are not cheap!For reference when i first got it last year it would blow out air that was as cold as 51 degrees! i remember cause i tested it right away.The pictures i added show that when it was 64 outside it couldnt even blow out colder air and this was at 5am when i tested to see if it would at least blow out colder air then the temp outside. The 76 reading is from when it was 88 outside around 5pm with inside air temp being 79.1 and the setting on the AC is at 68 which i always have it set to and yes its on the cooling mode with the snowflake. very sad that it stopped working correctly :("
"Pros:* It does an amazing job of cooling my bedroom which is ~150 sqft. I would NOT recommend this for a big shared space such as a living room. I think its rated for 500sqt for something but I am skeptical at that claim.* Relatively easy setupCons:* The biggest issue I have with it is actually software related, not hardware related. The way their cooling algorithms works, they allow a 5 degree buffer before starting the AC. This means that this AC does NOT keep the temperature that you set it at all the time and only checks every 15 minutes or so. You would think that the AC would say ""Hey, I'm set to 75 degree, but the room is 79 degrees, I better lower the room temperature"", but it doesn't. Because of the 5 degree buffer, it waits until it reaches 80 degrees and THEN turns itself on.What does this mean? This means that you can get wildly inconsistent temperatures. You want the room to never go above 75 degrees? You have to set the temperature to 70 (which might be too cold for some people). This wouldn't have been an issue if the temperature buffer was something more reasonable like 2 or so degrees, but 5 is way too much in my opinion. I've been woken up multiple times during hot summer nights because setting the temperature to 78 (which is good enough for summer) made it get uncomfortably hot in the middle of the night when it shot up to the low 80s and the AC decided it wasn't time to turn on.* Lack of directional control for the fan -- It only shoots straight up. The flexibility to have it shoot sideways would have been nice"
"It cooled the room pretty quick tbh. Was bigger than expected so had to put it in a different spot but still worked out. Rolled around really easy. Once hooked up was difficult to set in the position i wanted. Kept messing the window panels up. The window panels could be reworked but I made it work. Overall, not bad though."
"The description says it will cool 500 sf, which it might, if that is one open space. I live in a two level 500 sf apartment and was hoping this would have enough power to cool the downstairs as well, but it does not. We have it in our bedroom and it cools it to an icy level which is great. It is loud, but it's really just white noise, it doesn't keep me or my husband awake. Although,I have been having a hard time hearing my alarm on my phone with it running.I personally had no trouble installing the window piece, the screws that came with we're not long enough to actually hold the pieces together, luckily I have plenty of screws on hand, so I replaced them with my own. I have old push out casement windows with newer sliding storm windows inside, so  I have the outside casement window ajar slightly and then slid the plastic piece that came with the unit between the frame and the storm window. There is no foam or anything malleable to hold the window piece in, so I fit my sliding window as tightly as I could and secured it with packing tape, which I intended on replacing with foam tape or duct tape, but as far as I can tell it seems to be working just fine.I don't use the remote, but have been enjoying the timer feature. I set the timer when I leave for work and when I come home the unit has been on for about an hour and it's much more bearable upstairs. We haven't hit too many 90+ days yet this summer to really see what this thing can do, but so far my husband and I (who are both generally people who run hot) have been able to sleep comfortably with the blanket on.It does use a lot of I power, although I live in an old garage apartment with presumably old electrical. I have this plugged into the circuit with my bathroom, refrigerator and microwave. I have to unplug the unit to use the microwave or my hair dryer, which isn't terribly inconvenient.We've both said this thing has been worth the money, and thanks to amazon prime, I ordered it on a Thursday and it was on my front porch Saturday morning."
"I bought this air conditioner solely on the Good Housekeeping recommendation that I read about on the Amazon site. Since receiving it and using it now for most of the summer months, there are both good and bad things to report.The good: It has for the most part kept up with cooling our living room and kitchen area, which is what we bought it for. This unit replaces a window air conditioner rated at 10000 btu which had no problem cooing the area. At 14000 btu's, I would have thought that we could have hung meat in the kitchen, but that is not the case. Hot days, the units compressor never shuts off, and is obviously taxed to the maximum trying to keep the temperature at the set 72 degrees, which it never gets to. So I guess the ""good"" isn't really all that great.Now for the ""bad"". There's plenty to complain about since the first day. The unit is noisy, and not just air blowing out from the fan. We have a Gree 10000 btu unit at the other end of the house in our bedroom which is much quieter and frankly blows the Wynter away in it's cooling ability. The Wynter unit also has an annoying bussing sound which is emanating from parts unknown whenever the compressor is running, which is most of the time. I can lean on the unit and usually get the buzzing to stop, but it becomes tiring to stand there all day holding one's hand on the air conditioner to alleviate the sound annoyance. Setting it on an area rug and an occasional 'thump"" on the top sometimes works for a while.The controls on the front of the unit were obviously designed by a three year old, because you need vision like a hawk and have to be able to lean down to about 2 feet off the ground to try to interpret the hieroglyphics that are used in place of actual words for each button function. The remote is equally useless, as the buttons are impossible to understand.The latest issue I discovered is shown in the picture. How in the world a bug got into the control screen on the front of the unit, who knows? Maybe Good Housekeeping could explain."
"I have had this unit for just over a year. It still works. I think the numbers on these units are theoretical and not actual. This unit seems to have the potential to move 14,000 BTU’s, but not without some help. Many complaints say that the hot air hose leaks at the unit. This is true. The couplers for the hoses are very cheap and do not seal. They are also very easy to break when connecting or disconnecting. The hot air exhaust is also located just below the room air intake for the unit. Without making some changes, the unit will inhale its own hot air and become very inefficient( it just will not cool the room). I removed the outer shell of this unit (probably voiding any warranty) and noticed a host of internal design issues. Mostly just a lack of thermal barriers between the hot lower side of the unit and the cold upper side. One by one I sealed holes and gaps and then applied a fiberglass and foil tape on the bottom side of the internal divider wall. I also removed the plastic spokes on the intake and exhaust where the hoses plug in to increase the air flow. I made a dam with a piece of cardboard on the lower 3 inches all the way across the evaporator intake(cold upper section) to prevent the cold side from inhaling hot air from near the hose connection. Last I used weather strip to better seal the hose connections and prevent hot air leaking back into the room. These changes dramatically increased the efficiency of the unit finally allowed it to reach its potential. I was able to maintain a 25 degree temperature difference inside my 2 car garage on a 113 degree day.I doubt that any of the units you have looked at can reach their full potential without some kind of crafty intervention. So you should expect a large degree of BS in the numbers given. Always go as big as you can afford on the cooling potential of the unit. Even if it’s twice what you think you need."
"I bought this as it has same specs as a Haier unit and even looks very similar and saved me a trip to a home improvement store and having to transport a 100 pound box.  I thought it would be very similar and both were based on a manufacturer reference design.  A couple of the issues I found:The top vent is poorly designed and very small.  When fully closed it has a 1 inch gap to allow cold air to exit the top but blows straight up.  When the vent is fully opened, the vent is 2.75inches deep but does not redirect the air from the 1 inch gap.  The air from the 1 inch redirects the air from the vent so even with the vent fully opened, the air still blows almost straight up at the ceiling and then is pulled back to the return air on the back of the unit creating a small air bubble.  The room I have this unit in as 12 x 22 with a ceiling fan in the middle of the room.  The square footage is roughly half of what this unit is rated for but because of the poor venting it does not cool the room.  I build a plenum to place over the venum and direct the airflow forward.  Not the room cools as it should.The next issue I found is that the unit creates negative pressure in the room even though it is a dual hose unit.  This should not be the case but it is constantly pulling in moist warm air from outside the room so my relative humidity hovers around 65%.  I do understand the relationship between the cooling power of the unit and the size of the room, but that is not the case as the unit is not cycling on and off and the Haier unit did not have this problem.  This room does have several computers and the sun sets over this corner of the house.This unit does cool quite well, the observed temperature difference between the return air and vent is 24 degrees and the squirrel cage fan used for the vent does move a lot of air.  However, because of the poor vent design, I would not purchase again and can not recommend this unit."
I looks like a good unit but has some design issues. The hose ends are hard to put on and stay on - poor design. The carbon filter cover will not stay closed poor design on the tabs. The good thing you can use a piece of packing tape. The only good thing is it makes cold air!!!
"It cools a large room and hallway well.The downsides, needs some foam to seal around the window frames, the vent had missing screws or over tightened screws causing parts to fall down into the blower. I spent my first day fishing out parts from down in the blower and that caused quite some annoyance."
"Let me preface this review in that I do not think Whynter makes bad products, although every manufacturer has designs that are better than others. I bought this unit and ARC-110WD, a 11k btu model in one purchase. The 11k model has done a fantastic job, and to be honest, it cooled circles around this 14k model. Blew it out of the water.When I unpacked  this AC, the first thing noticed was that the fit and finish was terrible. The chassis is a lower grade blow molded plastic and it seems like some of the various sections were forced together, as there was evidence of distress in the plastic. The louvered vent at the top also did not move smoothly in addition to being unevenly mated to the chassis. Not a good first impression.I was willing to forgive all the cosmetic discrepancies as long as it did its job as intended. Well, it did not get high marks in that regard either. First off, the thing is LOUD; numerous rattles and the chassis vibrates excessively. Much experimenting was tried to quiet the thing down, and eventually shimming up 2 of the wheels so it actually sat slightly unevenly and the use of a towel under the unit got the vibrations down to some semblance of tolerable.On to the next problem: The location of the condensate drain. To be frank, its completely asinine, being like 2 inches off the floor. Now this machine supposedly utilizes evaporation of the condensate to aid in cooling, but if it is even slightly humid, then don't expect this machine to keep up, because it won't. Be ready to just make a mess draining it, since a cookie sheet is what you need to drain this thing and carrying a cookie sheet of water = complete failure. After a few times of mopping up water with bath towels, the final solution was to put it on a beater night stand I had, with the towel under it and some spring clamps to chock the wheels so the POS didn't vibrate itself off the night stand. I yanked out the plug, inserted some clear tubing into the drain bung and let it drain into a HVAC condensate pump I got at Lowes. I drilled a hole in the window vent backer plate for the tube and the pump would dump the water outside.The biggest insult was that it cooled like garbage. It DID cool, but the 11k seemed like it was shooting out penguins and sno-cones while this loser just traded 100 decibels of noise per hour to cool the place down a degree. The 14k had to cool off only 100 more square feet than the 11k but it struggled and it never seemed like it was blowing cold air. Cool, yes, but not cold.Final Verdict: This machine is probably where Whynter learned what to not do or it was just a rebrand until they found some better outsource. Maybe it is not even their design, as it is also sold under the name of Edgestar and Royal Sovereign. This unit is not a total pile, but it is enough of a pile to the point where I decided to replace it and try to sell it on Craigslist. No one would buy it after seeing it in action, so off to the dump it goes since I don't have time to waste entertaining people just to tell me now because they can see the obvious that its a POS. Maybe I just got a dud and everyone else has had good luck, since most everything is hit or miss unless you want to plunk down some serious cash."
"Given reviews I'd read from a number of sites online and here on Amazon, I had high hopes for this air conditioner.  I'm quite disappointed. We are in the second day of a five day heat wave (the second already this summer) and my little two room apartment does not feel cool and dry at all.  I have it properly sized for the square-footage of the apartment, properly installed in a casement window which I retrofitted quite snuggly, and--since I discovered in the manual provided that it is optional--I've removed the intake hose.  I have a separate fan on it's highest setting to move the air from the small bedroom in which the AC is installed into the small living area where I spend most of my days.  Even at the lowest setting of 61 degrees and with the fan on high, my apartment is still 80 degrees and the humidity is in the 60's.The condenser runs constantly even if I set the temp to a more reasonable (and hoped for) 72 degrees and the fan on low.  To top it off, the unit is loud and the condenser has a low, pulsing sound to it that makes sleeping with it on difficult.The unit is quite large and quite heavy and the icons for the control buttons on the unit are etched in the buttons and are the same color as the buttons.  So, I have to put on glasses and turn on a bright light to locate and use the correct buttons.  What's the problem with prominent labeling?I'm supposed to rate the energy efficiency of the unit.  I have no idea since it will be a month before I can see my electric bill.  But, given the fact that the condenser never ceases to run, I'm expecting a high bill.  I'm also supposed to rate the remote control.  Frankly, I found it confusing to use so I don't use it.And finally, because the unit doesn't work all that well at reducing humidity, some water condenses on the unit surface next to the conditioned (cold) air vent.  I keep having to towel it off.It's not 98 degrees in my apartment with a dew point of 73, but almost $600 is lot to pay for something that ""kind of works a little bit.""TWO MONTHS LATER:  Aside from the fact that this unit doesn't cool as hoped, once again I want to point out that the noise from the condenser is extremely annoying.  It puts out a fast, pulsing, rhythmic noise that eats into one's psyche like a dripping faucet.  It is loud and constant and maddening.  The AC is in my bedroom and, even on the hottest nights, I have to turn it off because it disturbs my sleep so much."
"My Rating is based on 18 months of usage.  Bottom Line: It cools a 400 sq ft bedroom.  It's noisy ... with my phone app, I measure 78db from 8 ft away.  Because of its ""top heaviness"", it's IMPOSIBLE to roll other than on a hardwood/laminate/vinyl floor.  [I have to get on my hands and knees and push it at a point that is no more than 8"" above my 1/8"" pile rugs to move it to another room in the off-season.]Installation: by far the hardest part is screwing the four couplings onto the two hoses ... they just do NOT want to start [there's no learning curve ... it'll take 5-10 minutes to start the threads on each one]; inserting the paper-thin 'carbon filter' took a minute, just about as long as it took to unwrap the AA batteries; but there's more ... like most other reviewers, I wasn't happy with the window insert ... left way too much open area, plus owing to the holes being centered top-to-bottom, there was only an inch above and below the hose coupling and that caused a major issue with my sloped sills and stool height; however, I was able to make a custom insert [prototype] in a matter of minutes [an additional two inches in height was added to the 'bottom'] ... using pipe-insulating foam tubes around the entire perimeter of the inset makes for a perfect air/light tight fit.Operation: the manual makes no mention of it but I think you need to rotate the deflector fully for good conditioned air flow; the fan runs CONSTANTLY [with the compressor when cooling] ... I'm not yet fully comfortable using the timer function; the set point calibration is off ... you'll have to determine what it should be to get the room down to the temperature you want [in my 22x22 room and the unit 18"" from the wall, my set point had to be set at 68F to get 75F in the middle of the room at bed level] ... OPPORTUNITY for IMPROVEMENT => have the remote measure temp and send that temp back to the unit!  [I forgot to measure he temperature of the air leaving the unit, but I suspect it's not much lower than 60F].I have a 14K-BTU window unit in my shop ... that, my friends, produces 53F air."
"I didn’t realize how heavy the unit would be, or how loud.  Also, needing to be vented to a near by window, really limits placement in the room. I’m not sure I would have spent the money had I realized some of these things."
"Don't get me wrong, it works, but if your are someone that needs consistent temp to sleep, don't buy this product. Set at 61 deg it might be able to get down to 66 deg(it was under 60 deg outside) And after it was up and running the instruction manual says there is a 5 deg variance in accuracy. Temp fluctuations....... So if waking up hot then cold then hot would drive you up the wall, don't buy this Whynter ARC-14S 14,000 BTU. It's sorta on the loud side also."
"This is my review of the Whynter 14,000 BTU Dual Hose Portable Air conditioner. The unit blows air out at a temp of around 59 degrees F, so cooling is what would be expected from an A/C this size. The reason I bought this unit was because of the dual hose system. I expected the input air to be used to cool the compressor and the condenser and not pull air from the room which would cause a negative pressure and pull hot air in from other rooms. However, the amount of air being pulled into the intake hose does not equal the amount of air being exhausted to the outside through the exhaust hose. Now I didn't measure the difference so I can't state the specific air flow through each hose, but it was easy to discover. All I had to do was stand under the central air conditioning system's intake in my apartment and feel the blast of hot air being pulled into the room. My apartment is on the second floor so all the A/C duct work runs through the hot attic. Obviously, the unit is pulling air from the room along with the air being pulled from outside through the intake hose and pulling air from other rooms. At this point without taking the unit apart, I can't tell if the pulling of air from the room is by design or if there is a manufacturing defect that allows the room air to be pulled through in combination with the intake hose and then exhausted. If it wasn't for the hot air being sucked into my space, this unit would be top rated by me as it has sufficient cooling power. As it is though, I can only reach around 85 or 86 degrees with the outdoor temperature at around 100 degrees. Also with the cold air vent blowing up to the ceiling, I purchased a 4"" x 12"" 90 degree A/C duct vent at a home supply place that fits perfectly over the top vent and directs the air straight out from the front of the unit. As for Amazon, delivery was fast and the packaging was in great shape. The unit arrived without a scratch. Thanks Amazon."
"Works great, best non-dedicated AC unit we've used.......until about a day ago. After a year and a half of solid use the unit began leaking water all over the carpet and >>the drain pan is empty<< No clue what's going on here but there's NO way for the user to service this apparently. It's of course, mid July here in norther VA with 100°F temps and near 100% humidity. Not sure why there's no way for us to clean the pipes but it seems like something is clogged or come undone inside.I want to give this a glowing review but we may now have to replace the carpet in our living room because of this!All info online has ZERO information on this issue. All I can find is articles talking about the drain pan which is fine but not the problem we have. So until I can get this fixed I'm forced to give it two stars because it IS a fantastic product while it works....until now and it's not a small problem."
"This type of air conditioner doesn't seem to be very efficient.  First, I live on a boat so there is no insulation that is a given, it is siting 80 degrees + water. The first one I bought was a 10,000 btu  and it couldn't keep up, temp inside got up to 88 degrees. I returned that one and bought this 14,000 btu with pretty much the same result.  Previously I had cooled the boat with a 5000 btu window unit. So after I returned  this Wynter unit I bought an 8000 btu window unit. Yesterday 7/5/24 it was 92 degrees outside and a wonderful 72 degrees inside. Both the 14,000 btu and the 8,000 measured 61 to 62 deg inside the vent but the window unit has a wider vent than the 2 uprights and it is much closer to the ceiling. Hey no HVAC person here but the window unit could do what the upright couldn't with just over half the btu rating. Not to mention it cost nearly half as much."
"What can I say? I was immensely excited to finally receive the much praised, rave-reviewed Whynter 14,000 BTU Dual Hose Portable Air Conditioner (ARC-14S) just before the summer heat season began, but was left with such dissatisfaction that I didn't mind packing it all up, carrying it into my car, and make the trip to a UPS Drop-Off just to get it out of my sight.I'll make this brief and to the point:-*- It arrived sooner than expected via free shipping (thanks to Amazon.com!)-*- Well packaged and sealed!-*- Markings and scratches on plastic casing (seemed a bit odd since I bought a NEW unit, but didn't want to feel like I was being too picky)-*- Louder than expected (not even large, bulky window AC units are as loud as this portable unit I had, even while standing on carpet, not hardwood floor)-*- DID NOT COOL! I carefully read the instructions, multiple times, and gave it a solid try about 10 times throughout the week it was in my possession. It cooled for a few moments (~3 minutes), and then it started blowing hot air out! Both hoses were properly installed on the unit itself and out the window with the mount just as instructed, so I was confused as to why it could be blowing out cool air in order to cool the room, but then a few moments later push heated air back out through the same front-facing vent. Looked online for help, read through the manual (again & again) and still no luck in figuring out what was wrong. Took a look with a flashlight inside the unit through the back exhausts where the hoses attach and I did notice a few parts looked dented and not in ""new"" condition. Again, this seemed odd because despite the scuffs and scratches on the casing of the unit, there weren't any dents, so I didn't understand how the internals could have been dented themselves if the whole package was neatly sealed when it arrived to my home.After getting a reading of the temperature of a completely sealed bedroom where the unit had been running on cooling mode at 65 degrees for a little over an hour, it was in fact 2 degrees hotter (76 degrees) than before we turned the unit on and closed the one window (proof that my unit was in fact slowly but surely heating up the room when again this was the ARC-14S model, not the ARC-14SH model that had an additional heating option). My family and I concluded that this may have been in fact a refurbished unit (due to the internals looking dented) that just had no hope of ever successfully cooling again. What a disappointment and if this is how Whynter makes their products (possibly using USED parts into building supposedly NEW units as I had purchased), then I'll make sure I spend my ~$500 elsewhere, even if it means taking on a lower BTU unit but as long as it looks new and most importantly, works!2 STARS instead of 1 because it could've been that these Whynter units usually do in fact work, but unfortunately mine could have been just the defected one out of the bunch. I'll give them the unfortunate benefit of the doubt."
"I bought this AC unit to cool my office down and reduce the humidity in it, I live in South West Florida where it is like a rain forest more then half the year, very humid and hot.  My last ac in the office would reduce the humidity level down to about 50% and keep the air temp around 74 which was nice and comfortable, it was a 8K BTU unit similar to this one.  I thought this unit would do the same, WRONG! it will cool the room to whatever  temp i want including into the 60's but it does not get rid of the humidity.  I have never seen this with any AC in my life, usually the issue down here with AC running all the time is the lower humidity levels inside a home, the rest of my house has the humidity level in the 45 to 55% range but i cant get my office down and keep it down below 70% humidity level.. craziest thing.  So it cools super well but doesnt do anything to reduce the humidity level, even when running it as a dehumidifier.  Would love to hear from the company, sending them an email."
"The product worked great at first. It cooled down a large space quickly. It was a little loud but not terrible.However after a few months of owning it, it would no longer blow cold air. It was still under warranty so I thought it wouldn't be a big issue but Whynter customer support was no help. I went back and forth with them trying to get them to accept that the machine needed to be fixed but they just sent increasingly difficult tasks to handle.They sent instructions to take a part the machine and clean parts, take pictures of different parts and sent them to them, take apart other parts, etc. I disassembled the machine at least 3 or 4 times trying to get Whynter to accept fault. It seems like they have an intentional strategy of hoping customers will give up so they don't have to support the warranty of their faulty machine.I have LG and SereneLife portable ACs as well and have had no issues while having them for years. I will never buy a product from Whynter again."
"The exhaust and intake for the window is a bit loose, I cannot lock the window and they have NO SCREENS. The window screen is unable to close because of the fitting. The air conditioning and fan work good but dehumidification mode did absolutely nothing to drop the humidity in the room. The unit is much heavier than expected and quite ugly. The ac mode does work good and dropped temps fast and cuts off when desired temp is reached. Going to have to make some sort of makeshift screen and filter for the intake and exhaust as I already saw an ant outside crawling in. Pretty simple idea that I’m not sure how they skimped on. The Manuel states they have intake and exhaust filters for sale on their website but they don’t. The only filters available are the replacement carbon filters for the unit itself which are overpriced for a cheap and thin carbon or 3M filter."
"Pros+ It worksCons- Isn't plug and play, gotta cut PVC if your window length isn't a few inches within the long or short slider, there are tons of holes the window attachment leaks from that you gotta plug with your own weather tape or strips- Old model from 2015 or older: Though it might have been improved, the manual says twist clockwise, but the hose is twist counterclockwise, and this has been the case since at least 2017. It's a hassle taking out the hoses since the push in tab is rigid, not sure I can even take it off the unit side since the tabs are inside the unit- Pretty loud at <56 db at the lowest fan setting. Not impossible to sleep to, but not whisper quiet either. The fan can't turn off so there's constant noise even if the room is coolI would try out the Dreo TwinCool 12000 BTU Smart Inverter Portable Air Conditioner instead if I had the chance since it's 42 DB or 25% quieter, has a more modern design with inverter, and may not have these issues."
"If you live in a dry, desert climate where it reaches over 100 degrees every day from June thru September be aware that this air conditioner will not suffice unless you have ceiling fans to help distribute the cool air. I live in the Sierra Foothill region of California where it reaches well over 100 degrees every day and we have massive wildfires in the summer which leads to smokey air. I am currently using this unit to cool down my living room and kitchen area which is approximately 750 square feet. The space is too big for this unit and during the heat of the day, I cannot get the room temperature below 80 degrees (with the unit set to 61 all day)especially not without ceiling fans. I do not recommend buying this product unless the room is 500 square feet or smaller and you have ceiling fans. In addition to the ac unit, I had to purchase a Honeywell Tower fan to circulate the air in the kitchen. We also learned that if there is a wildfire in the area,generating smokey air, you will have to remove the intake hose and cap it at the window and leave it open to suck air in from the room, and not from outside. I live in the county of Mariposa where we were evacuated from the massive Detwiler fire. When we returned home and turned on the ac unit, it sucked in the smokey air from outside and made my house smell like an ash tray. I called customer service and they advised me to remove the intake hose and cap it at the window. It still smelt a little smokey in the house, but wasn't as bad as before. If I had to make my decision over again, I would have bought the LG 15,000 BTU Window unit instead. On the positive note, I think this unit would be great if it was in a smaller room with lower ceilings and fans. It's not too loud and was really easy to set up."
"This is my first time owning a portable AC unit, but I've been to friend's houses who've owned them and now I'm jealous I didn't go for something like what they had. I just put this together today and am not very impressed. My apartment is around 700 sq ft, I'm lucky if the air extends past 300 sq ft. The unit is VERY loud, even on the lowest fan setting. I also read that the ERR rating was 11.2, but when I got the unit the sticker on the machine states only a 7.9 so now I have that to look forward to.It does cool the space quickly, but its a monster. Setup wasn't that easy either as the directions that were included were incorrect. I watched the prod video here on Amazon. Also the device doesn't seem to turn off after the room reaches the desired temp but rather keeps running. Right now, I have it on its lowest setting and its loud AF in my apartment. I need to turn it off every time I hop on a call."
"So, I decided after I turned 70 last spring that it wasn’t a good idea for me to install window air conditioners. I looked into portable air conditioners and decided that Whynter air conditioners seemed a good bet. Accordingly, I purchased two of them in 2016.During the 2016 season, all seemed fine. I live in Maine where it where it can be pretty chilly, even in summer, so I didn’t use them a lot.As I said, in April 2016, I bought two Whynter air conditioners, but one of them stopped working properly after one night in the new summer season of 2017.  Apparently, the evaporating system was not working. That’s actually a good thing that it stopped working, because I had read horror stories of people finding that their flooring was ruined because of leaks that happened when air conditioners malfunctioned, leaking water on their floors and carpets. I was happy that the carpeting and flooring were not ruined.Anyway, Amazon suggested that I contact Whynter troubleshooting, so I did that. I learned that either I had a bad connection or a bad fan (the one that evaporates the water). Whynter sent me images to do the troubleshooting.Unfortunately for me, the first image showed the air conditioner without the intake/outtake hoses. Not being technologically savvy, I didn’t realize that that meant I needed to start from there—without the hoses.  That’s probably my fault for being stupid, but still I think they should have been clear and specifically stated to take them off. Later on, that posed a problem, but friends helped me to solve this problem—at length….But the final image showed an air conditioner that wasn’t similar to mine. When I emailed the tech person, he said it wasn’t a problem. I emailed him back saying that it was because the connections I was supposed to be looking for were in the box I didn’t have…He then decided that I had done all the troubleshooting that I could do and suggested sending my machine back to Whynter. He gave me an estimate for a repair that seemed sensible, even with the cost of sending the air conditioner via UPS. It was a lot of money (around $350 shipping and repair costs) , but still less than the cost of a new air conditioner at $500.So I sent my air conditioner back, and about a month later (delayed because of wild fires in California) I got an air conditioner back. I say an air conditioner because I did not receive MY air conditioner.I was never told that I would receive a refurbished air conditioner back, not necessarily my own, repaired. The one I received was clearly not my own which was practically brand new. Remember, I live In Maine, where I probably use an air conditioner ten or fifteen days absolute maximum during the summer season.This one I received had scratches on it, had a ventilator that would not hold open, and had a non-functioning light that was supposed to turn on in the dark to show temperature, functions, etc.  Furthermore,  I did not receive back the charcoal activated filter which I had not retained at home as I had expected that my own air conditioner would be returned to me, repaired. To do Wynter credit, upon my complaint, they did replace the filter (as a one-time courtesy), but they told me that I could find the other accessories online… They were pretty snippy about replacing the charcoal activated filter, reminding me that it had to be replaced every two months or so. Like I didn’t know…I spent a great deal of money to keep this air conditioner going, and I would NEVER purchase another Whynter product."
"his unit doesn't reach the set temperature 70 degrees (only 74)  remote should have a backlight, so need a flashlight at night.  Will have to follow-up with support, still brand new/under warranty.This is my second Whynter product and the other one works well in the same size room on the attic floor."
"If you're buying this unit to install in a sliding glass door: don't.If you're buying this unit to cool a large space: don't.The Whynter fails in the two areas I needed it to work most - a large space, and one which only had a sliding glass door as a window. The Whynter simply is not built for either purpose despite listing itself as 14,000 BTU and 500 sqft of cooling. It cools about half that. And not particularly well (even when properly vented).Most importantly to me, the room I really needed it in only has a sliding glass door and Whynter's dual hose system is not compatible with nearly anyone's sliding glass door kit. More, their own window kit is only good up to around 48 inches of window. Forget it, too if you want to use the proprietary intake filter Whynter sells with a non-Whynter sliding glass door kit, it won't attach. You'll have to go to a separate website to buy a connection extender if you want that filter. (If you don't care about the filter, then you just have to get lucky and find someone selling a 5 inch dual hose window kit, also extremely hard to find.)All around the Whynter has been a miserable experience. I've spent over a $150 dollars on accessories and modifications just to get the dual hose with filter plugged into a sliding glass door kit. Plus it doesn't really cool 500 sqft.So I give it a big thumbs down."
"I received my unit yesterday.  I'm using it to cool my living-room/kitchen until I get a new HVAC system for downstairs.  The unit gets nice and cool.  I've been running it on the highest fan setting at 69 degrees.  The fan is definitely loud at this setting but no more than a powerful fan.  The plastic exhaust hose is hot to the touch so I switched to insulated expandable ducts.  I'm using the supplied window vent unit so I'm probably sucking the hot air right back in.My rating is related to secondary product materials.  (1)  The instruction manual seems to have been written by a minimalist--very lean on details.  It mentions the drain plug but does not offer any further information on how to drain the unit if  needed.  I live in a very humid climate so I would not be surprised if I had to manually drain it.  (2)  The ""fixtures"" (I'd call them grates or hose connector clips) have 4 holes each, but I received only 4 screws in all.  The screws were inadequate and they easily fell out when the window slider was moved.  I've replaced them with longer screws and nuts.  (3)  The manufacturer made no effort to make the ""window slider"" energy efficient.  The fixture screws were screwed into the slider, leaving small holes once removed.  There were extraneous holes in the slider that I sealed when I sealed the gap between the fixture and the window slider.  (4)  The window slider needs to have move room above and below the hose connectors.  I had to add some styrofoam to raise the bottom edge of the hose connector to the window stool height.I will probably end up making a custom window slider to move the intake/exhaust hoses further apart.Except for the annoyingly cheap screws and window slider, I am happy with my purchase so far."
"Worked great for about 15 days of use, then started producing a strong smell similar to mercaptan (the same chemical added to natural gas so you can smell a leak). Reached out to manufacturer for advice about a week ago, and they've ignored me. The fan function still works fine, but I didn't pay $500 to just cool my house an extra 3 degrees overnight."
"I would not recommend this AC unit.I purchased this unit at the end of June after my old portable AC unit finally stopped working after 10 years of use.  In August, out side temperature got hot, sometimes around 90 degree.It did not work at all.  My room never got colder than 5~7 degree below the outside temperature.  I installed everything right as in the manual.Out side was 90 degree and inside was 84 degree while it was on.  My room is 400 sf.  normal hight ceiling.  Insulated well and no big windows.I contacted the customer service.  I got this answer. ""If the unit is blowing cool air out of the front and hot air out of the exhaust hose, then the unit is working properly.Portable air conditioner solutions are differentiate from wall mount units and central air conditioning in many ways. One way is that the thermometer of the air conditioner is located at the back of the unit where hot air is generated. Also, the output air into the room is within 10-15 degrees less than the ambient temperature. Please understand that portable air conditioners work of the air in the room. What generally happens is the unit will draw out the heat and humidity in the air, but the air extracted from the room gets replaced by other air coming into the room from outside through ceilings, tiny openings, under the doors, etc... For example, as the outside temperature goes down, the unit will work more efficiently to cool a room.We suggest that you uninstall the intake hose and leave the unit with one hose only (exhaust hose).  The unit will work as a single hose unit. The dual hose portable air conditioner comes with one air intake hose and one air exhaust hose, the air intake hose pulls air into the portable air conditioner from the outside to cool off the compressor and condenser coil. The hot air generated from the air conditioner is then expelled out the exhaust hose.  Operationally, a dual hose portable air conditioner has two main advantages over a single hose unit. A dual hose portable air conditioner will cool a room faster and will help minimize negative air pressure situation in the room. If the outside temperature is much higher than the room temperature, you can block the intake hose and it will function like a single hose unit.""To me this answer sounds like "" that is what you will get from this unit, just deal with it "".  Just a fan worked better in a way.I tried as single hose unit, but no difference.  Amazon was kind enough to let me return it even after 30 day from the purchase date.  They took restocking fee though.I purchased  Frigidaire FRA156MT1 15,100 BTU Window-Mounted Median Room Air Conditioner        from Amazon.  This unit works great.  I had to install in the window but it really worth it and cheaper and quieter."
"I purchased this air conditioner to replace an old window unit in our small bedroom window with the hopes of improving our cooling, reducing A/C noise, and improving our light (due to less of the window being used. Boy, was this an absolute failure.First off, this thing is extraordinarily loud. It is impossible to even be in the bedroom with it on. Its noise comes from several sources:1. The air rushing in and out the two hoses is perhaps the loudest noise, and there doesn't seem to be any way to reduce it. I have tried bending the hoses this way and that, and nothing does it. It's just insanely loud.2. The fan that blows cool air into the room is also very loud - the second loudest thing. Even on low, it is much, much too loud. Even turning the unit into fan-only you can't possibly use this thing as a fan.3. The compressor is very loud. Really, really loud.4. There are annoying hums/rattles. The construction is just very poor, and the big empty water container and the components rub against each other and rattle and make annoying hums. (Think of the occasional resonant hum you might get on a water cooler when the water is at just the wrong level, or something.) This is the most distracting noise because it's not ""white noise"" like the other noises. I spent a huge amount of time moving it this way and that and pushing and pulling things to get this to go away and it just doesn't go.On top of all this, it's just plain huge. It's probably 3 feet high (higher even than the windowsill!) and more than a foot deep. It makes our radiant heat radiator look small (which of course it is because it has to fit underneath the window). It's just ludicrously large.The vent on top can't be pointed anywhere but straight ahead. Yes, it has extraordinarily small louvers that imply that air can be directed left or right, but they just plain don't work. To aim the air you have to move the whole unit left and right, and in doing so you will probably make the noise from the air hoses louder. The more turns, the louder the noise.Finally, it came in a box that makes it nearly impossible to pack back up and return. It was two separate pieces that fall apart when you cut the straps holding it together. The bottom just falls right out. Now how am I going to return it?The bottom line is that this is just plain a horrible air conditioner. In my 17 years of doing business with Amazon, this is absolutely, bar none, the worst purchase I have made and the biggest waste of hundreds of dollars I have ever spent. I will try to figure out how to return it. I believe Amazon is doing people a disservice by offering this for sale and I sincerely hope that my review will help people decide about this model. I will be happy to respond to comments."
"This is the 2nd brand/model of room A/C I've tried.  First one was a Honeywell single hose unit.  This one definitely cools better than that. So, that said, there are a number of thing I hate about this thing. I try to use this in my bedroom, the warmest room in the house, a smallish room, and it's just too dang loud.I should also mention, I live in Seattle, and the temps in the past weeks I've had this thing have never got past like 85, and it's cooled off well below 75 at night, usually to mid-to-low 60's. The room itself gets up to 90 or so, but just saying... I'm not fighting triple digit temps during the day so your mileage may vary.So, the things I have issues with:First and foremost, I cannot stress enough how astonishingly loud this thing is.  OMG is it loud.Second, it doesn't (seem to) have an energy saving feature where the whole unit can shut down when desired temp is reached. Maybe I'm stupid and missed it, but the fan runs all the time. And the fan is pretty loud in and of itself... not to mention, it's just the right pitch that even wearing ear plugs to try to sleep with it on, it cuts right through them and into my brain.Third, the fan just sucks.  I blows mostly straight up, and it's difficult to get it to point ""outward"" toward the front of the unit. I really don't think I'm stupid, it's just poorly designed.Forth, When the compressor comes on, the compressor fan is also very, very loud. It roars.Fifth, the compressor inexplicably stops sometimes, and stays off for an extended period, and the temp really climbs. I've checked the condensate reservoir and nada... I don't know what it's problem is, but if I click the temp down about 5 degrees, it will come back on with a vengeance and freeze me out.Sixth, I didn't use it (I made my own), but had I used it, the window kit leaves a lot to be desired.Is that it?  Gosh, I don't know. Oh, with the big-ol'd hoses, it's not exactly flexible to position this thing.  Oh yeah and WHY OH WHY DON't MANUFACTURERS OF THESE THINGS PUT *HANDLES* ON THEM!?!?!?!?  This thing is heavy. Getting up the stairs in a challenge not as much because of the weight, thouogh, but because it's HUGE and and unweildy.So.... there you have it.  I would return it if I could, but I had to go out of town for 2 weeks before trying it, and got rid of the box for some stupid reason. Now I'm thinking to sell it."
I only received one hose! I bought it last year at the end of last summer. They won’t send another hose. Only reason for not giving 5 stars.
"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PORTABLE AC!!! It lasted less than 2 months! I purchased this item on June 6th. It was delivered June 11th. I used it for the FIRST TIME July 13th.

"1. It has no handles2. The drain plug is less than 3 inches off the ground, and is generally a massive PITA to use.3. It doesn't come with the 2x4s that you'll need to use to raise it enough to drain it4. It also doesn't come with the flat baking tray you'll need to catch the water5. Thinking of draining it with a hose? No chance. It's so low to the ground that you'd have to put it at the edge of a cliff to get it to drain downwards.6. Troubleshooting is extremely basic and useless until...7. Support advises you to take the whole thing apart and clean it.8. There's 20 or so screws holding it together, at least half are recessed deep into the machine.9. You don't have a screwdriver long enough to get into the recesses ... and if you do, the handle is too big to turn.10. Taking it apart is a massive PITA.11. When you take it apart, you'll see nothing wrong with it.12. Putting it back together is a PITA, though less so than taking it apart. But good luck getting those recessed screws in.13. It's wildly heavy and hard to move if you can't roll it. (See point 1).14. There's no onboard storage for the remote control; velcro helps.15. If the window you want to vent to is unusually shaped, even a little, get ready to improvise, a lot.16. It works great until it stops working and no one on the planet knows why."
"Easy to use. The fan can’t be directed towards an area. It just vents out almost straight up. The room does cool fast; but, the room is not that big, so it should cool fast.  It is pretty loud, and will suddenly totally turn off when it gets to temperature.  I have no idea why it doesn't at least just keep the fan on.  That sudden off and on wakes you throughout the night.Update after using summer 2023: I can’t  sleep with the constant fan or air. So …. if you are like me, turn the unit down to 63 early in the evening (about 3 hours before bed), then turn the unit totally off when you go to bed and open a window. I live in a climate that cools down to at least the 60’s at night. If I get hot in the middle of the night, I just throw the covers off. Anyway, I would not be a return buyer of this unit. IT IS TOO LOUD TO SLEEP."
"Dead on arrival. Compressor Wont Stay OnWhen the compressor turns on the air is pretty cold. However, the compressor will not stay on for more than a minute. The compressor hum starts out healthy, slowly gets deeper sounding until it eventually abruptly shuts down.I read many other reviews here, the owners manual, the support instructions, reviews on other sites. I've followed all the install instructions. Ive troubleshooted everything. I wasted half a day trying to get it to work. I tried powering down the device in case it was a circuit logic issue. I tried basting hot dry air onto what I assume is the evaporation sensor in case it was a faulty evap sensor telling the condenser to shutoff.This is an extremely common problem, its the number 1 complaint. No solid answer as to why this issue occurs.My best guess at this point is that the coolant line has a pinhole leak that's slowly draining, or the coolant was not adequately filled in the first place. The radiator fins were bent and dented up on arrival too. Either poor manufacturing quality or a poorly refurbished unit resold as new.Either way, I'm annoyed and unimpressed. Gave this AC a chance because it was so highly recommended, but it seems this product is riding on the coattails of its past reviews. Don't waste your time with this product."
"My office is located above the garage on the south side of the house. It's always been 5-10 degrees warmer than downstairs. This unit does a great job cooling off my office and is helping lower the humidity in my home! But I'm only giving 3* because it arrived damaged. The box had no bottom, just Styrofoam with tape holding it in place. Bits of the packing foam were falling off everywhere as soon as we brought it in from the porch. We saw that it was damaged, but it was hot in my office...so we carried it upstairs and set it up anyhow. At least it cools well...but after just a couple of days, it already smells so musty! It's heavy and I don't want to deal with the hassle of returning it. I don't regret the purchase, but I'm very disappointed by the damage and the musty smell."
"Overall it works well for my bedroom- I’ve read other reviews about it not lasting longer than a year so I’ll update if anything changes.- controller: i wish the controller would work from far away- you have to be within 4 ft of it, kind of reducing the need for a controller. it doesn’t have a backlight and it doesn’t sync up with what’s shown on the air conditioner- it works, but what I’ve selected directly on the unit is not reflected on the controller.- noise: this thing is loud! I was prepared for it to sound like a fan, but it definitely has some kick. I don’t mind it because I like white noise and hate the heat.- performance: This works way better than my window unit and it cools down my bedroom pretty quickly. The only bummer is that I have noticed that it blows hot if its over 95 degrees out. I just turn it off then turn it back on again and that seems to be working for me. I try to catch the heat before it gets that hot indoors though- according to their troubleshooting tips, I’m just trying to run it when it’s too hot both in and outdoors?"
"IMPORTANT: I had two Dreo Units and tested them. When the unit is in between AC cycles, it blows outside exterior air into my bedroom. Like a window unit does when it’s running,  But as a portable AC unit they are supposed to use the homes air and recycle it. Pulling air from the home to cool the air. I have had multiple AC units while living here. This is the only one that I’ve owned do this. The Dreo customer support claims that their products don’t pull from the air outside and asked I attach images for proof of my install quality.As an OCD perfectionist I had zero issues showing them my install quality. I used the non adhesive foam for the window frame as well as the top of the window to block the air from coming up in between the gap. I then used adhesive foam around the window panels. After all that I added HVAC air duct tape. This weather proofs it and seals the window fully. I also use insulation wrap on the vent tube so there is ZERO chance hot air exhaust or exterior air could be coming into my room.For those that use portable AC units often you will know what it feels like when the air is circulating through properly. If you’re in a bedroom and if you have to shut the door, you will feel a little tug bc that’s the AC unit pulling air from the home it creates pressure.It should always feel this way even on “Fan” mode.However the Dreo unit on “fan” mode and or in between the AC cycles, it doesn’t have that pressure pull. I can tell that the air quality is also bad. I have an air purifier in my room. It lights up either green, yellow or red depending on the air quality. It’s been yellow and red since I installed this Dreo AC unit. I have allergies BAD so once my eyes started burning and itching i knew something was off. Not to mention the smell alone was enough to make me sick. That “outside” smell. Like someone’s been sitting in the sun for 12 hours - or like a wet dog. That has been blowing in my room in between the AC cycle. I did laundry and I can usually smell clean fresh sheets for days before it goes away and when I tell you it took minutes for my entire Bedding, closet, and room to go from laundry fresh to wet dog outside smell.Again, Dreo claims it isn’t their product and that it shouldn’t do this but it’s clear to me. They created an amazing look, the noise level is so quiet, I love the remote that glows in the dark & how you can turn the light off on the appliance so it isn’t bright when you are sleeping, I love the double air filter that you can remove to clean bc it protects ALL of the parts inside the appliance, if taken care of properly and cleaned weekly it should run for years, and I was excited to see it came with non adhesive foam and also adhesive foam to help weather proof it because I normally have to buy that myself at Home Depot so that was an added benefit. The look is sleek. It’s not massive in size which for a 12,000 BTU they are usually large. I love how COLD my room is & I mean COLD! the 12,000 BTU I’ve had to set this unit between 73-75 bc I was actually freezing when I went to bed. I am heat intolerant so this is huge for me.I’m telling you, I did research on AC units for 2 days before making this purchase and if it wasn’t for the exterior air being pulled into my room on the fan mode, I would be writing a completely different review for you all.I would have given it 5 stars all around.Well, I do feel like the window panels are weakly designed and should come with two “size B” panels and have screws to keep the hose better connected to the panel, but that’s here nor there. I’m not a Dreo product manager but they should hire me after this. LOLIf you listen to any review. This is the one.NOTE: If you DONT have allergies or don’t mind the “outside wet dog” smell, this is a wonderful AC unit. Fantastic actually. As I said above I had a list of MUST haves when researching AC units. From owning previous units I knew what I didn’t want and what I needed.This Dreo unit has all the wants and needs. It’s the perfect unit if it wasn’t for the air flow and air quality it gives off between AC cycles. So when I say I’m disappointed I have to return this unit. I’ll end up sacrificing some wants in order to get a unit brand that works as it should to recycle the home air. It’s a shame. I would have been glowing if this issue would have been non existent.I hope that Dreo really takes this to heart and gets the fan mechanics right bc they will outperform any other AC appliance on the market. Hands down.The smart app is a bonus too.I hope this review helps others and you don’t have to go through what I went through.I’ve wasted so much time, money, & energy, during this process. Plus the researching and installing etc. not to mention the money I’ll have to spend to get more HVAC tape and a new HEPA air filter bc this one is trashed now. 😢So to sum this up- it’s an amazing buy if you don’t have allergies and can deal with the smell.Otherwise, definitely go with something else.Make sure to check & see how these products work. I know I will call the next brand before I buy it. To double check all these things.And note to Dreo: Hire me and you would run the AC market. LOL mic drop."
"Update: after realizing there was a ton of heat escaping from the tube, I did a little jerry-rigging and insulated it. As of this morning it was able to cool the house 9° in one hour. It's going to be 98° today. Hopefully with the adjustments I have made it will hold out and keep temperature better. Fingers crossed.I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. The unit says it's 12,000 BTU but I seriously doubt it's more than 8,000 maybe 10,000. I bought it to replace my 12,000 BTU window unit which kept the house at a Frosty 65°, in 100° weather. This thing is struggling to keep the house at 74 in the same heat. There are a lot of features that are really nice about the unit. It's very high-tech you can control it from your phone which is nice, and it's extremely quiet which I did not expect. I think I may return this one and exchange it for the 14,000 BTU unit."
"The air condition is super quiet, and cools very well. I purchased this to replace a 13 year old portable Black and Decker model which did not require a water drainage hose.  I also have another portable unit by another manufacturer which does not require drainage. I was under the impression from photos and even the instruction book that came with this product that if you just used  it in cool mode and not dry or fan you would not need to use the water drainage hose. Boy was I wrong. I learned the hard way, ruined my hardwood bedroom floor with roughly a full bucket of water which I didn't realize was leaking until I felt the warped floor in the morning. Had I known I would need to use a hucket, I would not have purchased. If that isn't an issue for you then its a fine air conditioner."
"Two years ago I bought two Dreo portable air conditioners for the bedrooms and they are FANTASTIC….what the heck did Dreo do to a nearly perfect product… they ruined it. No longer does it have duo hose that both exhausts air and intakes air, instead they replaced it was single hose that gets hot as heck. Yes it is quiet when on low but the room smells like dirty sweaty Gym. with my first Dreo model this does not happen nor does the hose get hot.DREO if you read this go back to the first version it was far superior. What to improve….the remote have it backlit on low all the time unless customer wants to turn light off"
"Worked great for about a month, now just sits there blowing humid air. Wake up sweating at 80 degrees, turn in down to 65, then it runs like a madman. Put it at 72, just blows humid air, other minisplit works overdrive. Good if you sit there and turn it on or off, but nothing is automatic."
"Just received my ""new"" system, and it's clear that it has been used previously. Tape smudges on the panels, hour log on the app shows 264. Worst of all, the unit doesn't appear to be blowing cold. It's been running for 30 minutes in my 81 degree room with no change in ambient temperature. Disappointing."
"Ac unit should have come with 4 window panels.  Only 3 came in the box. Needed that extra extender to fit in my large window. Very difficult to assemble the panels I did get. Not senior citizen friendly. Trying to slide the panels together was tedious. Very small hard to see connectors. I wish they would have pre assembled them before shipping, it would have made things much easier.This is an emergency ac unit so I can’t review its cooling power since I haven’t used it yet."
"Right out of the box after reading and following instructions the unit did not power on. Watching video did not help. I contacted Dreo Customer Support, which was excellent by the way, and they walked me through what the unit should do when powered up. We tried different plugs and unit is receiving correct voltage but still no power. I have started return process with Amazon. UPS was provided my contact number to arrange pickup. Well they arrived today with no notification, good thing I was home. Nothing against Dreo but I’ll probably go a different route when purchasing my A/C.UPDATE: After contacting Dreo and speaking with customer service representative Tina we resolved the issue. They wanted a second chance and offered to replace my Dreo A/C. Things happen and I agreed. After receiving and plugging it in it powered on this time. I got it for our bdrm to use with the generator during power outages but it will be used mainly my garage."
"Item arrived on time.  But it did NOT fit my hung window.  In accurate website description, the listing says 17"" and in the unit it said different.  I contacted the seller but didn't get anywhere.  So I returned it, too bad because it works well and cools a whole rooms and then some!"
The adhesive on the insulation is insanely sticky; I've already spent 10 minutes trying to remove it from my hands and they're still covered. What a mess! The AC unit does not cool well beyond a 3 foot radius.
I love this but when on number 2 and number 3 of the A/C there is an annoying jingling whistle sound. Didn’t start happening until after a month of use. 🫤 other than that it works fantastic!
"Cools well enough BUT there is no option to turn off the fan as others do when the unit reaches its set temperature. As well, the ECO mode temperature only goes to a low of 76f. Why can't it be set lower? All in all it's a dissapointment."
"I researched throughly and had a faith to this AC. Got this delivered yesterday and I had it run over 11 hours this afternoon for my office room. It did not cool down a degree! It was only around 90+ degrees not exceeding 100” outside, but even with lowest temperature set of 65”, it did not go down staying above 92” inside. I went through all reviews making sure spacing and install was correctly done. Nothing else seems to be problem, but when I checked again at night, I noticed it still says to stay at 97” in the room when outside is at 77”. Will be returning this. Doesn’t recommend!"
We were sent a used air conditioner in a torn and tattered box which had holes in the bottom and the electrical cord was hanging out of the bottom of the box!  The original covering was not on any of the pieces. The remote had scratches on it.
"Did not cool my garage, which is less than the square footage it claims to cool. Multiple delays and finally a complaint before receiving a refund after shipping back. Do not recommend."
Product states that it does not require constant drainage but it does.
My room just keeps getting hotter and hotter and it does not cool my room
Does not perform as advertised
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This worked great for three days until it started rattling while the fan was blowing. For an almost $500 unit, this is unacceptable. Puts the quality of the machine into question."
It blows warm air and doesn’t cool room.
"Wasint worth the money, regret buying this."
"TL;DR: Disappointed with the DREO portable air conditioner because it's a single hose unit, which is inefficient and causes warm air to seep into the room, making it uncomfortable.Very disappointed with this portable air conditioner. I thought I would really like it because DREO usually does a great job making their appliances, but this one doesn't satisfy me.This is a single hose unit. Single hose air conditioners can be less efficient because they pull air from the room to cool the unit and then expel it outside. This creates negative pressure, causing warm air from outside or other parts of the house to seep in, which can make the unit work harder to cool the space.As soon as I turned it on, I could instantly tell something was wrong. I felt a draft of hot 95-degree air from outside seeping into the room, making it extremely uncomfortable. This made other parts of the house a lot hotter as well.You guys at DREO need to make a dual hose version with an inverter how you did with the TwinCool that I can not find anywhere."
It did not work even in my small apartment I did better with a fan and didn't have to don't have to fill it up with water and ice.
"Its basically an expensive fan, cool mode isnt actually cool and feels no different than fan mode"
"I spent a half day and could not get this unit working for longer than 45 minutes. It constantly threw an E5 error and would shut off - which I had to look up online to mean 'tank full', and it would continue throwing the error even after I drained it of all water. I tried running it both in 'normal' mode as well as continuously draining mode using a hose attached to the top drain. Sometimes it would run for 20 minutes, sometimes it would shut off immediately - but always ended with an E5.I did read online that sometimes the float valve can get stuck in the full position, which can cause this, but I wasn't about to open the unit up to try and find it."
"I ordered two of these:  One worked great, but the other one was failing out of the box.  The customer service was actually decent and they sent out a replacement unit (but I had to deal with the bad unit), unfortunately the second unit was bad as well.  They ended up just giving me a refund instead of a working unit which was quite the bummer.  Now I am stuck with two bad air conditioners that I have to figure out what to do with."
Apparently there is no drain hose available that attaches to the drain fitting. I've reached out to customer service and they sent me the hose pictured and said just shove it in the hole. I don't recognize the thread as any standard size and they wouldn't or couldn't tell me what it was.
Only cools if you’re right in front of it. Does not cool a small room that good. Extremely loud for a bedroom
"I purchased 2 of these units and after 2 months of use only 1 still works.  So far zero help from the manufacture. Update, They informed me that it is defective and being as its 5 days over the warranty period, the could just give me a 10$ credit towards a new one.  Do yourself a favor and find another brand with better customer service and a better product.As far as the working one goes, It dose cool a moderate to small room fairly well. It is very loud though. To watch tv at a resalable volume you can only really run the unit on low.  I think they are overly optimistic on their rating as far as BTU and SPL ratings.This is an update. The company got a new one to me at no charge. I updated my rating to 3 stars."
"I just got this so it’s a very initial review. The box came damaged and one of the wheels was broken right out of the box. It didn’t take too long to install and works well enough and keeps my room cool. That being said, the tube doesn’t stay in all the well on my window and if I move it at all, it falls out. It’s loud and might keep you up at night if you’re sensitive to noise. I’m pretty happy overall though.Pros:Keeps room coolEasy to installNo issues with the drainage so farCons:Poorly packagedCame with a broken wheelLoudDoesn’t stay in my window well (I recommend using tape to bolster the tube)Probably a bit overpriced for the quality of it"
"Update 10/4/24: the unit no longer cools the air. I’ve seen it logging temperatures as high as 82 degree Fahrenheit with my thermometer. The fan still works but I think the condenser or whatever the cooling part is called is dead already. It’s only been a few months. I’ll contact customer service to see if they will fix the unit. I heard they are not good with honoring their warranties so we’ll see what happens. Wish me luck.Update 9/8/24: the other day the unit shut down and flashed an error code. Looked it up and it’s because it got too cold it seems. But the unit wasn’t really running for that long before it happened. Anyways, I let it do its thing. I didn’t use it at all and let it run its course with the antifreeze or whatever it’s called. Anyways, the temperature gauge was going crazy saying that it’s super cold or really hot. I couldn’t think of what else to do so I tried draining it, which I’ve done in the past. When I have drained it in the past, I didn’t really get that much water output. When I get it this time, though water just started pouring out. And ever since that date of the error code, it’s producing so much water.The temperature goes as low as 60 degrees Fahrenheit but it doesn’t seem to get my small bedroom THAT cold. It also doesn’t help that the vents don’t actually aim the air left and right because of how small they are. The way my room is laid out it’s hard to turn the whole unit in the optimal direction. And if anything it blows air to the right so that makes aiming even harder. It’s also pretty loud even on low."
"I had a window AC unit for a year and a half until a disgruntled HOA decided those weren’t allowed. Purchased this based on reviews and was sorely disappointed. Significantly louder than I expected, and the unit runs nonstop! I reached out to customer service and they said that’s how it’s supposed to be, unless you turn on sleep mode. What kind of AC unit doesn’t turn off when it gets to temp?! Other things to note, mostly first world problems, any time to push a button to make a change (on the unit, app, or remote) the unit dings for every change which can be disruptive at night. The app only allows you to schedule the unit turning on and off, but not the temperature, so it will turn on to the last setting. Which if you’re like me is colder during the night. Also had an occasional smell like something was overheating. Ultimately I returned it and purchased the Midea brand like my former AC unit and it’s significantly better!"
"I like the actual unit, but the window kit was so long we had to cut it.  I have a standard sized window and do not feel that I should have had to cut the panel (which is not easy to cut)."
"I am not impressed either with your response to my query, which never came, or your product. The User Manual is poorly thought out and has numerous improper English terminologies, obviously not written by anyone whose first language is English. The window sealing unit is not well thought out, it is suitable only for what you perceive as standard windows. My window is only 30"" wide which required that I cut off about 5"" of the inner sliding piece in order to attach the exhaust pipe attachment. Additionally it does not fit securely as it does not allow for the particular design of my window. In fact the entire Air Exhaust Duct Assembly is very poorly designed. The instruction to 'insert the exhaust pipe assembly (exhaust port end) into the window seal panel assembly and 'screw it up' (this is a very strange expression) is ludicrous as there is only 1 screw provided and their is no hole in the Window Sealing Kit into which the screw can be screwed without drilling a hole. The phrase on page 13 of the manual says 'Insert the exhaust pipe assembly (exhaust port end) into the window seal panel and screw it up. In English 'screw it up' means to botch it up or mess it up, surely that is not what you intended. Do please hire people whose first language is English to write your manuals otherwise they become not only useless but hysterically funny. Attaching the unit that attaches to the 'Window Sealing Unit' is another problem. You show the 'Air Exhaust Duct Assembly on page 11 with 'Connector' on the left and 'Flat Nozzle' on the right. It is unclear what those terms mean. Nowhere, that I can find do you explain clearly how the 'Flat Nozzle' connects to the Air Exhaust Duct'. It took me many minutes to figure out that the nozzle must be attached by turning it anti-clockwise and turning it several times. There are numerous badly thought out phraseologies, terminologies and explanations in the so-called 'Users Manual'.More like a 'User Nightmare.' Finally I was disappointed in the air conditioning unit itself which is very noisy. If used in a bedroom, how is one supposed to sleep with such a racket going on. Sorry but you need to rethink your entire procedure from beginning to end."
"First, I wouldn't recommend this thing for what it costs. It does put out cool air, but it was barely able to maintain 24 C in my roughly 300 sq ft office with an outside ambient of 26 C. When it hits 28 to 30 this summer, it's going to struggle.The piece that goes in the window is junk. You will have to rig up a piece of cardboard if your window is more than 26"" but less than 48"" wide. There is an extension, but you will have to cut it if your window is less that about 48"" wide. Even if you manage that, it's still going to wobble around on the sill. I had to fabricate something out of plywood to make it work.The instructions aren't useless, but they aren't particularly useful either.This thing is LOUD. There are two fan settings. Commercial airport and aircraft carrier flight deck. Seriously. With the fan on low, it's difficult to carry on a conversation and I have to turn it completely off to make a phone call.According to the instructions, you have to open a stopper that is a couple of feet off of the floor to drain the condensate (which the instructions helpfully warn you not to drink). I foresee a puddle on the floor when I have to do that.It has WiFi. Inexplicably.I gave it 3 stars because it makes cool air, but that is being extremely generous. Do yourself a favor and get something else."
It was loud even on low fan.  Did not cool my room after running it for 12 hours.
This noisy unit will rattle you to the core!
I purchased this because I wanted someone that wasn’t loud. Boy was that a lie. Easy to install. WiFi feature was something my partner didn’t expect but seemed excited about. Very very loud :/
"This is the second summer I’ve had this AC. Last summer was pretty mild, so far this summer we’ve had a heatwave of upper 90’s/100’s for a week now and this AC is not cutting it. I have had many portable ACs over the years so I know how they work. I purchased a 10,000 BTU knowing it cools more like a 5000 BTU window unit. My bedroom is only 250 square feet. For reference I have an amazing Honeywell in the living area of my house that cools well so I know it’s not simply “too hot.” This SereneLife has only been able to take my room down about 10 degrees less than the actual room temp. Full power, filters cleaned, it’s still 80 degrees."
"Let’s just say  I’m Grateful for packaging tape! Absolutely no directions on how to install the tubing into each end , tubing Wouldn’t stay in, so I ended up having tape them. Also, they give you this tiny little screw and tell you to use to secure the bracket  but there’s no point of entry for the screw to adhere .Unit is noisy, A YouTube video said it’s like being in a hotel room with a level being close to six decimals.I attempted to watch YouTube videos to try to get the tubing installed correctly and couldn’t find anything after about four videos. Very frustrating."
"At first the sound is nice, like a white noise maker, but after ten minutes, it starts being a high pitch sound which is not tolerable if you're trying to work or rest.The foot print of the AC is wonderful, small, not too tall either.  Easy to move around.The window hardware did not work for my window (which is 32 inches wide).  The second plastic panel is too long and overlaps with the opening of the first panel.  You will have to saw one panel if your window is not larger than mine.This AC is in no way as good as the little Edgestar AC that I had bought on Amazon 5 years ago.I am going to give it a few more days but I will probably return this SereneLife AC unless I find a way to block the high pitch noise."
"This is a very noisy AC. Rather heavy too. Somewhat easier to install in a two panel slide up window set than one would imagine, but still, not worth all the noise when I try to cool a room. Also very noisy when you set it on Dry."
I installed when still cold out. I used twice ans the second time stopped working. The compressor doesn't stay on. Everything is as it should be according to instructions.I emailed (checked my spam email) the warranty web site twice and registered the product. Nothing i have received nothing. Looks like I bought a 40lb paper weight. I would recommend staying away because of the after product support/lack of
"This feels no different from a regular fan. Barely cools and definitely cannot help you on an extremely hot day, not to mention how noisy it is."
"The product is completely Wi fi and confusing. There could be issue with gas leakage in  Refrigerant which was not disclosed. It’s not user friendly in the back where tubing goes. Was not disclosed how long you can run a/c unit before emptying built up condensation. It’s not set up fir continuous emptying of condensation.  The hose is cheap short and inconvenient if one uses their system. This in itself was a big no for me. I returned it unused new immediately in its box, which by the way the box was damaged at the bottom when. I have had other a/c units, which work great, however are no longer available so I ventured onto anaxon…but this one does not report  on Amazon all the information needed and certainly not considered  safe enough for me based on the. instructions and information, and lack of..  Ivdecidedcto go their own we sue forcthis product, and there was a bad review there.. My personal opinion, really do a deep dive on these kinds of units before purchasing."
"I bought this product to help cool down a room.  I had an error code as soon as I plugged it in and turned it on.  I checked the manual and the e5 code wasn’t listed in the booklet so I reached out to tech support.  After going over the issue with tech support with no resolve to my issue, I was told that my product is defective and to contact the seller since it was within 30 days of purchase.  I happened to notice that there was a return label on the side of the box the unit was shipped which showed where this product was returned 7/5/24.  I paid full price for a used and defective product.  This is being returned."
"AWFUL AIR CONDITIONER WITH MISLEADING CLAIMS. The product description is not accurate. Deafening noise, no swing function or remote. This unit is disruptively loud... no way this is 57 decibels. (Their sound measurement description indicates it's quieter than a refrigerator, but that is 100% untrue. It is unusable in a bedroom, office, nursery, living room... actually, anywhere in a home!)  It does not cool even remotely the square footage they say it does. I have another, different brand portable 10,000 btu A/C unit that is outstanding. This one is terrible, promises untrue results, and is not recommended. I only wish I could have returned this, but the Amazon drop off place would not take it because I didn't have the original box. WTF. Waste of $ that I need for other stuff."
I have a 35 inch window which I think is pretty standard.  The window panels were much too long to fit in—they were much longer than the panels for other portable AC ‘s that I’ve owned. I had to borrow a saw to cut one to a length that would work.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT A SOAKED FLOOR! So now instead of it dripping from one spot, it's dripping from multiple spots underneath the unit, doesn't drain from the back consistently despite there being a hose connected, and has almost ruined my hardwood floors. Do not buy! It is VERY loud. It cools the main room of my small house since my central air died but I literally turn the TV to 50 when I normally watch on 12.It has not even been 2 months so I'm calling and hopefully Amazon will do the right thing and take this POS back."
"i purchased this ac in 2021 and it cools down my entire two bedroom apartment (681sqft) all the way down to 65 F. my problem is that it leaks now. it might be really good at taking humidity out of the air, but if you don’t drain it every hour, it will leak all down the back and cause a huge puddle underneath. i’m hoping to get my money back on this item."
"It was an ok A/C for a small room but its not quiet.  After 6 months the entire LED display started fast flashing for no reason and was unrecoverable. Consider it a short-term ""disposable"" A/C...  Wrote support but no response."
"Disappointed with this product. I ordered this product used (never doing that again) in hopes of cooling down my room, which always seems to be hot, no matter the temperature. I live in SC, and summer’s can be brutal, so I purchased this in preparation. It’s February and today was 80°, yesterday was 85°. I was so excited to get the ac unit. When I received it, the box was damaged and ripped on the sides. When I opened it, there was a big crack in the back of the unit. To top it off, the “adjustable” panel did not fit into my window, it was much too big. There are no instructions on what to do if the panel is too long for the window, and shortening blocks the hole for the exhaust connecter. To top it off, there are even marks on the sliding panel where it looks like someone attempted to cut it down, but gave up. I’m pretty unhappy, as I will now have to lug this 55 lb. unit back to UPS, and wait for a refund before I am able to order another."
"When it works it really cools the room.  Unfortunately, it keeps turning off.  E5 code shows up, but in the manual there is no E5 code.  The manual is written in broken English.  I’m so disappointed in this unit.  It’s a shame because it really cools a room.  Wish I knew what E5 means."
"We finally had hot enough weather to install this unit last night. We ended up needing to cut the window installation plate so it would fit our 28 inch wide window. Not cutting it would have blocked the hole where the vent pipe is inserted. The unit is quiet and sufficiently cooled down the room. However, this morning, we discovered that it had leaked all over our floor (the FL indicator never lit up). As we investigated the cause of the leak today, we found that the wheels are imbalanced, causing the unit to tilt slightly and therefore leak water. This is absolutely unacceptable. I'm going to try to reach out to customer service and see what there response is. **Update 7/17/24**I emailed the company right away and have never received a response from them."
"I am disappointed with this purchase. Two reasons one, it claims to have wifi capabilities..it does not! That was one of the reasons for my purchase. It clearly has the word wifi on the unit above the power button, maybe that translates to power in some language, i dont know. The second, i wish i would have taken a picture, the unit was clearly assembled wrong. I had to take every screw out of the housing in order to try to align the side panel to the front. There is no way it could have happened from shipping damage. I had to break one of the tab's off in order to fix it, and it is still cosmetically flawed. If i had bought this for home instead of work this would have been a quick return! I guess the only plus is that it is fairly quiet. Still disappointed!!"
"First of all, the item came in a terribly damaged box, but the unit itself seemed to be okay. The first couple of months went well with it installed in our master bedroom. The AC blows super cold (the reason for two stars), but about a month ago it started making a loud rattling noise when turned on the highest speed. Okay, so we avoided the high speed and stayed on medium. A couple weeks in and the rattling started on medium. Okkaaayyy, we put it on the lowest speed. Everything was fine until the rattling started on the low speed as well. It’s gotten to the point where the rattling is so loud it’s impossible to sleep, I feel like my brain is rattling along with it. Pretty disappointed as it all started after the return window. Now my choices are to be kept awake by noise in a cold room, or sweat in my sleep in a quiet room. Both options suck."
I did a lot of research before buying because I had a Honeywell last for one season before the thermistor went out and I messed with that all last year to make it work. This one seemed like a decent buy but didn’t work pretty much right out of the box. It basically shuts off with an E5 error which means overheating. I tried the dehumidifier which seemed to work for a day or two but to drain the water I had to monitor the water jug I placed to catch the water. Now it won’t even run for more than ten seconds before turning off. I plan to return tomorrow which is a major effort because I live in the third floor of a walk up and it very heavy. Maybe it’s just bad luck but I wouldn’t recommend this one and won’t be rebuying it.
"Easy install for the most part. Great to add to a functioning AC in home, but struggles to cool a single 10X14 bedroom (140 sq ft) below 75 without additional cooling help. Purchased a 10,000 BTU model that should cool up to 300 sq ft."
"Never had the chance to use the product.  The assemblage was ok, not great: the hose did not fit well in the provided window pane, but the most important thing is that the unit would turn on, work for 1 - 3 minutes and then stop.  A message on the display said: Error 5.  The instruction manual was of little use: no valuable troubleshooting and a list of 3 errors that did not include E5. The on- line manual was just like the paper manual.  The phone number NEVER took me to a person, despite multiple attempts.  Finally, 3 days after my 1st e-mail, someone answered and asked first for ""proof of purchase"".  Note that I had filled the warranty.  We went back and fort every 2 - 3 days and finally she informed me that E5 was ""failure of the water pump to turn on"" or something like that.  So I asked for the faulty piece.  A few days of silence and then she typed: ""you know what? You still are within 30 days from buying the product.  You need to return it to Amazon!"".  So I did and I got my money back.  That's all I can tell you: if you need help from the original seller, don't hold your breath!"
"Product arrived in a box that was badly damaged.  Set it up and it seems to run adequately, however it vibrates extremely.  Additionally, this unit is louder than the first (the fan vibration, perhaps?) .After a few minutes the unit's A/C portion turns off (as if the thermostat has achieved it's desired temperature, which it hasn't) and the tempurare setting reverts back to 77 degrees Fahrenheit.The remote does not work to reduce the temperature (it can be reduced directly on the unit itself).This is the second unit we've purchased.  The success we had with the first one was the reason we purchased the second.The process to return this unit will be massive.  I'm hopeful that SereneLife will respond with a fix that works for us."
"Very loud. Noise registers as over 90 decibels on phone app even at the low fan cooling settings, and sounds like a large engine is running. Practically useless cause it doesn't even cool very well. If you are within a couple feet in front of the AC, you can feel cool air coming out, but beyond that it doesn't really cool down a room."
"It has worked great for over a year now to cool down the room, but it leaks everywhere. Had to put it in a plastic tote sitting on blocks of wood because it doesn’t collect the humidity in the tank like it’s supposed to. Just drains underneath the unit instead. Other than that, the wifi feature works great with Amazon Alexa and it cools down the room great. But it’s very loud. For the price, it’s worth it for the extra little hassle."
"This unit effectively cools a large room with a cathedral ceiling.  However, it is very noisy and  so loud that, even with silicon earplugs, I can hear it at night."
"We have three ACs with the same btu, this is by far the noisiest and weakest of the bunch..."
I bought this and the Black and Decker 8000 BTU model. They both perform about the same. What you might expect at a 350 price point. Noise is about the same but it is not bad. The problem with this model is the window attachment. It is too narrow. The hose connects to the attachment at the bottom of the window between the ledge and the sash window but it is way too narrow and there is not enough clearance at the level of the window ledge itself. The B + D model is far better in this regard. For the sake of a few dollars (or cents probably)
Please don’t buy it.. I wasted so much money and time. This is super loud and it blows a fuse. DONT BUY! I never leave reviews either but this I had too.
"Keeps my studio apartment cool enough. Not the easiest or best fit for window, though, so be prepared to use a lot of duct tape."
"I LITERALLY CAN'T SLEEP!!!!!!!!!!! I can't say enough bad things about this horrible waste of money. I hate this thing so much, and wish I hadn't spent a dime on it. It's so incredibly loud. The sensor will randomly turn it off for a few seconds for some reason, and then when it kicks back on it wakes me up every. single. time. It's so intense and literally makes me feel like I'm right next to a garbage truck. I've had black and Decker units before this, and I foolishly didn't want to spend the money on one of those again... You get what you pay for I guess. I hate this product SO SO SO SO SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!"
"This was  areplacemet of my older different brand that stopped working. I se this up and was excited as we have been having 100 degree days. Well right out of the box it didnt' cool anything! The Fan setting and the cool setting were the same. Yes i had it set at 62 nothing. Spoke with amazon, emailed the complany nothing , crickets. DO NOT BUY THIS !!! Maybe I got a bad unit, but no answer in  days from the company is a disgrace!!!! i emailed them several times.Going to return this and buy an LG !"
"I was disappointed that this portable air conditioner was not able to cool a 150 sq.ft. bedroom adequately. The installation was fairly easy and the air conditioner powered up successfully. The temperature outside was about 75 Degrees, so I set the AC to 68 in order to cool off the room. It blew cool air (not cold) and the room temperature never got below 71 degrees during the day. After trying it for 2 days, and following the brief troubleshooting tips, I concluded that it was never going to reach the desired temperature. I had saved the packing material, so I decided to return it."
"Unit was very loud and kept shutting off, thius waking us up every time it turned back on .returned on July 15. They received it in one day. Waiting almost a month now for a refund. At first it said 8/1, then 8/4, the. 8/9. That’s when I notified Chase 8/5 of the problem. They put a temporary refund on the account. Now 8/9 it still has not been refunded. Some nonsense about issuance failed, we will refund in a few days ….. JUST DON’T."
"Worked fine for first 3 weeks. Got the message to drain it, did so, it began leaking out of the bottom of the unit an hour later. Decided I could live with it draining from the hose out the back to prevent leaking. BIG MISTAKE! In 9 hours I emptied 11 liters of water, and it periodically STILL LEAKED! My entire apartment is less than 100 square feet (Yay NYC), how is it even possible that much water was in the air? I can't leave it on unattended for more that 2 hours - I certainly can't leave it on overnight.My guess is the passive evaporation that's supposed to happen through the air ventilation hose shut off when I drained it the first time, and now all the water is being collected for me to drain. Of course, between a delivery delay and the 3 weeks that it did work I can no longer return it to Amazon.  I've seen other reviews that specifically mention it starting to leak after first drainage. Do yourself a favor if you buy this and drain it after a week just to see if you have the same problem while you can still return it.Almost $400 for an air conditioner that I have to babysit and can't leave on overnight. This thing is awful!"
"Just installed, it works well for a small room, and the attachment fits my apartment’s horizontal sliding window!Only down side so far is that it does not have the “automatic swing mode w/ moving wind vent” as mentioned in the description, so I’m a bit disappointed in the misrepresentation of it’s functions."
I PURCHASED AND IT STOP WORKING TWO MONTHS WHEN I CONTACTED AMAZON AND THE COMPANY DID NOT RESOLVE ME AND THE ONLY THING THEY OFFERED ME WAS TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR AND SHIPPING OF THE AIR CONDITIONER. WHERE IS THE PRODUCT WARRANTY?NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE GARBAGE AND OF COURSE THE CUSTOMER WHO PAYS IS THE ONE WHO LOSES.
"If you need to move this unit upstairs or have to go thru steps...forget it.  No handles therefore while you can glide it as it has wheels, you cannot lift it as there are NO HANDLES!!! have to take it two stairs up.  Can't so likely will return.  Dramatic flaw"
"I’ve had problems from the start with this unit. It immediately had an E5 error which isn’t in any of their literature. Customer service stated to leave it unplugged for 24 hrs which I did, then it ran for maybe an hour. I got it when I didn’t really need it (middle of winter) because it was on sale and didn’t have time to mess with it. Now I need it and it won’t even run for a minute before the E5 error. Tried unplugging for 24 hrs no luck. I have the drain open and there is no water at all. Now a few days out of the return period and I’m stuck with a huge expensive paper weight. Yay"
Runs for 15-20 minutes and gives an E5 error code. Also could not get it to connect to the app.
"I've just unboxed this and set it up.  It worked for about 15 minutes and since then, it won't stay on (cooling mode) for more than a minute or so. It shuts off the cooler and fan with an E5 error. There is not listing of this code number in the troubleshooter, so I don't know what to do. Hoping to get a response from vendor so I can see if this is salvageable."
"This AC was never optimal but I bought it out of necessity. It was very loud and I had to use it in my home office. Participants on my Zoom calls could barely hear me speak over the noise of it in my 12x12 office. Bought in 2022- completely failed on me June 2024. So not waste your money. If you do purchase- get the extended warranty. Not to sound like my dad, but they just don’t make them like they used to."
I’d like to give a review of whether or not this ac can cool my room down but I can’t even set it up because the exhaust fixture for the window is too big. I’m not sure what to do now. I bought two of these units for the bedrooms in my house as we don’t have central ac and we are anticipating a hot summer…of course I bought these a couple months ago to prepare and now I’m not sure if I can return them as they are so heavy and the one box has been opened already. Frustrating That a standard window size isn’t big enough…
"I bought this in 2021.. had it in the box, didn't pull it out untill this summer(2024) leaks terrible!!! No cold air. In box came in.. standing upright.. had to store it to take care of dementia  parent.. got it out yo use for 1st time..DOESNT WORK!!! DON'T BUY.. $ 356.00 IS TOOUCH FOR A LARGE PIECE OF PLASTIC!!!"
We were excited with this unit which was bought to cool a small closet. It was used for less than 3 months when it stopped blowing cool/cold air. We submitted a ticket directly with the manufacturer which was not smart in retrospect (more later). The manufacturer provided no valuable support and they simply wasted our time with back and forth questions. They then expected us to pay for the unit to be sent back for repair. We then reached out to Amazon and they resolved it immediately by refunding and providing a pick-up of the broken device.
Put unit on porch enclosed with vinyl windows  Room size is just under 300 sq ft  The unit won't keep it cool with 90+ temp and close to 100% humidity.  Not sure if a bigger unit would do the job.  Not a good choice on my part.  Seems to be doing all it can do.
"I just received this today, and I'm very disappointed. Every minute or two it shuts down with an E5 error code. The manual lists error codes from E1 to E4, nothing about E5. The manufacture web site has no information, doesn't even seem to list this product. Some googling brings up no info, but with other manufacturers E5 seems to be related to excess water that needs to be drained. I'm plugged in the hose in the upper drainage hole, set up a bucket to catch the water, and put the AC on a small table and opened the lower drainage hole so that it can also drain directly into the bucket. Water is draining out both, but the machine still shuts down every 5 minutes. Very disappointed, no sure what to do."
"I loved this for the first year. All of a sudden, it’s now leaking and producing an absurd amount of water. Isn’t really cooling down the room anymore. Was good for a year but wouldn’t recommend this"
Arrived timely and will be perfect for the barnUpdated- they offered a rebate and seems like a total scam. Be careful buying from this supplier
It was doing a great job until it started to turn off with an E5 error which was not in the manual. I called and they helped and said it was a defective unit and I could return it. It's a rough repack to return. The fan works great but a $300 fan is a little much. I will be returning it.
"As others said, don't believe the positive reviews and this a/c is trash. I had it for about a year and I barely used it at all. It is super loud like other people are saying. I've tried other portable a/c so this one is definitely on the loud side. Wanted it for the wifi feature but totally NOT WORTH IT. just get a smart plug for your a/c instead. We got a heat wave here so I turned my a/c on and within 1 day it started shaking like its gonna blow up and it was making HOT air, not cool air. And yes, the exhaust hose generates a ton of heat no matter how well you try to seal the gaps or insulate it and all that heat is dumped into your room. So you'll pay an outrageous electric bill AND you'll get hot air when you desperately need cool air. Just don't buy this pos."
"This AC puts together easily and does a very good job of cooling the space - unfortunately despite the name, it's still very loud, particularly if being used at night, and the ""sleep"" mode doesn't help. If you're a heavy sleeper, go for it, but if you're not and needing it at night, this kicks on and off loudly."
"BE PREPARED TO EMPTY THE WATER FROM THIS UNIT EACH DAY, at least!If you want to have a hose at the back with a bucket, THEN PLEASE BUY THIS UNIT.Really, the unit itself cannot evaporate any water by itself. Also, it fills up a bucket of water in only a day.  I don't even live where it is hot, like California. If I did, I would have to empty my bucket at least twice a day.COSTOMER SERVER IS VERY POOR!I called them to ask where I could get a remote to replace the one I have.  They said they don't have them anymore. The gal said she would send me a small visa gift card for my inconvenience. Well, that never showed up.NOISE....YOU BET YA. IT Squeaked from the day I bought it.*** Want a good unit........THEN GET AN LG AIR CONDITINER. I have had mine now about 2 years in my bedroom. Never once have I had to empty the water out of it."
"The only negative is the noise level. We have a Honeywell we purchased last summer so we have a comparison. We purchased the SereneLife specifically because it was described as quiet and it is positioned in a bedroom where that quality is important. Unfortunately, every time the compressor activates, there is a loud buzzing or rattling sound that wakes me up.  The noise continues until the machine cycles off."
"I purchased this portable ac because I read many good reviews about it but after a few months, the first unit started making a loud whistling noise that I couldn't fix no matter what I did, and soon after it stopped cooling. I reached out to the company and they sent a replacement. All was good until today. The 2nd unit randomly stopped cooling... I checked the filters in case I forgot to clean them but they were clean. tried emptying out any water from the condensation chamber and still nothing."
"I bought this to go into my 19""travel trailer and it keeps it cool but isn't what the description says it's way larger I bought this one because of its size and it fitting in a certain spot and it is 34 inches tall not 26 like it states so a bit bulkier then expected"
Easy to useEasy to installNoise level good
"Bought this March 2021, so to all writing great reviews that just bought, good luck.I get FL error code everyday and have to drain even though I am not running in ""dry mode "" called customer service to find out why I am getting this code. Their response was to tell me since my unit is out of warranty they can not help me.I don't want them to repair or replace just tell me why I am getting this code.So i am going to replace it with another brand and use this for target practice, watch for the video on youtube..."
I give SereneLife no stars...got it last year 7/7/23 and the freon leaked out and the condenser coils freeze up with ice $300 to last one season. I hate throwing things away now I got to toss this in the garbage
There is NOT a filter for the condenser coil. You have to either remove the whole cabinet to access or do as I did and cut to bottom rear grill to access for cleaning. Sent a message to manufacturer with and received a silly response.
"They're ok. Keeps a 10x10 room cool. Bigger room doesn't cool though. Bought two. One of them is constantly leaking. I thought it might have been where it was placed, so swapped it with my other one, and its still leaking like crazy - several buckets a day."
"The product I received in the picture looks nothing like all of the review photos. And it definitely does not work like the ones in the reviews.  The unit that I received stays on for about one minute and then turns off. I am so disappointed, it is not like this air conditioner was cheap! My husband and I assembled it and read through the manual and did everything correctly. I’m sending it back."
"Depending on how you want to define ""freestanding"", this item is  probably a very functional and effective product...  BUT, it is not freestanding in the sense that it can be used without any outside vents.  Just like any other air conditioner it must be vented to the outside and this one really is only set up to work with windows that open vertically.  It looks as though something could be ""jury rigged"" to vent on a horizontal opening window, but it is not really made to do that.  none of the photos or advertising material include any views of the setup or include the vent hose"
"NOT GOOD FOR STANDARD WIDTH WINDOWS (36 INCHES AND UNDER)  THAT LIFT BECAUSE OF WINDOW KIT.  The sliding bars to window kit overlap and block the venting system to the outside. Basic remote, nothing fancy - batteries not included.  Very loud on hardwood floors, need a area rug to reduce noise, but still loud, especially when you lower the temperature - it sounds like a bus downshifting."
We kept up with the maintenance just a written in the manual and after about 2 months the unit stopped producing cold air. I was able to get a full refund though.
"I bought the SereneLife portable AC based on strong reviews.  My experience has not been a good one.  Out of the box the unit would only run for a few minutes before shutting down and showing ""E5"" on the screen.  There is nothing in the manual about what triggers the error message ""E5"" and how to fix it.  There is no phone number to contact SereneLife with contact filing a request for help through the web portal and then waiting for them to contact you.  Don't count on it, at least not with a quick response. A day later no contact by phone or e-mail to my request for technical help. There is no excuse for not getting back to me within 24 hours on a new unit that does not work."
When the unit showed up I immediately took it out of the box and noticed the bottom had been covered with a clear oily substance. I tried to see if it would run and maybe it was just some kind of assembly oil that was left over. It ran a couple hours without blowing cool air. Boxed up and returned the next day.
"Worked wonderfully for the first few months. Now all I can get is an hour before I received an E4 error code, and on the app, it is linked to refrigeration issues.Amazing the product lasted exactly until the refund window closed, like they know just how much freon to insert to ensure you are stuck. Really poor product design and wish someone wrote an honest review before I purchased it.Will answer any questions you have if you are thinking about buying this product, and help the next customer avoid being burned out of your hard-earned money."
"Complete waste of money. It might have worked great if had fit my window. But the adjustable second plate prevents the nozzle from being inserted in all the way. Your window either has to be ~26.5 inches, or equal to or greater than 37”. And of course my window is 34”.We’ve had such terrible heat waves in Oregon—I really needed this second unit to keep my bedroom under 80 degrees at night. Really wish this information had been included so I could have ruled out buying this product. Instead, I’m poorer and just as hot as I was before."
the remote wifi control stopped working after a week
"I've been using this for a  few days. Set up was simple and the unit works far better than the GE model that it replaced and much more quiet in comparison. The remote isn't quite as nice as the unit itself which I thought was odd but works well all the same.After using this for a little over a year it has stopped working entirely. I would occasionally get an E5 error that completely shuts the unit off. I would reset the power and it would be fine. As time went on it would become more frequent, until finally the unit will run for a couple minutes and shut off.Still works as a fan."
"This thing is rated for 300 sq ft, but you don't want to be in the same room for long. It is loud.Temp is impossible to control. Set point is no where near accurate.  I set it at 77 and it was still running at 75.I am so disappointed in this AC. It does cool, but you don't want to be in the same room and try to carry on a conversation.Update 6/15Unit was set to 73 in order to shut down at 77, my desired temp. This was last night.This AM, the room is 82 and the unit is not running. With the thermostat inside the unit, and with no fan moving air across it, I don't see how it could be accurate. Temp controller needs to sample ambient air at all times.I will now check into returning it for a refund"
"I've used this A/C unit for the last 3 months (June, July, Aug) in Brooklyn, NY and I gotta say that I'm very disappointed in its cooling ability. My room is 11x13, and this unit cannot bring the temperature of the room below 80F during the warmest times of the day when the temperature outdoors is 85F-90F. I might as well use a fan and save on electricity. During the heat wave when outdoor temps were in the mid 90s, my room was regularly 82-84F with this unit blasting.I feel like I wasted money on this unit plus all the extra $ on the electric bills this summer. Do not buy unless your room is very small."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            They advertise it at 52db, and that's the only reason I purchased it. It is false! See video. Lame and false advertising"
It makes a noise then go out.  I only had it 1 month
"Despite the Amazon description that this unit has auto swing, it does not. I bought this for that specific feature and it is simply disappointing. Caveat emptor."
It is very loud and the options are limited. It states that wifi is available but there are no instructions for set up. Definitely not worth the high price.
"Great compact unit. It is Louder than I was expecting. Still learning how to use it. Wish there were more detailed instructions on the buttons and settings. Zero instructions on WiFi, can’t find an app anywhere so the WiFi is pointless. Also the sleep mode doesn’t work. Literally same noise level with or without sleep mode. It does cool the room down and is fairly small size wise. With the lack of instructions and non existent customer service I’m not sure it’s worth the high price."
"Maybe others have had a better experience with this product but mine stopped blowing cold air after the 4th use.  Messaged  the Amazon customer service and she asks me ""I see you purchased this in June, may I ask why you are just now contacting us?""  Umm because I've only run it 4 times since I got it? I'm simply asking for a solution.  Contacted customer service for Serene Life and she kindly offered to send a replacement.  I asked her not to because the thing is so heavy and I'm an older single woman living on the 2nd flr.  Hard enough to get it up here in the 1st place. So...I now have a big, heavy expensive white noise maker I'm not sure what to do with."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It stopped working after 3 months.  Started making a thudding noise when compressor turned off.  Total junk!
Machine keeps giving me error message after few minutes of use.  Error says E5 which is not in the manual.  Company was no help.
"Very loud,  cannot have a normal speaking volume level with this device running even at lowest fan setting.  Unless cooling a garage or shed, I would avoid this product."
First day of installation and Ingot error codes. It is now not cooling at all!  Low quality product do not buy
I had ac one year and computer broke. Now what
"Don’t like the fact that it didn’t come with one of the important items to assemble it when it arrived, now I have to wait until I order the window sealing kit.  Doesn’t make any sense!"
Weaknesses:1. Loud: my baby jumps every time it restarts.2. Have to drain a bucket of water about every 8 hrs.3. The window extenders did not fit my window was too long. Had to tape a piece of wood to help close the gap.4. Warm air escapes from the back.Benefits: it does cool down but the warm air that escapes from back vent kinda works against cooling down the room more efficiently.Blows air pretty strong.
"After less than 2 months my AC started leaking leaving my carpet soaked with a stale water smell. I have kept the vents clean, drained properly and it continues to leak from the back and bottom. I have tried calling the customer service line which tells me I am the ""3rd person"" in line and estimated time is about ""10 minutes"" and I have been on the line for over a half hour.I regret making this purchase. I cant believe how horrible this experience has been so far and judging from the other poor reviews I'm guessing they will be no help and expect me to pay $100 to ship a defective product back."
"I hoped this would be the answer to the day-to-day dinner plates, mugs, and bowls. My plates do not fit. I am able to put 2 dinner plates, 2 bowls and 2 mugs along with some flatware (I had to remove the top of the flatware container because the handles don't fit through the grid openings).It works fine but such a minimal amount of dishes to get washed isn't really a labor-saving appliance.Unfortunately, with the Thanksgiving holiday, I am now 2 days past being able to return it."
This is a very specific review as I got this dishwasher specifically to do baby bottles and toddler dishes.1. This dishwasher takes forever!2. Whatever you have in the very corners do not get clean bc the bottle still has white milk droplets in it. Not ok especially when you are feeding to an infant as they are more susceptible to getting sick from things like this.3. This would probably dry regular dishes but not bottles or anything in a bottle accessory caddy. I even let it set overnight. I literally had to shake the water off them in the AM and still air dry them on a bottle rack.This has a baby bottle setting so I expected it to perform the same as with any dishes bc it is advertised to do these types of dishesI will be returning and hopefully getting a different one as I am not ready to give up and go back to hand washing mountains of bottles!
"Beautiful design. Easy, very easy to use. Sprayer is not very strong when using the water tank feature. I can not hook it up to my sink faucet but hoping sprayer will be stronger."
I am sorry I didn't check to see if there was a heating element. The water cools as it cycles.Air/fan dry only.I've only used it a few times. I can't comment on performance yet.
"Bought in November 2020, used lightly but consistently until it started having issues over this summer. It would start the wash cycle on its own while I was still filling up the water tank. If I turned it off and then on again it would work fine. I was away for 3 months and when I returned it would start the wash cycle but nothing would happen once the water was released into the compartment. No error codes. I sent the company an email and they asked that I send them a video. They informed me it was likely a failed washer pump after viewing the video and want me to dismantle the machine to pull the pump out so they can see it. The how to video they sent me was in Chinese, so not super helpful. Not worth the weeks of waiting and I have zero interest in attempting to install a new washer pump if they decided to send one. Will be buying a new dishwasher from another brand. Less than 4 years is not the longevity I would hope for at that price point."
"The pictures don't show just how small this dishwasher is. The silverware basket has two compartments and can fill up quickly. There is a picture on the dishwasher showing how to load it. The problem is the basket isn't built to fit dishes in as they are in the picture. I am single and don't use a lot of dishes. I started doing dishes every other day and washing larger dishes by hand. I found that using the cup tray would leave detergent residue in the cups. I decided to try washing dishes every day, but there are still some dishes that don't fit in the dishwasher. Daily washing has eliminated the detergent residue in the cups, though, since I no longer use the cup tray.The bells that are supposed to tell you when the reservoir is full are hard to hear. Sometimes they don't sound at all, and I only know that I have too much water when it starts to leak from the outlet hose.If you are careful loading the dishwasher, it does a great job of cleaning the dishes that fit in it (except on the cup tray), even when I was washing them every other day on the quick mode.If you only use small dishes, this dishwasher should satisfy your needs. If you use a variety of small and large dishes, you should probably look for a larger dishwasher."
"Original review “I wanted to give it a few months before I wrote a review. And so far I love this thing. We have a family of 5 (three young kids who like to use multiple cups everyday lol) and we moved into a new house without a dishwasher. We eventually want to redo the kitchen but until then we got this thing. I usually do three loads of dishes a day. Cups, bowls and silverware, and then plates. I love how this unit doesn’t have to connect to the sink (which is why this model won out against others) so I can be hand washing the big pots and pans while this thing takes care of the rest. It cleans the dishes really well. The only downside is the drying cycle makes a high pitch noise but it isn’t loud and you can just skip the drying cycle if you wanted. (I have when I’ve been in a rush to get dishes done- just did the wash cycle and then took the dishes and put them on my drying rack to air dry while the next load was washing) I’ve been very impressed. I generally wash my dishes on the quick cycle and it cleans them great and it doesn’t take a super long time!”*** updated review*** It’s been 9 and 1/2 months since we got this thing and today it crapped out. It now longer lights up or works in any way shape or form. To pay 400+ dollars on a machine (16 hours worth of working wage for my family) for it to no longer work after not even a year is literally heart breaking. I contacted the company to see if it’s under any sort of warranty or if they will back up their product. Will update the review if I hear back accordingly. Just wanted to warn others of this possibility!!!*** update number 2 *** I contacted the company and it was under warranty because it was used under a year. They sent free replacement parts and emailed videos of what to do. The first video was SUPER informative and worked great but that problem did not solve it for my dishwasher so I had to install the second part. That video was in a foreign language and didn’t show ANYTHING!!! A few quick texts to a friend who builds computers later and I got it put together correctly and it is currently working again. I hope it lasts longer than 9 months this time but  we will see. If anything else happens I will update more.Overall personally I think it’s worth it. I would personally buy this product again. The company does stand behind its product and its warranty and for that I am very thankful"
"The dishwasher cleans really well and seems of good quality, BUT we could not load it as the description image indicated: 12 oz mugs didn’t sit on the little shelf; plates fit awkwardly in rack so difficult to get everything to fit;  silverware caddy has certain sized holes so our silverware wouldn’t fit either. We tried to wash dinner dishes for 4 of us and ended up needing to hand wash 2/3 of things anyway. Didn’t work for our needs."
"I really like this thing. I went through a lot of different models, and possibly different companies. Who knows these days, to find what I want and settled on this one. I have no need for a full size dishwasher so I got this one. Primarily picked this one because it had an internal tank so I didn't have to hook it up to any water source.  Pretty much works right out of the box, just plug it in and hook up the hoses and you're basically good. After a few months it started leaking small amounts of water out of the bottom. Not where the hose hooks up or water, somewhere from inside. This is where my 3 stars came from. It has a year warranty, and I was within that time frame so I messaged the company and their response was to send them a video of the leak. However the only time I can find the leak is when it flows out from underneath the dishwasher over the course of a few washes. The leak is coming from inside, so I can't see where it's actually coming from. And taking it apart would void the warranty. I explained this to the company and all they did was sent me another copy and paste of the exact same message, requesting a photo or video. I tried to make them understand that I can't actually find where the leak is coming from about taking it apart, which would void the warranty, so I tried to get in writing that it would not actually void the warranty and of course I wouldn't get that. So it almost sounded a little like a scam as far as the warranty goes. They try to get me to take it apart so they could say later on that I took it apart and voided it"
"Pros:• It was nice having while it lastedCons:• I stopped using the “dry” function very early on because it sounded like a high-pitched ringing.• the heating element stopped working a little after a year in• then this was followed a month or so later with an “E4” error (dishwasher was purchased in July 2021, then the E4 error began sometime in September 2022).• I emailed “lifetime support” on October 1, 2022, they wrote back to me November 9, 2022, asked me to send a video of the issue (E4). However, at this point SOMETIMES the dishwasher would not give the error. (So, I would get ready to record… and boom… the dishwasher would work… so I ended up never getting back to them.)• and today, we tried getting it to work and it will not drain, despite not having used it for over month (or BECAUSE we haven’t attempted to use it in over a month? Hmmm…)Anyway, I gave three stars because I wondered and suspected the issues stemmed from hard water (because running diluted CLR through it in the end seemed to help); I had watched videos on the internet and implemented every suggestion (e.g. turning it on its side to drain)And, for a machine that costs ~$300, it seems a bit silly to pay an appliance tech ~$150 to diagnose it.It has been a glorified dish drying rack for the past five months.I do miss it, from the time it worked.I attached a picture from March 13, 2023, so folks can see it on a counter.Update: this has been moved to the garage until I figure out what to do with it/if there is a way to refurbish it. I have since purchased a competitor’s countertop dishwasher but made sure to purchase the warranty available through Amazon."
"I bought this 8 months ago. It's been going strong until the beginning of this month. It started leaking from the drain pump (its cracked). I emailed the company asking if they sell replacement parts. They said it has a 12 month warranty and sent me a new one (it's still in the process of shipping, I see it on my usps informed delivery screen). Couldn't be happier with the customer service.I use this dishwasher every few days for the basics and I hand-wash anything that won't fit (big skillets/pans).Edit to add they sent me the wrong part. The part they did send doesn't even fit the dishwasher."
It leaves baby bottles dirty.
Came in with front glass shattered but is double paned so works well anyway
"It takes longer to wash dishes, but you don't have to waste your time doing it.My dishes still end up with dirty spots and they just say to soak the dishes, which is what the machine is essentially doing.The detergent needs 85 degrees to work and it takes like 15 minutes for the water in the machines to heat up; I put in cold water as my experience with hot water was that it didn't heat the water enoughI feel like the top spray arm is just weak and not really doing much.I removes the grey tray and my dishes cant with it, I even tried it with a cup and the cup is touching the top of the inside wall, didn't like it.  I also place the utensils towards the center instead of the back as the manual states as it touches the back lip and If didn't feel that was good for cleaning, at least in the middle they get the upper arm spraying water on it, as the middle of the top arm is dropping water consistently.I barely use it as I get a better clean scrubbing, but I do like that it uses extremely  hot water, I did burn myself with my utensil trying to get it out as soon as it finished; (Heavy Metal Utensil)  Gotta let stuff cool.  It's a bother that the DRY isnt automatically on and you have to select it.I wish there was a better product on the market but it seems like everything the same, wish Amzon would make their own with scrubbers so dishes can be actually clean.I bought this beacuse I saw a youtube Video and it looked like a champ in the video, but my experience was not the same."
I was really disappointed that standard size dinner plates don’t fit in the washer. The silverware basket has compartment opening for the silverware and most pieces don’t fit in the slots.  My plates and silverware are of average size.
"The dishwasher worked fairly well for what it was but it completely stopped working after 2 years. It just stopped turning on one day. When it worked, I generally had to use the Baby/heavy mode for the dishes to come out clean, which was slow but worked. The dishwasher itself was also hard to clean on the inside. The food catch screen and filter were really hard to clean and were always dirty. The plastic inside of the dishwasher always had a residue too regardless of the dishwasher detergent used. I tried several different detergents to see if I could find one that worked best and also tried some dishwasher cleaners but we not very effective. The dishrack inside the dishwasher also started to rust after a year of use and started to disintegrate. Overall definitely not something that was designed for long-term frequent use, which is what a dishwasher should be designed for."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Worked great and was a great solution to my small kitchen until month 6. I didn’t do anything different and after I turned it on, it said “E2” and stopped working. The bottom part of the dishwasher was SO full of water that it was COMING out from where the hinges connecting the door to the machine was—WHEN THE DOOR WAS SHUT!While I had prompt reply from their customer service, which was a positive sign, I detached the hose, poured water through it. It seemed to do the trick for two weeks. This last weekend, all in one day, I got the E2 message again. The company informs me that it has something to do with the hose. Thing is, I entered the system. By pressing the buttons, I detached the hose completely, pouring flushing water through it. There was literally nothing in the house. I then emptied everything out of the dishwasher and tied all the rest of the water, because it was flooded into my sink. I did this three separate times and three separate times it stopped working after 15 minutes and displayed the E2 sign. Despite the original ordeal of the major flood, and this, I am being told that I have to detach the hose and flood it through.  I am sending my videos of what is happening to the company, and they are telling me it is a problem with the air. Not resolving my solution, not refunding me. I bought the insurance. Please refund me. This dishwasher is good for you if you have a very small place, and $300 is like a pocket change for you. Personally, I’m a single mother/teacher. $300 is worth a lot. Please refund me. This is not worth , the $300. It is low quality. $300 should last me at least two years. Not six months."
Descriptiin says we can use pods inside the washer ..but when used dapple dishwasher pods for baby products.. we see lot of foam left behind.. we have to run mutiple cycles to get it cleaned thoroughly
"This diswasher is VERY small. Plates and glasses fit well, but there's really no way to fit bowls into it without them leaning on each other, which results in their edges chipping. That said, it was still nice to have a diswasher for some things. However, after having it about a year, the top jets stopped rotating. A few months later, the bottom ones have as well, making this utterly useless. That works out to about $20/month that I paid to only have to handwash about half my dishes. I don't think it was worth it, and I hate having to just throw away a machine like this that took so many resources to build and ship."
"First off, this does what it’s supposed to do. I’ve run a couple of loads, and everything comes out spotless. It was easy to install.It’s definitely too big to fit under most standard cupboards. It’s half an inch or so too tall to go under my upper cupboards, so this has gone in front of a window, which is unfortunate.It’s also too small to fit my plates, which aren’t overly large.If you have high cupboards and small plates, this will be absolutely perfect for you. For me… it’s okay. Not very convenient for placement, and doesn’t fit half my stuff."
"I’ve had this thing for a while now so I feel like I know it quite well, and overall really like it with one big caveat. This machine has a ton of great features and gets dishes very clean! And it has a surprisingly decent capacity on the inside. HOWEVER, it has one design flaw that can make it a bit irritating to use. The roll-out tray is positioned too close to the bottom water sprayer, and unless you load your dishes VERY carefully, it’s pretty common for the sprayer to fail to rotate, so you have to pause the cycle, open the door, dig around until you find which dish or plate needs to be shifted around a tiny bit, get everything settled back down, and resume the cycle. It happens frequently and is very irritating."
"I bought this in February, 2024.  It worked nicely at first, but the sprayer arms keep clogging with some soft white material that it is impossible to remove, even with a needle.  I wanted to purchase new sprayer arms, but they do not accept credit card payments, only payment methods I do not use or have never heard of, and say I have to send the a screenshot of my payment, which I have never heard of either.  The product is rendered useless if it is impossible to  buy parts without opening new payment accounts, which I do not want to do."
I had enjoyed this little helper quite a bit until it just gave up washing (water flows heats etc but arms won’t agitate/spin) now it’s the most expensive regret I think I have from Amazon.
"I bought this product because of the reviews, bought it 3 months before i had my baby, it was in the pack until i had my baby in oct thats when i opened the box. i know i would be hand washing bottles and pump parts, so i was excited to open the box, when i opened the product i found water in it, felt disappointed  cos i had seen someone whos had water in it and didn't work. Mine worked first day , the second day machine keeps telling me to load water in it , i did it, still did not work and tried all other trouble shooting in the book , machine is not working right now. My product looked used , guess the same problem the previous person had and returned it. Is there anyway you guys can help me out, am hand washing bottles and pump parts everyday , NOT FUNNY for such an expensive product, product in my garage. HELP"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Well, it was awesome for about a month. Then I noticed when I took the drain out for cleaning that there was a little water in the bottom. I made sure there was no blockage, unscrewed the draining tube, rinsed that out and checked for blockages, and reattached. Everything fine again. Then I washed a load this morning and noticed the top and bottom spinners weren't moving, just spraying water to the left of the dish load. I took everything out, made sure there wasn't anything in the way and started the dishwasher up again. Still no movement from the spinners and you can see the result of the drainage in the pic. This item was almost $400, I expect it to work for longer than 30 days. I've sent an email communication to the seller, I'm hopeful that I hear back from them sooner rather than later.Update: tech support kept saying the problem was the spinners were covered, they weren't. To their credit they offered me a new machine or a refund. I opted for a replacement. Unfortunately the one they sent me never worked properly, with the top spinner never working and the bottom arm only intermittently. Tech support has disappeared with only minimal response, saying that the problem is the top arm is in crooked. Listen, you sent it to me like this. At this point I'm going to have to ask Again to step in. Based on my experience, I can't believe all of these positive results are true and I'm just the exception to the rule. Beyond irritated with this company and this product."
"Received it because like so many others, I dislike washing dishes by hand. The item was simple to use. It did fit on my counter under my cabinet. just fill water reservoir, and push buttons for preferred washing.  (Powder detergent is the best option). Downside it will not fit my large plates or many cooking pots due to size. (which is to be expected for an item this size). After using it a few loads, many utensils did not get cleaned. Cooking utensil's did not get clean at all, however some items like small plates and bowls and mugs did get clean. The upper spinner does get stuck which i read several others had that problem. Overall I decided that the product just wasn't for me. If your someone who cooks lightly then I imagine it would be perfect for you."
"I only just got it today but already it is proving that it is more then capable of doing what a normal dish washer can do. It works beautifully, and even does a good job with stuck to on material (at the moment anyway, I’ll come back in a few weeks if that changes) the machine was a little awkward to get set up, but nothing one wouldn’t expect from a dish washer of any size. One thing I’ve noticed right away is that filling it up is a bit hit or Miss, and the suction cup isn’t very high quality. But all around, it’s perfect for a budget kitchen, especially for those of you who hate doing the dishesUpdate: this machine has started having issues after maybe a year or two, giving me an E3 error message and refusing to stop attempting to drain even when it’s empty, making it impossible to actually use the dish washer. I suspect perhaps the built in water heater may have gone out causing the issue but can’t be certain. I’ve only ever used hot water when filling it up so I can’t say it that user error. Impressive that it’s lasted as long as it has but frustrating that I can’t just use it with the problem it has."
"It did well washing dishes. In terms of ease of use, it was very easy to use. The design and load capacity is good. Only breaking issue I had was that  suddenly stopped functioning, it would come on and cycle through the dish washing process but would not wash the dishes, it did not even show an error code. The water stopped flowing, it stopped drying, the only feature that still works is then emptying feature. It stopped working with 7 months, as a result I can not recommend."
"I used it with high quality detergent but clearly all it does is lightly splash everything with water at a high heat. No real pressureMaybe it's because I used it with the fillable tank, but I tried with the baby setting as well and half the dishes still had dirty spots after 1 hour of washing + 1 hour of drying.It's definitely not the same quality as a dish washer from what I've seen. Not very happy with the results at this price"
I ordered this to wash all the baby products. I did fit a lot of stuff in there and used the baby container to fit the smaller pieces. If you take everything out and shake it after it is washed and put the dryer mode on afterwards it will dry things much better than if left in there to dry right after the cycle. It is loud when washing the dishes. The dry cycle always got stuck when it went down to 6 mins and did not  shut off.
"This came in yesterday.  I'm currently starting to run my third cycle with the same dishes, because after the first two they're still as dirty as ever.If you clean the dishes before putting them in, this will definitely get them soapy and hot.  But if you're looking for a machine that WASHES your dishes, this ain't it."
"While the dishwasher works great, when I received it, it had water in it, meaning that it’s used! I paid for a brand new one, so I should receive a brand new one!"
"Product comes with a 1 year warranty. We bought it in June of 2023. It died July 2024. Kept giving multiple errors and could not get ahold of their support team. Common ones were E2 and E3, which is either drain pump error or overflow error. The dishwasher itself was.... Okay."
"It would be perfect, but since the first use, the upper spray arm is not spinning at all. It looks like the plastic spray arm has a leak that doesn’t allow it to spin. Also the brand does not exist anymore. I was thinking in sending it back. But I fix it with silicone and so far is working. It’s up to you, but better go for a known brand. Also the space inside is not that big but is enough for a 2 persons household. Plates bigger than 10” doesn’t fit very well. After all, it cleans very nicely when is working"
They don’t want a real review. It’s a good product if u don’t drink a lot of coffee or have a bunch of kids on a bottle or sippy cup. That top rack DO NOT go down completely causing the door to not shut. It does help if u don’t use a lot of dishes. Single with small pots and pans but it don’t clean as good and have to run it more than once to get them clean. I usually just put my small bowls and glasses and even then have to run it again. It’s not what I expected but u get what u paid for… I truly feel like I wasted my money on this product because it could be better….. but that’s my opinion 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this item twice. Returned the first one. Just received second one, Both come with water inside the machine. Both with top water spray doesn’t turning."
"It’s alright, it’s good if you got a lot of dishes to put half in the washer and wash the other half by hand. Kind of a pain more often than not to be honest. We drain it into a bucket which I’m not a huge fan of. It’s okay I suppose. A little bit of a waste of money but it works as advertised"
"Top spinner stopped working after about 20 loads. Layout for the interior could be better designed to fit more in the space available. Doesn't work well with detergent pods, there's always soap left on the dishes after if you use a pod. Silverware basket isn't great. The caged too will only fit straws and chopsticks. Without the top, silverware falls over and stacks against itself because the sections are too large"
"This machine cleans well and not noisy at all, but there is a bug in the control panel for the drying cycle that causes me to unplug the machine to reset it. It gets stuck with time left and does not shut off automatically. Not catastrophic but certainly annoying and seems like could have been caught with proper testing.  This happened after about the 3rd run and continues to happen.  Technical support has been non-responsive."
Doesn’t remove all food and leaves white film on everything.
"The cleaning performance was subpar, and the dishes still felt grimy after washing. It also doesn’t dry the dishes effectively, leaving them wet and needing extra drying time."
"We have had this dishwasher for almost a year, we got one on black Friday last year and after about a month it stopped draining. Amazon was amazing and replaced it, so this one we have had since mid/late January. This time it has stopped pumping the water from the main reservoir  to where it needs to be to actually wash the dishes. It works great when it works but for $400 I would hope it would last more than a year."
"My space was very limited and this didn't fit into the space I had planned. It probably works fine, but the fact it was so much larger than expected for a ""countertop"" dishwasher wasn't my favorite. If you have the counter space for it though, I'm sure it would be fine."
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. DON'T LET THE REVIEWS FOOL YOU. THE PRODUCT THAT WAS SENT TO ME WAS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING AF. A ROTTEN AND HORRIBLE SMELL CAME OUT OF THE DISHWASHER THE MOMENT I OPENED IT. WHEN I TOOK THE FILTER OUT, THERE WERE LOTS OF TINY PIECES OF FOOD REMAINS AND AN EXTREMELY EXTREMELY TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SMELL. WASTE OF MY MONEY, TIME, AND EFFORT TO PICK IT UP, SET IT UP, AND THEN REALIZE IT IS A USED PRODUCT. ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL."
"Not only was I sent a USED product but it’s defective. It’s leaked all over my counters every time we try to fill it to even bother using it & wont start a wash cycle at all. Absolutely ridiculous and far from worth the money. Clearly a defective item, you’d be better off just buying a whole dishwasher at this point or doing them by hand."
"I will be contacting the seller and will definetly update the review upon getting my dishwasher serviced/repaired or pending customer service with the seller.The pros are it is super easy to get it up and running. Its pretty dang small, and sadly the top rack doesn't fit any cup bigger than an espresso mug. We weren't expecting the world, just a nice little dishwasher for sanitizing glasses and daily items. First month it worked perfectly.Then things started coming out dirty. We tried switching settings, switching detergent, and even putting just one cup in the machine and running it. We have learned how to take off the spray arms to clean them. The spray arms spin---sometimes. Sometimes they just stop working all together. Pretty dissapointing considering the price was almost the same of a FULL SIZE DISHWASHER from lowes or what have you. If we can get this repaired we will switch to danby. Hoping for a favourable result from NOVETE as we had super high hopes for this little dishwasher."
Works but too big
This is literally good if you want to wash like five dishes. You also have to be somewhere where are the hose can leak out the excess drainage into a sink at first I didn’t know that and I got water all over the floor. Not worth it for the amount of dishes it can clean
"Not even 6 months in and this thing is unusable. Every load I put in here I have to wash at least 3/4 of the dishes afterwards because it leaves a white filmy scuzz on them. Doesn't allow you to turn off the drying feature for some reason. Just as loud as a large dishwasher. It looks nice, but that's about the only good thing I have to say about it. Sad I spent 250 dollars on it and didn't test it immediately, because now I am stuck with it."
"My first few uses for this dishwasher were great but now the top sprayer stops working all the time. Haven’t even had the dishwasher for a month yet. I don’t recommend this product, I’m very disappointed."
"I bought because of the great reviews including a youtube video review. Well, I would not buy again and I would not recommend to others. It's too small for more than one meal's dishes for one person. And god help you if your dishes have stains from setting. I have silverware that I have washed six times and they still aren't clean. Silverware basket is too small for any silverware with wide handles.skillet didn't come clean in six tries either. Works fine if you get up from a meal and immediately run the dishwasher. But if you're doing that, then you might as well wash by hand."
"I ran the wash cycle twice before using it to get rid of the smell. Then I started using it with dishes and detergent, hoping the smell would go away. Nope! Even the dishes smell like chemical hell and I am rinsing them after having them washed by this machine to make sure no harmfull chemicals are sticking on my dishes."
"After 3 months, I started having 'E3' errors every time I ran the machine. I was able to talk to CS and they were able to help me out. I'm super happy cause I really like the machine, the dishwasher is super nice and well made.After 10 months, the machine again stopped working and needed more repairs to where it no longer wants to turn on"
I was originally very excited about this appliance as I was spending an enormous amount of time hand washing dishes. Unfortunately the bottom arm that dispenses water continuously gets stuck as I have to stop the cycle and restart which defeats the purpose of having a dishwasher. I contacted manufacturer and had already done all the things they suggested and the return window has lapsed.
"We researched and bought this for our tiny summer cabin. We’ve used it maybe a dozen times (if that) and went to use it for the first time this season and the washing arms (top and bottom) no longer spin to clean. This is a super expensive piece to stop working with low usage. Plus, there is no way to even try to work on it yourself to fix it so just a giant paperweight. Very disappointing. Do not recommend."
"Inlet hose does not fit sink, electric cord and hoses are not long enough for my needs, too tall to fit between older cabinets and kitchen counter.Works pretty good at cleaning, but doesn't hold much inside."
"The product washes good... Not an accurate description of what actually can fit in it ... will be returning this product because the top sprayer doesn't work properly, spins only when it wants to. It's more of a novelty item personally."
I had this for just slightly over a year when the leak sensor went off and would not stop ringing. I contacted the company. They were slow to respond and not helpful at all. (You can only get them via email and they take forever to respond and when they do their suggestions are suspect at best. Terrible communication.) They said I should take it apart and check for leaks. I did so and could find nothing wrong. They suggested doing a few things that just did not work at all and left me swinging in the wind. My guess is it is designed to fail after the warranty is out. More than $350 for one year of service (which probably didn't amount to more than 60 or 70 washes) is no bargain. Never buying from this company again. And I'll try to steer clear of their affiliates as well.
"An affordable luxury in the RV, but it takes up too much counter space and has to be put in a lower RV cabinet for storage when not in use.. which also takes up very valuable space in an already small area. Why didn't I think this through? Lol. 😆"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            UPDATE:After six months, the dishwasher has started leaking very badly upon every use -- see video. This started after the unit displayed an E3 code and I had to take it outside and drain the water out of it at every angle.This dishwasher looks nice and is easy to use. The flexibility afforded by the two water ingress options is very nice.However, the dish washer is often not effective. Moderately to heavily soiled items (e.g. smoothie cups) do not get clean. The top arm also gets stuck quite often and requires manual intervention. I'm still not sure exactly what the solution is but some combination of spinning the arm and removing/reinstalling it usually works. This should absolutely not be necessary in a two month old dishwasher, though.I would not recommend this device to anyone looking for a dishwasher they can use daily."
I love that my sink faucet is not tied up for an hour. I can do other things in the sink while it's running. Very small. It is not super powerful. Will clean some but you have to pre wash. The dryer works ok.
"I bought the product assuming it was supposed to be brand new, but when I received it was wet inside as if someone had it or used it before. I tested it myself it does clean dishes, very well infact.  though the power button seems to be iffy I have to press it numerous times to get it to power on."
"It was a really good dishwasher for my house since I do not have the cabinet space for a built-in unit. Unfortunately, it has completely died out after a year."
The top arms have quit rotating.
Amazon support suggested leaving a poor review. Product used a couple times but does not have anywhere close to the capacity it claims to have.  Couple plates is the most it holds at a time and even they hit top of machine.  Would like to purchase bigger cause otherwise okay
Worked great in the beginning and then stopped cleaning bottles wellI have to rewash bottles after every timeIt stopped working well for every wash after month that I got it
"I was SO excited to have this countertop dishwasher.  Ran a cycle without dishes as recommended.  Worked great.  Loaded the dishes and ran them through; worked great.  As it did for the third use.  The 4th use I got an E7 error message.  As per the manual, I turned it off and restarted it - adding more water and it ran fine.  Next day ... E7 message.  As per the manual, if the error message repeated, I was to contact Novete support.  OK, sent them an Email and haven't had a response.  Disappointed that the unit doesn't work and more so that no one has reached out to me."
"I absolutely adore this dishwasher. It works so well, just be aware that once it gives you alerts it’s almost impossible to fix. The company cannot be contacted for help and many small appliance repairmen in my area won’t help me. I’ve only had it for 1.5 years so it makes me sad to have to replace this at this point."
"Smaller than what I expected definitely does not take four servings of plates and the top spray that’s supposed to be spinning always gets stuck. You have to open it push it with your hand to restart it. I saw it in another review, but I ignored it."
I was extremely disappointed that I was unable to use this product due to it arriving with mold growing inside of it. When I took it out of the box it was wet. It has a label on the top stating that water is run through it to test it in the factory and may have residual water. I set it up and opened the water reservoir to add water the first time and there is mold growing in the filter. Returned item because did not feel comfortable using it for baby bottles which was the reason I bought it in the first place. Now have to repack this big heavy thing and bring it to ups to return.
"UPDATE: This unit began failing and  showing an error code just out of the return window. The manufacturer's warranty solution is to remove a panel and see what parts are leaking. They will then sent parts for me to repair it on my own... This of course is beyond belief. Stay clear of this brand.It seems to function, but was missing packaging foam, and was dented on one side. Also, no instructions included."
"I bought this counter top dishwasher and when I opened the box it had water in it, I was kinda upset but still proceeded to hooking it up and trying it out, after a few days of use I noticed it started turning on by itself and randomly beeping, I also noticed that it smelled very bad of cat pee and I don’t have any pets, so because of all this problems and the fact that it doesn’t hold what the description says, I’m sending it back. I’m very unhappy and dissatisfied, on top of the fact I have Amazon prime I had to pay $34.96 for this to be package, again disappointed."
"As stated, I put my rinsed dishes in the washer and tried two different cleaning cycles to clean the dishes. It did absolutely nothing to clean them. There is no point to this machine if I have to wash my dishes before using the machine.DO NOT BUY IF YOU DONT WASH YOUR DISHES BEFORE USING THE DISHWASHER."
I got this because we are a family of 6 and I was tired of the sink constantly being filled even though I hand wash the entire load every single night. Our house doesn’t have a built in dishwasher. Husband got this for me for my birthday. But little did we know that it only fits 4 bowls and 3 plates and a handful of utensils. This is for someone who is really lazy. The timer was for over 1 hour to wash those few items. I could wash those in 5 minutes and for less water and electricity. This isn’t worth it unless you’re really lazy.
"This was billed as a new product, however when it arrived, it had mold growing in the water tank. This is gross and unsanitary. Cannot believe they would ship out a moldy “new” dishwasher.Do yourself a favor and avoid the Novete dishwasher."
"I have used this for a few months - forget about adding anything with real food on it. Even sometimes pre-risning doesnt work. It's just not strong enough. After 2 weeks the top jets stopped working. A lot of the time a dish will get stuck on the bottom jet and then it wont even dispurse the water properly. It just is kind of cheap, and not worth the price. This is maybe worth $70. Also when it dries it has this high pitched sound thats headache inducing."
"This was a nice little compact dishwasher I originally bought at the end of October 2020 for my tiny apartment with a tiny sink. Used it a lot because it cleaned well and was convenient. Then it decided to stop working. Have tried to work with support but after several trial and errors they ceased responding to me until I sent a new email again. They do not want to honor the warranty and offered a 30% off coupon for the same washer or a mere 20% discount for reimbursement. Oddly enough, in the manual that came with the dishwasher said there was an 18 month warranty but on their website it's 24 months. Regardless of which one, I am well within the warranty period yet all they want to give is a discount on a new machine and not actually honor this warranty of theirs. Don't buy from this company."
"Read a lot of great reviews. Unfortunately, this machine was a nightmare for me. It shut itself off without finishing a cycle. Light would randomly blink and beep for no reason. Sending it back and getting a different brand."
"DO NOT BUY!!!  Dishwasher worked great the 1st month, after that it will start to rust and break down. After 2 months, the spinning arm in the dishwasher stopped working and you will have to keep taking it off and on to try to get it spinning again.  After 6 months,  the pump stopped working.  Contacted customer service and they stated they would send replacement part that you will have to replace yourself  once they get it back in stock in a few months.  They will send you a video on how to replace part on your own. I told them please send confirmation once part has been sent.  I didn't hear back from them for about 3 months and I contacted them again and NO RESPONSE....."
Did anyone else get their machine and find water droplets on the back? Trying to figure out if this is normal or if I got a return. Opening the machine smells like mildew.
The sprayer arms stopped turning after five months. We cleaned them out but they still won't work. So disappointing.
"What I don’t like: there has been no response from Novete regarding the fact that my dishwasher basket 2nd level shelf arrived broken AND when I inquired about that I also asked about the non existent instructions for using the fruit basket/ fruit cleaning mode because if you sit the fruit basket directly into the dish basket, the prongs pierce your fruit.What I do like: this actually does get my dishes amazingly clean, and I’m happy with how many dishes I can fit in. I do however expect a company to respond to my warranty issue promptly (it’s been several weeks), that a brand new item be perfect, and instructions on how to use all features."
"started with error E3, there is no answer to help with what this means, someone said they think it means clogged drain, but the drain is not clogged.  Arms won't spin, I use hot water and cold to start, nothing works. BIG disappointment  because it was great until then"
"Lots of nothing when I set it up, not one bit of motor sounds. What s wrong? I followed book instruction  the water tank is full according to directions. Now I cant get it to empty so how can I move it . I tried running it empty still not a sound. Neighbor  said i should send it back but I cant get the water out.  Please help."
"My item arrived with water inside but was factory sealed. Was this a return they manually repackaged? Did they test this with water inside the factory? Either way, it was wet. I ran one cycle without dishes to clean the machine, then one with dishes. Even though I pre-rinsed everything, 20% still came out dirty, and 100% smelled of mildew. Even if it cleaned the dishes properly, I would be unhappy with this machine. There's a mandatory hour-long drying cycle. Even at maximum capacity, it only holds a few plates and cups. Why should it take an hour for this? even after the hour mandatory drying period, they were still wet with puddles of water at the bottom. Maybe I just got a bad machine, I don't know, but I can't recommend it."
"Not sure if we got a faulty one or what, but our dishwasher after only one month of use started to go on the frizz. Multiple error codes even though we followed the instructions on what to avoid and what not. Very expensive for what it is and it’s a shame we spent all that money because it’s now sitting on our counter and it’s turned off. Tech support sent us some replacement parts that require a special tool and we were not happy to spend money on something that honestly just needs to be replaced all together. Please do something about it, it didn’t cost us $5, it cost us over $400."
"5 days after purchase it completely stopped working, would count down the cycle time but not do anything! Amazon was kind enough to replace it.The second one worked worse than the other one! Before the first one broke it worked pretty good, got off 95% of grime, given it is a counter top washer. The second one left food and grime on everything. So frustrating!!"
"Things break, why don't you sell parts to fix it? Good luck contacting them, the link doesn't work. It has been over a year since purchasing this unit. I thought taking out insurance was a good thing, that was a joke. They sent a company that didn't contact me and just showed up while at work. I contacted warranty company and just as useless as this company."
"The machine has an E3 signal error. The seller said that it was overflow problem, but I found out myself that this error comes from low water temperature. It could be the error of water temperature sensor or heater. The seller seems not know about their products. This is an expensive product but it is easily broken down. Please do not buy this product. I checked reviewers and the official website before buying but it seems that the seller is not the manufacturer. Sellers answering my questions are from different names. They are not Novete? I am not sure. Please check the origin and the information carefully before buying it."
"Worked like a charm the first 8 times. But now I get an error message E7 with every attempt.  And of course, the warranty has expired.  For the cost, it should have more life."
I can't contact the company. They won't respond to my emails about error codes I am receiving. It doesn't fit my counter under the shelf cause it is too tall. I had to sit up a small table in the kitchen to use it.
A big expensive machine to wash one place setting.
The height dimension of this product is incorrectly listed as 16.8 inches tall in the product description. The dishwasher that showed up was nearly 18 inches tall and couldn't fit below my cabinet. Now I have to lug it all the way to an access point to return it.
"I have been trying to get a replacement for this product for two months. My dishwasher staring throwing an error and completely stopped working.Novete sent me a ""replacement"" that not only threw an error but also leaked AND already had food in it. Since I have asked for a refund they have stopped responding. I bought a full five year warranty when I bought the product. I would love Amazon's help figuring out why they stopped answering my emails and refuse to honor the warranty."
Every single time I attempt to use this product it fails and gives an error reading. It is not a high-quality product. DO NOT BUY THIS. I read the user manual cover to cover and exchanged many unhelpful emails with the manufacturer. At one point they suggested I (using tools that your average home wouldn't have) essentially fully take apart and reconstruct the machine. I've been working on getting a refund for the better half of 2 months. It has all been supremely frustrating. I can't warn any potential buyers enough. DO NOT BUY THIS.
Worked well for about 2 weeks then started to leave a film behind on all dishes and pans very disappointing had a lot of potential to be good. Glad it’s still in Amazon return period.
"I absolutely loved this dishwasher for almost 6 months. Out of the blue, it stopped working and showed an E7 code. I followed all of the troubleshooting suggested within the manual. I have emailed the company twice and have had no response for over a month. Sadly disappointed."
"The product was defective and could not be used as the hose sprouted a leak at the machine end when connected to faucet. There is no local Customer Service Phone number. I was provided with a Singapore number by Amazon.  I reached out to the only support email  address and received no resolution  Responses had a time lag and relevant issues were not addressed or corrected. Moreover, they stopped responding completely with no explanation.  Very disappointing and a waste of my time.  Highly dissatisfied and would NOTt recommend buying this product. I returned it."
"Not worth the price.  Takes up too much space, putting water in for the wash cycle is difficult AND requires a space to drain the ""wash water"" into unless willing to hook it up to your kitchen sink, which is NOT Worth the effort.  Haul out a bucket of dirty dish water (kills weeds?)"
"The dishwasher works well, customer support not at all. I purchased this dishwasher about a year ago, I lost a couple of the wheels for the dish rack, I repeatedly tried to contact customer support, they don't have a phone number, just a website, I would try contacting customer support before you paying $300.00 dollars for this dishwasher."
"UPDATE 9-7-24Close to 2 years later and am very happy with it once I hard plumbed it in. Every time I go to my folks house, (they have a full size dishwasher under the counter) and I've been spoiled with counter height and I don't have to bend over slide out and reach in the back. I definitely don't want a full size built-in again.Before I go into my findings for remote use, meaning not near a sink/drain, here's some stuff to consider.  This is large, the dimensions are in the listing and likely will not fit under the upper cabinets of many many many US homes. It's heavy at 51lbs as stated in the listing.  One more thing you can do, as I did, and read the PDF version of the manual before purchasing which is available in the listing body. Not everything I wanted to know such as hose and cord lengths are even in the manual so I shared that information in text boxes on my photos. You may want to touch the photo for it to enlarge to read or see all the details I shared.  Now onto my experience so far compared to a smaller cube style portable dishwasher which has an onboard tank.  After having a small cube style portable dishwasher I found we don't have dishes piled up and are very good at emptying and loading daily, unlike the full size built in at our old house which was always a crap shoot if the dishes were clean dirty or some of both since it wasn't ran daily.  So when the upper spray bar quit working, I decided to look for a bigger one to accommodate pots and pans that could still be used remotely, and this seemed to fit the bill but about $200 more than the cube one.FYI, I paid $419 with at the time a $30 off coupon and waited 2 weeks for it to arrive.  - 1 STAR- MUST HAVE 2 BUCKETS FOR REMOTE USE, meaning not near a sink/drain  I thought this one would suck up all the water it needs to run a complete cycle, and I could use the same bucket as the waste water catch. That's a big fat NO!  This sucks up water as needed multiple times during a cycle along with draining as needed, so both buckets must be in place during the entire cycle until it ends, and I really mean, until it ends. For instance if you're johnny on the spot after it finishes spraying water and the count down cycle timer still has time left on it. And you decide to pull out the dishes before the timer is zero, well it will drain some more so don't pull out the waste water bucket until the timer is zero!  You MUST use 2 buckets, one for clean water the other for dirty water making this quite the set up and space hogger for remote, not near a sink use. Yes you could put it on a cart and wheel it where needed, which I did a couple of times to see if that worked for me, but found it more of a time waster, space taker and more of a nuisance than just hand washing.  Now the directions when using the clean water collapsible bucket it comes with say to fill just above the 12L mark. This leaves around 1/8"" to the top making it impossible to carry across the room. You'll be investing in another bucket if used remotely, not near a sink. If used in your sink, keeping your faucet available, it's not an issue.  You really should have 2 buckets, with a minimal 3.5 gallon capacity so they don't slosh out when you move them.  - 3 STARS - THE AMOUNT OF SPACE IT REALLY TAKES  The dimensions on the listing are accurate, but if you picked up as I did the 2 different measurements for depth from front to back with the door closed, one is the base or footprint the other includes the thickness of the door which sticks out roughly an inch passed the body.  Well add another 1-1/2"" to 2"" on that, the cord and hoses stick out passed the back since this wasn't designed with a recessed area for them tuck into. It leaves enough countertop in front of it for small tasks, let's say buttering toast, at least on my 23"" deep countertops. If you're like me and have this in a remote corner of countertop with the cord and hoses not only running along the back but also the side, add 1-1/2 to 2 inches to the width to accommodate. As I mentioned earlier this is quite tall and likely won't fit under your overhead cabinets, but if you happen to have high hung cabinetry, you won't be worried about the steam affecting the cabinets if they are around 12"" deep, since the steam vents off out where the door opens at end of cycle and should clear with a few inches to spare.  I shared numerous photos with a 2 liter bottle next to it giving you the idea of it's size.  - 5 STARS - CYCLE TIMES, TEMPERATURE AND WATER USE  There are plenty to choose from so pick what works for each load. This information is straight from the manual and can be viewed via PDF prior to purchase, but I also shared photos of them.  - The water use ranges from 1.85 gallons of water to 2.99.  - Cycle times range from 29 minutes to 150 minutes.  - Water temperature ranges from 122⁰ F to 162⁰ F  I typically use the 58 minute cycle which has no problem removing dried on gravy from breakfast when I run it that night.  -3 STARS - NO HEATED OR FORCED AIR CIRCULATING DRYING OPTION.  As stated in the listing the door pops open about 2"" at the end of cycle, this is optional, to quickly release the steam, hence items that hold heat well , like glass, aluminum and steel, tend to quickly dry, and naturally plastic will still be wet.  Now this is ok if you start the dishwasher before leaving to work or before bed and enough hours pass, allowing natural evaporation to take place, leaving for the most part, everything dry including plastics with only small puddles caught on rims.  If you need to do loads back to back, you will be hand drying droplets on even glass and steel, although my thick stainless steel flatware and thick pots and pans are usually completely dry, as they hold heat naturally and help evaporate water rapidly.  Something I really liked about my cube portable was it offered heated dry or fan circulated air dry, and miss this option on this one.  -4 STARS - NOISE LEVEL  No doubt it sounds like a dishwasher, it's quieter than the full size built-ins we've had, but louder than the cube portable I had. An additional noise you will hear when using the clean water bucket to fill, is the water pump.  If you're standing within 2 feet from it, you'll likely slightly raise your conversation voice. Mine is placed between the kitchen and living room and we don't need to turn up the TV volume or raise voices in the living room or most of the kitchen. It really isn't loud.  - 5 STARS- EXCELLENT CLEANING POWER.  This has enough spray bars to soak and remove everything we've put in, including dried on gravy and a lasagna pan. I have zero complaints here!  - 5 STARS - DISH HOLDING/ARRANGING CAPACITY  Truly some of the reasons I bought this, the upper removable rack, the lower racks ability to fold tines down, the ability to place roughly 12"" tall items, wide rack accommodates pots with handles, although my 12"" skillet with long handle on one side then short handle on opposite side has to go across the bottom rack caddy corner, it's easier just to hand wash.  After you play around with it a few times you'll figure out what fits where around each other.  If you have 10"" plates with 1"" deep rims as I do, the tine spacing is not as accommodating but still doable.  The upper rack fits tumbler lids on the left, lots of flatware in the middle, and smaller tea and coffee cups, pinch bowls or utensils on the right.  -4 STARS - HOSE AND CORD LENGTHS  I give the lengths in text boxes on my shared photos.  When used remotely away from a sink, both the fresh water pick up hose 78"" and drain hose 77"" are long enough to reach buckets on the floor.  By the way the pick up hose is stiff and hard to keep where you need it, also doesn't have an 90⁰ elbow off the back, which it really needs to prevent it from stretching away from the barb it's attached to on the back and prevent leaking, when you have this shoved as close to the backsplash as possible. The corrugated drain hose is similar to all dishwasher drain hoses, only this one comes with a terrible plastic type suction cup to prevent the tip from flopping around. I ended up replacing the suction cup with a silicone one which actually holds in place.  The faucet hook up hose, I hope you don't need to use, is very very stiff and unruly. This is the shortest hose at 60"" of usable length minus the amount needed to clear the dishwasher body which is 9"" to 12"" depending on what side you run it from.  The power cord length is 53"" and has a flat or 90⁰ plug.- 3 STARS- HARD PLUMBED IN. Bye the way,By no means do they advertise this to be hard plumbed in, but after a couple months using it remotely I decided to.  Here are my findings you will definitely want to be apprised of if you go this route.Here's what you need to know if you'll be hard/permanent plumbing it in.  For the water hook up you'll be using the inlet designed to hook to a sink faucet. Well the threads for this hose are NOT standard US dishwasher, which here in the states is the same as a garden hose, the threads on this dishwasher are fine threaded. You might be able to hunt down an adapter to change the threads which accommodates standard US dishwasher hoses, but I had no luck at 2 home and garden centers. Maybe try an actual Plumbing store.  I ended up having to use the hose which came with it, cut the faucet connector end off and using a 1/2"" barbed fitting to convert the end making it possible to hard plumb.As far as the drain hose, I was able to find and install a ""Y"" drain pipe instead of my existing straight pipe to accommodate the hose. Just make sure you use a hose clamp since the dishwasher pumps dirty water out with a lot of pressure, and you definitely don't want water flooding underneath your sink.  Another thing is the water inlet hose which came with it, had a pinhole leak near the threaded fitting, as though it wasn't crimped properly. I contacted Amazon, which they could only offer a return/replace since they don't have spare parts. Then tried contacting the manufacturer, but lo and behold their website has zero ways to contact them, also doesn't offer replacement parts.FYI- I didn't need to use any on/off valve, as the machine already has a valve to control the water flow built in.- 3 STARS- OVERALL TAKE  It's great if you have the ability to place it next to your sink where it will live all the time, and if you use the bucket this leaves your faucet freed up. While I like it's capacity for long handle pots,  It's not set up well for those of us who need it remotely placed away from a sink. I would NOT have purchased it if I had known it doesn't suck up all the water it needs at the same time, hence requiring me to have to use 2 buckets. This is where my old cube portable shines, yes it took 3 trips with a pitcher to fill it's tank, but only 1 bucket and hose sitting on my floor, not 2. I also do not like no recess to accommodate the cord and hoses. So far I've ended up purchasing $20 worth of 90⁰ elbows and tubing to correct the fresh water pick up tube issues, $4 for a suction cup and another $50 in attractive cans, (these are in a a photo in a stackable configuration), these are visible full time in my kitchen, stackable trash bins to use as the fresh water and dirty water bins which are a larger capacity at 3.5 gallons to ensure I don't slosh water everywhere when moving them to fill and empty.  I can't say it's been worth it. It's cost me even more money to work in my space, also it isn't free returns hence I'm on the fence of sending it back. In hindsight I probably should of stuck with the cube style with onboard water tank and just dealt with hand washing pots and pans. Too bad this doesn't have an onboard tank, it would make it even more remote friendly.  It would be great for those who have the space to place it next to a sink. This is designed to keep your faucet freed up by using the fresh water bucket in the sink, but for those of us using remotely, you will be shelling out more money, and figuring a bucket system so they aren't in the way of your walk space.  Hopefully this was helpful!"
"i live in NYC in an apartment with no dishwasher and thought this might be a nice option for when I’m feeling lazy. I’ve been using it for a few months now and i will say it cleans my dishes beautifully. The glass particularly comes out looking shiny in a way that handwashing doesn’t seem to ever achieve. I use the little dishwasher pods and just throw them in. The cycle is fairly long but I don’t mind I just set it and forget it.Key tips - DEFINITELY get a waterproof mat to go beneath the machine - something that has sides and can hold water. I got an undersink mat off Amazon. You will want to catch leaks.The hose for the offshoot water is terrible. Flimsy and leaky as hell. After many headaches I replaced it with a clear flexible plastic hose that I push into exit port (something that snugly fits over the exit port would also work). It’s snug and isn’t going anywhere. I have an hard time understanding why they included an hose that comes off the exit port with the slightest amount of pressure. Anyway that swap seems to have resolved the leaking issues I was having. The clear plastic also lets me monitor the flow of the water out of the hose - anyone who knows fluid dynamics knows that water in a hose is pretty wonky. I affixed it to the side of the machine and have it drain into a bucket beneath my sink because I don’t have the real estate for a big clunky dishwasher to be sitting on my counter.Filling the machine can be a little annoying as well, if you don’t have the direct connection. It takes a lot of water - more than you’d think - and it won’t run beneath a certain level. I would recommend getting another length of plastic piping and affixing it to a funnel that you can run directly from your spout. It’s way faster than filling up a pitcher and trying to maneuver it over the tank. I wish they would have included something like this.Overall, a good machine, I just don’t know that the maker really thought through the more complex piece of running a water-based appliance without attaching it to your plumbing lines - getting the water in and getting that water back out. Both can result in a watery mess if you don’t have watertight connections. It feels like they could improve those bits and make this machine a lot more user-friendly.Alas, when it works it’s great. Saves me effort on a lazy day and provides an out of the way place to put dirty dishes where they won’t attract pests or be an eyesore. I’d recommend it to dishwasher-less apartment dwellers who cook a lot at home and who don’t mind putting in a bit of upfront effort (and maybe a few headaches) in the service of being lazy down the line."
"While the convenience of having a machine do the work can’t be beat, this machine does not work well for baby bottles and pump parts despite having a cycle called “baby care”. The way that the spray arms come from the bottom and the top, if you load bottles on the bottom left, you cannot put bottle nipples or any small pump parts on the utensil shelf or they will not get any water in them plus they will just fall off from the water pressure. I used a dishwasher basket but it’s the same thing - you can’t put nipples on the top if you put anything in the bottom that will block the water from getting in them. I ended up putting bottle nipples on the bottom of the basket (bought separately) so they would get cleaned but they always got jostled around from the water and turned upside down so after the cycle was complete, I’d have to shake out all the excess water and rinse again in the sink just in case the dishwasher detergent was left behind, thus undoing the UV sterilization. Same with small pump parts like duckbill valves - I ended up putting them in upside down in the dishwasher basket just to ensure they would get water inside them but then I would have to flip them back over to get the water out after the end of the cycle and re-rinse them to make sure they didn’t feel greasy inside. Bottles that are put in the corners also don’t get cleaned very well - every single wash, there is always one or two bottles that still have residue inside and I always rinse my bottles before putting them in. Lastly, apparently UV discolors plastic. I did not know this before buying this appliance so my bad, but now my Dr Browns bottles are yellow.This machine is also HUGE. I measured my space to make sure the dimensions online would fit my space before ordering it but even then I was surprised by how big it was. The box says it’s 45 pounds so I couldn’t lift it onto the counter myself being 2 months postpartum. It’s also quite loud if you’re used to having a quiet dishwasher. I couldn’t use the quick connect hose and did the manual water fill option - so while it’s great to have the two different options, filling it up every time was also a pain. It takes 3 and a half pitchers to fill the water tank inside - not a problem for my husband but I am short and the water inlet is at the top of the machine so I had to get on my tip toes and lift a pitcher (with an awkward handle that is not ergonomic) full of water. Again not a problem for taller and stronger people but just FYI for anyone that is short and not very strong (I also have postpartum carpal tunnel).Overall, I am disappointed and I am returning this today - and beware, you can only return it at UPS stores and not the regular Amazon hub counters which I am used to using in my area.I never write these long reviews but I wish I had read this kind of a review before ordering this appliance so I’m leaving this in case it helps any other mama desperate for help with washing baby bottles and pump parts - sorry but this isn’t going to be the best option. I tried using it for a few weeks for my sanity (baby moms will know what I mean), but I just wasn’t confident in safely feeding my baby from bottles and pump parts that were washed in this."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I ordered this in October but did not use until November/December. I bought this to clean baby items. The whole packaging is very heavy btw, once I got it out the box it was still heavy but not so bad. I did not do any heavy lifting while pregnant & set this up 2 months after baby was born, get help lifting if necessary or pregnant. I have had no issues with leaks UNTIL recently. I have used it plenty times with no issues. I had mine on top of my front load washer & had the drain cord go into a bucket. Switched to a top load & needed to move it so made space in kitchen, the second time after moving it to the kitchen it spilled water all over the counter & floor (I’m so so grateful an extension cord & airfryer next to it did not get wet nor the outlet) this time around I unplugged & moved everything on the counter when using it to see what the issue was.Unfortunately I am unable to upload more than one video. I found where the leak was, it is leaking from the drain cord. I will need to contact the company & see about replacing the cord. As you can see in the photo taken immediately after the cycle ending, it retains a lot of water. I don’t mind too much as I just place my items on a baby drying rack & allow it to air dry, this could be tedious if you are tight on space & want things dried. I also only fill water manually through the top but it’s nice you can hook it up to sink if you don’t plan on using sink water for the duration of the cycle you’re using.I suggest making sure your drain cord is facing in the direction you are draining from, I did not let this happen but I could see how the cord could get tangled. I also suggest if you are filling manually & are not by a sink to use two cleaned milk gallons filled with water or water jugs, it uses 1 and 1/2 if I remember correctly. Also note that the detergent is meant to fall out of the little door and into the bottom of the washer. Check the coupon dates as well! The soap coupons do expire, mine expired in December & I didn’t have a chance to use them. After I finished the sample soap I did buy Mollys suds dishwasher soap to use & it seems to be compatible. -6/14/24 I will update my review & date in another paragraph if anything changes or I feel there’s more info you should know before purchasing."
"I bought this machine back on August 2022, and my life got so much better not having to do dishes a million times a day!Anyway, the machine started having technical difficulties on April 2024, it seemed to be the power button, it started not wanting to work until a week later it stopped working all together.I contacted customer service and they said they could help with information even if it was out of warranty (they give you a year from purchase date).  They made me take a video, send receipts, write what was wrong with the machine and the guy on the line said he would be able to give me advice if something was wrong.  Sent the email, and they returned the email back with a one line, no hello, no thank you for contacting, nothing nice except… you’re out of warranty we can’t help you. That’s it, as far as I’m concerned it is still their product and at least be kind and mindful when connecting with customers.Bottom line, get the warranty that will give your product one more year of protection.If you think these machines can be serviced, they can’t, just because technicians are not willing to do it since the part that might be needed are probably going to costa as much as the machine and it’ll take some time to find them and get them plus service.This machines are good until they are not and out to the garbage, which makes you feel like polluting the planet.I can no longer go back to a life without a dishwasher so I bought a new one, with warranty this time. Hopefully it’ll last me more than a year and a half.I would’ve bought it from a different company but I couldn’t find one with the same smaller dimensions to fit  under my cabinets.Moral of the story, single use product, customer service sucks, no way of fixing, but life changer giving you time back from doing dishes."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Foam packaging inside of box was all broken, but original. Dishwasher arrived without any damage. We ran a GLASS cycle, since that’s mostly what we wash frequently in our RV and it cleaned great. We used one Platinum pod (no detergent was included). If you touch the upper door during the wash cycle, the interior light came on which was nice and unexpected. However, the dishwasher and all of the cycles were very loud. When the GLASS cycle finished, the door popped open an inch to allow for proper drying. The dishwasher was very easy to use and did a great job cleaning the glasses. The noise was such a deterrent to us that we decided to return it."
"This has been my most prized appliance. Was purchased August 2022 and worked great until lately. It has been giving error code ""ed"" for the past 2 months (which means communication error) and now the buttons won't press unless you use a ton of force and open and close the door about 15 times. My next countertop dishwasher will have the buttons at the top of the machine. I think that was the downfall here was water getting into the control board of the buttons."
I do like this dishwasher for small loads like after a small meal and a family of two or three because that's about all it fits. If you wash your dishes immediately and you have scraped them out beforehand then it works fantastic. If your dishes have been left for a long period of time and our dishes that tend to have things stick to them after being left out it most likely will not get everything off of them even on the more thorough setting. Also if you have dishes that have been left for a while and smell pretty bad it will apparently hold on to that smell and sometimes transfer it to other dishes you do afterwards and that is unpleasant. Leaving the door open after loads and letting it dry out completely and air out entirely has helped with that particular issue but it still leaves residue if your dishes have been sitting for a little while in say greasy water. Also if you use pods in the washing machine on the short wash setting it will leave soap on your dishes it does not rinse enough to get all of the soap off your dishes entirely so my recommendation is to use a liquid dishwasher detergent for the short loads and the pods for the regular wash cycles. Also the short cycle does not have a drying feature so your dishes will be soaking wet when it's done but it does have an air refresh feature that if you put on with the short cycle your dishes will somehow end up dry at the end. Also sadly I have been informed that I cannot use it in my very regulated apartment so that sucks.
This dishwasher was realllllly amazing up until it broke and started leaking 1 year after I bought it
"The product itself works. My issue with it was that the top spinner kept getting clogged.I contacted Comfee and they agreed to process a refund, since they had 1 year warranty. They told me they sent the check, but it never arrived. I subsequently contacted them 2 more times, both times of which they responded saying they would resend the check. I even tried a different mailing address! Never got the refundAll in all, I think I was scammed by Comfee in terms of the refund policy. They agree to send it and then never do until you give up like I did."
"i’ve had this for almost a year and unfortunately had to be refunded for it because the start button just stopped working. sometimes it turns on and then other times i literally cannot press start. for when i could use it, it washed my dishes great."
"So I purchased this in Feb 2023 and it has not been a smooth ride. As of today it still works, but there’s a lot of issues with this machine and will often not start at all. I at once point stopped using it for three months.If your machine is not starting, here are some tips to possibly get it to start: 1) unplug it and plug it back in an hour later, then try to start it 2)force out all of the water then try to load it with water again 3) open and close the door like 12 times 4) when in doubt, hit it hard. On either side of it, if it doesn’t start I just start whacking the heck out of it and then I am able to get the power button to work againAgain, if all of this sounds annoying (it is), I wouldn’t recommend."
"The Good: This product will clean your dishes. The Bad: It's a very large machine, yet can only wash a small load. The Ugly: It all takes a great deal of time.This strangely huge ""Portable, Countertop Dishwasher"" from COMFEE' -- at over 16"" wide, 17"" deep and 18"" high -- isn't practically portable and isn't likely to fit on your countertop. I had to purchase a rolling cart. Yes, it absolutely will get your dishes clean, but only 4 or 5 dishes will fit.Not only does it take a long time to prep the hose, put in the water and properly position the dishes -- it then takes 2 hours to complete a single wash. Even on the quickest cycle, a wash is 40 minutes. That amounts to about 10 minutes per dish! Once the cycle completes, of course, you have to empty the water and re-secure the machine.It's much ado about very little, but I don't regret this purchase. I hate doing dishes -- plus this machine sanitizes everything and leaves my dishes sparkling clean, so . . . All's Well That Ends Well."
"If you have soft water or want to fill it by hand, it's a great little unit. Not perfect, but it does its job well enough.If you plan permanently plumb it in or add in a water softener, you'll suffer. The connection to the machine is non-standard (it's not GHT, the standard across the board, NPT, or BSP) and the quick release leaks constantly. After a week and more fittings than I care to admit, I finally got a functioning system by just cutting the hose in half and adding new, standard compliant fittings.So, yes, the non-standard plumbing cost this machine two stars, but it's such a terrible decision, and will cause a lot of people problems, especially if they're looking for a semi-permanent installation in an RV or apartment."
Started leaving white residue on dishes and one time didn't turn on until I unplugged and plugged it in. It is a very clutch device however will be trying to figure out the white residue issue. It holds quite enough for out two person household and we run it about twice a day. Still more hygienic than hand washing somedays since it gets the temperature pretty hot.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This mini dishwasher is alright. I love that I can fill it up without having to attach to a sink. That being said, I wish I had paid better attention to the dimensions before ordering. There are a few different brands/models I’ve seen since that are even cheaper and seem to fit more dishes than this one. None of my full-size dinner plates fit into this upright, meaning I have to lean them at an angle to fit, taking away space for other dishes.Again, I knew it was mini, but this one is smaller than I would have liked. I would return it for another if it wasn’t such a hassle. Overall, the cleaning power is good, but I’ve definitely seen better results when using more expensive detergent packs. The fast cycle works well but does not actually dry the dishes, so you still have to allow them to dry afterwards, whereas the long cycle does dry them at the end, but it takes 2 hours and 10 mins overall. Pretty much functions as most normal dishwashers do - load the dishes, add detergent, and start the cycle. There’s multiple other cycle options, including one to clean fruit, but I haven’t used them yet.It was relatively quiet when I first started using it but lately it seems to have a louder whirring sound coming out of the bottom of the machine. That worries me, but for now the washer is working fine so I can get over it. The washer also came with a sample of Finish JetDry but there’s nowhere to put it in the washer itself, so that seemed like a waste to me.If you really only have space for this model, I would say go for it. But if you have just slightly more room, I would opt for another brand/model. This one just seems to be too small and the basket is kind of weird in the way you can arrange things. I don’t hate it, but I don’t really love it either. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"Has been pretty much a game changer as far as being convenient and enabling me to cook more but during a wash cycle last night it threw a e4 error code which according to the pdf has to do with not enough water. Nope, was filled to the required amount before startup. I tried putting more water into it to see what would happen and all it did was drain back out. Tried unplugging and plugging back in. Nope. Same thing. Funny that the extended warranty is for only 2 years for $33 and this only lasted 2 1/2 so even if I had bought that would still be out of warranty. I will not buy this type of dishwasher again and don't really recommend unless you buy knowing its short shelf life."
It worked well up until today.
"I'll give this three stars despite the fact that I did return it. It cleans just fine but leaves dishes so wet that I spent just as much time drying them as I would have hand washing (which boggles my mind because the ""dry"" cycle lasts forever). Ultimately it wasn't worth the space it took up and the time I had to waste drying everything."
"I live alone, and I do a lot of cooking. My house is small, so I can’t have a real dishwasher. Also, because my kitchen faucet has one of those sprayer heads, I can’t hook a portable dishwasher onto it. So I needed something that I could fill with water, and would fit on my countertop. This dishwasher seemed to fit the bill.On the plus side, it actually does clean dishes very well. It cleans as well as any full-size dishwasher I’ve ever used. It runs very quietly, and I like the automatic open function that helps dry the dishes.The negatives? First off, it’s just a little too tall to fit under my cabinet. That in and of itself was not a dealbreaker. It requires quite a bit of water to work. The pitcher that it comes with needs to be filled three times in order for the dishwasher to have enough water to clean. Also, the cleaning cycle is very long. Almost 3 hours! But the biggest drawback, is its tiny capacity. Like I said, I live alone. And even for the dirty dishes that I generate, I have to run the machine twice to get them all clean. That’s almost 6 hours of run time a day! And then I’m still left with my pots and pans that need to be washed by hand.So I guess if you live alone, don’t do a lot of cooking, and really hate washing dishes (or maybe you can’t due to a condition of some sort) this may be a good option for you. Personally, I don’t really see it as a time saving or energy saving option for me. So I’m going to send it back."
"It's bulky and a bit of a pain to use, but it does work like you'd think.Biggest issues are the size, weight, and how long it takes to do dishes. Each load is almost 2 hours, and it doesn't dry as well as you'd hope, though the dishes are not soaking wet after the dry cycle.But it works. It gets off stuck food and does a good job as a supplement to hand washing.Big thing to keep in mind is that it doesn't have any sort of water heater or heating element, the temperature of the water going in is the temperature it's going to be, so I recommend putting in near boiling water just for the piece of mind"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I've run maybe 4 loads in this so far. Uses 2 TBS detergent and NO rinse aid. Everything is clean but not dried. I'm adding water manually, and I just turn the washer so the water drains into the sink, because the first load with the drainage tube attached ended up leaking on my counter. Will likely be returning. My flatware knives don't fit well in the utensil rack, it doesn't dry hardly at all, and I'm seeing other models cheaper that have actual drying cycles."
I really do like this dishwasher but I hate that it doesn’t dry the dishes even when you put it on to dry them.  You need to open up dishwasher to air dry to get the dishes dry.  That’s why I gave a 3 star cause it’s really annoying that it leaves the dishes soaken wet.  And that I have to dry them all and it important to also dry the dishwasher too
"Updated Review:  I noticed on the first use that that top ""spinning"" thing where water comes out would spin the stop, then spin and stop spinning.  I thought maybe this was how it worked.  But then on the second use, the top spinner was spinning fine.  Well, this morning I put my new corelle dishes in for a quick clean and the top spinner didn't spin at all, and water was dripping from the bottom of the door.  Sadly, after speaking with customer service my only option is to return the unit for a refund.  Not an easy task because i'm disabled so my son will have to help me pack up the unit for UPS to pick it up.Original Review: So, I'm not thrilled with the purchase, but I'm not upset either.  I should have read the manual before I purchased it.  It takes 2 hours for a normal wash which includes the dry function - OMG seriously??? This is a fraction of the size of a normal dishwasher and you expect me to run it for 2 hours?  I opted for the rapid wash which took 40 minutes - guess what, no dry function with this option.  Ok, I let my hand washed dishes air dry no biggie.  Well, even 4 hours after the wash was done and the door was left open the dishes were still wet.  Anyway, If you have larger dishes this will not hold 30 items.  I was able to fit 1 large dish, 1 cereal bowl, 4 coffee mugs, one small drinking glass.  I also used the cutlery tray and was able to get 4 spoons and 3 forks on the rack.  Upside is dishes all came out clean.  I cut an eco friendly dishwasher tablet in half.  I think in the future I'll just use a few drops of Dawn as others have commented that they use.  I am considering doing a return because I found another unit that has better cycle options and a separate dry option.  Not sure what I'm going to do."
"I bought this so I could wash pumping parts and baby bottles without having to hand wash them all the time. It does great at washing them. Things came clean very effective in that manner, however drying them not so much. I understand they have a different shape to them, but everything was still soaking wet, so I ended up having to let it dry for several hours or put it in the sterilizer to dry it. It doesn’t have an heating element like a normal dishwasher so I don’t know if that’s part of it. It also doesn’t have anywhere to put rinse aid which I know help dry stuff too."
"This is a love/hate review. When it worked it was great, it did what it needed to do and it was such a great convenience and worth taking up the counter space as I live in a small studio apartment. The utensil rack wasn't in the best setting though, bigger porcelain spoons would fall off and break, sometimes items would slide off onto the floor (not that big of a deal though because again, it did what it needed to do and I got cleaned dishes). A year and a half in, the buttons stopped working. I could plug it in and the lights go on but the power button didn't work anymore. Most technicians only work on traditional dishwashers, and I didn't want to call the technician that Comfee recommended due to super low reviews. I found a video of a guy who showed how to dissemble it and I managed to get the door off the hinges and I found the wires connecting to the circuit board of the control panel was damaged, I'm no expert but I guess that stopped the buttons from working. I have an old iphone charger cord with wires sticking out like nobody's business and that still works, but the same can't be said for Comfee. I am weary of Comfee products now and will buy another countertop dishwasher from another brand."
"UPDATED REVIEW:Came back to update that this model was good while it lasted, and it only lasted about 6 months before it persistently started flooding and throwing error codes, and stopping mid-cycle. I managed to use it for another 6 months before I'd have to drain it before every cycle, and eventually it couldn't finish a single cycle. I tried contacting the company for repairs to no response, and could not successfully find a way to use the Amazon extended warranty either. So, that was a waste of money. So sad that this ended up being essentially a disposable appliance.---ORIGINAL REVIEW:What I love: almost everything. It works great as a single person living in a small space with no dishwasher. I'm neurodivergent and dishes are one of the things that saps all my energy, so I use the Comfee for all of the little items that take the longest to wash. It saves me so much brain space and cleans really well. I've used it for four months now with no issues at all. Was easy to use out of the box.What is tedious: I had to take off the rubber feet in order to get it to fit underneath my cabinets (and this was the only portable dishwasher on Amazon that would fit.) It's annoying day after day filling up a jug three times to enter the water and it does take up some valuable counter space, but it saves me so much brain space it's worth it."
This one is so bad in quality. I got a new one and it broke within a week?
The measurements on Internet are not correct. Height is  18 inches. Not 17.25.  Can you please tell the height without the rubber washers on it.  Thank You.
"This dishwasher was bought to wash bottles and pump parts daily. It’s great, and has good capacity, I like that you can refill water into it. It does leave a lot of water spots. I do not overfill and use one small soap pod of dapple, and  experiencing leaking :( not thrilled about that and makes me question longevity."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ⚠️ UPDATE :( :(.  Purchased July 2024, it’s now, October 2024) I was in love, when it worked it was wonderful, but it got stuck on error code e4, there is no reset button, after unplugging multiples of times and trying the 3sec cancel button multiples of times, I called the manufacturers help line, followed all representatives instructions that failed, was advised to take pictures of serial number, log into Amazon to get actual receipt (proof of purchase) it shows if unit was brand new or used, I had unit removed, after several hours of waiting for reply to email, I called again only to find out 1st rep didn’t get my email correct, then I was told to take a picture of the error code 😕😡 well why didn’t the 1st rep know this?Now I’m being told I can’t get it replaced because I was given bad information by the company’s representative….I still think it’s a great little space saving unit for RV’s, tiny homes, etc..  WARNING ⚠️ ⚠️⚠️ if you have a problem within your warranty period double check on what info they need and do not dispose of the unit until you have been assured your replacement is on the way!1st review.I travel frequently in my motor home, I travel alone, and it’s perfect for one, I place breakfast, lunch, supper, whatever that days dishes were, in a bowl of hot soapy water, after relaxing for a bit, when I’m ready for bed, I load the dishes, actually love the ever so light sound it makes, not loud enough to interfere with tv, music, or conversations, I wake up the next morning :) with no dirty dishes. I would highly recommend, gift if appropriate, if you’re thinking of gifting be sure the size will be okay, I am happy that it sits on my counter top and I am thrilled with every inch of space I gave up to have this, I already know, I’ll never be without a counter top dishwasher again …. Love it !!!"
"Got one for my friend last year. It was really good while it lasted, but it broke after 10 months."
I bought this to clean my bottles and pump parts. After a couple weeks it stopped working. Wouldn’t start a new cycle or drain the water from the cycle it stopped working during. I had to hand drain the water from the dishwasher and still couldn’t get it to start working again. Waste of almost $300.
"I bought this dishwasher five months ago, and was instantly in love. I haven’t had a dishwasher in six years, and was ecstatic to take some extra work off my plate. It didn’t clean as well as a traditional dishwasher, but it did a decent job, and made my life a lot easier.Flash forward five months. I get an E4 error, I drain the machine, clean it, think everything is fine. The machine still won’t work, but now it’s an E3 error. I ended up using dish washer cleaning tablets and even unscrewing part of the drain area to ensure there’s no clogs. I did this several times, found nothing, it still won’t work. The water won’t heat up, so I’ve been using warm tap water. The top sprayer won’t spin either, so nothing is getting clean.Today, I go to run the dishwasher because the little cleaning it provides is better than nothing. I go to the living room, and come back to find my kitchen covered in water. The dishwasher spewed dirty water everywhere out of the bottom of the machine. It completely ruined the shelving unit I bought specifically to hold the dishwasher, and my floors are damaged.It’s only been five months. I’ve spent hours trouble shooting this, and it’s broken in multiple different ways that I cannot fix. It’s so faulty that it’s damaged my other property. This was a huge splurge for me to buy, I’d been expecting it to last years, and I only got five months out of it"
"When hooked up to faucet, washer will not take water. Top washer spinning wand doesn't spin. Washer is supposed to beep when tank is full. It doesn't. Contact with customer service is unsatisfactory as the connection to whatever part of the world is bad and the service person doesn't speak English very well."
"I bought this dishwasher on August 24, and by November 23 it's already stopped working! I haven't even finished paying it off, or even thrown out the box yet, and I already need to replace it.Not that it ever worked well to begin with. Sometimes - not always, but sometimes - it makes a very loud hum that can be heard in the hallway outside the apartment. The sprayers don't cover the entire compartment, so only about half of its already-limited capacity will get clean. It doesn't have a compartment for rinse aid, so no matter how little soap I used, the dishes always came out with a salty detergent residue crust, so I have to run it a second time with vinegar to wash that off.A couple weeks ago it started randomly shutting itself off mid-cycle; at first I thought it might have been some kind of overheating protection, but now I see some detergent/vinegar crystals around the seam at the bottom of the door, meaning it isn't sealed properly and water is shorting out the power button (which, of course, is a cheap touch control, rather than a proper physical button)."
"I was fairly happy with this washing machine upon purchasing due to it's small size and good washing quality. However, only a mere year after initial purchase I am already experiencing serious malfunctions. The washing machine stops working mid-wash, with all of the dirty dishes still inside, and all of the cleaning liquid pooled on the bottom. When I attempt to remedy the situation by unplugging the dishwasher and cleaning out all of the dishes and the water manually, this resets the washing machine but the problem just occurs again the next time I am trying to do a wash. I live by myself and don't overload the machine. One year is not a good enough life-cycle for a product that costs almost $300. It should not have broken down this quickly and speaks to the low quality of the parts and/or engineering that went into this product. Would not recommend to someone looking for a decent quality tabletop dishwasher.EDIT: If I could rate this review at 0 stars, I would. Contacted Comfee support to request for assistance in fixing my issue; they did not even bother to suggest possible troubleshooting steps and flatly informed me that since the product was recently out from under the warranty (by a few months) they would not be taking any action to help me and told me to go screw myself. NEVER BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS BRAND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE RIPPED OFF WITH NO RECOURSE"
"It's completely dead after 9 months of use. I first encountered an issue after running only a couple loads with E4 error. The manual states to contact the manufacturer for repair replacement so I did. They simply said to return it to Amazon. This was not an option as the price had since increased and I'm not paying more for a replacement that should have worked in the first place (really getting sick of this bs with Amazon and their sellers). After some thorough googling, turns out it's just a design flaw and you have to manually tilt the unit backwards every so often to drain excess water and the E4 code disappears. Of course they wouldn't tell me that in hopes that I would re-order at a higher price point... sleazy.Other than dealing with E4 it worked as expected most of the time except every few weeks the start button would stop responding until you unplugged the unit for some time and re-powered it... Well that happened again yesterday but after multiple attempts with no luck, now the entire display does not come on and none of the buttons work. It's full of water without no way to run it... it hasn't even been a year and it's had multiple issues and already completely failed. I see now the price is almost $100 more than what I paid 9 or 10 months ago, what a joke.. avoid this overpriced junk."
"Is a common problem others have reported too - comfee needs to fix panel durability, or use manual buttons, or make replacements for the part washer. Otherwise works great for not too many dishes!"
"I bought this because I’m barely ever home. bought last week and opened today I'm trying to figure out what's going on.. so I did everything right before I started reading the manual twice before I put the water in. I seen the water fill at the bottom of the portable dishwasher and heard water running and the top and bottom starting to spin it then shut down flashed E4 and leaked everywhere! it went all over me, all over my cabinets inside and outside, and all over my floors! I contacted comfee myself and they said they don't have nothing to do with it I would have to call Amazon. The manual says they can have someone come out a fix it but that’s not true they only come out for built in under the counter dishwashers. Amazon said I would need to leave my package out on Monday for UPS at any time to pick it up I kept asking for a supervisor but they kept telling me that this is what they offer and they demanded they would disconnect the call. So I now as of today would have to leave my package out in the open hoping no one would steal it thanks to this two companies. I’ve been a loyal customer to Amazon and after this I’m never ordering from this again I’ll just go to Walmart!"
"The first time I ordered it, it got lost by the transportation team or got damaged in transportation and they refunded me after I waited two weeks for it. I waited a month and then ordered it again. It arrived and is quite heavy (as described) and I ended up having to place it away from the sink due to my cabinets being too low, so the fact I could pick any outlet and have it use it's water tank and empty in a bucket was great. However after less than three months, it had an electrical issue with the front panel and could no longer turn on or start running. Thankfully it does have a one year warrantee automatically with the manufacturers. I celled them and we determined this wasn't an issue they could help me figure out how to fix on the phone and they offered me a full refund.Like I said, customer service was great, but in the end it was more hassle than it was worth in my personal experience."
"I had the highest hopes. Door broke during a cycle, crashed open. Comfee customer service approved a refund, 14-21 days. I waited 21 days, contacted them. They said sorry someone never sent out the check. So im approved and its going on three days later and still the check is not sent out in the mail. Just messy and a hassle. Get one that wont break easy."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was so excited about this mini dishwasher, I live in a small place and I work and study so I have very little time to do house chores. Already in my first time using it the machine it  stop working mid cycle and sometimes  even in the beginning of cycles, it would end up leaving the dirty water  in the bottom of the machine.  The product  would simple not work sometimes or start out of the blue by itself making lots of noises “clicking random in buttons “, I wouldn’t even be able to stop that, soon enough it stop working at all, the light inside the machine would work but non of the functions or the buttons could be pressed. I contacted the brand to see if they could help with some solution, they didn’t offer me much of help just said I should return the product. I contacted Amazon to see what could be done and the frustrating part is after they delivered it in the wrong building( it’s a very very heavy box for one person to carry by itself ) , they told me I needed to return this product by myself so I would have my refund after possible 30 days. I was shocked, all I wanted was an exchange for a functioning machine but they refused, just refund. So I had to purchase another machine, meaning had to give over 500 dollars  for this thing until they decide to give my money back.! The only reason why I repurchased is that it’s the only counter machine that actually fits the space I have, the few times it worked a little longer I could see that would do the job. I am really frustrated how they handled the situation being they send me a defective product. The video I attached is the same I sent to the brand."
"I had really high hopes for this dishwasher but after having it for 2 months I unfortunately have come to the conclusion that this was not worth the money.I live in a very small studio and was excited for a bigger portable dishwasher after my farberware dishwasher stopped working.Nothing on the top rack gets properly cleaned and I more often that not have to run a cycle at least twice to get anything overall cleaned. Using different detergents made no difference I think the jets must be very very weak. At this point I expect to still have to clean my dishes a little before they can actually be set to dry.Speaking of drying… I thought it wouldn’t be too big a deal to have things solely air drying but with the price point I think having a drying function should’ve been included. It’s certainly a feature that I miss from my other dishwasher.So far I just set everything to the hygiene cycle in the hopes the high temps will get things properly cleaned but even with that setting things aren’t coming out as clean as dishwashers in the past have gotten my dishes. This cycle makes the dishes dry faster is the only other upside.I think it’s overall a good concept but needs significant improvement. I’d urge anyone interested to look elsewhere.***UPDATE***After over 6 months of use and attempts to salvage this thing I think I’m ready to give up and throw this thing in the trash.This thing now leaks and I’ve had to put towels under it whenever in use. The water hose that’s supposed to take in water is constantly falling out. I also had to get a different bucket to hold the water it would intake because the one they give you you basically have to fill it to the very top where it’s close to spilling and even then it’s not always enough.I’ve had to do other things in attempts to work with the machine that I won’t go into detail because it’s ridiculous.This thing was supposed to make my life easier and it’s honestly made things harder. I’ll happily hand wash until I can save up to buy something, anything better."
"There aren't many counter top dishwashers out there and it seems like they are all poorly designed and not very effective.  The wash cycle is also super long for such a small load.  It takes about an hour and only washes a few dishes and a handful of silverware.  I could wash 10 times as much by hand in half the time... and my dishes would actually be clean.  I wish a reputable company like Panasonic or Bosch or GE or LG.  I don't have any LOVE for those companies, but at least the products they sell tend to actually do the basic thing that they were sold to do.  This one doesn't.  It was so heavy that I didn't return it, but I should have."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I bought this machine on January with the purpose to wash my babies bottles.  I had the hose from the machine to my sink to drain the water. There’s an option to connect the water line but I didn’t, I just put the water myself using the small bucket. However, after just one month it started giving me error messages. When I searched up the codes it meant it needed to be drained. Which I did. The issue was resolved. Then it started leaking from the front. Which makes it inconvenient ."
"tl;dr version: leaks from inside the machine through the bottom. Don't buy this. Common problem in the reviews.Long version:I bought this dishwasher because we moved into a home without one. Its just the two of us so we didn't need a full sized unit. I got it in the evening and opened it right away. I followed the directions and did everything I was supposed to do to set it up. I didn't use the water line hookup because our kitchen faucet doesn't fit it correctly so I used the top fill method.I immediately noticed water on the counter coming from the underside of the unit, before I even turned it on. I thought maybe it was just some spillage or something so I loaded it up and started the cycle. It told me I didn't have enough water in it already which was weird but I filled it up again anyway.Let me tell you that my floors were wetter than the dishes because the water just consistently poured out from under the machine. I looked underneath to figure out where it was coming from and all I could see was water coming from inside and through the bottom pan.I googled and looked for troubleshooting tips which said that it could have been overflow from the filling process. I unscrewed the bottom pan and dried it out and drained the water completely...as much as possible.Tried to fill it again and use it and the same thing. Then started getting error E4 and it just drained all the water out because it showed an overflow again. Water is everywhere...the counter, the floor, in the sink, and no amount of paper towels or towels could keep up.I finally went on here and looked more closely at the lower rating reviews and others have the same issue. Not just my machine.There is a defect in the manufacturing process with COMFEE and they need to address it immediately.Do not buy this machine. Unless you need to mop your floors because thats all its good for...getting your floors wet.I sent it back the next day and will not buy this brand again."
"This has been my only experience with this machine.  The book says the only way to fix this is to call for service.Amazing.Edit: After being told by support to return it, I just removed the drain hose and tipped the unit backward to drain the water out, now it's working fine."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I hate that this has touchscreen controls. Sometimes the dishwasher won’t turn on and it seems to be because the button isn’t registering the touch. I’ve been using it for 3 months and this started happening about 2 months in. I’ve tried unplugging and replugging into different outlets. Sometimes that helps, other times it just won’t turn on and I have to hand wash everything.Another annoying thing about this dishwasher is that after using it a few times, the tank suddenly requires more than 5 liters of water before the icon + beep will go off. It takes about 6 liters now.I use this dishwasher to wash baby bottles, pump parts, and small toys sometimes. When it works, it gets the job done. If you’re planning to use this dishwasher for baby items, it’ll take a while to figure out a configuration that works. Smaller parts will fall through to the bottom. If something blocks the lower arms at any time during the cycle, you will end up wasting 2 hours and 5 liters (or more) of water because things won’t get cleaned. I ended up buying a dishwasher crate to hold small items, which really helps, especially since my baby only likes the annoying Dr brown bottles that have a million little parts. Even with the crate in there, the dishwasher is still able to hold all the bottles I need to clean at the end of the day.The spot where dishwashing liquid/pods go is weird and confusing. It’s just a little rectangular slot. Pods fall into the bottom anyways so I don’t see the point of it. I use seventh generation pods with this dishwasher and it works great.For anyone considering a tabletop dishwasher for baby bottles, it really does help. Just don’t get this one cus it might just crap out on you for no apparent reason."
"Not as good as the novete dishwasher. Has less space inside, the silverware rack makes loading the washer really odd, control panel not very intuitive, louder and the chime is more annoying."
"I just received the item a week ago.  I live in a small home  with an even smaller kitchen.  I hate hand washing dishes.  I'm so sad that I have to return this item in a few days. I used Dishwasher on 4 occasions since receiving it, and each time it leaked underneath  the unit on all 4 occasions.  My method of use was draining it in a 5 gal paint bucket.  I checked the drain hose to make sure it was secure to back and even tried to tighten the clamp again.. nothing helped.  I'm not sure why it is leaking underneath.  Will be returning next few days.  Really wished for it to work out.  I got it on Amazon prime days Sale.. So disappointed. I don't have marble countertops so even though I put a towel underneath  to soak up water after a cycle  it was soaked.. I don't want to ruin my Laminate/wood Countertop.  It's a Heavy Item so if it's sitting in a wet situation for a normal cycle it eventually will warp my Countertop if I dintlift it up each time to put a new dry towel  underneath."
This dishwasher worked great for a few months. It cleaned dishes well and we never had issues. One day it just quit working altogether. It turns on but won’t actually run a cycle. We’ve troubleshooted but nothing has worked. Super disappointed because we haven’t had it long.
"June/2023 Works great, gets dry food off good, just make sure the dirty bowls/cups are upside down, the bottom sprayer is stronger and use liquid detergentThis is great and hasnt raised my water/electric bill.If you have a small kitchen and hate washing dishes like me this is for you, I keep mine in my laundry room and I have the hose out the window and I pour the water inI would provide a picture but it won't let meEdit: 12/28/23 I've had this since July and only had a error code once that was easy to fix, it's great I highly recommend itEdit: 2/2024 the buttons have started malfunctioning and hardly work I have to unplug and plug it in multiple times before it works unfortunately so I'm knocking off a star9/24 i have stopped using it, no longer cleaning dishes well, cant by replacment filters ive been using a sink strain and the machine is darn near uncleanable so it smells awful. Good for a time though"
"I was a little unhappy when I first recieved this product, as the amount of dishes I could fit in it was pretty low. Also, I have only 1ft X 1ft of total counterspace in my kitchen, so I wanted something I could easily put away somewhere when not in use. It's pretty heavy for something that doesn't wash a lot of dishes. It does wash them well though, I'll give it that. However, I can only figure out how to use one cycle, and it the normal cycle takes 2 hours, including dry time. The drying cycle is pretty pointless, because the dishes aren't even remotely dry when they come out. But the final straw for me is that it only lasted about 6 months before it started leaking all over the place. I'll be looking into a larger roll away dishwasher next. Hopefully it will be better quality than this"
"I have used this for a little over a year. Paid $300. I have only ever used this for baby bottles.It’s not very quiet honestly it’s kind of obnoxious. Also, the inside plastic rack has started to chip apart/melt and rust. Not good. I’m gona have to buy a new one and do my research on a better brand.For $300 this should last you well over 1 year.Seriously don’t waste your money.Also sometimes it will randomly shut off in the middle of a cycle. I only ever used the hygiene cycle because it’s baby bottles and i want them cleaned and sanitized properly. (rarely but STILL happens occasionally).I have always kept the door open after a cycle and in between cycles because I’m pretty OCD when it comes to moisture and air flow ( deadly terrified of mold). So i know rusting isn’t from user error. Seems like a quality issue."
"It's decent and compact, and can really fit for two people, HOWEVER there's major upkeep downsides. If you use dish powder, the machine gets clogged. The hose is prone to falling off and unsealing, and you need to place the dishwasher near a drain because the house is, at best, a countertop distance to the sink. After having, and using consistently for months, it's really not worth the cost. You can get a decent dishwasher for a little more than this. Save your money and spend it on something better."
"It cleans alright, water pressure is pretty unimpressive with adding it to the top of the dishwasher. Very heavy, doesn’t fit a lot of dishes."
Product was very easy to install and the instructions were written well. I don’t think it’s the best quality. It dosent clean dishes as well as I would like and I don’t think it’s a good value for the money. The performance is lacking for me but it does have a good drying time.
Make sure every clears top and bottom. Not a very strong jet stream.
"This dishwasher I don’t know where to start . The first wash was ok . A full wash is 2 hours and you have to use it twice a day because it’s small . So the energy guide says 17 a year but that equates to 34 a yearThe top spray arm is so sluggish but your dishes will get clean and somewhat dry .The second day the top spray arm completely stopped working I called tech support after reading the manual I could not remove it to see if food or something had stopped it. Tech support oulfnt help they had no information about removing the spray arm .A few hours later I called Amazon they said I could return it so I was more than ready to do so. After that my handy man stopped by and I was telling him the problem and he looked in and figured it out you have to unscrew it then pull it down it has little nodules on there. You would think one sentence about a lack luster product could have been put in the manual .The next morning i called Amazon and told them we had got it back working so I kept it.Actually the one redeeming quality is it fits under my counter . I had another brand that lasted me 12 years! Unfortunately Amazon doesn’t sell it anymore and I really wanted the top sprayer and clear window . Aesthetically, it’s very nice looking like a 80s portable television set and if you get past the sluggish spray arm  It’s OK , it gets the job done but it’s like just adequate and I can work with it. If it last 6 months I’ll be surprised but in the mean time I’ll be saving my money because I don’t trust this thing. That’s my honest review it gets 2 stars in my book"
"Bought it, used it once and the water came out all of the seams. Returned immidiately."
"I so badly wanted this to work for my pump and bottle parts. I've been hand washing and sterilizing for 7+ months and am desperate for a solution. $300 felt like a steal when considering all the man hours and wasted free time I've spent soaking, washing, drying and sterilizing parts. Some of my larger 9oz bottles weren't cleaned all the way, and despite using the highest drying setting everything was left with watermarks. This is going back."
"I loved the fact that it was small enough to fit on my countertop- I have a baby so I wanted something I could rely on to get his bottles clean & sanitized. Unfortunately, there have been very few loads that I did not have to wash after using the dishwasher. Yes, I know how to properly load one, I never have any food particles on my dishes but I clean the filters after every wash anyway. The main problem is it doesn't get hot, doesn't dry. It used to dry when I'd use the hygiene cycle, but not anymore. The instructions say to open the door ""slightly"" to let things dry- there is no ""slightly"", it's up or down. I'm going to keep trying because I'd love for it to work, it cost a pretty penny, and has yet to really save me much time. At all. Takes over 2 hours to wash. So, I guess it wasn't really a smart move on my part."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is an excellent dish washer however, it makes an awful noise starting at around the 3rd use for me. Haven’t had it long & I’d hope the kinks would work out by now. I hope it will continue to work well.  I’d increase my rating if they contact me about how to improve the noise."
"I was so excited to get this for my small apartment and I it worked great for the first 5 or so times I washed dishes with it. One night I loaded it up and about halfway through the cycle it beeped and showed an E1 error. In the user manual this indicates that it wasn't getting any water from the water source. I used the tank and it was completely full when I started it so I just topped it off and tried again. This time the washer made a noise like it was trying to pull water from the tank but no water came into the main washer area and the E1 one error showed up again. I tried several troubleshooting techniques, (including hooking it up directly to the faucet), but I was unable to get ahold of anyone for further troubleshooting. I ended up requesting a refund and sending this back to Amazon. When it works this little machine is great but unfortunately for me I got a dud. I suggest keeping your packaging in case you need to send it back."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this September 2022, so I’ve been using it for a little over a year. Haven’t had any issues with it until now (Of course when the warranty is up). Tried doing a load of dishes and some of the buttons won’t work. Tried unplugging it a few times and turning on and off and finally got it to start on the rapid cycle. About five minutes into the load, it stops and the screen shows that I need to add more water. So I added more water. Now the buttons won’t work again. I guess if you only want to use this dishwasher for a short while it’s fine but I don’t recommend it for the long run."
"I bought this but ended up returning it. It worked well, but made a rattling noise. It also does not dry the dishes. I ended up buying the same brand, but one that had the drying function."
"I can see a lot of potential this has especially if you have a small apartment, need an extra hand, camping, etc, it works well for us the only thing is it doesn’t dry very well even with the door left open and the fan going alllll night it just doesn’t dry, but if you take out the tray and use it as a drying rack on the count or in the sink after it’s done washing it’ll take care of that problem."
"UPDATE, the buzzing stopped and now half the buttons quit responding, NOT HAPPY!!!this is a good little dish washer but it BUZZES & HUMS until i tap on the side. then it is a little tall and only leaves 3 inches under my top cabinet to fill the water so i trimmed the side filler to stay on the washer and used a sort of playdoh to seal around it when i fill it from my spray nozzle sink faucet."
"We loved this and used it for baby bottles only. Didn’t have a complaint besides it doesn’t dry well, but we just had a solution of taking the bottles out and having them air dry. It’s only been 5 months and it just died and threw and Ed error! Contacted customer service and they have zero solution for it. It’s a communication error. I’m hesitant to even buy another with the refund even though they said it’s not a common issue of the product or model. Disappointed to say the least."
I bought this because I have a new born baby. I have used to wash Baby bottles and small dishes  for 10 times so far.  Good thing is it clean very well of glasses.  Glasses are shiny and clean.  The bad thing is baby bottles are still wet and you can see water stains.  So I say this little machine is good for small dish wash but not for baby product.
"It comes broken inside, it is functional but I start the return because the problem is water leaking."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            after 2 uses, it doesn't work anymore  it doesnt start and buttons don't work"
"Worked perfectly for some time.  Then a few months in, the washer would stop 10-15 minutes in to the cycle and shut off. Requires manually unplugging it from the wall, draining, and refilling it to get it to work again. Then it either works, or goes into this cycle again. No rhyme or reason this happens, it just does. The line is cleared, the filter is empty, and all possible checks are done to make sure it operates. When it works, it cleans everything perfectly, but for the price point it should be working every time."
"I cook a lot so purchasing a dishwasher is to relieve myself from an extra task. The machine is very heavy. It fits my counter top. I pour the water into the machine instead of connecting to a hose; not feasible. I use a small amount of dish detergent instead of buying dish detergent pod which is more expensive. Don't put too much soap otherwise it won't rinse thoroughly. When use, I use rapid mode - 40 min. If you use the regular mode, it will takes 2 hours to complete the wash cycle. It fits a few small items but definitely not big pot or pan even if that is the only thing you put inside. It is best to rinse out food residue from your dishes before put them inside the washer. If someone is doing heavy cooking, this machine won't be a help as it only takes a few items."
"Seems like this would work well if it didn't leak everywhere...Water immediately poured out from the broken filled reservoir inside, flowing from the back bottom.  Thanks for checking your returns for quality and wasting my time."
"It was the perfect dishwasher for our tiny kitchen. Purchased in November 2023, but in October 2024, the buttons do not work and we cannot start the dishwasher. Disapointing for the amount of money spent on it."
"This dishwasher works great BUT in one spot it says it takes max 10 inch plates and in another it says 10.5. My plates happen to be 10.25 inches and most dinner plates are 10.2-10.5 so if you don't want to have to spend 40-60 dollars on all new plates just to use it then measure first. My Corelle frost whites do not fit and even leaning they stop the top water feed from moving at all. Other than that, I have run it three times so far and it cleans dishes well on the normal setting. The suction cup for the water outlet holds well in the sink. Thinking I should have sized up to the next bigger Comfee countertop and probably will after this one is at the end of its life. As a single mom with just one child this helps me a lot. It holds one days' worth of dishes for my son and I and saves me time from handwashing."
"I almost never write product reviews but this one I feel I need to do my due diligence to warn other shoppers of what happened.First of all its not nearly as spacious as it is made to seem. I could only fit a few items in there. And it takes still a decent amount of time to fill it up manually by water. I was thinking that I could save time by using this but you have to manually fill it with about 4 full pitchers of water. If you have low cabinets like me, then its really hard to do so too.The MAIN ISSUE is that it BROKE WITHIN 2 WEEKS. It just said E4 error on the front of the machine. I looked inside the manual how to fix it, it says that you have to call customer support and someone will come down and fix it. I called them. They said that they dont have anyone to come and fix it and the product is just defective and I will have to send it back. Well I already got rid of my box so I had to go find another huge box to fit it in, which was a hassel in of itself. The dishwasher overflowed and also led to a situation where I had to clean up a big mess.AVOID THIS PRODUCT unless you want to risk it just randomly deciding to stop working and then find yourself in a situation where customer support  doesnt want to help. Thankfully Amazon itself helped me resolve  the issue but I don't recommend using this company."
"I hoped this product would help save me some time from doing dishes.  Instead, it has wasted a great deal of my time as I tried to make it work.The first major issue I encountered was that it is very, very loud.  The unit makes a loud buzzing sound while it's running.  It sounds like a bad electrical transformer. If that is the cause, the company should replace or repair the unit, but I'll talk more about that later.  At the very least, it is by no means quiet, despite what the manufacturer claims.  I solved the buzzing sound by pressing a heavy object against the side panel, damping the buzzing sound.  However, I shouldn't have to do this for an item that is still protected by its warranty.The second major issue is that the unit leaves a white residue on items after the wash cycle.  The troubleshooting guide claims this is caused by hard water, but I do not have hard water as my place.  I tried using different soaps, including the soap recommended by the manufacturer, all without any effect. Even having only one item in the unit while it is washing doesn't do anything to prevent the white residue. Again, this indicates to me that the unit is not operating correctly and that the company should do something to fix it.This leads me to my last point.  I reached out to the Comfee customer service two weeks ago, but never heard back.Because of all these factors, I would strongly recommend looking somewhere else for a portable dishwasher.  This one is way more hassle than it is worth."
"I bought this for my tiny kitchen ! best part? Super space -efficient. It fits like a charm. it can handle small pots and pans well but not big and many !Cons: a bit pricey🥲 the water and energy use can be higher compared to full sized dishwashers. So it’s not eco friendly option ! The drying isn’t top notch, some dishes come out a bit damp, so i need air dry them a bit. And it’s a little noisy . In a nutshell it really depends on your need , if you are tired of dishwashing and have limited space this could be a good help"
"This is the second unit we have had, first one had an error after less than 24 hours use. Received a replacement about 2-4 months ago and now we’re back to where we started. Unable to be used. Cleaned as recommended, limited instructions. This time water was splashed all over the counters etc, and the only thing that we can do is toss it or hire a repairman. Not sure they can help with this item. Look at other options or get the extended warranty."
"I read through many reviews and figured that enough of them were decent, and that this countertop dishwasher was worth a shot. Plus it was in my price range. However, I was quite disappointed and returned it the following day.I followed the set up instructions and filled the reservoir until the beeping sound. All seemed to be working well as I started my first mini load. About 2/3 of the way through the wash, water started spurting and trickling out of the lower part of the front door! My kitchen was a water works. There was no stopping it until the cycle finished. It got into a drawer and soaked the counter top and floor. Also, there was a TON of water left in the bottom of the machine when the wash was done. There was an error code saying I overfilled it.I drained the water out eventually and repacked the machine for return. UPS picked it up for me!On a positive note, the dishes did come out nicely clean. And the blue light inside was enjoyable.Will need to spend more $$ on a different model next time."
I am still awaiting my refund taking way longer than any other amazon return - Not acceptable.  I was so excited to use this in my RV thinking wow great clean sanitized dishes.  However was quickly disappointed as it leaks underneath the unit.  I tried it twice to verify before placing it under the sink cabinet (water leaking in an rv is a hard NO). The first use I thought perhaps I spilled some water when pouring it in.  NOPE tried it a second time on the counter and there is a constant leak at the back underneath of the unit.  So would not recommend! Buyer beware as it does not work as stated and getting a refund to purchase a new unit it is lengthy!!!!!!!!!
"I looked at all my dishes and decided all that time with my hands in dirty water was worth 250$This little washer is just okay, it took me 3 week for it to arrive to me- it arrived with a crack in the front. It works, it’s just loud. I don’t think it’s worth the money but that is ultimately yours to decide."
So I ordered one of these because I had saw some pretty good reviews but definitely beware if you buy. I got it and I had it for 3 days and it quit so I got it returned and ordered another one thinking it was just a faulty item. So after 3 days it stopped mid cycle and quit working so I got another one and it had it for 13 days and it stopped working again the same thing with stopped mid cycle. I think the control panel being on the bottom is a bad idea because it seems to keep shorting out on me no matter how careful you are with it. I won’t be buying this brand or product ever again.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Who would’ve thought I’d actually look forward to doing dishes ? Lol seriously though my only regret is not having purchased a mini dishwasher sooner. I live in nyc and a hookup is out of the question let alone might even be prohibited in our lease. This has saved me hours of time I usually spend doing dishes. Aside from that it has made me appreciate cooking again without that nagging thought I’d have to clean up a lot after preparing a big meal. I hope it lasts because this guy here is my new bff :)update :I really enjoyed using my washer but sadly it stopped working only after having it for less than 3 months. The power button would turn on but the panel on the right side just won’t respond anymore. If I select rapid I cannot press the normal. The start won’t work. Like something behind the panel just won’t connect. It’s really sad coz I was enjoying using the unit. It’s outside the 30 day period so i had to contact the manufacturer to try to troubleshoot but they recommended to just refund my money:( I’m likely just gonna get a replacement . Still thinking about whether I shioks get the same brand since this stopped working in a short span of time I’ve had it .
"For the price I was expecting a great decent sized dishwasher. It is so little inside. It holds about 4 plates with enough room to wash 2-3 cups at the same time. 3 meals a day that's multiple loads of dishes, and the cycle is 2 hours long! The dryer also doesn't work very well. My dishes are soaking wet at the end. I loves the option of not having to hook this up to the sink and just fill up the tank, but it's seriously not worth it. Maybe if you're a single person who doesn't cook very often who loathes washing dishes, otherwise its a waste of space and time. I'd have to run it all day long to wash everything used in a day. Easier to just fill up the sink."
"Ordered mid-August, after around 2 months of use got an E4 error code which indicated in the manual to call customer support to get a tech out. I called and support said they do not send out techs to fix broken units that are fulfilled by Amazon. I didn't have the serial on me when I initially called and about another 2 months went by and I plugged the unit back in for the first time. It seemed to be working normally, but in two days (last night) I went to bed with it running and this morning my whole kitchen was flooded. I called again, and customer support very pretty short with me bordering on rude. It took two phone calls and resending information three times because no one was very clear with what was needed from me. The issue is now ""resolved"", because I was offered a refund for the unit and taxes. The third rep I spoke with said it will take a business day for the refund to be approved by another department and another 10-15 business days for the check to be sent out.TLDR; the unit broke really soon after purchase, customer support is ineffective, but a check will be sent snail mail in 2 weeks. Not worth the hassle."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I found that the instructions were a bit convoluted and unclear on set up and general operation. What was most upsetting was how easily the front door of this appliance would pop open at the slightest touch or jostle. The buttons not being physically present is also kind of a drag, it’s just a flat surface with no exterior physical designs to let you know if you correctly pushed a button unless you are directly watching the interface. Idk the lack of a physical button just irks me. It comes with a built in notch for you to fit a tide pod, or whatever brand you use, but it might as well not have been put in at all as it is so shallow a pocket and when the door is closed it stand vertically and there’s no way it will ever hold any sort of cleaner pack. You’re better off just tossing your cleaning agent at the dishes inside this thing."
"We’re a family of 3. Perfect for the couple of dishes we cycle through out the day. Fits perfectly on our small counter top. Easy to use. No complaints.Edit** we have lost the water funnel for the top part of the dishwasher. The website does not provide any support for replacement. Please let us know how we are supposed to get this part, it’s difficult to fillThe dishwasher with water without one."
"Update: the heating function stopped working. The water is not hot and neither is the air vent at the end of the cycle. Dishes are now white stained or greasy. Contacted comfee, let’s see.I actually wanted the bigger and newer version of COMFEE dishwasher as it has a water sucking mode so you don’t have to pour water into the machine to use a tedious pipe to connect to the valve. But then that one doesn’t fit our countertop and the darn low ceiling cabinet.I didn’t like this machine at first because it’s small. Turn out this disadvantage helps to improve one’s creativity. If you really try, you can actually put a lot of stuff inside it. Just make sure to arrange them in the way that each spot can receive the water splashed from the top and bottom rotators. We have no trouble putting -3  meals worth of 2 people and some more. I don’t like the pipe laying around so just manually pour water in every time. It sounds tiring but it’s only 3 pitcher full of the one that came w the machine. The machine is not quiet, but definitely not loud enough to disturb my work. Actually it’s quite a nice white noise. It really heats the water well during the wash as all the grease come off nicely. Make sure to use dishwasher detergent, the one used with handwash will cause a lot of foam. I’ve been using this daily for 2 weeks and start to like it a lot. I’ll update if things break in the future, let’s hope not :)"
Top part only  cutlery can be use. To me is kind of ridiculous.  Because the bottom get crowded with cup and plates.  But the worst part is that don't dry everything is full of water 😕. Only because my son throws the box I didn't send it back. Not very pleased..
"40 mins for rapid wash, you can fit maybe one medium sized mixing bowl, or small bowls with 3 or 4 small cups.Takes over a gallon of water to run it, if for some reason that it gets shut off or you open the door it will drain the water and you have to fill it completely up again, doesn't work if living off grid .I will say that it does clean stuck on mess really good , but you will be thirsty since it took all the water you had"
Does the job well but doesnt even fit my cutting board which is a standard size. Fits only a couple of dishes after each meal.
"Well, it works. Kinda...It takes over two hours to wash a few dishes, and I use the word wash very lightly. The dishes you put in it might as well be clean before you even start it, and given the amount of dishes you can fit in there it will only take five minutes to hand wash.Then you have the fill procedure, plan on having a dedicated water source before you begin. If you get the push to connect fitting that attaches to your faucet it fills just fine, but don't use that faucet for at least ten minutes. This all permitting you actually turn the water off as soon as it is done filling, otherwise you and whatever counter you set it on will get a shower. You could use the funnel and pitcher it includes to fill it with water, but again it takes longer than hand washing the few dishes you can fit in it. Patience is key when pouring, practice on a surface you don't care about getting a bunch of water on first.Again, I use the word ""wash"" lightly. It doesn't really wash dishes, even if you rinse your dishes with hot water as soon as you're done eating and start the machine shortly after. I've been using the tablets they recommend and dishes just aren't as clean as regular hand washing. Plus hand washing is considerably faster given the capacity of this machine.Summary. If you have a couple hundred dollars to waste on something, you're just plain lazy, you don't care if your dishes are squeaky clean, and you have nothing better to do with your time this machine is perfect for you!"
"I have tested the cleaning power of this little dishwasher by allowing my husband Buffalo chicken cheese dip sauce to dry on the mini crock pot liner and the serving spoon(these are normally very hard to clean off by hand even after soaking) it got all of it off. It has also gotten dried on food off my husband's hidden dishes he has left on his desk. If you have an over grown man-child this will come in handy if you have limited space and not enough time to spend an hours plus soaking scrubbing and soaking again. One downfall is the regular cycle is a long cycle 2hours+ including drying. But still save time so you can clean other things. I work 2-2-3 rotation 12hour shifts so coming home and cleaning after work is a no go for me. I just want to sit and relax before going to bed. I also didn't want to spend my days off doing nothing but cleaning. Another downfall it doesn't fit larger items those still need to be cleaned by hand. Like pots and pans that are larger than a sauce pan. Yes, I know it's taboo to put pans in a dishwasher, they aren't fancy pans. Lol if I could afford fancy $100+ each pans I would have a bigger place with a built in dishwasher haha.@UPDATE... control panel stopped working. Customer service is giving me the run around. Manufacturers warranty is 1year after purchasing. They are trying to get out of the warranty my dragging on saying oh we need this oh now we need this, oh and this. While taking weeks to reply. AVOID AT ALL COST!!!"
"It worked great for 6 weeks. Not very loud, doesn’t take up a lot of room, looks nice, cleaned dishes even with dried on food stain like chili. Unfortunately it worked great for about 6 weeks. Now it won’t turn on, and when it decides to turn on you can’t start it 90% of the time or change the wash setting."
I liked it at first but after a few washes I noticed residue on my dishes especially cups even when I didn't over fill it didn't seem to wash the detergent off and I ended up having to rinse everything off in the sink
"It works, it’s not very good with forks.It’s smaller than you would expect, not that I was expecting much. It’s also difficult to stack things inside. If things aren’t placed correctly you will have dirty dishes at the end of the cycle.There have been times where I rinse things away after it is finished with its cycle. I don’t see the point in having this take so much counter space for 10 items.The first cycle is best but even then, you’re only washing like 10 items in there at a time.With the amount of things you can put inside of it, save your money. You’ll spend 10 minutes doing the dishes by hand.It’s nice that they give you free pods to use. The machine is fine too, it’s just too small and half the times something comes out dirty.I am giving it 2 stars because it works but the time it takes to place the little dishes you can put in there isn’t worth the $300."
"When I had the dishwasher installed and 3 days later went to use it and it sounds like the pump is out. It was so loud. When I contacted customer service I had to send proof of purchase. The next day I got the call and was told within 2 days I would get a call for someone to come and fix it. It has been 2 days and no phone calls. Obviously a known problem with them because it says in book, if no water goes into unit to contact customer service."
"So far, the dishwasher is working rather well. It  has a pretty impressive capacity considering I switched from a standard size dishwasher.  However, the lettering on the control buttons started rubbing off after a week or so. ""Power"" and ""Start"" are completely gone at this point.  That's not ideal and makes me a little nervous that the product wasn't well designed/ thought out. Very effective so far at cleaning dishes.  I bought this brand because the air conditioner I purchased was top-notch and better than any other I've owned."
"We still haven’t installed it. We bought it in July on a great sale, but knew we wouldn’t be able to install it until the rest of the project was ready. It sat in its original box in our home. We unboxed it to install it, the entire front looks like it was kicked in. There was no damage to the box in this area, but the unit and the internal packaging is damaged. Hoping we can figure something out. Ughhh."
"1). Puts out immense heat.2). Questioning the opening & closing the door over time, will cause the plastic locking  mechanism to adventurely break"
"I open the box and there is a humongous dent on the side. I thought about returning it but thought about how painful it is to return. I installed it to see if it works before deciding. Oh btw....it doesn't include hoses, electrical cable etc . This item in amazon says explicitly that no other parts are needed to install and that everything is included.  Bs! I had to buy the kit and plumbers tape. On the upside, it was quite easy to install. It looks sturdy...it worked despite having that large dent which I assume was a substantial drop. At least it wasn't in the front. So I've decided to keep it. It seems to clean dishes well. At normal mode, it takes about 2 hours. No soap suds left over after rinse. I am happy with the dishwasher....not with the delivery and the product description."
Will not fit the same conventional dishwasher space.It would be great for tiny spaces.
For some reason it will leak but not all the time
The dishwasher works great just mad that I ordered the back dishwasher and they sent the sliver now it don't match in my kitchen.
"Delivered yesterday 10/11/2023 there was no bottom to the box at all, half of the styrofoam was missing on the bottom, opened the box this morning 10/12/2023 and found a big dent in the back of the machine, dirt all over especially on the bottom of the machine in the back. Praying it still works. What a shame."
Leaks at both bottom door sides at times.I leveled dishwasher before install per instructions and depending on what's maybe in washer it will leak on right or left bottom door area. Not happy with product.Update: Midea made it right.
Close but doesn't fit. See photo. with door open it's an inch oversized compared to published specs. Totally unacceptable in this day and age. Return window has closed.
"I receive the dishwasher and install it.... flood my all place, leaking ...leaking .... leaking ...."
"Not the quietest when running. Have to run multiple times to get dishes clean. Not a complete seal around the door and leaked. Overall, low quality."
"Earlier I gave it this review: ""Good washer, and real good price. Quiet and efficient."" However, we have had it for only 10 months and first the water leaks on the kitchen floor, then the machine stopped working.Sigh."
This dishwasher was brand new and once we had it completely installed it wouldn’t work. We sent it back.
The back and inside of the product is all bent up.
Bottom seal failed within 6 months. Probably on ran this thing once a week.Very unhappy with product.
No signs of the packaging being damaged. The back left corner of the cabinet had a huge dent. I had to pack this up and deliver to the UPS store for returns. Not easy on a single 60+ woman.
Does not work after two times of using.  Do not buy.
"Customer refused product upon delivery 8 March 2024 due to missing packaging, parts."
Be careful you will miss the connection parts
That's all I'm allowed to say. Frustrating.
Cheap hard plastic. Not good for loading dishes. Buttons hard to read. Purchased at Lowe’s when install rebate in place but life’s has no intention of paying any rebate. They deny despite proof of purchase and install.  Do not purchase any modes product. Awful company with no integrity.
"Washes dishes, great had for three years then had a problem keeping it running but the mechanics team two times $300 couldn’t fix it call Madea they said buy another dishwasher didn’t care"
"I wanted to love this due to its size, it’s perfect for our small kitchen. My husband had to get different adapters to connect it as it didn’t bring what was needed. That wasn’t the biggest issue though. We set it up, got it to work. After the 3rd use, he buttons had faded. Unless youve memorized each button, this machine is useless. My daughters have not a clue how to get it to work. So now it just serves as storage, until we get a new one.  Don’t waste your time or money. Not worth it."
"This PoS only rinses and sometimes gets the soap in the rinse. You have to scrub everything off the dishes and glasses before putting them in or they won't get 'clean'. The soap door doesn't even open half the time and it doesn't seem to work with soap pods that have any type of powder in them, they don't dissolve, so you waste 2 hours of wash time for slightly hot rinsed dishes. There is no sort of pressure washing action even though it has a pots and pans setting, which is apparently the only one that works with the soap pods, every other setting doesn't do anything noticeable except leave some soap scum on not-clean dishes.The basket for dishes has so many large holes in it that you can't put anything like utensils or tupperware lids except in a couple of spots or they fall through and get caught in the washing arm. Also the spikes to hold dishes are so stupidly placed that you can't put a saucer type bowl in without it falling over and taking  up 1/4 of the space available. Even pint glasses are hard to place due to the spacing of the spikes. All the extra plastic flaps on the tray do absolutely nothing except get in the way.The hoses for the water lines are different lengths and come bent in a circle in the box, which would be fine if they were pliable at all but they are too stiff to position without them bending back to packing position. This leads to water not draining correctly to the sink due to low spots so when you detach the hose from the sink, it immediately wants to coil back up and gush water all over the floor. Additionally the connections on the back for the hoses come loose every time you move the hoses, so it also leaks on the floor unless you take a wrench to it everytime.This is not designed for a countertop that has any type of cabinets, so I had to buy a tall wire rack just to get it to sit where it would partially drain. The plug is only meant for outlets that have no molding or backsplash on them (90° vertical plug, not horizontal or straight-in like it would make sense for any modern home).I really wish I had returned this crap in time, but I was too busy to even use it for a couple weeks and missed the window.Also when it showed up the box was mangled all to hell, didn't see any real damage to the machine, but who knows, something might have busted internally and that's why it's not working for me. Overall this was a total waste of money."
"We love(d) this dishwasher. It worked great. Then it stopped working. E3. So should just be a temp module. Customer service is being useless (Danby directly) & in frustration I went to order a replacement since it seems like it will be more than 2 month til we get the part. Depending on our financial state when we do, I figured I would keep the 2nd unit as a backup, or sell one of them. But Amazon is suddenly not shipping to where we live. When I spoke with an endless string of Amazon customer service to find out how to get it shipped...the main thing they would all admit about it is that Amazon is Redlining...not shipping certain value items to certain areas. I bought this dishwasher via Amazon in 2020. When I first tried to order a replacement, it wouldn't ship to me, but I could get it to accept addresses in Orinda & Beverly Hills. When I re-checked...working with a friend who lives elsewhere to try to understand the shipping mayhem, it had then switched to being blocked from shipping to any California address we tried. Amazon customer service repeatedly said this was redlining, while not seeming to understand when I said ""it is illegal to redline"". So we have a broken one we cannot get a part for months...which I think may be a problem with any brand of this particular build design. Not sure what to tell anyone else on whether to order it or not, other than if you are allowed to order it & you have trouble with it at all early on, insist on return/replacement because you probably have a lemon. Wish I had."
"I have owned two counter top dishwashers now. The. First one I sent back, as when it stopped functioning it was still in the return time. It’s been three months and I cannot return this now. The drain hose has leaked since I got it. This is still running, but it doesn’t clean any of the dishes. I’ve run a load three times and it’s still not clean. Now it’s just taking up space and creating mold in my cabinets below. I completely regret this purchase, and I am now out $300 and there’s nothing that I can do about it."
"Great for small house or apt where space is limited. Only dislike is a full size plate won't fit standing straight up in the slots. Got to lean it a bit. You also have to make sure there is nothing in the way of the dispenser flap where you put your dish tabs, if it gets blocked door can't open and dispense tab."
"It's pretty obvious by the headline. The first time we used the dishwasher, we got an E4 error message, stating the device was not draining water. Went thru all of the steps in the install guide - didn't work. Called the 800 help line, after waiting for almost an hour online, was cut off. Second time I called, the call was ended because it was closing time. Email ""help"" was either return it, at almost half the cost of buying it - OR - take it to an approved service agent, over 120 miles away. What a joke. I'm currently stuck with a massive paper weight in my kitchen."
"While the box did arrive damaged the part of the box that was damaged was not where the product itself was damaged. There is a large dent on the metal finish casing on the top of the product. In my opinion this likely occured while the product was being packaged or maybe even before that as it looks as though something caught the inner lip of the metal sheeting which would only be possible if the door of the dishwasher was open. This leads me to believe the product was damaged and packed/shipped anyway. Also lifting the washer out of the packaging it appears as though some of the black flared clips that hold the bottom to the outer casing were laying in the bottom of the box snapped off. While we are pretty disappointed that the washer is visibly damaged, it appears to work fine for the first few test washes I have done. I could return it for a new one but trying to have this shipped back would be a project in itself. I will be contacting amazon to see if there are any other avenues we could go down rather than return."
This dishwasher has a leak water issue on the bottom of the maching: the bottom cover is desing to hold some water and when there is a lot of water under a sensor actives an error. It is an eassy to fix by drilling a whole and put a cup under it so you dont get this error every time. I was getting the error after each wash.
"My step mom has a dishwasher that has ran for decades. This one ran well then broke in less than two yrs. Some family members had purchased one as well, theirs broke in less than a year (same error, seems to be the heating element is not good with cool water coming in). Perhaps you will fair better if you put hot water into it.  We have a small hot water heater (use to live off grid) and need all 5 gallons for showers. Relatives in similar situation. Oh well, trying a Farberware next..."
"Excellent machine when running BUT BEWARE— cheap, plastic hoses and faucet connector.  Plastic wears out quickly. Checked Lowe’s, Home Depot, Ace Hardware, and a plumbing supply specialty store for replacement hoses and connectors. Danby’s connection setup is proprietary and NOBODY could figure out how to replace the connectors, not even the plumbing supply store with plumbers on hand with 30+ years experience. So I checked Danby online, followed online instructions to pre-emptively order replacement hoses and faucet connector and they aren’t there. Called Danby. Refused to let me place order over phone. Kept trying to give me 15+ digit part numbers for multiple parts (which I had no way to confirm they were even the ones I wanted) and was told to go back on line and type in all the long part numbers to order. No thank you. WAYYY too complicated to replace the plastic parts that will surely break within a year. As soon as I mentioned the difficulty was such that I now prefer to return the dishwasher to replace with another more easily serviced, representative said “That’s fine if you want to.” and hung up on me. She  ever called back. So I assume it was intentional. I’ve now wasted 10 hours over two days trying to find replacement parts. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE."
"The dishwasher insert:- Uses up about 30% of the vertical height, leaving no room for large plates- Has no spots for glasses/cups. I have several highball glasses, rocks glasses, wine glasses, coffee mugs, and point glasses, none of which fit well anywhere on the insert- Has no good spots for bowls. Most other dishwashers usually have grooves that can hold a bowl upright- The upper area is so small, nothing but small pyrex lids can be wedged inOverall this dishwasher (mostly because of it's metal insert) just doesn't do it's job. It's only useful for silverware, small plates, and 1 bowl per load that I can use up the remaining space by placing it upside down. Would not recommend."
This dishwasher is alot smaller than I expecting! I can't get my plates in standing up because not high enough and if they lay down then you can only get a few things in it
The dishwasher works great but it arrived with a big dent in it. I read some other reviews that mentioned it having dents. Seems like the company should be working on better and more protective packaging. I kept it anyway because it seemed like more of a hassle to return it and the new one probably would have arrived with dents anyway.
Love the dishwasher. I just contacted customer service about my silverware basket breaking (never moved) and it’s not covered after 4 weeks (I bought 5 weeks ago). I highly recommend using a credit card with insurance because my experience with Danby thus far is they are very good at not covering any fixes on these products. Better to go through insurance or Amazon.
This thing was great up until yesterday as it was going through a cycle and started beeping. I went to look at it and saw on the front display a E4 error... I also heard a sound like it was trying to drain water out of the machine but there was no water in it so it was crazy. I unplugged the machine for hours and came back to it the next day and still E4 code showing.. Not sure what the issue is but there seems to be no fix for this from what i can see and this makes me very nervous in the future if this is replaced as I'm concerned it will keep happening.
This was an expensive appliance and I expected a higher quality.  The major problem is that the latch doesn't work and the door pops open!  I am using velcro to try to keep the door shut!  Photos show the crappy latch (who would use something like that?  the designer should be fired!) and my velcro work-around to try to secure the door.
Right now I have water dripping from the front of dishwasher. I had that problem with my old dishwasher that is why I brought a new one. I have contacted the company for a solution to the problem. Other wise the machine is quiet and does a good job of cleaning.
"Ordered this and it was bigger than expected, so be ready for that. All the pipes you have to hook up are annoying to set up, barely fit my faucet. Once I did have it all set up finally and loaded (barely any dishes into it mind you because it's somehow at once too big yet smaller on the inside, like a reverse Doctor Who contraption), it worked for about 15 minutes before it came time for the water to drain out and I kept getting an E4 error, which meant the drain pump had malfunctioned. Repositioned the pipes, kept tightening the connecting ports, even checked the internal filter (and was up to my elbows in suds), but nothing. Kept getting the same error and the thing refused to drain properly. Might've been able to figure it out but by that point it was too much of a hassle for a machine that only promised to do some of the dishload. Save yourself the time and get something else."
Unfortunately I can't give an adequate review cause my dishwasher arrived damaged and at all looked like it was returned not the first time. I had to return. thanks for arrange home pick up. Otherwise I don't know how to deal with this heavy box. For this 2 stars.
"This dishwasher was super helpful when we bought it. No longer had to handwash dishes, it was easy to hook up to our sink and held a decent amount of dishes for the size. HOWEVER, I bought it one month and one year ago. For just the last few cycles the detergent no longer cycles through properly leaving a soap scum layer on the inside of the washer and on the dishes. It also leaks water from the bottom of the machine. (I did clean it properly to try to fix the issue) I reached out to Danby to inquire but since I/just/ missed my warranty I can only pay to service it. It is disappointing that the dishwasher began to fail as soon as the warranty was over."
"I really like the size and design of this, but this is the second time I've ordered one of these and it arrived with a broken door latch. I can't use the appliance if the door isn't latched. Oh and Danby support is the actual worst, and the product's warranty is laughably bad."
"After ~30 minutes of reading the instructions to make sure I install it correctly the dishwasher didn't even work. It made an insane amount of noise when I started it and I thought it is going to explode. The screen showed an E4 error which apparently corresponds to a blockage in the drain (and yes, I checked that everything is installed correctly). Waste of money and time. Returning this and going with another company"
"Received package and it was a little beat up, but opened it up and it was fine but for one small cosmetic scratch on the top edge of the door. Worked fine for a week then we got an error E4, drain malfunction. Cleaned the filter, unplugged the hoses and drained the unit of all the water then plugged it all back in and still E4. Called theor support number and they told me to send it back for a new one. So I sent the old one back and the replacement came but instead of a compact dishwasher, they sent me a compact freezer instead. That was enough for me, so I've requested a refund."
"""Hey Boss, A truck load of our little dishwashers was in a wreck, what should we do with all the dented dishwashers?""""Sell them online""It is nice and quiet. It is a little too small. one inch taller would help a full size plate fit. You must make sure the rotating spray wand on the bottom rotates without hang up, or nothing will get clean."
"Item arrived damaged on both sides and top, but still worked"
"We purchased this dishwasher in May 2020. We used it infrequently for 1 year and 8 months.  The dishwasher is no longer operational because we got an error code, fixed the issue and yet it was impossible to clear the error code from the dishwasher.  A piece of junk!"
"It is very quiet, but it is poorly planned for glassware, cups and mugs.  The smaller 4 place setting dishwasher was infinitely better in its plan for stacking the dishes in it."
"This looked to be packaged well, but upon opening there is a large dent in top of unit!"
Worked for under 3 months. Stipped dispensing rinse aid one day and a week later the soap door starting opening toward the end if the cycle. Covering the dishes in soap. I also purchased the warranty and All-State has ignored my issues.
I've had this for 3 months and haven't felt like it's done a decent job yet.  I have to re-wash about half the dishes after every load.  Washing by hand has to be much more sanitary than this... Good luck if you pull the trigger on this buy.
This device worked great until recently the lcd is flickering on and out.  I slam the door to get or to work. And then it works half the time.  Danby said your screwed.
"Well the attachments included with the unit did not attach to my faucet. It has been a huge pain finding the correct ones, and I still am struggling to do so without buying a new faucet. Anyone have an easy solution for this? Danby doesn’t offer any additional connectors for modern faucets."
Quit after 3 months.
The dish washer gets 5 stars but the shipping was terrible
"Mine worked great the first two washes. Then the drain pump stopped draining and I couldn't get the error code to clear. Sadly, I sent mine back."
Cannot be hooked up to most Faucets in the kitchen I had to send this back
Not worth it. First load of dishes came out dirty. Had to rewash by hand. Total cycle almost 2 hours and still dirty dishes?
"This product came broken and with a huge dent on the top, like it had been dropped b4 packaging, the box was perfectly fine"
Defective
Arrived completely dented. Very. Disappointed.
"Love the idea of this, but on average 60% of my dishes come out dirty. Would love some advice."
"This appliance, that I purchased, was manufactured in Oct. of 19.  It was purchased the next month.  Plugged it in & it didn't work.  Since it was under warranty, I had it repaired, & it turned out to be a wire that either fell of, or was never attached to begin with.  Works fine, is quiet & doesn't take up much space.  But hopefully, yours will work when taken out of the box."
"After testing the screen media on the bottom of the unit for Lead (which was positive), I decided to send a sample of the wash water to a lab (only water-no soap was used). With a plastic tub bottom (most of the others use stainless) and the screen media being likely lead based, fully expect the wash water to contain several highly carcinogenic materials. Shame on you, Danby, being one of the highest price points in the Countertop Dishwasher category, taking these dangerous shortcuts is not very consumer friendly :("
"First off, shipping was very quick, the boxing is incredible (with instructions on how to continue unboxing once you open it. It's all very well done. I am a smaller woman (5'2"") and 67 years old. I found it quite difficult to lift it from the floor to the counter, not because the machine is heavy (it isn't), but because it is a lot larger than I expected and it was just plain bulky.All the installation instructions are well written and easy to follow. However, they just say to attach the hoses to the outlets and tighten them. In the past, any plastic nuts I have used tell you to hand tighten, which is what I did. That was a mistake as the water leaked all over my counter, ruining much of the contents of a brand new box of Cascade powdered dishwashing detergent. Luckily, I have both a backsplash and a bullnose on my counter, so the water went no further than my counter. Out came the toolbox, and after a few small turns of the wrench, and I assume that problem has been solved. At least I hope it has.This is NOT a small machine and it is not the space-saving device I had hoped it would be. With the benefit of hindsight, I should have bought a full-sized dishwasher on wheels. I will explain why shortly.OK ... so onwards to the actual use of the DW. As soon as I began loading it for the first time, the very first item I tried to load wouldn't fit. It was a standard-sized 10.5"" dinner plate. Danby advertises that the machine fits 6 place settings. I was in the dinnerware industry for more than 20 years, and a place setting consists of 1 dinner plate, 1 salad/luncheon plate, 1 bread and butter plate, and one cup and saucer. Since it can't fit even one dinner plate, that makes their claim patently false. There is absolutely no way in the world that you could fit 6 standard place settings into this machine.So, I went to Amazon and purchased (6) 9"" salad plates that I intended to use as dinner plates. They shipped me two plates and an obviously USED third plastic/melamine plate (with knife scratches on it) and that bore no resemblance to what I had ordered. After some difficulty trying to actually talk to someone at Amazon, they finally said they would make things right but that I would have to wait a few days as the carrier hadn't yet updated the status of my shipment.Next, my standard-sized 6.5"" round soup bowls don't fit into between all those posts either! I only discovered this after I had already spoken to the lady at Amazon. I had some olives in a bowl and tried to put it in the machine. So I looked at the picture of a loaded basket in the manual and discovered that there are really only 2 spots for standard-sized soup bowls. The other 6 spots are only sufficient for the little 5.25"" bowls that are sufficient for a small snack or mini-desert. I have the tiny bowls and have only ever used them for dips. They are way too small to use as a salad bowl or soup bowl. They would probably be good for the coleslaw you get from restaurants in those small styrofoam containers ... or maybe as a peanut bowl.At this point, I was pretty annoyed, since the 2 items I use twice every single day just don't fit in my rather expensive new dishwasher.But I was determined I was going to make this work somehow and told myself that although not ideal, I would just wash the bowls by hand since the tiny bowls are basically useless for soup or salad.I hate cups and saucers and prefer to use a coffee mug. Naturally, that doesn't fit on the slanted cup racks, so I immediately removed them as they were tacking up valuable real estate inside the dishwasher. I was able to fit one in on my test run ... thank God for small mercies.I put one of my soup bowls that had contained black olives earlier in the day in one of the two soup bowl spots shown in the photo. In the other, I put my small kitchen strainer. I also managed to fit in my small AllClad 1 quart saucepan and numerous knives, forks, spoons, and a spatula. The cutlery fit just fine. Yay!I then referred to the manual to find out how much detergent and rinsing agent to use. Once I had the machine loaded, had the detergent, and everything ready to go, I connected the machine to my faucet and pressed the appropriate buttons. I was gleeful when it started to run and even more pleased when I heard how quiet it was.I  then continued reading the manual, only to discover that the machine has no drying cycle and you have to unplug it from the electrical outlet after every use. That requires that I move the machine, reach in behind the machine to find the plug, do my best to pull it out of the outlet, and then move the machine back into place. They recommend that you leave the machine for 5 to 10 minutes after it has finished its cycle to allow the dishes to drip dry before emptying it. I left it for 20 minutes and I still had to dry some of the plates. The salad/soup bowl that had contained some black olives earlier had a black stain still in the bowl, so I had to wash it by hand.I had just run the machine using the ""normal"" cycle. I always scrape off any leftover food and rinse plates before I put them in a dishwasher, but I guess I didn't notice the small bit of olive juice in the bowl. I do not consider a little black olive juice to be ""heavily soiled"", and I don't think any reasonable person would.  Oh, I had to wash my saucepan again as well, it didn't remove the slightly green waterline caused by boiling peas either.To put it mildly, I am really disappointed. This is a badly designed machine that does NOT have the capacity the company claims, the basket is very poorly designed and it didn't clean sufficiently. Being the neat freak I am, I neatly broke up all the interior styrofoam packaging, slit open the box, and folded it over once on itself in order to put it out to the street for collection with all the other cardboard. Sending it back at this point would be a nightmare as there is no way I could package it as well. If I could, I would! If it hadn't been for the fact that I couldn't put my dishes in it, I would have used it before I destroyed the box and I very likely would have sent it back.At least one of those full-sized dishwashers on wheels would take all my dinnerware and clean it all properly! Needless to say, I do not recommend this machine. I could cry at this point as I have just wasted a lot of money I simply can't afford to waste. This was a birthday gift from my family and I just don't have the heart to tell them what a disappointment it has turned out to be.  :(Unless you and your husband eat like birds and don't use full-sized (adult) dinner plates, soup bowls, and coffee mugs, I suggest you steer clear of this machine."
"Overall, it works. It's a dishwasher. I have a bit of trouble fitting my plates in there, it's a squeeky fit, but it does as advirtised. The only main issue I have is it's filter system. It's crap. You Have to rinse your dishes really damn well. Even if you have sauces that have dried. Because of the design of the hoses leaving the system, debris easily gets caught in the out flow in the hard elbow despite the metal screen it shouldn't fit past. When this happens, the whole system backs up, it shuts down and leaves all the water in the unit which you have to dump yourself to clear the code. This is a messy job! I had to do this twice within the first days of purchasing while I was getting used to it and it dumped a lot of water everywhere! It's an E4 code if you run into it. Easiest way to clear it, open the door and dump as much water as you can into the sink. Spin the rear to the sink and pull off the out line on both ends. Put the opposite end of the clog directly on your tap tightly and turn on the water to have the water backwash and clear the hose. If you go through all this and the system still won't loose the E4 code, tip the dishwasher backwards until it stops draining. It seems Wierd, in flows out of the machine itself, but I got caught up for like 30 minutes trying to figure that out."
"The machine seems solid and can likely run well if in good condition. Mine arrived dented but I decided to give it a try. It worked well for a couple of washes then kept producing an error and releasing water from its underside. On investigating, I noticed a crack on the back plastic panel. I assume may have been dropped while on transit. Would have loved to try a replacement but seemed the only option was a refund."
The pictures on the Amazon posting make it look like you could fit a lot more dishes in it and it has capacity forThis thing does not even fit full-size dinner place without having to run an angle this supposed cup rack what are you talking about like miniature tea cups you can’t put a coffee mug there the rock design is completely ridiculous and too close together so please don’t sit properly it works really well however I’m gonna have to do two loads each time just to do a 6 Person setting it is actually quite upsetting to me soon considering now I’m gonna be wasting double the water running the cycle the pictures are very misleading as to how many dishes can actually fit in this thing otherwise impressed also Amazon is telling that you can use tablets with it of course that comes up on the advertising so I bought them and everybody is saying use liquid not impressed by that either but whatever for the price it does work well I’m just a little disconcerting about false advertising I think they should knock 50 bucks off for everybody that had to deal with us just my opinion As it’s very much false advertising it will not fit full-size dinner plates without them being on an angle and taking up more room  than is necessary
"I have a pull down type kitchen faucet and the adapter to hook up the dishwasher to the tap didn’t fit. The faucet aerator is too small. So, my husband and I decided to buy a new faucet rather than return this huge $500 machine. We went to Canadian Tire and couldn’t find ONE faucet that fit! We tried at least 10 different faucets. The only one it fit was a laundry tub faucet lol.There is another reviewer here who had the same issue and suggested an adapter from Rona that we will try.Just be careful because the statement that it fits most faucets is misleading!Update: we got it to work, loaded it, and the dishes came out dirty! We wanted to test it and see how well it cleaned so we rinsed off food, but didn’t ‘pre-wash’ the dishes. Well, they were dirty. We had to run them through a second time, tbd if that will work."
- i had mine for a year when i had to give up fighting the crazy leaking all over the countertop. It was coming from inside where all the electrical components are. I had had a second hand (actually 3rd hand) Damby countertop dishwasher for many years before it stopped working and it wasn't leaking.- this one looked and felt cheaper from the get go and seemed very much a cheap white labeled product. Waste of money!
"My 1st time owning an auto dishwasher so not sure a countertop would be satisfactory ,however this unit works well ,hope it last me at least handful of years ,wish it was slightly larger inside as one of my plates rubs the rubber seal upon entry. takes a bit of practise to load up ,metal dish tray doesn't seem to be the best design.  Still trying to figure out which detergent works best. if you can get on sale ,might be ok to try otherwise probably best buy a full size model be it portable of built-in 3.5/5 stars for me!"
"1 - Hose fittings on faucet adapter, fresh out of the sealed package were CROSS THREADED onto the adapter, I had to remove them, put in new washers and re connect the se together.2 - 2 tines on the dish rack were broken off, I found them lying in the filter cup on pre use inspection3 - Cutlery basket came with one side of the handle broken off.4 - there was about a liter of water in the unit I had to dump out when it was first unboxed. ( pervious use?? Testing in assembly? )Danby was very un co-operative when called, which is surprising as that I have had and still do have other Danby appliances.Caveat Emptor."
"Sleek looking dishwasher that is compact enough to fit in my 1940s kitchen counter but I must say that I am not fully pleased with how this thing operates. 1 out of 5 times the 1.5 hr cycle will complete only to reveal crusty, dirty dishes and an unbusted pod laying on the bottom or in the pod compartment that didn't unlatch properly or something (I use regular cloarax pods in this thing). It's a mystery how this machine sometimes straight up dose NOT wash anything. Also rusts my knives. The size however is good for two people, our dinner dishes always fit"
"This product works well, but you better put a permanent berm under it because it will leak regardless of how tightly you screw in the supply and return lines into the back. I even put thread sealant tape on the male threads and it still leaks from somewhere. Would not purchase again."
"I like the looks of it, obviously its small just a little to short to fit even my smallest regular plate. Pretty easy set up."
"This little dishwasher was exactly what we needed. It worked flawlessly for a bit over a year, before it kept getting constant ‘E4’ errors and drain itself on the counter it sits on. I scoured forums and reviews for solutions, tried every maintenance suggestion and operational adjustment I could find (lower the water pressure, clean it out more, etc.) but still it would fail and flood the kitchen if not babysat. I’ve given up with it. I’ve had it just under a year and a half now, and I would not recommend this machine to anyone."
Seams to work okay but can no longer use for intended purpose as it was shipped all beat up. The stainless steel skin is very fragile. And wouldnt look good in my original purpose. In regards to cleaning dishes seems okay.
Let me started by saying it took over 1 month to get this item ( WITH PRIME 2 TO 3 DAY DELIVERY) Then our first one came broken either by the mail lady or from storage not sure. After reported this we wore told it be a few days for replacement to arrive which it took another 2 weeks almost .... So finally I got my dishwasher with a little scratch on screen but hey I said to my husband I don't care I'm tired of waiting.... So I set it up and start my first load already disappointed as you can barely fit anything on this small appliance but hey I started dishes .... well let me tell you how much I hate this piece of crab .... it's my 4th time trying to get the same dishes clean even tho I rinse them before with hot water this dishes still dirty ..... OMG DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DANBY DISHWASHER YOU WILL REGRETTED!!! It's the worse so far calling right now because I want my money back not worth the hassle at ALL
"I bought this unit last week. I was very excited and it works well. The description is as it says and the install is super easy. I would wish that the hose that comes with it wasn't plastic, so that lot a bit of points with me.The real reason why this gets 3 stars and not 4, is the way it was sent. I saw some reviews saying that there was some sort of dent on the unit and that's how mine came. This doesn't affect the ability to wash dishes, but where this is more expensive as the lower model, I expected more. If you are not concerned with looks, I would advise to save some money and get DDW621WDB."
I like the compact size... I wish they designed the inside rack like a standard full size... As plates are awkward4to try and put in... I use to own a standard regular dishwasher so not quite sure about why the rack design could not have been the same on a smaller scale. But does clean my glasses but for lightly soiled dishes only.. Pre rinse is necessary before I put them in the washer
"The installation was an absolute headache, & I still cannot install the thing!I purchased this expecting to easily hook it up to my sink out of the box. Yet that was definitely not the case. The in-box adapter does not fit with my faucet, that is pretty standard in my area & finding an adapter for it has been a horrible experience.Even contacting the manufacturer, they literally told me that they cannot help anyone with a sink thats not a ""standard North American faucet"". I am running out of options here & have had a paperweight on my counter for weeks with absolutely no way to use it. Extremely dissapointed in this product & its manufacturer."
"My dinner plates are literally about a 1/2"" too tall for the washer, and there's a good 2 inches between the top of it and my upper cabinets. The side ""cup"" rack also only allows space for a cup that's about 2 inches tall. Which none of mine are. Other than that is cleans very well."
"The product arrived on time. When we opened the box, the inside of the box was wet, instruction manual was soaked and the dishwasher was dented on the outside and dirty on the inside. It was evidently a return. Additionally the adapter that was suggested did not fit the kitchen faucet. Do not want to return due to hassle."
This unit was clearly a used / returned unit and not a brand new unit. Not impressed.
Smaller than something I expected
"BE CAREFUL when looking in to it, make sure that you have the right measurement that can plug to your faucet!I have an old faucet (i'm renting so i can't change it) and we have tried 5 different adapters and none of them fits... it's just there on my kitchen table collection dust because i can't use it :/"
"Was shipped full of water and all the contents inside were soaked, other than that I have found the dishwasher works fairly well. It has gotten worse with time but dishes come out fairly clean."
"Door no longer closes, Danby consumer service has been useless, going on 2 weeks waiting for a solution. Now have a very large and ober priced paperweight."
"Not worth the money.After a few months, it just isn't cleaning dishes good enough. To often I have to re-wash by hand. We kind of stopped using it, and it was just taking up space. We've decided to get rid of it."
"Not cleaning well, iam disappointed."
"I've owned several Danby products in my lifetime, and the rest worked for years but not this one! First load of dishes and alarms were going off, screen was flashing ""E4"", and the unit was humming. after unplugging the unit, I opened it to check filters and hoses, all of which were fine. The machine continued to throw the error, regardless of what I did, so it got returned. I wound up doing my dishes by hand in the sink. These products should be tested at factory before they consume resources to get to my doorstep. Think about that, Danby."
I ordered on a Saturday I got it Monday. it took 3 days to fit it to fit the faucet I had to change me whole faucet. I got to use it Friday and there was no power after I plugged it in. I tried 5 different plugs even plugged in a alarm clock to see there was power. still no power in dishwasher. i tried for 2 days i called amazon for an exchange on this item they said no exchange only refund. I want happy after all that hassle in the whole week.
Badly damaged when received
"My hose connector broke about 2 months ago, I've contacted their warranty support and I STILL DIDN'T RECEIVE IT, after many e-mails exchanged.The machine itself is good, but my customer support experience would make me choose another brand if I were buying this machine again."
"Basically it does the opposite of what one needs it to do. My dishes are still dirty and some of them come out with soap still on them. More than half of the times, the machine malfunctions. The second time I used it, it nearly flooded my kitchen. I'm trying to be patient because I realize it's not a normal dishwasher but this is just ridiculous. Not worth the money."
"I don't know who's dishes are supposed to fit into this thing, but mine certainly do not"
"The only thing I can say about it is this dishwasher is very lazy. I can only wash one small load for every 24 hours, if I try to use it twice a day it just won’t drain the water for the second wash. I used two months after the purchase, so can’t really return it. Try to find support, still haven’t hear anything back from them. Not worth the money and trouble."
"Damaged at arrival and also after doing a firts wash, we discovered that he was leaking from underneath, not even the pipes"
"Bought in October 2022, stoped working in 10 months. Do not recommend"
I just bought this dishwasher and the only thing working is the power button. Everyone is hooked up properly but no water is flowing in nor am I able to even switch any programs. Very disappointed didn’t even get to try it.
Realized after about 2 weeks of owning it. The front door was not assembled properly at factory and is slightly bent
order it... and my post office had to return it because the box was damage...  ordered it somewhere else works fine love it would get it
I am still shocked! The second I opened the box I noticed that the side part was dented. Then I opened the door and saw everything inside was wet! and the water dispenser and the base of the machine was defective and broken. Very disappointed and definitely will return it.
This is my second countertop dishwasher from Danby. Often broken and need frequent repairs. Please avoid Danby products!
Too large for available cupboard space.
"Have not be able to use it yet, because I cannot find an adapter to connect to my kitchen faucet.  Still searching for one."
comes water inside like open box not new .when i try it error code F4  doesn t workmaybe the pump doesn t work
it had two dents on the top and it was wet insideit was not new
"Easy to install, but after every load there is a white powder like substance on the dishes. I’ve tried less / more detergent and rinse aid but nothing helps."
The front door was dented but the shipping box wasn’t.  Bad quality and returned the item.
"If you need to return this, it will take weeks and they will not refund your money for weeks. So, don’t but it unless you’re okay with having $240 of your money unavailable to you for weeks.Aside from that, my friend has one of these and it works great."
Mine is leaking out of the bottom and I can’t figure out why
"This is by far the worst Amazon purchase I’ve ever made. Leaks horribly all over your countertop and as soon as you fill it, it just chunks alllll the water back to the sink. It doesn’t clean very well when it chooses to work, and it leaks every single time I’ve used it. Complete garbage and customer service is HORRIBLE at assisting with a refund. DO NOT buy this."
"So first off. They show off this neat 'mini' dishwasher. Saying it attaches right to the sink! AMAZING.WRONG. It will not fix to any sink. Hate to break it to you, you need a second piece that they don't tell you about until you BUY it and looking through the instructions.So NOW I am having to buy other stuff to just make this work because the price is already INSANE.0/10 do not recommend.Always remember: if it SOUNDS too good to be true? It normally is."
The cushioning on bottom was 1/2 missing which caused a lot of damage in shipping.  The product itself wasn’t put together squarely on the base either.  It’s broken like crazy and now I have to mess with a return.
"Ordered twice and neither one worked. Looking for another brand.Also, the second one that arrived already had water inside as though it had been used already."
The hookup to my faucet doesn't fit. Will be returning.
To small for plates and silverware. Returned
"Dishwasher arrived dripping with water and musty on the inside, box was bone dry"
"It arrived wet and with food in it, disgusting"
"Mine did not fully dry, nor, was there much pressure at all.  The water just “dribbled”.  I ran one load 3x’s, and still, glassware came out cloudy. I rechecked everything.  All assembled properly.  Still, not effective nor reliable at all."
Great product but terrible on believing  Instructions when Receiving it
"UPDATE 9-7-24Close to 2 years later and am very happy with it once I hard plumbed it in. Every time I go to my folks house, (they have a full size dishwasher under the counter) and I've been spoiled with counter height and I don't have to bend over slide out and reach in the back. I definitely don't want a full size built-in again.Before I go into my findings for remote use, meaning not near a sink/drain, here's some stuff to consider.  This is large, the dimensions are in the listing and likely will not fit under the upper cabinets of many many many US homes. It's heavy at 51lbs as stated in the listing.  One more thing you can do, as I did, and read the PDF version of the manual before purchasing which is available in the listing body. Not everything I wanted to know such as hose and cord lengths are even in the manual so I shared that information in text boxes on my photos. You may want to touch the photo for it to enlarge to read or see all the details I shared.  Now onto my experience so far compared to a smaller cube style portable dishwasher which has an onboard tank.  After having a small cube style portable dishwasher I found we don't have dishes piled up and are very good at emptying and loading daily, unlike the full size built in at our old house which was always a crap shoot if the dishes were clean dirty or some of both since it wasn't ran daily.  So when the upper spray bar quit working, I decided to look for a bigger one to accommodate pots and pans that could still be used remotely, and this seemed to fit the bill but about $200 more than the cube one.FYI, I paid $419 with at the time a $30 off coupon and waited 2 weeks for it to arrive.  - 1 STAR- MUST HAVE 2 BUCKETS FOR REMOTE USE, meaning not near a sink/drain  I thought this one would suck up all the water it needs to run a complete cycle, and I could use the same bucket as the waste water catch. That's a big fat NO!  This sucks up water as needed multiple times during a cycle along with draining as needed, so both buckets must be in place during the entire cycle until it ends, and I really mean, until it ends. For instance if you're johnny on the spot after it finishes spraying water and the count down cycle timer still has time left on it. And you decide to pull out the dishes before the timer is zero, well it will drain some more so don't pull out the waste water bucket until the timer is zero!  You MUST use 2 buckets, one for clean water the other for dirty water making this quite the set up and space hogger for remote, not near a sink use. Yes you could put it on a cart and wheel it where needed, which I did a couple of times to see if that worked for me, but found it more of a time waster, space taker and more of a nuisance than just hand washing.  Now the directions when using the clean water collapsible bucket it comes with say to fill just above the 12L mark. This leaves around 1/8"" to the top making it impossible to carry across the room. You'll be investing in another bucket if used remotely, not near a sink. If used in your sink, keeping your faucet available, it's not an issue.  You really should have 2 buckets, with a minimal 3.5 gallon capacity so they don't slosh out when you move them.  - 3 STARS - THE AMOUNT OF SPACE IT REALLY TAKES  The dimensions on the listing are accurate, but if you picked up as I did the 2 different measurements for depth from front to back with the door closed, one is the base or footprint the other includes the thickness of the door which sticks out roughly an inch passed the body.  Well add another 1-1/2"" to 2"" on that, the cord and hoses stick out passed the back since this wasn't designed with a recessed area for them tuck into. It leaves enough countertop in front of it for small tasks, let's say buttering toast, at least on my 23"" deep countertops. If you're like me and have this in a remote corner of countertop with the cord and hoses not only running along the back but also the side, add 1-1/2 to 2 inches to the width to accommodate. As I mentioned earlier this is quite tall and likely won't fit under your overhead cabinets, but if you happen to have high hung cabinetry, you won't be worried about the steam affecting the cabinets if they are around 12"" deep, since the steam vents off out where the door opens at end of cycle and should clear with a few inches to spare.  I shared numerous photos with a 2 liter bottle next to it giving you the idea of it's size.  - 5 STARS - CYCLE TIMES, TEMPERATURE AND WATER USE  There are plenty to choose from so pick what works for each load. This information is straight from the manual and can be viewed via PDF prior to purchase, but I also shared photos of them.  - The water use ranges from 1.85 gallons of water to 2.99.  - Cycle times range from 29 minutes to 150 minutes.  - Water temperature ranges from 122⁰ F to 162⁰ F  I typically use the 58 minute cycle which has no problem removing dried on gravy from breakfast when I run it that night.  -3 STARS - NO HEATED OR FORCED AIR CIRCULATING DRYING OPTION.  As stated in the listing the door pops open about 2"" at the end of cycle, this is optional, to quickly release the steam, hence items that hold heat well , like glass, aluminum and steel, tend to quickly dry, and naturally plastic will still be wet.  Now this is ok if you start the dishwasher before leaving to work or before bed and enough hours pass, allowing natural evaporation to take place, leaving for the most part, everything dry including plastics with only small puddles caught on rims.  If you need to do loads back to back, you will be hand drying droplets on even glass and steel, although my thick stainless steel flatware and thick pots and pans are usually completely dry, as they hold heat naturally and help evaporate water rapidly.  Something I really liked about my cube portable was it offered heated dry or fan circulated air dry, and miss this option on this one.  -4 STARS - NOISE LEVEL  No doubt it sounds like a dishwasher, it's quieter than the full size built-ins we've had, but louder than the cube portable I had. An additional noise you will hear when using the clean water bucket to fill, is the water pump.  If you're standing within 2 feet from it, you'll likely slightly raise your conversation voice. Mine is placed between the kitchen and living room and we don't need to turn up the TV volume or raise voices in the living room or most of the kitchen. It really isn't loud.  - 5 STARS- EXCELLENT CLEANING POWER.  This has enough spray bars to soak and remove everything we've put in, including dried on gravy and a lasagna pan. I have zero complaints here!  - 5 STARS - DISH HOLDING/ARRANGING CAPACITY  Truly some of the reasons I bought this, the upper removable rack, the lower racks ability to fold tines down, the ability to place roughly 12"" tall items, wide rack accommodates pots with handles, although my 12"" skillet with long handle on one side then short handle on opposite side has to go across the bottom rack caddy corner, it's easier just to hand wash.  After you play around with it a few times you'll figure out what fits where around each other.  If you have 10"" plates with 1"" deep rims as I do, the tine spacing is not as accommodating but still doable.  The upper rack fits tumbler lids on the left, lots of flatware in the middle, and smaller tea and coffee cups, pinch bowls or utensils on the right.  -4 STARS - HOSE AND CORD LENGTHS  I give the lengths in text boxes on my shared photos.  When used remotely away from a sink, both the fresh water pick up hose 78"" and drain hose 77"" are long enough to reach buckets on the floor.  By the way the pick up hose is stiff and hard to keep where you need it, also doesn't have an 90⁰ elbow off the back, which it really needs to prevent it from stretching away from the barb it's attached to on the back and prevent leaking, when you have this shoved as close to the backsplash as possible. The corrugated drain hose is similar to all dishwasher drain hoses, only this one comes with a terrible plastic type suction cup to prevent the tip from flopping around. I ended up replacing the suction cup with a silicone one which actually holds in place.  The faucet hook up hose, I hope you don't need to use, is very very stiff and unruly. This is the shortest hose at 60"" of usable length minus the amount needed to clear the dishwasher body which is 9"" to 12"" depending on what side you run it from.  The power cord length is 53"" and has a flat or 90⁰ plug.- 3 STARS- HARD PLUMBED IN. Bye the way,By no means do they advertise this to be hard plumbed in, but after a couple months using it remotely I decided to.  Here are my findings you will definitely want to be apprised of if you go this route.Here's what you need to know if you'll be hard/permanent plumbing it in.  For the water hook up you'll be using the inlet designed to hook to a sink faucet. Well the threads for this hose are NOT standard US dishwasher, which here in the states is the same as a garden hose, the threads on this dishwasher are fine threaded. You might be able to hunt down an adapter to change the threads which accommodates standard US dishwasher hoses, but I had no luck at 2 home and garden centers. Maybe try an actual Plumbing store.  I ended up having to use the hose which came with it, cut the faucet connector end off and using a 1/2"" barbed fitting to convert the end making it possible to hard plumb.As far as the drain hose, I was able to find and install a ""Y"" drain pipe instead of my existing straight pipe to accommodate the hose. Just make sure you use a hose clamp since the dishwasher pumps dirty water out with a lot of pressure, and you definitely don't want water flooding underneath your sink.  Another thing is the water inlet hose which came with it, had a pinhole leak near the threaded fitting, as though it wasn't crimped properly. I contacted Amazon, which they could only offer a return/replace since they don't have spare parts. Then tried contacting the manufacturer, but lo and behold their website has zero ways to contact them, also doesn't offer replacement parts.FYI- I didn't need to use any on/off valve, as the machine already has a valve to control the water flow built in.- 3 STARS- OVERALL TAKE  It's great if you have the ability to place it next to your sink where it will live all the time, and if you use the bucket this leaves your faucet freed up. While I like it's capacity for long handle pots,  It's not set up well for those of us who need it remotely placed away from a sink. I would NOT have purchased it if I had known it doesn't suck up all the water it needs at the same time, hence requiring me to have to use 2 buckets. This is where my old cube portable shines, yes it took 3 trips with a pitcher to fill it's tank, but only 1 bucket and hose sitting on my floor, not 2. I also do not like no recess to accommodate the cord and hoses. So far I've ended up purchasing $20 worth of 90⁰ elbows and tubing to correct the fresh water pick up tube issues, $4 for a suction cup and another $50 in attractive cans, (these are in a a photo in a stackable configuration), these are visible full time in my kitchen, stackable trash bins to use as the fresh water and dirty water bins which are a larger capacity at 3.5 gallons to ensure I don't slosh water everywhere when moving them to fill and empty.  I can't say it's been worth it. It's cost me even more money to work in my space, also it isn't free returns hence I'm on the fence of sending it back. In hindsight I probably should of stuck with the cube style with onboard water tank and just dealt with hand washing pots and pans. Too bad this doesn't have an onboard tank, it would make it even more remote friendly.  It would be great for those who have the space to place it next to a sink. This is designed to keep your faucet freed up by using the fresh water bucket in the sink, but for those of us using remotely, you will be shelling out more money, and figuring a bucket system so they aren't in the way of your walk space.  Hopefully this was helpful!"
"i live in NYC in an apartment with no dishwasher and thought this might be a nice option for when I’m feeling lazy. I’ve been using it for a few months now and i will say it cleans my dishes beautifully. The glass particularly comes out looking shiny in a way that handwashing doesn’t seem to ever achieve. I use the little dishwasher pods and just throw them in. The cycle is fairly long but I don’t mind I just set it and forget it.Key tips - DEFINITELY get a waterproof mat to go beneath the machine - something that has sides and can hold water. I got an undersink mat off Amazon. You will want to catch leaks.The hose for the offshoot water is terrible. Flimsy and leaky as hell. After many headaches I replaced it with a clear flexible plastic hose that I push into exit port (something that snugly fits over the exit port would also work). It’s snug and isn’t going anywhere. I have an hard time understanding why they included an hose that comes off the exit port with the slightest amount of pressure. Anyway that swap seems to have resolved the leaking issues I was having. The clear plastic also lets me monitor the flow of the water out of the hose - anyone who knows fluid dynamics knows that water in a hose is pretty wonky. I affixed it to the side of the machine and have it drain into a bucket beneath my sink because I don’t have the real estate for a big clunky dishwasher to be sitting on my counter.Filling the machine can be a little annoying as well, if you don’t have the direct connection. It takes a lot of water - more than you’d think - and it won’t run beneath a certain level. I would recommend getting another length of plastic piping and affixing it to a funnel that you can run directly from your spout. It’s way faster than filling up a pitcher and trying to maneuver it over the tank. I wish they would have included something like this.Overall, a good machine, I just don’t know that the maker really thought through the more complex piece of running a water-based appliance without attaching it to your plumbing lines - getting the water in and getting that water back out. Both can result in a watery mess if you don’t have watertight connections. It feels like they could improve those bits and make this machine a lot more user-friendly.Alas, when it works it’s great. Saves me effort on a lazy day and provides an out of the way place to put dirty dishes where they won’t attract pests or be an eyesore. I’d recommend it to dishwasher-less apartment dwellers who cook a lot at home and who don’t mind putting in a bit of upfront effort (and maybe a few headaches) in the service of being lazy down the line."
"While the convenience of having a machine do the work can’t be beat, this machine does not work well for baby bottles and pump parts despite having a cycle called “baby care”. The way that the spray arms come from the bottom and the top, if you load bottles on the bottom left, you cannot put bottle nipples or any small pump parts on the utensil shelf or they will not get any water in them plus they will just fall off from the water pressure. I used a dishwasher basket but it’s the same thing - you can’t put nipples on the top if you put anything in the bottom that will block the water from getting in them. I ended up putting bottle nipples on the bottom of the basket (bought separately) so they would get cleaned but they always got jostled around from the water and turned upside down so after the cycle was complete, I’d have to shake out all the excess water and rinse again in the sink just in case the dishwasher detergent was left behind, thus undoing the UV sterilization. Same with small pump parts like duckbill valves - I ended up putting them in upside down in the dishwasher basket just to ensure they would get water inside them but then I would have to flip them back over to get the water out after the end of the cycle and re-rinse them to make sure they didn’t feel greasy inside. Bottles that are put in the corners also don’t get cleaned very well - every single wash, there is always one or two bottles that still have residue inside and I always rinse my bottles before putting them in. Lastly, apparently UV discolors plastic. I did not know this before buying this appliance so my bad, but now my Dr Browns bottles are yellow.This machine is also HUGE. I measured my space to make sure the dimensions online would fit my space before ordering it but even then I was surprised by how big it was. The box says it’s 45 pounds so I couldn’t lift it onto the counter myself being 2 months postpartum. It’s also quite loud if you’re used to having a quiet dishwasher. I couldn’t use the quick connect hose and did the manual water fill option - so while it’s great to have the two different options, filling it up every time was also a pain. It takes 3 and a half pitchers to fill the water tank inside - not a problem for my husband but I am short and the water inlet is at the top of the machine so I had to get on my tip toes and lift a pitcher (with an awkward handle that is not ergonomic) full of water. Again not a problem for taller and stronger people but just FYI for anyone that is short and not very strong (I also have postpartum carpal tunnel).Overall, I am disappointed and I am returning this today - and beware, you can only return it at UPS stores and not the regular Amazon hub counters which I am used to using in my area.I never write these long reviews but I wish I had read this kind of a review before ordering this appliance so I’m leaving this in case it helps any other mama desperate for help with washing baby bottles and pump parts - sorry but this isn’t going to be the best option. I tried using it for a few weeks for my sanity (baby moms will know what I mean), but I just wasn’t confident in safely feeding my baby from bottles and pump parts that were washed in this."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I ordered this in October but did not use until November/December. I bought this to clean baby items. The whole packaging is very heavy btw, once I got it out the box it was still heavy but not so bad. I did not do any heavy lifting while pregnant & set this up 2 months after baby was born, get help lifting if necessary or pregnant. I have had no issues with leaks UNTIL recently. I have used it plenty times with no issues. I had mine on top of my front load washer & had the drain cord go into a bucket. Switched to a top load & needed to move it so made space in kitchen, the second time after moving it to the kitchen it spilled water all over the counter & floor (I’m so so grateful an extension cord & airfryer next to it did not get wet nor the outlet) this time around I unplugged & moved everything on the counter when using it to see what the issue was.Unfortunately I am unable to upload more than one video. I found where the leak was, it is leaking from the drain cord. I will need to contact the company & see about replacing the cord. As you can see in the photo taken immediately after the cycle ending, it retains a lot of water. I don’t mind too much as I just place my items on a baby drying rack & allow it to air dry, this could be tedious if you are tight on space & want things dried. I also only fill water manually through the top but it’s nice you can hook it up to sink if you don’t plan on using sink water for the duration of the cycle you’re using.I suggest making sure your drain cord is facing in the direction you are draining from, I did not let this happen but I could see how the cord could get tangled. I also suggest if you are filling manually & are not by a sink to use two cleaned milk gallons filled with water or water jugs, it uses 1 and 1/2 if I remember correctly. Also note that the detergent is meant to fall out of the little door and into the bottom of the washer. Check the coupon dates as well! The soap coupons do expire, mine expired in December & I didn’t have a chance to use them. After I finished the sample soap I did buy Mollys suds dishwasher soap to use & it seems to be compatible. -6/14/24 I will update my review & date in another paragraph if anything changes or I feel there’s more info you should know before purchasing."
"I bought this machine back on August 2022, and my life got so much better not having to do dishes a million times a day!Anyway, the machine started having technical difficulties on April 2024, it seemed to be the power button, it started not wanting to work until a week later it stopped working all together.I contacted customer service and they said they could help with information even if it was out of warranty (they give you a year from purchase date).  They made me take a video, send receipts, write what was wrong with the machine and the guy on the line said he would be able to give me advice if something was wrong.  Sent the email, and they returned the email back with a one line, no hello, no thank you for contacting, nothing nice except… you’re out of warranty we can’t help you. That’s it, as far as I’m concerned it is still their product and at least be kind and mindful when connecting with customers.Bottom line, get the warranty that will give your product one more year of protection.If you think these machines can be serviced, they can’t, just because technicians are not willing to do it since the part that might be needed are probably going to costa as much as the machine and it’ll take some time to find them and get them plus service.This machines are good until they are not and out to the garbage, which makes you feel like polluting the planet.I can no longer go back to a life without a dishwasher so I bought a new one, with warranty this time. Hopefully it’ll last me more than a year and a half.I would’ve bought it from a different company but I couldn’t find one with the same smaller dimensions to fit  under my cabinets.Moral of the story, single use product, customer service sucks, no way of fixing, but life changer giving you time back from doing dishes."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Foam packaging inside of box was all broken, but original. Dishwasher arrived without any damage. We ran a GLASS cycle, since that’s mostly what we wash frequently in our RV and it cleaned great. We used one Platinum pod (no detergent was included). If you touch the upper door during the wash cycle, the interior light came on which was nice and unexpected. However, the dishwasher and all of the cycles were very loud. When the GLASS cycle finished, the door popped open an inch to allow for proper drying. The dishwasher was very easy to use and did a great job cleaning the glasses. The noise was such a deterrent to us that we decided to return it."
"This has been my most prized appliance. Was purchased August 2022 and worked great until lately. It has been giving error code ""ed"" for the past 2 months (which means communication error) and now the buttons won't press unless you use a ton of force and open and close the door about 15 times. My next countertop dishwasher will have the buttons at the top of the machine. I think that was the downfall here was water getting into the control board of the buttons."
I do like this dishwasher for small loads like after a small meal and a family of two or three because that's about all it fits. If you wash your dishes immediately and you have scraped them out beforehand then it works fantastic. If your dishes have been left for a long period of time and our dishes that tend to have things stick to them after being left out it most likely will not get everything off of them even on the more thorough setting. Also if you have dishes that have been left for a while and smell pretty bad it will apparently hold on to that smell and sometimes transfer it to other dishes you do afterwards and that is unpleasant. Leaving the door open after loads and letting it dry out completely and air out entirely has helped with that particular issue but it still leaves residue if your dishes have been sitting for a little while in say greasy water. Also if you use pods in the washing machine on the short wash setting it will leave soap on your dishes it does not rinse enough to get all of the soap off your dishes entirely so my recommendation is to use a liquid dishwasher detergent for the short loads and the pods for the regular wash cycles. Also the short cycle does not have a drying feature so your dishes will be soaking wet when it's done but it does have an air refresh feature that if you put on with the short cycle your dishes will somehow end up dry at the end. Also sadly I have been informed that I cannot use it in my very regulated apartment so that sucks.
This dishwasher was realllllly amazing up until it broke and started leaking 1 year after I bought it
"The product itself works. My issue with it was that the top spinner kept getting clogged.I contacted Comfee and they agreed to process a refund, since they had 1 year warranty. They told me they sent the check, but it never arrived. I subsequently contacted them 2 more times, both times of which they responded saying they would resend the check. I even tried a different mailing address! Never got the refundAll in all, I think I was scammed by Comfee in terms of the refund policy. They agree to send it and then never do until you give up like I did."
"i’ve had this for almost a year and unfortunately had to be refunded for it because the start button just stopped working. sometimes it turns on and then other times i literally cannot press start. for when i could use it, it washed my dishes great."
"So I purchased this in Feb 2023 and it has not been a smooth ride. As of today it still works, but there’s a lot of issues with this machine and will often not start at all. I at once point stopped using it for three months.If your machine is not starting, here are some tips to possibly get it to start: 1) unplug it and plug it back in an hour later, then try to start it 2)force out all of the water then try to load it with water again 3) open and close the door like 12 times 4) when in doubt, hit it hard. On either side of it, if it doesn’t start I just start whacking the heck out of it and then I am able to get the power button to work againAgain, if all of this sounds annoying (it is), I wouldn’t recommend."
"The Good: This product will clean your dishes. The Bad: It's a very large machine, yet can only wash a small load. The Ugly: It all takes a great deal of time.This strangely huge ""Portable, Countertop Dishwasher"" from COMFEE' -- at over 16"" wide, 17"" deep and 18"" high -- isn't practically portable and isn't likely to fit on your countertop. I had to purchase a rolling cart. Yes, it absolutely will get your dishes clean, but only 4 or 5 dishes will fit.Not only does it take a long time to prep the hose, put in the water and properly position the dishes -- it then takes 2 hours to complete a single wash. Even on the quickest cycle, a wash is 40 minutes. That amounts to about 10 minutes per dish! Once the cycle completes, of course, you have to empty the water and re-secure the machine.It's much ado about very little, but I don't regret this purchase. I hate doing dishes -- plus this machine sanitizes everything and leaves my dishes sparkling clean, so . . . All's Well That Ends Well."
"If you have soft water or want to fill it by hand, it's a great little unit. Not perfect, but it does its job well enough.If you plan permanently plumb it in or add in a water softener, you'll suffer. The connection to the machine is non-standard (it's not GHT, the standard across the board, NPT, or BSP) and the quick release leaks constantly. After a week and more fittings than I care to admit, I finally got a functioning system by just cutting the hose in half and adding new, standard compliant fittings.So, yes, the non-standard plumbing cost this machine two stars, but it's such a terrible decision, and will cause a lot of people problems, especially if they're looking for a semi-permanent installation in an RV or apartment."
Started leaving white residue on dishes and one time didn't turn on until I unplugged and plugged it in. It is a very clutch device however will be trying to figure out the white residue issue. It holds quite enough for out two person household and we run it about twice a day. Still more hygienic than hand washing somedays since it gets the temperature pretty hot.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This mini dishwasher is alright. I love that I can fill it up without having to attach to a sink. That being said, I wish I had paid better attention to the dimensions before ordering. There are a few different brands/models I’ve seen since that are even cheaper and seem to fit more dishes than this one. None of my full-size dinner plates fit into this upright, meaning I have to lean them at an angle to fit, taking away space for other dishes.Again, I knew it was mini, but this one is smaller than I would have liked. I would return it for another if it wasn’t such a hassle. Overall, the cleaning power is good, but I’ve definitely seen better results when using more expensive detergent packs. The fast cycle works well but does not actually dry the dishes, so you still have to allow them to dry afterwards, whereas the long cycle does dry them at the end, but it takes 2 hours and 10 mins overall. Pretty much functions as most normal dishwashers do - load the dishes, add detergent, and start the cycle. There’s multiple other cycle options, including one to clean fruit, but I haven’t used them yet.It was relatively quiet when I first started using it but lately it seems to have a louder whirring sound coming out of the bottom of the machine. That worries me, but for now the washer is working fine so I can get over it. The washer also came with a sample of Finish JetDry but there’s nowhere to put it in the washer itself, so that seemed like a waste to me.If you really only have space for this model, I would say go for it. But if you have just slightly more room, I would opt for another brand/model. This one just seems to be too small and the basket is kind of weird in the way you can arrange things. I don’t hate it, but I don’t really love it either. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"Has been pretty much a game changer as far as being convenient and enabling me to cook more but during a wash cycle last night it threw a e4 error code which according to the pdf has to do with not enough water. Nope, was filled to the required amount before startup. I tried putting more water into it to see what would happen and all it did was drain back out. Tried unplugging and plugging back in. Nope. Same thing. Funny that the extended warranty is for only 2 years for $33 and this only lasted 2 1/2 so even if I had bought that would still be out of warranty. I will not buy this type of dishwasher again and don't really recommend unless you buy knowing its short shelf life."
It worked well up until today.
"I'll give this three stars despite the fact that I did return it. It cleans just fine but leaves dishes so wet that I spent just as much time drying them as I would have hand washing (which boggles my mind because the ""dry"" cycle lasts forever). Ultimately it wasn't worth the space it took up and the time I had to waste drying everything."
"I live alone, and I do a lot of cooking. My house is small, so I can’t have a real dishwasher. Also, because my kitchen faucet has one of those sprayer heads, I can’t hook a portable dishwasher onto it. So I needed something that I could fill with water, and would fit on my countertop. This dishwasher seemed to fit the bill.On the plus side, it actually does clean dishes very well. It cleans as well as any full-size dishwasher I’ve ever used. It runs very quietly, and I like the automatic open function that helps dry the dishes.The negatives? First off, it’s just a little too tall to fit under my cabinet. That in and of itself was not a dealbreaker. It requires quite a bit of water to work. The pitcher that it comes with needs to be filled three times in order for the dishwasher to have enough water to clean. Also, the cleaning cycle is very long. Almost 3 hours! But the biggest drawback, is its tiny capacity. Like I said, I live alone. And even for the dirty dishes that I generate, I have to run the machine twice to get them all clean. That’s almost 6 hours of run time a day! And then I’m still left with my pots and pans that need to be washed by hand.So I guess if you live alone, don’t do a lot of cooking, and really hate washing dishes (or maybe you can’t due to a condition of some sort) this may be a good option for you. Personally, I don’t really see it as a time saving or energy saving option for me. So I’m going to send it back."
"It's bulky and a bit of a pain to use, but it does work like you'd think.Biggest issues are the size, weight, and how long it takes to do dishes. Each load is almost 2 hours, and it doesn't dry as well as you'd hope, though the dishes are not soaking wet after the dry cycle.But it works. It gets off stuck food and does a good job as a supplement to hand washing.Big thing to keep in mind is that it doesn't have any sort of water heater or heating element, the temperature of the water going in is the temperature it's going to be, so I recommend putting in near boiling water just for the piece of mind"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I've run maybe 4 loads in this so far. Uses 2 TBS detergent and NO rinse aid. Everything is clean but not dried. I'm adding water manually, and I just turn the washer so the water drains into the sink, because the first load with the drainage tube attached ended up leaking on my counter. Will likely be returning. My flatware knives don't fit well in the utensil rack, it doesn't dry hardly at all, and I'm seeing other models cheaper that have actual drying cycles."
I really do like this dishwasher but I hate that it doesn’t dry the dishes even when you put it on to dry them.  You need to open up dishwasher to air dry to get the dishes dry.  That’s why I gave a 3 star cause it’s really annoying that it leaves the dishes soaken wet.  And that I have to dry them all and it important to also dry the dishwasher too
"Updated Review:  I noticed on the first use that that top ""spinning"" thing where water comes out would spin the stop, then spin and stop spinning.  I thought maybe this was how it worked.  But then on the second use, the top spinner was spinning fine.  Well, this morning I put my new corelle dishes in for a quick clean and the top spinner didn't spin at all, and water was dripping from the bottom of the door.  Sadly, after speaking with customer service my only option is to return the unit for a refund.  Not an easy task because i'm disabled so my son will have to help me pack up the unit for UPS to pick it up.Original Review: So, I'm not thrilled with the purchase, but I'm not upset either.  I should have read the manual before I purchased it.  It takes 2 hours for a normal wash which includes the dry function - OMG seriously??? This is a fraction of the size of a normal dishwasher and you expect me to run it for 2 hours?  I opted for the rapid wash which took 40 minutes - guess what, no dry function with this option.  Ok, I let my hand washed dishes air dry no biggie.  Well, even 4 hours after the wash was done and the door was left open the dishes were still wet.  Anyway, If you have larger dishes this will not hold 30 items.  I was able to fit 1 large dish, 1 cereal bowl, 4 coffee mugs, one small drinking glass.  I also used the cutlery tray and was able to get 4 spoons and 3 forks on the rack.  Upside is dishes all came out clean.  I cut an eco friendly dishwasher tablet in half.  I think in the future I'll just use a few drops of Dawn as others have commented that they use.  I am considering doing a return because I found another unit that has better cycle options and a separate dry option.  Not sure what I'm going to do."
"I bought this so I could wash pumping parts and baby bottles without having to hand wash them all the time. It does great at washing them. Things came clean very effective in that manner, however drying them not so much. I understand they have a different shape to them, but everything was still soaking wet, so I ended up having to let it dry for several hours or put it in the sterilizer to dry it. It doesn’t have an heating element like a normal dishwasher so I don’t know if that’s part of it. It also doesn’t have anywhere to put rinse aid which I know help dry stuff too."
"This is a love/hate review. When it worked it was great, it did what it needed to do and it was such a great convenience and worth taking up the counter space as I live in a small studio apartment. The utensil rack wasn't in the best setting though, bigger porcelain spoons would fall off and break, sometimes items would slide off onto the floor (not that big of a deal though because again, it did what it needed to do and I got cleaned dishes). A year and a half in, the buttons stopped working. I could plug it in and the lights go on but the power button didn't work anymore. Most technicians only work on traditional dishwashers, and I didn't want to call the technician that Comfee recommended due to super low reviews. I found a video of a guy who showed how to dissemble it and I managed to get the door off the hinges and I found the wires connecting to the circuit board of the control panel was damaged, I'm no expert but I guess that stopped the buttons from working. I have an old iphone charger cord with wires sticking out like nobody's business and that still works, but the same can't be said for Comfee. I am weary of Comfee products now and will buy another countertop dishwasher from another brand."
"UPDATED REVIEW:Came back to update that this model was good while it lasted, and it only lasted about 6 months before it persistently started flooding and throwing error codes, and stopping mid-cycle. I managed to use it for another 6 months before I'd have to drain it before every cycle, and eventually it couldn't finish a single cycle. I tried contacting the company for repairs to no response, and could not successfully find a way to use the Amazon extended warranty either. So, that was a waste of money. So sad that this ended up being essentially a disposable appliance.---ORIGINAL REVIEW:What I love: almost everything. It works great as a single person living in a small space with no dishwasher. I'm neurodivergent and dishes are one of the things that saps all my energy, so I use the Comfee for all of the little items that take the longest to wash. It saves me so much brain space and cleans really well. I've used it for four months now with no issues at all. Was easy to use out of the box.What is tedious: I had to take off the rubber feet in order to get it to fit underneath my cabinets (and this was the only portable dishwasher on Amazon that would fit.) It's annoying day after day filling up a jug three times to enter the water and it does take up some valuable counter space, but it saves me so much brain space it's worth it."
This one is so bad in quality. I got a new one and it broke within a week?
The measurements on Internet are not correct. Height is  18 inches. Not 17.25.  Can you please tell the height without the rubber washers on it.  Thank You.
"This dishwasher was bought to wash bottles and pump parts daily. It’s great, and has good capacity, I like that you can refill water into it. It does leave a lot of water spots. I do not overfill and use one small soap pod of dapple, and  experiencing leaking :( not thrilled about that and makes me question longevity."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            ⚠️ UPDATE :( :(.  Purchased July 2024, it’s now, October 2024) I was in love, when it worked it was wonderful, but it got stuck on error code e4, there is no reset button, after unplugging multiples of times and trying the 3sec cancel button multiples of times, I called the manufacturers help line, followed all representatives instructions that failed, was advised to take pictures of serial number, log into Amazon to get actual receipt (proof of purchase) it shows if unit was brand new or used, I had unit removed, after several hours of waiting for reply to email, I called again only to find out 1st rep didn’t get my email correct, then I was told to take a picture of the error code 😕😡 well why didn’t the 1st rep know this?Now I’m being told I can’t get it replaced because I was given bad information by the company’s representative….I still think it’s a great little space saving unit for RV’s, tiny homes, etc..  WARNING ⚠️ ⚠️⚠️ if you have a problem within your warranty period double check on what info they need and do not dispose of the unit until you have been assured your replacement is on the way!1st review.I travel frequently in my motor home, I travel alone, and it’s perfect for one, I place breakfast, lunch, supper, whatever that days dishes were, in a bowl of hot soapy water, after relaxing for a bit, when I’m ready for bed, I load the dishes, actually love the ever so light sound it makes, not loud enough to interfere with tv, music, or conversations, I wake up the next morning :) with no dirty dishes. I would highly recommend, gift if appropriate, if you’re thinking of gifting be sure the size will be okay, I am happy that it sits on my counter top and I am thrilled with every inch of space I gave up to have this, I already know, I’ll never be without a counter top dishwasher again …. Love it !!!"
"Got one for my friend last year. It was really good while it lasted, but it broke after 10 months."
I bought this to clean my bottles and pump parts. After a couple weeks it stopped working. Wouldn’t start a new cycle or drain the water from the cycle it stopped working during. I had to hand drain the water from the dishwasher and still couldn’t get it to start working again. Waste of almost $300.
"I bought this dishwasher five months ago, and was instantly in love. I haven’t had a dishwasher in six years, and was ecstatic to take some extra work off my plate. It didn’t clean as well as a traditional dishwasher, but it did a decent job, and made my life a lot easier.Flash forward five months. I get an E4 error, I drain the machine, clean it, think everything is fine. The machine still won’t work, but now it’s an E3 error. I ended up using dish washer cleaning tablets and even unscrewing part of the drain area to ensure there’s no clogs. I did this several times, found nothing, it still won’t work. The water won’t heat up, so I’ve been using warm tap water. The top sprayer won’t spin either, so nothing is getting clean.Today, I go to run the dishwasher because the little cleaning it provides is better than nothing. I go to the living room, and come back to find my kitchen covered in water. The dishwasher spewed dirty water everywhere out of the bottom of the machine. It completely ruined the shelving unit I bought specifically to hold the dishwasher, and my floors are damaged.It’s only been five months. I’ve spent hours trouble shooting this, and it’s broken in multiple different ways that I cannot fix. It’s so faulty that it’s damaged my other property. This was a huge splurge for me to buy, I’d been expecting it to last years, and I only got five months out of it"
"When hooked up to faucet, washer will not take water. Top washer spinning wand doesn't spin. Washer is supposed to beep when tank is full. It doesn't. Contact with customer service is unsatisfactory as the connection to whatever part of the world is bad and the service person doesn't speak English very well."
"I bought this dishwasher on August 24, and by November 23 it's already stopped working! I haven't even finished paying it off, or even thrown out the box yet, and I already need to replace it.Not that it ever worked well to begin with. Sometimes - not always, but sometimes - it makes a very loud hum that can be heard in the hallway outside the apartment. The sprayers don't cover the entire compartment, so only about half of its already-limited capacity will get clean. It doesn't have a compartment for rinse aid, so no matter how little soap I used, the dishes always came out with a salty detergent residue crust, so I have to run it a second time with vinegar to wash that off.A couple weeks ago it started randomly shutting itself off mid-cycle; at first I thought it might have been some kind of overheating protection, but now I see some detergent/vinegar crystals around the seam at the bottom of the door, meaning it isn't sealed properly and water is shorting out the power button (which, of course, is a cheap touch control, rather than a proper physical button)."
"I was fairly happy with this washing machine upon purchasing due to it's small size and good washing quality. However, only a mere year after initial purchase I am already experiencing serious malfunctions. The washing machine stops working mid-wash, with all of the dirty dishes still inside, and all of the cleaning liquid pooled on the bottom. When I attempt to remedy the situation by unplugging the dishwasher and cleaning out all of the dishes and the water manually, this resets the washing machine but the problem just occurs again the next time I am trying to do a wash. I live by myself and don't overload the machine. One year is not a good enough life-cycle for a product that costs almost $300. It should not have broken down this quickly and speaks to the low quality of the parts and/or engineering that went into this product. Would not recommend to someone looking for a decent quality tabletop dishwasher.EDIT: If I could rate this review at 0 stars, I would. Contacted Comfee support to request for assistance in fixing my issue; they did not even bother to suggest possible troubleshooting steps and flatly informed me that since the product was recently out from under the warranty (by a few months) they would not be taking any action to help me and told me to go screw myself. NEVER BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS BRAND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE RIPPED OFF WITH NO RECOURSE"
"It's completely dead after 9 months of use. I first encountered an issue after running only a couple loads with E4 error. The manual states to contact the manufacturer for repair replacement so I did. They simply said to return it to Amazon. This was not an option as the price had since increased and I'm not paying more for a replacement that should have worked in the first place (really getting sick of this bs with Amazon and their sellers). After some thorough googling, turns out it's just a design flaw and you have to manually tilt the unit backwards every so often to drain excess water and the E4 code disappears. Of course they wouldn't tell me that in hopes that I would re-order at a higher price point... sleazy.Other than dealing with E4 it worked as expected most of the time except every few weeks the start button would stop responding until you unplugged the unit for some time and re-powered it... Well that happened again yesterday but after multiple attempts with no luck, now the entire display does not come on and none of the buttons work. It's full of water without no way to run it... it hasn't even been a year and it's had multiple issues and already completely failed. I see now the price is almost $100 more than what I paid 9 or 10 months ago, what a joke.. avoid this overpriced junk."
"Is a common problem others have reported too - comfee needs to fix panel durability, or use manual buttons, or make replacements for the part washer. Otherwise works great for not too many dishes!"
"I bought this because I’m barely ever home. bought last week and opened today I'm trying to figure out what's going on.. so I did everything right before I started reading the manual twice before I put the water in. I seen the water fill at the bottom of the portable dishwasher and heard water running and the top and bottom starting to spin it then shut down flashed E4 and leaked everywhere! it went all over me, all over my cabinets inside and outside, and all over my floors! I contacted comfee myself and they said they don't have nothing to do with it I would have to call Amazon. The manual says they can have someone come out a fix it but that’s not true they only come out for built in under the counter dishwashers. Amazon said I would need to leave my package out on Monday for UPS at any time to pick it up I kept asking for a supervisor but they kept telling me that this is what they offer and they demanded they would disconnect the call. So I now as of today would have to leave my package out in the open hoping no one would steal it thanks to this two companies. I’ve been a loyal customer to Amazon and after this I’m never ordering from this again I’ll just go to Walmart!"
"The first time I ordered it, it got lost by the transportation team or got damaged in transportation and they refunded me after I waited two weeks for it. I waited a month and then ordered it again. It arrived and is quite heavy (as described) and I ended up having to place it away from the sink due to my cabinets being too low, so the fact I could pick any outlet and have it use it's water tank and empty in a bucket was great. However after less than three months, it had an electrical issue with the front panel and could no longer turn on or start running. Thankfully it does have a one year warrantee automatically with the manufacturers. I celled them and we determined this wasn't an issue they could help me figure out how to fix on the phone and they offered me a full refund.Like I said, customer service was great, but in the end it was more hassle than it was worth in my personal experience."
"I had the highest hopes. Door broke during a cycle, crashed open. Comfee customer service approved a refund, 14-21 days. I waited 21 days, contacted them. They said sorry someone never sent out the check. So im approved and its going on three days later and still the check is not sent out in the mail. Just messy and a hassle. Get one that wont break easy."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was so excited about this mini dishwasher, I live in a small place and I work and study so I have very little time to do house chores. Already in my first time using it the machine it  stop working mid cycle and sometimes  even in the beginning of cycles, it would end up leaving the dirty water  in the bottom of the machine.  The product  would simple not work sometimes or start out of the blue by itself making lots of noises “clicking random in buttons “, I wouldn’t even be able to stop that, soon enough it stop working at all, the light inside the machine would work but non of the functions or the buttons could be pressed. I contacted the brand to see if they could help with some solution, they didn’t offer me much of help just said I should return the product. I contacted Amazon to see what could be done and the frustrating part is after they delivered it in the wrong building( it’s a very very heavy box for one person to carry by itself ) , they told me I needed to return this product by myself so I would have my refund after possible 30 days. I was shocked, all I wanted was an exchange for a functioning machine but they refused, just refund. So I had to purchase another machine, meaning had to give over 500 dollars  for this thing until they decide to give my money back.! The only reason why I repurchased is that it’s the only counter machine that actually fits the space I have, the few times it worked a little longer I could see that would do the job. I am really frustrated how they handled the situation being they send me a defective product. The video I attached is the same I sent to the brand."
"I had really high hopes for this dishwasher but after having it for 2 months I unfortunately have come to the conclusion that this was not worth the money.I live in a very small studio and was excited for a bigger portable dishwasher after my farberware dishwasher stopped working.Nothing on the top rack gets properly cleaned and I more often that not have to run a cycle at least twice to get anything overall cleaned. Using different detergents made no difference I think the jets must be very very weak. At this point I expect to still have to clean my dishes a little before they can actually be set to dry.Speaking of drying… I thought it wouldn’t be too big a deal to have things solely air drying but with the price point I think having a drying function should’ve been included. It’s certainly a feature that I miss from my other dishwasher.So far I just set everything to the hygiene cycle in the hopes the high temps will get things properly cleaned but even with that setting things aren’t coming out as clean as dishwashers in the past have gotten my dishes. This cycle makes the dishes dry faster is the only other upside.I think it’s overall a good concept but needs significant improvement. I’d urge anyone interested to look elsewhere.***UPDATE***After over 6 months of use and attempts to salvage this thing I think I’m ready to give up and throw this thing in the trash.This thing now leaks and I’ve had to put towels under it whenever in use. The water hose that’s supposed to take in water is constantly falling out. I also had to get a different bucket to hold the water it would intake because the one they give you you basically have to fill it to the very top where it’s close to spilling and even then it’s not always enough.I’ve had to do other things in attempts to work with the machine that I won’t go into detail because it’s ridiculous.This thing was supposed to make my life easier and it’s honestly made things harder. I’ll happily hand wash until I can save up to buy something, anything better."
"There aren't many counter top dishwashers out there and it seems like they are all poorly designed and not very effective.  The wash cycle is also super long for such a small load.  It takes about an hour and only washes a few dishes and a handful of silverware.  I could wash 10 times as much by hand in half the time... and my dishes would actually be clean.  I wish a reputable company like Panasonic or Bosch or GE or LG.  I don't have any LOVE for those companies, but at least the products they sell tend to actually do the basic thing that they were sold to do.  This one doesn't.  It was so heavy that I didn't return it, but I should have."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I bought this machine on January with the purpose to wash my babies bottles.  I had the hose from the machine to my sink to drain the water. There’s an option to connect the water line but I didn’t, I just put the water myself using the small bucket. However, after just one month it started giving me error messages. When I searched up the codes it meant it needed to be drained. Which I did. The issue was resolved. Then it started leaking from the front. Which makes it inconvenient ."
"tl;dr version: leaks from inside the machine through the bottom. Don't buy this. Common problem in the reviews.Long version:I bought this dishwasher because we moved into a home without one. Its just the two of us so we didn't need a full sized unit. I got it in the evening and opened it right away. I followed the directions and did everything I was supposed to do to set it up. I didn't use the water line hookup because our kitchen faucet doesn't fit it correctly so I used the top fill method.I immediately noticed water on the counter coming from the underside of the unit, before I even turned it on. I thought maybe it was just some spillage or something so I loaded it up and started the cycle. It told me I didn't have enough water in it already which was weird but I filled it up again anyway.Let me tell you that my floors were wetter than the dishes because the water just consistently poured out from under the machine. I looked underneath to figure out where it was coming from and all I could see was water coming from inside and through the bottom pan.I googled and looked for troubleshooting tips which said that it could have been overflow from the filling process. I unscrewed the bottom pan and dried it out and drained the water completely...as much as possible.Tried to fill it again and use it and the same thing. Then started getting error E4 and it just drained all the water out because it showed an overflow again. Water is everywhere...the counter, the floor, in the sink, and no amount of paper towels or towels could keep up.I finally went on here and looked more closely at the lower rating reviews and others have the same issue. Not just my machine.There is a defect in the manufacturing process with COMFEE and they need to address it immediately.Do not buy this machine. Unless you need to mop your floors because thats all its good for...getting your floors wet.I sent it back the next day and will not buy this brand again."
"This has been my only experience with this machine.  The book says the only way to fix this is to call for service.Amazing.Edit: After being told by support to return it, I just removed the drain hose and tipped the unit backward to drain the water out, now it's working fine."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I hate that this has touchscreen controls. Sometimes the dishwasher won’t turn on and it seems to be because the button isn’t registering the touch. I’ve been using it for 3 months and this started happening about 2 months in. I’ve tried unplugging and replugging into different outlets. Sometimes that helps, other times it just won’t turn on and I have to hand wash everything.Another annoying thing about this dishwasher is that after using it a few times, the tank suddenly requires more than 5 liters of water before the icon + beep will go off. It takes about 6 liters now.I use this dishwasher to wash baby bottles, pump parts, and small toys sometimes. When it works, it gets the job done. If you’re planning to use this dishwasher for baby items, it’ll take a while to figure out a configuration that works. Smaller parts will fall through to the bottom. If something blocks the lower arms at any time during the cycle, you will end up wasting 2 hours and 5 liters (or more) of water because things won’t get cleaned. I ended up buying a dishwasher crate to hold small items, which really helps, especially since my baby only likes the annoying Dr brown bottles that have a million little parts. Even with the crate in there, the dishwasher is still able to hold all the bottles I need to clean at the end of the day.The spot where dishwashing liquid/pods go is weird and confusing. It’s just a little rectangular slot. Pods fall into the bottom anyways so I don’t see the point of it. I use seventh generation pods with this dishwasher and it works great.For anyone considering a tabletop dishwasher for baby bottles, it really does help. Just don’t get this one cus it might just crap out on you for no apparent reason."
"Not as good as the novete dishwasher. Has less space inside, the silverware rack makes loading the washer really odd, control panel not very intuitive, louder and the chime is more annoying."
"I just received the item a week ago.  I live in a small home  with an even smaller kitchen.  I hate hand washing dishes.  I'm so sad that I have to return this item in a few days. I used Dishwasher on 4 occasions since receiving it, and each time it leaked underneath  the unit on all 4 occasions.  My method of use was draining it in a 5 gal paint bucket.  I checked the drain hose to make sure it was secure to back and even tried to tighten the clamp again.. nothing helped.  I'm not sure why it is leaking underneath.  Will be returning next few days.  Really wished for it to work out.  I got it on Amazon prime days Sale.. So disappointed. I don't have marble countertops so even though I put a towel underneath  to soak up water after a cycle  it was soaked.. I don't want to ruin my Laminate/wood Countertop.  It's a Heavy Item so if it's sitting in a wet situation for a normal cycle it eventually will warp my Countertop if I dintlift it up each time to put a new dry towel  underneath."
This dishwasher worked great for a few months. It cleaned dishes well and we never had issues. One day it just quit working altogether. It turns on but won’t actually run a cycle. We’ve troubleshooted but nothing has worked. Super disappointed because we haven’t had it long.
"June/2023 Works great, gets dry food off good, just make sure the dirty bowls/cups are upside down, the bottom sprayer is stronger and use liquid detergentThis is great and hasnt raised my water/electric bill.If you have a small kitchen and hate washing dishes like me this is for you, I keep mine in my laundry room and I have the hose out the window and I pour the water inI would provide a picture but it won't let meEdit: 12/28/23 I've had this since July and only had a error code once that was easy to fix, it's great I highly recommend itEdit: 2/2024 the buttons have started malfunctioning and hardly work I have to unplug and plug it in multiple times before it works unfortunately so I'm knocking off a star9/24 i have stopped using it, no longer cleaning dishes well, cant by replacment filters ive been using a sink strain and the machine is darn near uncleanable so it smells awful. Good for a time though"
"I was a little unhappy when I first recieved this product, as the amount of dishes I could fit in it was pretty low. Also, I have only 1ft X 1ft of total counterspace in my kitchen, so I wanted something I could easily put away somewhere when not in use. It's pretty heavy for something that doesn't wash a lot of dishes. It does wash them well though, I'll give it that. However, I can only figure out how to use one cycle, and it the normal cycle takes 2 hours, including dry time. The drying cycle is pretty pointless, because the dishes aren't even remotely dry when they come out. But the final straw for me is that it only lasted about 6 months before it started leaking all over the place. I'll be looking into a larger roll away dishwasher next. Hopefully it will be better quality than this"
"I have used this for a little over a year. Paid $300. I have only ever used this for baby bottles.It’s not very quiet honestly it’s kind of obnoxious. Also, the inside plastic rack has started to chip apart/melt and rust. Not good. I’m gona have to buy a new one and do my research on a better brand.For $300 this should last you well over 1 year.Seriously don’t waste your money.Also sometimes it will randomly shut off in the middle of a cycle. I only ever used the hygiene cycle because it’s baby bottles and i want them cleaned and sanitized properly. (rarely but STILL happens occasionally).I have always kept the door open after a cycle and in between cycles because I’m pretty OCD when it comes to moisture and air flow ( deadly terrified of mold). So i know rusting isn’t from user error. Seems like a quality issue."
"It's decent and compact, and can really fit for two people, HOWEVER there's major upkeep downsides. If you use dish powder, the machine gets clogged. The hose is prone to falling off and unsealing, and you need to place the dishwasher near a drain because the house is, at best, a countertop distance to the sink. After having, and using consistently for months, it's really not worth the cost. You can get a decent dishwasher for a little more than this. Save your money and spend it on something better."
"It cleans alright, water pressure is pretty unimpressive with adding it to the top of the dishwasher. Very heavy, doesn’t fit a lot of dishes."
Product was very easy to install and the instructions were written well. I don’t think it’s the best quality. It dosent clean dishes as well as I would like and I don’t think it’s a good value for the money. The performance is lacking for me but it does have a good drying time.
Make sure every clears top and bottom. Not a very strong jet stream.
"This dishwasher I don’t know where to start . The first wash was ok . A full wash is 2 hours and you have to use it twice a day because it’s small . So the energy guide says 17 a year but that equates to 34 a yearThe top spray arm is so sluggish but your dishes will get clean and somewhat dry .The second day the top spray arm completely stopped working I called tech support after reading the manual I could not remove it to see if food or something had stopped it. Tech support oulfnt help they had no information about removing the spray arm .A few hours later I called Amazon they said I could return it so I was more than ready to do so. After that my handy man stopped by and I was telling him the problem and he looked in and figured it out you have to unscrew it then pull it down it has little nodules on there. You would think one sentence about a lack luster product could have been put in the manual .The next morning i called Amazon and told them we had got it back working so I kept it.Actually the one redeeming quality is it fits under my counter . I had another brand that lasted me 12 years! Unfortunately Amazon doesn’t sell it anymore and I really wanted the top sprayer and clear window . Aesthetically, it’s very nice looking like a 80s portable television set and if you get past the sluggish spray arm  It’s OK , it gets the job done but it’s like just adequate and I can work with it. If it last 6 months I’ll be surprised but in the mean time I’ll be saving my money because I don’t trust this thing. That’s my honest review it gets 2 stars in my book"
"Bought it, used it once and the water came out all of the seams. Returned immidiately."
"I so badly wanted this to work for my pump and bottle parts. I've been hand washing and sterilizing for 7+ months and am desperate for a solution. $300 felt like a steal when considering all the man hours and wasted free time I've spent soaking, washing, drying and sterilizing parts. Some of my larger 9oz bottles weren't cleaned all the way, and despite using the highest drying setting everything was left with watermarks. This is going back."
"I loved the fact that it was small enough to fit on my countertop- I have a baby so I wanted something I could rely on to get his bottles clean & sanitized. Unfortunately, there have been very few loads that I did not have to wash after using the dishwasher. Yes, I know how to properly load one, I never have any food particles on my dishes but I clean the filters after every wash anyway. The main problem is it doesn't get hot, doesn't dry. It used to dry when I'd use the hygiene cycle, but not anymore. The instructions say to open the door ""slightly"" to let things dry- there is no ""slightly"", it's up or down. I'm going to keep trying because I'd love for it to work, it cost a pretty penny, and has yet to really save me much time. At all. Takes over 2 hours to wash. So, I guess it wasn't really a smart move on my part."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is an excellent dish washer however, it makes an awful noise starting at around the 3rd use for me. Haven’t had it long & I’d hope the kinks would work out by now. I hope it will continue to work well.  I’d increase my rating if they contact me about how to improve the noise."
"I was so excited to get this for my small apartment and I it worked great for the first 5 or so times I washed dishes with it. One night I loaded it up and about halfway through the cycle it beeped and showed an E1 error. In the user manual this indicates that it wasn't getting any water from the water source. I used the tank and it was completely full when I started it so I just topped it off and tried again. This time the washer made a noise like it was trying to pull water from the tank but no water came into the main washer area and the E1 one error showed up again. I tried several troubleshooting techniques, (including hooking it up directly to the faucet), but I was unable to get ahold of anyone for further troubleshooting. I ended up requesting a refund and sending this back to Amazon. When it works this little machine is great but unfortunately for me I got a dud. I suggest keeping your packaging in case you need to send it back."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this September 2022, so I’ve been using it for a little over a year. Haven’t had any issues with it until now (Of course when the warranty is up). Tried doing a load of dishes and some of the buttons won’t work. Tried unplugging it a few times and turning on and off and finally got it to start on the rapid cycle. About five minutes into the load, it stops and the screen shows that I need to add more water. So I added more water. Now the buttons won’t work again. I guess if you only want to use this dishwasher for a short while it’s fine but I don’t recommend it for the long run."
"I bought this but ended up returning it. It worked well, but made a rattling noise. It also does not dry the dishes. I ended up buying the same brand, but one that had the drying function."
"I can see a lot of potential this has especially if you have a small apartment, need an extra hand, camping, etc, it works well for us the only thing is it doesn’t dry very well even with the door left open and the fan going alllll night it just doesn’t dry, but if you take out the tray and use it as a drying rack on the count or in the sink after it’s done washing it’ll take care of that problem."
"UPDATE, the buzzing stopped and now half the buttons quit responding, NOT HAPPY!!!this is a good little dish washer but it BUZZES & HUMS until i tap on the side. then it is a little tall and only leaves 3 inches under my top cabinet to fill the water so i trimmed the side filler to stay on the washer and used a sort of playdoh to seal around it when i fill it from my spray nozzle sink faucet."
"We loved this and used it for baby bottles only. Didn’t have a complaint besides it doesn’t dry well, but we just had a solution of taking the bottles out and having them air dry. It’s only been 5 months and it just died and threw and Ed error! Contacted customer service and they have zero solution for it. It’s a communication error. I’m hesitant to even buy another with the refund even though they said it’s not a common issue of the product or model. Disappointed to say the least."
I bought this because I have a new born baby. I have used to wash Baby bottles and small dishes  for 10 times so far.  Good thing is it clean very well of glasses.  Glasses are shiny and clean.  The bad thing is baby bottles are still wet and you can see water stains.  So I say this little machine is good for small dish wash but not for baby product.
"It comes broken inside, it is functional but I start the return because the problem is water leaking."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            after 2 uses, it doesn't work anymore  it doesnt start and buttons don't work"
"Worked perfectly for some time.  Then a few months in, the washer would stop 10-15 minutes in to the cycle and shut off. Requires manually unplugging it from the wall, draining, and refilling it to get it to work again. Then it either works, or goes into this cycle again. No rhyme or reason this happens, it just does. The line is cleared, the filter is empty, and all possible checks are done to make sure it operates. When it works, it cleans everything perfectly, but for the price point it should be working every time."
"I cook a lot so purchasing a dishwasher is to relieve myself from an extra task. The machine is very heavy. It fits my counter top. I pour the water into the machine instead of connecting to a hose; not feasible. I use a small amount of dish detergent instead of buying dish detergent pod which is more expensive. Don't put too much soap otherwise it won't rinse thoroughly. When use, I use rapid mode - 40 min. If you use the regular mode, it will takes 2 hours to complete the wash cycle. It fits a few small items but definitely not big pot or pan even if that is the only thing you put inside. It is best to rinse out food residue from your dishes before put them inside the washer. If someone is doing heavy cooking, this machine won't be a help as it only takes a few items."
"Seems like this would work well if it didn't leak everywhere...Water immediately poured out from the broken filled reservoir inside, flowing from the back bottom.  Thanks for checking your returns for quality and wasting my time."
"It was the perfect dishwasher for our tiny kitchen. Purchased in November 2023, but in October 2024, the buttons do not work and we cannot start the dishwasher. Disapointing for the amount of money spent on it."
"This dishwasher works great BUT in one spot it says it takes max 10 inch plates and in another it says 10.5. My plates happen to be 10.25 inches and most dinner plates are 10.2-10.5 so if you don't want to have to spend 40-60 dollars on all new plates just to use it then measure first. My Corelle frost whites do not fit and even leaning they stop the top water feed from moving at all. Other than that, I have run it three times so far and it cleans dishes well on the normal setting. The suction cup for the water outlet holds well in the sink. Thinking I should have sized up to the next bigger Comfee countertop and probably will after this one is at the end of its life. As a single mom with just one child this helps me a lot. It holds one days' worth of dishes for my son and I and saves me time from handwashing."
"I almost never write product reviews but this one I feel I need to do my due diligence to warn other shoppers of what happened.First of all its not nearly as spacious as it is made to seem. I could only fit a few items in there. And it takes still a decent amount of time to fill it up manually by water. I was thinking that I could save time by using this but you have to manually fill it with about 4 full pitchers of water. If you have low cabinets like me, then its really hard to do so too.The MAIN ISSUE is that it BROKE WITHIN 2 WEEKS. It just said E4 error on the front of the machine. I looked inside the manual how to fix it, it says that you have to call customer support and someone will come down and fix it. I called them. They said that they dont have anyone to come and fix it and the product is just defective and I will have to send it back. Well I already got rid of my box so I had to go find another huge box to fit it in, which was a hassel in of itself. The dishwasher overflowed and also led to a situation where I had to clean up a big mess.AVOID THIS PRODUCT unless you want to risk it just randomly deciding to stop working and then find yourself in a situation where customer support  doesnt want to help. Thankfully Amazon itself helped me resolve  the issue but I don't recommend using this company."
"I hoped this product would help save me some time from doing dishes.  Instead, it has wasted a great deal of my time as I tried to make it work.The first major issue I encountered was that it is very, very loud.  The unit makes a loud buzzing sound while it's running.  It sounds like a bad electrical transformer. If that is the cause, the company should replace or repair the unit, but I'll talk more about that later.  At the very least, it is by no means quiet, despite what the manufacturer claims.  I solved the buzzing sound by pressing a heavy object against the side panel, damping the buzzing sound.  However, I shouldn't have to do this for an item that is still protected by its warranty.The second major issue is that the unit leaves a white residue on items after the wash cycle.  The troubleshooting guide claims this is caused by hard water, but I do not have hard water as my place.  I tried using different soaps, including the soap recommended by the manufacturer, all without any effect. Even having only one item in the unit while it is washing doesn't do anything to prevent the white residue. Again, this indicates to me that the unit is not operating correctly and that the company should do something to fix it.This leads me to my last point.  I reached out to the Comfee customer service two weeks ago, but never heard back.Because of all these factors, I would strongly recommend looking somewhere else for a portable dishwasher.  This one is way more hassle than it is worth."
"I bought this for my tiny kitchen ! best part? Super space -efficient. It fits like a charm. it can handle small pots and pans well but not big and many !Cons: a bit pricey🥲 the water and energy use can be higher compared to full sized dishwashers. So it’s not eco friendly option ! The drying isn’t top notch, some dishes come out a bit damp, so i need air dry them a bit. And it’s a little noisy . In a nutshell it really depends on your need , if you are tired of dishwashing and have limited space this could be a good help"
"This is the second unit we have had, first one had an error after less than 24 hours use. Received a replacement about 2-4 months ago and now we’re back to where we started. Unable to be used. Cleaned as recommended, limited instructions. This time water was splashed all over the counters etc, and the only thing that we can do is toss it or hire a repairman. Not sure they can help with this item. Look at other options or get the extended warranty."
"I read through many reviews and figured that enough of them were decent, and that this countertop dishwasher was worth a shot. Plus it was in my price range. However, I was quite disappointed and returned it the following day.I followed the set up instructions and filled the reservoir until the beeping sound. All seemed to be working well as I started my first mini load. About 2/3 of the way through the wash, water started spurting and trickling out of the lower part of the front door! My kitchen was a water works. There was no stopping it until the cycle finished. It got into a drawer and soaked the counter top and floor. Also, there was a TON of water left in the bottom of the machine when the wash was done. There was an error code saying I overfilled it.I drained the water out eventually and repacked the machine for return. UPS picked it up for me!On a positive note, the dishes did come out nicely clean. And the blue light inside was enjoyable.Will need to spend more $$ on a different model next time."
I am still awaiting my refund taking way longer than any other amazon return - Not acceptable.  I was so excited to use this in my RV thinking wow great clean sanitized dishes.  However was quickly disappointed as it leaks underneath the unit.  I tried it twice to verify before placing it under the sink cabinet (water leaking in an rv is a hard NO). The first use I thought perhaps I spilled some water when pouring it in.  NOPE tried it a second time on the counter and there is a constant leak at the back underneath of the unit.  So would not recommend! Buyer beware as it does not work as stated and getting a refund to purchase a new unit it is lengthy!!!!!!!!!
"I looked at all my dishes and decided all that time with my hands in dirty water was worth 250$This little washer is just okay, it took me 3 week for it to arrive to me- it arrived with a crack in the front. It works, it’s just loud. I don’t think it’s worth the money but that is ultimately yours to decide."
So I ordered one of these because I had saw some pretty good reviews but definitely beware if you buy. I got it and I had it for 3 days and it quit so I got it returned and ordered another one thinking it was just a faulty item. So after 3 days it stopped mid cycle and quit working so I got another one and it had it for 13 days and it stopped working again the same thing with stopped mid cycle. I think the control panel being on the bottom is a bad idea because it seems to keep shorting out on me no matter how careful you are with it. I won’t be buying this brand or product ever again.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Who would’ve thought I’d actually look forward to doing dishes ? Lol seriously though my only regret is not having purchased a mini dishwasher sooner. I live in nyc and a hookup is out of the question let alone might even be prohibited in our lease. This has saved me hours of time I usually spend doing dishes. Aside from that it has made me appreciate cooking again without that nagging thought I’d have to clean up a lot after preparing a big meal. I hope it lasts because this guy here is my new bff :)update :I really enjoyed using my washer but sadly it stopped working only after having it for less than 3 months. The power button would turn on but the panel on the right side just won’t respond anymore. If I select rapid I cannot press the normal. The start won’t work. Like something behind the panel just won’t connect. It’s really sad coz I was enjoying using the unit. It’s outside the 30 day period so i had to contact the manufacturer to try to troubleshoot but they recommended to just refund my money:( I’m likely just gonna get a replacement . Still thinking about whether I shioks get the same brand since this stopped working in a short span of time I’ve had it .
"For the price I was expecting a great decent sized dishwasher. It is so little inside. It holds about 4 plates with enough room to wash 2-3 cups at the same time. 3 meals a day that's multiple loads of dishes, and the cycle is 2 hours long! The dryer also doesn't work very well. My dishes are soaking wet at the end. I loves the option of not having to hook this up to the sink and just fill up the tank, but it's seriously not worth it. Maybe if you're a single person who doesn't cook very often who loathes washing dishes, otherwise its a waste of space and time. I'd have to run it all day long to wash everything used in a day. Easier to just fill up the sink."
"Ordered mid-August, after around 2 months of use got an E4 error code which indicated in the manual to call customer support to get a tech out. I called and support said they do not send out techs to fix broken units that are fulfilled by Amazon. I didn't have the serial on me when I initially called and about another 2 months went by and I plugged the unit back in for the first time. It seemed to be working normally, but in two days (last night) I went to bed with it running and this morning my whole kitchen was flooded. I called again, and customer support very pretty short with me bordering on rude. It took two phone calls and resending information three times because no one was very clear with what was needed from me. The issue is now ""resolved"", because I was offered a refund for the unit and taxes. The third rep I spoke with said it will take a business day for the refund to be approved by another department and another 10-15 business days for the check to be sent out.TLDR; the unit broke really soon after purchase, customer support is ineffective, but a check will be sent snail mail in 2 weeks. Not worth the hassle."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I found that the instructions were a bit convoluted and unclear on set up and general operation. What was most upsetting was how easily the front door of this appliance would pop open at the slightest touch or jostle. The buttons not being physically present is also kind of a drag, it’s just a flat surface with no exterior physical designs to let you know if you correctly pushed a button unless you are directly watching the interface. Idk the lack of a physical button just irks me. It comes with a built in notch for you to fit a tide pod, or whatever brand you use, but it might as well not have been put in at all as it is so shallow a pocket and when the door is closed it stand vertically and there’s no way it will ever hold any sort of cleaner pack. You’re better off just tossing your cleaning agent at the dishes inside this thing."
"We’re a family of 3. Perfect for the couple of dishes we cycle through out the day. Fits perfectly on our small counter top. Easy to use. No complaints.Edit** we have lost the water funnel for the top part of the dishwasher. The website does not provide any support for replacement. Please let us know how we are supposed to get this part, it’s difficult to fillThe dishwasher with water without one."
"Update: the heating function stopped working. The water is not hot and neither is the air vent at the end of the cycle. Dishes are now white stained or greasy. Contacted comfee, let’s see.I actually wanted the bigger and newer version of COMFEE dishwasher as it has a water sucking mode so you don’t have to pour water into the machine to use a tedious pipe to connect to the valve. But then that one doesn’t fit our countertop and the darn low ceiling cabinet.I didn’t like this machine at first because it’s small. Turn out this disadvantage helps to improve one’s creativity. If you really try, you can actually put a lot of stuff inside it. Just make sure to arrange them in the way that each spot can receive the water splashed from the top and bottom rotators. We have no trouble putting -3  meals worth of 2 people and some more. I don’t like the pipe laying around so just manually pour water in every time. It sounds tiring but it’s only 3 pitcher full of the one that came w the machine. The machine is not quiet, but definitely not loud enough to disturb my work. Actually it’s quite a nice white noise. It really heats the water well during the wash as all the grease come off nicely. Make sure to use dishwasher detergent, the one used with handwash will cause a lot of foam. I’ve been using this daily for 2 weeks and start to like it a lot. I’ll update if things break in the future, let’s hope not :)"
Top part only  cutlery can be use. To me is kind of ridiculous.  Because the bottom get crowded with cup and plates.  But the worst part is that don't dry everything is full of water 😕. Only because my son throws the box I didn't send it back. Not very pleased..
"40 mins for rapid wash, you can fit maybe one medium sized mixing bowl, or small bowls with 3 or 4 small cups.Takes over a gallon of water to run it, if for some reason that it gets shut off or you open the door it will drain the water and you have to fill it completely up again, doesn't work if living off grid .I will say that it does clean stuck on mess really good , but you will be thirsty since it took all the water you had"
Does the job well but doesnt even fit my cutting board which is a standard size. Fits only a couple of dishes after each meal.
"Well, it works. Kinda...It takes over two hours to wash a few dishes, and I use the word wash very lightly. The dishes you put in it might as well be clean before you even start it, and given the amount of dishes you can fit in there it will only take five minutes to hand wash.Then you have the fill procedure, plan on having a dedicated water source before you begin. If you get the push to connect fitting that attaches to your faucet it fills just fine, but don't use that faucet for at least ten minutes. This all permitting you actually turn the water off as soon as it is done filling, otherwise you and whatever counter you set it on will get a shower. You could use the funnel and pitcher it includes to fill it with water, but again it takes longer than hand washing the few dishes you can fit in it. Patience is key when pouring, practice on a surface you don't care about getting a bunch of water on first.Again, I use the word ""wash"" lightly. It doesn't really wash dishes, even if you rinse your dishes with hot water as soon as you're done eating and start the machine shortly after. I've been using the tablets they recommend and dishes just aren't as clean as regular hand washing. Plus hand washing is considerably faster given the capacity of this machine.Summary. If you have a couple hundred dollars to waste on something, you're just plain lazy, you don't care if your dishes are squeaky clean, and you have nothing better to do with your time this machine is perfect for you!"
"I have tested the cleaning power of this little dishwasher by allowing my husband Buffalo chicken cheese dip sauce to dry on the mini crock pot liner and the serving spoon(these are normally very hard to clean off by hand even after soaking) it got all of it off. It has also gotten dried on food off my husband's hidden dishes he has left on his desk. If you have an over grown man-child this will come in handy if you have limited space and not enough time to spend an hours plus soaking scrubbing and soaking again. One downfall is the regular cycle is a long cycle 2hours+ including drying. But still save time so you can clean other things. I work 2-2-3 rotation 12hour shifts so coming home and cleaning after work is a no go for me. I just want to sit and relax before going to bed. I also didn't want to spend my days off doing nothing but cleaning. Another downfall it doesn't fit larger items those still need to be cleaned by hand. Like pots and pans that are larger than a sauce pan. Yes, I know it's taboo to put pans in a dishwasher, they aren't fancy pans. Lol if I could afford fancy $100+ each pans I would have a bigger place with a built in dishwasher haha.@UPDATE... control panel stopped working. Customer service is giving me the run around. Manufacturers warranty is 1year after purchasing. They are trying to get out of the warranty my dragging on saying oh we need this oh now we need this, oh and this. While taking weeks to reply. AVOID AT ALL COST!!!"
"It worked great for 6 weeks. Not very loud, doesn’t take up a lot of room, looks nice, cleaned dishes even with dried on food stain like chili. Unfortunately it worked great for about 6 weeks. Now it won’t turn on, and when it decides to turn on you can’t start it 90% of the time or change the wash setting."
I liked it at first but after a few washes I noticed residue on my dishes especially cups even when I didn't over fill it didn't seem to wash the detergent off and I ended up having to rinse everything off in the sink
"It works, it’s not very good with forks.It’s smaller than you would expect, not that I was expecting much. It’s also difficult to stack things inside. If things aren’t placed correctly you will have dirty dishes at the end of the cycle.There have been times where I rinse things away after it is finished with its cycle. I don’t see the point in having this take so much counter space for 10 items.The first cycle is best but even then, you’re only washing like 10 items in there at a time.With the amount of things you can put inside of it, save your money. You’ll spend 10 minutes doing the dishes by hand.It’s nice that they give you free pods to use. The machine is fine too, it’s just too small and half the times something comes out dirty.I am giving it 2 stars because it works but the time it takes to place the little dishes you can put in there isn’t worth the $300."
"The absolute only reason I gave this three stars is definitely not because of the machine quality or performance; it just was so much larger and more cumbersome than expected. I’ve been shopping around for portable dishwashers, and I liked the shiny, black, sleek design and it seemingly fit all the measurements. I have absolutely no doubt that this machine will clean beautifully and efficiently, but it’s quite large. It literally took over my small apartment kitchen. Be aware that this one does require a hose hook up; the adapter worked perfectly for me, but I soon discovered that the best and most effective way to use this would be to store the dishwasher on a rolling cart of its own and make sure that the hose route is as straight as possible during hookup and use. It’s really just so much more work than I am willing to do—the whole reason behind getting a dishwasher being the elimination of extra work. I returned it and I’m getting one that has a top fill reservoir feature.  A little bit more on the size of this machine, it’s literally half the size of a regular size dishwasher so it has a large capacity and many features.  I would have kept it if I had more space."
"Let me start by saying that the product is absolutely amazing and if you're looking for a dependable portable dishwasher, get this one. It's absolutely amazing. I gave it three stars because of Amazon. They delayed our order so many times, and we pay for prime to have it on certain days. It was delayed 3 times and I'm not sure why. We were told that it was promised to come in one day, after speaking with a customer support representative, which wasnit true... I call again the following day after it was delayed again, and the only way I found out it was delayed was through me caling customer service. They were not updating the app nor the website on the status until AFTER we called in and made it a point to correct it... I just find it odd that the package was less than an hour away from our house yet they couldn't deliver it on time... I understand that Amazon drivers have a lot of orders to drop off, but it sat at the carrier location for many days... Other than that, the product is absolutely amazing. Cleans the dishes very thoroughly and we are very happy with it."
"I bought this back in July, installed it to its permanent home in September. we have used it to wash the few dishes that we use. now tonight (Nov. 30, 2024) this unit has started leaking water out of the back into my kitchen floor. looks like a very poor design by the manufacturer. other than the leaking water this is an awesome unit. I just hope that they fix this major problem before it causes someone to flood their home or burn it to the ground."
This product leaking after a couple of weeks.
"First time I used this, it leaked out of the back. I figured out that if I removed the black piece of cardboard insulation covering the back, it wouldn't leak anymore, but you can clearly see water in the tray in a gap in the back of the machine.This thing is so much bigger than I expected, and it would be a huge hassle to return it. I am just going to replace the cardboard with something that doesn't tuck into that gap because having something tucked into the gap is what caused water to leak out. I don't know if being able to see water in that gap is normal, but as long as it is contained in the machine and not leaking out onto my counter, I am happy.There was also fiberglass? insulation sticking out of the gap between the door and the bottom of the machine. It looked ugly. I pushed it back in, and it is still visible. I may need to take the door apart to put the insulation where it is supposed to be.I don't feel like the controls are very intuitive. I keep having to take out the manual to decipher the meaning of the different pictures on the display.It washes my dishes. So, poorly constructed/designed but functional."
The box it came in was a damaged but it was a thick cardboard. After I opened it up I saw there was some damage to the top and back. I just wanted it to work and there is no leaks. It is a little bigger than I thought but barely fits on my counter top. It's pretty quiet which is nice.
"So we set it up about 6 months ago despite buying it 18 months ago. ( we had a baby and life got hectic). It’s been working fine but lastnight it decided to break. Water backed up into it and destroyed all the tech in the bottom and the back so it is now useless. It was working perfectly fine, no leaks to anything until lastnight. It threw a code E4 and when we cleaned it out and restarted it, it started leaking from the bottom. Water got all inside its computing system and we don’t know why. It was a great little dishwasher until then but since we have only used it for 6 months it doesn’t make sense as to why it would break so easily. 300$ down the drain….literally."
Box came crushed at the corner and dishwasher came with a small dent but whatever. Dishwasher works great so far! I’ll edit the review if it doesn’t.
"I've had this dishwasher several months now. The packaging was great, beefed up with some metal framing and styrofoam. I was happy to see that, but somehow one of the corners still got dented in. Barely noticeable, so I decided to keep it. This dishwasher is lighter than the last countertop dishwasher I had. It doesn't seem to have internal heating elements, so that's probably the reason. The water temperature is what comes out of your tap, I think. It seems to cycle in & out of water intake during the wash - to regulate the temperature, I presume. This is a plus for me. I have hard water and it killed the heating elements in my last countertop d/w. This d/w may last longer. The water wand seems a little weak. It's not a strong spray. As a result, Eco setting for my lightly soiled dishes was not enough to thoroughly clean the dishes. I've since switched to the Normal setting and it works pretty good most of the time. I haven't tried the Heavy setting yet. I doubt it would clean heavy residue, but may be good for normal residue. Judging by the running time for each setting, the difference between, Eco, Normal, Heavy, etc, seems to be simply the running time. There seems to be no difference in the intensity of the water spray between the different settings. It has operated, so far, easily and without any problems. I'm OK with the weak spray, I just rinse better before stacking. Still easier and quicker than hand washing for me.  The instructions are adequate and easy to understand."
"I ordered my new dishwasher and was so excited to use it. I hooked it up, ( totally easy to hook up) loaded it, and turned it on. It was soo quiet! Eventually, though, an alarm went off that there was a leak somewhere in it. Well, not kiddin, there it was! So I cleaned up the mess, and called the number in the book! They got me all set up with a return. Very nice to deal with! I just wish Amazon had customer service IN the United States. They picked it up today. Very good customer service. I'm just bummed I don't have a dishwasher! Daaaaang!"
"Product showed up dented on the top, but otherwise good"
"After the first one I order got delayed several times and then lost in transit, my replacement finally got to me 2 weeks later. Needed an adapter for my sink. When I got it working I started leaking from the drain port on the dishwasher itself, as others have mentioned they’ve had happen. The dishwasher itself is 5 stars and amazing. If I can fix the leak I’ll revise the review. I don’t think the shipping was their fault either."
"Very difficult install for semi permanent installations where you will not be using faucet and the quick connect. None the piping is standard size.  You really want a plumber to come in if you will not be using the faucet for water supply.  Be prepared for two trips to your local home improvement store to match the sizes ,connections ,and converters.  After two trips to home depot , I still have a very very small drip leak from the drain connection that I will just haft live with. It very tight and snug.  I take a paper towel to wipe up the few drops of water after each wash.The dishwasher does it’s job.  It’s decent.  I like to do a pre rinse. Everything comes out clean. I have yet to stick  dirty dirty dishes straight into the machine. The manufacturer says you can. I would give this machine 3.5-4 stars if it was not for the difficulty of the installation and the slow leak on the drain that I suspect is manufactured defect."
It washes my dishes well. If you are a person that thinks you might need the separate faucet attachment. You won’t. The one you buy extra is the same one that already comes in the box. The only problem I have is it doesn’t dry the dishes at all. Even with the dry function the dishes are still just soaked so I either have to dry them off myself of open the washer and let them dry. Over all I like it. It was worth the money to me. When I got the washer it was wet on the inside but I’m sure it was just from them testing it.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Purchased 8/8/23. It has not yet reached a year. The dishwasher is noisy and has started to leak water. The dishes come out clean as long as you rinse first. The filter is easy to remove for cleaning. You’re not able to fit small cups on the cup rack like it shows. The overall performance of the dishwasher is great and easy to use. Unfortunately the leaking problem doesn’t appear to be fixable and will eventually cause the dishwasher to stop working.
"Was excited to setup and run as I could really use it in a house of 5 individuals cooking at the same time, but was disappointed to find that the faucet adapter piece that was supposed to be included was not. Had to find a replacement piece."
First thing is the little rack for cups. That is a joke. Unless you are washing your 5yr olds tea party dishes. That is my biggest complaint. Jury is still out on how well is washes. Due to the fact we have very hard water here. But the white residue left on the dishes did not start till we added the rinse agent. As far as size I guess I would not call it portable. But if you know how to load a dishwasher you can get quite a bit in it. Just make sure there is nothing blocking the soap. If it can't open all the way the pods do not dissolve completely. It is very easy to connect to faucet once it is set up. And the different wash cycles are nice to have.
The dishwasher worked pretty well until the pump stopped working a couple weeks ago. I use it about once a week so it's not like it's being HEAVILY used. Trying to figure out how to fix it has been a nightmare. I don't know if id purchase it again since it didn't even last a year before needing repairs
We’re a family of four with two kids under 3. We have lots of sippy cups and bottles so I ran it everyday. It only lasted 3 months before it started leaking and the motor smelled like it was burning up.
"After living in my rented home for 6 months with no dishwasher, I decided to get a countertop dishwasher on Amazon Prime Day in July. I got a good deal on this one and it came timely and looked great. The dish basket is well designed and it holds more than you would think. It does take a lot of room on the counter top though. Anyway when I tried to connect it to my kitchen faucet I found out that it is not compatible with the hose from a pull down sprayer faucet. I went online and ordered adapters. My son went online and ordered adapters but none of them work. One video online shows someone able to attach it after connecting a series of 4 adapters but you have to know not only diameter but thread size. We have spent and additional $50 on adapters but we cannot get them to work. I have not been able to use the dishwasher, we even tried wheeling it into the bathroom faucet like another person on the internet did, but it didn't work. I just think they should be clearer in the description that you may not be able to attach it. I would return it but it is 52 lbs. and I did not save the box, so I think that is out of the question. I am going to try to sell it on marketplace."
"I bought this in October, recieved it in November. It worked great for months, cleaned my dishes well, loved the little guy. Now its march and it went from Working fine to overflow error in one wash. The machine now can not fully drain so its basically useless.  Ive trouble shot the issues, the filter was shockingly clean for 4.5 months of use, the drain hose is clear, the propeller visible from the drain pan is clear. That leaves one possibility a faulty pump. 4.5 months of use x2 times per week and the pump crapped out. Unimpressed and sad because i really did like the washer.Calling customer service but i have low expectations.  Buyer beware you might want to go with a more expensive and reliable model.UPDATE, i took it apart, the drain hose takes a uturn immediately after exiting the drain opening. Stick a  wire in there and you can remove debre. Got it working again. Poor desight for a drain but fixable. It does leak a bit out the door  seal if you pack dishes close to the door. Once again not the best design but useable."
Does not wash very well. Sometimes the dishwasher pod is still in tact after the dishwasher did its job…. So that means the soap never washed. I don’t use the cheap pods….so I don’t understand…most of my mugs still have coffee in them… very disappointed
It worked great until the drain hose come off. It is a small rubber tube that you can not get out far enough to reattach.
"Bought this in Feb '23 (for reference, it's December '23). Unit stopped working within 2 weeks. Initiated a return and advised to ship back but the item did not come in a box, rather styrofoam and those reinforced cardboard beam-type of things. It was really well packaged and there was no damage, however, packaging is not conducive in the event you need to return the item due to malfunction. It's still sitting in my garage because I had to ship it back and had nothing big enough to fit it in without extensive searching online for a box to purchase (the ones at big box stores were either to small or too big to fit in my car to bring to UPS/FEDEX/USPS).With all of that being said, the unit is not small whatsoever and ""countertop"" is a stretch. It can sit in the counter yes, but it barely made clearance for my top cabinets. If you strategically place the dishes you can get a good amount in for a single person or maybe working couple who isn't home most of the day but it is not suitable for a family (although it would probably work if you used it in an outdoor kitchen/bar area that wasn't subject to the elements). It's about 24""x24"" so it takes up a considerable amount of space. It's loud but it does clean. I wouldn't purchase again simply because it ended up not working within 2 weeks (it wouldn't drain) and while the amazon return process in theory was relatively simple, the logistics of returning this just made it impossible. I hate that I have a useless, near-$300 item sitting on my garage counter with no way to return (bringing to an Amazon dropoff was not an option at the time). It was just brought to my attention that I had not reviewed this item."
"Washes well, gets plenty hot. Quiet except for the drain phase as the pump is very loud.  The drain point on this dishwasher is non standard making fixed installation to a drainpipe very challenging. It is threaded with non-pipe threads so swapping the hose/connector is an exercise in creativity. Would be nice if it came with a brass elbow that terminates in an 11/16th barb so you could easily affix a universal drain hose. Also does not have a dry-only cycle like my other portable dishwasher does. Arrived partially crushed on a corner but works fine. Only other complaint is Amazon reduced the price almost $30 immediately after I bought it."
"The entire dishwasher has become something I hate. It’s not space friendly for the amount you can fit into it. The shape and space inside is set up weird so you have to angle cups and such strange, which then you wonder how clean anything gets.The worst part though is that it won’t stop leaking. Everything is tight and put together correctly, but it’s leaking so badly I have to position the entire back half over my kitchen sink so it doesn’t get everywhere. Multiple places leak and I’ve only used it 5 times. The dishes never all look clean and I wish I never got it.I’d rather hand wash at this point, but I spent the money so I have to try and make it work.I wish it didn’t leak so I could put it on a rolling cart and just move it over to hook it up when I need to. That would at least make up for some of the other drastic pitfalls."
Leaks out the bottom constantly. I want a refund but the item is too bulky and water logged to return.
Back top left corner of the dishwasher came dented in. The box it came in had no issues.
"I bought this because I hate doing dishes. But I still have to. Dishes need a little scrub before loading. And although I put on the extra drying cycle, there is always water on the cups, silverware and inner walls of the machine. It also doesn't hold much."
My COMFEE dishwasher isn’t dispensing the detergent when I add the detergent and turn it on it runs great but when it’s done the detergent is still there so I’m not sure if I’m doing something wrong
"As the title says, we loved this when we first got it! Dishes have always been a struggle, and this was hands down the best home appliance we'd ever bought. However, after having it for nearly two months, it unfortunately will not drain any longer.We have done all possible troubleshooting over the past week: made sure the filter was clean (it was), checked to make sure the drain hose wasn't kinked or blocked (it wasn't), I even took the drain hose completely off and no water would come out of the back spout. We replaced it with a standard metal hose and tried to run it again, thinking maybe the drain pump would need to force the water out, but all we got was water all over our kitchen floor for our troubles when the machine overfilled. I'm not sure if the pump is the problem or if somehow something is clogging it further down than we can reach, though again, the filter had been kept clean and barely anything was on it when we took it off.I feel bad writing a bad review as it really was a great product up until it wasn't, but the return window was only a month and now we're stuck with a broken machine. The website says in order to get a replacement or refund you have to ship it to them along with a proof of purchase within 60 days of receipt. It would be far more expensive to ship than it would be worth, and then we'd have to wait and see if they would even cover it. No thanks. We'll be getting a replacement from another brand soon. :("
I was looking forward to this because since having a new baby I was sick of hand washing all the time. First of all it’s my fault for not measuring but this thing is much bigger then I expected! Pictures don’t do it justice. It’s extremely heavy it took me and my husband to lift this. It also barley fits under my cabinets I had to push it in and make it fit. I’ve tried every setting several different soaps and rinse aid settings and this thing just does a terrible job at cleaning my baby and pumping stuff. No matter what it always has some weird spotting and residue on it and sometimes they come out looking dirtier then they did going in! I even pre hand rinsed and cleaned a few and they still came out looking weird and greasy. I’ve troubleshoot everything and they just come out eh. It also doesn’t dry the dishes at all even with the extra dry setting and rinse aid the picture I included was after several hours of sitting out to dry. I have a 30 dollar sterilizer and dryer combo that dries better then this thing! For the money this should be able to dry the dishes. I’m just so disappointed I wanted this to help make my life easier and it’s just annoying I wish I had spent less for the smaller one probably would of worked better for less money
"I would have given it a 5 if it arrived undamaged. Mine had a good-sized dent on top. The box was damaged like it had been yetted by a forklift. It's like the driver knew because he hauled butt after dropping it on my porch. Was tired of handwashing dishes so I let it slide. The damage was only cosmetic.I permanently installed it where our old dishwasher was. This little thing cleans really nicely! Better than the big one we had. The only downside is the load capacity. We have a bigger family so we have to load it a couple of times a day, still better than handwashing!This would be absolutely perfect for an apartment, a camper, a person with a small family, or living on your own.Highly recommend."
"If you connect to your kitchen faucet, it's great, but if you want to do a permanent installation the drain connection is non-standard. By that, I mean there's no easy way to grab a drain hose from the big box stores and connect it like a typical dishwasher. The water inlet connection IS standard, but drain connection is some weird thing that has to be hacked to make work. WHY??? Horrible design."
"This is my 3rd portable dishwasher I have owned because I travel alot. They were different models, same price and have had no problems. But after a month of use, this model keeps stopping and showing a code on the screen... e4. The seals leak. Water seeps to the bottom catch and sets off the sending unit, thus stopping and draining the wash cycle until I dry out the bottom collection cup. If the seals didnt leak, it wouldnt happen. All the other mechanisms on the washer are fine. At this point, I wish I had bought a different model."
It gets three for customer service. I've used it two times and it's less than a week old...and just stops working. But I was very well taken care of so that's fabulous.
Would be cool to have a hookup onto the sprayer instead or another option to keep the sink faucet free to be used. Works really well.
"I like the size and it works really well and it gets the dishes clean, however it leaks a lot!  I am very disappointed with the amount of leakage. If it didn't leak the way it does I would've given it 5 stars."
"Bought and used for six months-then I get the E4 error. After googling (it wasn’t in the user manual) I found out that means water is getting into the motor compartment and triggering the flood switch. Open up the bottom and it is indeed wet, but none of the hoses or connections were wet or obviously leaking. Their website provides no email or phone number to contact for repairs or troubleshooting."
I have been at my current address for 1 year.  Bought my first one a year ago and had to return it after 8 months and now having the same issue with my current one.  E4 is the code that keeps coming up.  This time resulted in water all over my kitchen.  We tilt it over to drain it but that doesn’t fix the issue.  Super inconvenience!
"This little electronic thing which is the pump I think or one of them.. the corner was completely broken off and also the pipe it connects to had 2 chunks taken out of it. I couldn't repair this machine if I wanted to. HORRIBLE!!!!!! I couldn't even find the broken pieces either, was I sold a used returned piece of garbage? When I first set this thing up I kept getting E4 error, turns out it means there is a leak and no crap there is a leak the entire piping of the unit is broken off. Awful awful design.Edit: After reading other 1 star reviews.. seem this is extremely common. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TERRIBLY DESIGNED PRODUCT!"
"This is my second contertop dishwasher. The first one was very similar but of the other brand. It served for 3 years and I was very happy and then it stopped to pump water in the dishwasher. I decided to buy this one. When it arrived and I installed it, the screen immediately showed Error 4 and water leaked from the bottom. When we opened the dishwasher, the part which is marked on the picture was fallen apart. I must say that it is not very well made, seems to be very weak plastic. We tried to fix it with some stuff (like plastic bands) and seems that it works. But I don't know how long it lasts like this. I have read a lot of reviews where people were having  strange leaking problems. I think this is a common problem"
"I was honestly very excited for this product but unfortunately, it’s very inconsistent with the drying mode. I have even tried adding the extra drying cycle. Along with increasing the rinse aid level. However, I continue to have issues with drying. Dishes comeOut soaked! The main reason I got it was to wash baby bottles and pumping part but honestly baby bottle mode sucks. So I have to use the regular modes and hope my dishes dry but so far no luck."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update with video Dec,7 2023 Adapter to the sink now leaks water at multiple places that are at connection points. (Pot on faucet so not to spray water everywhere) Hope my husband is able to repair it. It isn't worth the water it is wasting, it pours & sprays water until you turn off the faucet.No more standing in front of the sink to wash dishes! I now get to enjoy cooking at home without the worry of clean up afterwards. It easily cleaned my large crockpot after cooking stew beef and gravy, which is a pain to scrub by hand. The only noise I hear is when it drains periodically, otherwise it is so quiet. You will not regret buying this if you are here shopping for it....Do it, quit second guessing it. You will love it. (I cook for a family of 3 adults) It installed easily on my faucet, which is an older style, came with all the parts to attach to my faucet, and even came with a package of 22 Finish detergent pouches."
"Overall, this is a decent dishwasher and cleans well if you get one that a) isn’t dented (the original packaging was visibly damaged…so, go figure)…and b) doesn’t keep giving error codes when you try to start a wash cycle. I had to go through the hassle of returning a damaged dishwasher (which was NOT a smooth process being that UPS failed to show up when scheduled).  The replacement arrived quickly BUT the unit STILL had a huge dent on the side (really?!) . If it hadn’t been for the hassle of having to return a defective machine and being sent a replacement with a huge cosmetic defective. I would give this unit a higher rating."
Won't even fit a standard dinner plate.
"Please save yourself my grief, it’s not a good a good machine. Mine is no longer working properly, I have only had it 3 months, and on the most only used 3 times a week !Save the mess, that it took me hours to clean up after. The water was gushing out the lower front. I of course  checked the hoses in the back, bone dry. I now have a broken dishwasher that is PAST THE RETURN WINDOW. Do yourself a favor, buy a name brand ."
I've done 10 washes since purchased. Get the dishes nice and hot and clean. I would have given this a 5 star review but the top of the washer came badly dented and was causing the door not to close. I fixed it but this is unacceptable.
Honestly it works great came with all the adapters everything however when we opened the box from the top we noticed 2 wooden pieces where bent inward upon further inspection we found the top of the dishwasher was dented inward from side to side like something much more heavy was placed on top of it this wasn't a small dent or shallow one it was pretty noticeable it did however still function correctly it was more of a cosmetic issue than a functional
I was very excited to get this dishwasher. It cleaned the dishes well. But I kept noticing my counter tops were pooling with water. I tightened the tube's. I thought maybe I connected it wrong.  Then I pulled it out a little while in use and water was pouring out of the bottom. I sent it back and was promised a refund but have not received it. I just wasted 300.00 and am very disappointed.
The silverware basket is broken I haven't even hooked it up yet to see if it works  tomorrow I'll review that
"I don’t love getting a pre-broken new thing, but I don’t have the energy to return the whole machine and wait for a new one just to fix the basket. It otherwise works fine."
This machine looks nice but it stopped working as soon as I got it. Didn’t even get to use it for a full minutes. When I paused it I heard a loud pop come from the door and now none of the buttons work besides the power button. I believe the door sensor or latch must of broke when I heard the pop.
A dishwasher was on my wish list for quite a while. Then I regretted buying it because setting it up was so complicated. I wasn't able to use it until about a month after the purchase. It did take up too much space on my counter since I live in a mobile home. I decided to place it permanently in a cabinet and lose out on storage for pots and pans.
"Worked ok for almost 2 years to the day using it once sometimes twice a week. 2 weeks past the warranty time if I had bought the extra 2 year protection plan the pump just seized up. Manufacturer and Amazon offer Zero support for the product, if it breaks it goes to the landfill. Garbage product. Buyer beware….."
We ordered this to build into a cabinet. We built a shelf to hold it. Pictures on the Amazon site showed the dishwasher installed under a counter. The only hoses that came with it were to hook up from on top of a counter. The attachment to the sink faucet would have fit a faucet from the 70’s. It was impossible to find fittings to adapt the dishwasher as a built in. We called a plumber to install it. $200.00 later we have a dishwasher.  Make sure you measure your dinner plates. 10 inches and not a cm more.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Tried it. Its working but didn’t do what it’s supposed to. I am not sure maybe because i put a normal dishwashing liquid and i dont have a rinse aid? It came out still dirty and not even dry. Tried it 3x. I will go to walmart and get some pods for dishwasher and a rinse aid hopefully it will work otherwise I’ll return it😔 I’ll update if it work.Update: returned it. The hose at the back bent and water won’t come in and company can’t send replacement
Purchased for rv and when you set it for the 140 min cycle an error message of the heating element comes on...not sure if it is because of the fact that rvs have smaller water heaters or what but using a shorter time the dishwasher will complete the cycle
"This was going to be second countertop dishwasher after my first stopped working after 7 years of service.Bought this brand had no clue about it, was a less expensive than the brand I wanted to get.As soon as I tried to use it for the first time, one could tell the pump was oddly loud, soon after the ""beeping of a problem"" came on and my kitchen was flooded.I returned this item immediately and ordered the brand I wanted in the first place, needless to say Danby brand worked perfectly at first use and since I received it.I am not sure if I received a fluke or got damaged in shipment but I should have gone with the brand I trusted in the first place."
"This is just the size and look I wanted for my small kitchen countertop, BUT…. There are 2 adapters that they recommended to get to fit your faucet (for faucet hook up). I bought both, because I wasn’t sure which I’d need.I followed their directions and what a mistake that was!!My faucet was not adaptable to either one of the adapters, the worst part is they tell you to unscrew the head of faucet- to try to screw in the adapter, but my kitchen faucet has not worked since….no running water !  I called the Company to speak to the tech department to help, but after giving the model number and name (right on the box), they DENIED KNOWING OF THE MACHINE!!  It still sells on Amazon, I mentioned, but still they DENIED IT!!Amazon was so kind about it, they said they’d give me a credit and to just keep it.The only problem is, with the credit I had to buy a different one and now I’m terrified to call a PLUMBER, knowing they charge so much!My new - different one, works great, but smaller! Has built in water tank, so needs no hook up.So, the other sits on my kitchen floor!!At least the Co. should own up to their own product!Shame on you Comfy!So buyer beware!"
Product arrived dented and silverware basket broke
"The wheels ahould be bigger so they dont come off track. Once off track, the sprayer jams.  The hook up hose is trash, too. Plastic. Should be metal. Ends on washer should be metal, too. Maybe another .5 inch clearance for plates, too. ."
Was thrilled to get this but it displayed an error code as soon as it was turned on. There were scratches and grease spots on the top of this machine so I suspect it was a return from someone else. Very disappointed because it was the exact size and color I wanted. The worst part is going to be trying to box this hot mess up to return.
"This is our second Comfee dishwasher. First one lasted a year then got the E4 code. We could not fix it on our own so we ordered another. This one lasted 2 months before getting the E4 code!! Just as with the first one, it stops draining and then leaks all over! What the heck! Uncool, lasting 2 months is unacceptable. Just missed the return window too."
"I bought this dishwasher since my new home did not come with one and thought it would work great. I’ve ran into so many issues with it like leaks or it just simply popping up error. I’ve been trying to contact customer service about getting a refund, it’s been over a month now and still have heard nothing back. DO NOT BUY."
"The E1 error has prevented me from even washing one load. It’s consistent despite leveling it, turning up water pressure, and unplugging the machine. This is literally a useless $400+ purchase.YouTube video coming soon."
"I previously owned a SPT Countertop Dishwasher and when that died (after more than 6 years of use) I bought this one instead because it was slightly cheaper. It doesn't load as many dishes as the SPT even though they are the same size, it doesn't clean was well as my old machine and within a day or two of first using it one of the handles on the utensils basket broke. Adequate but the SPT was better."
It's very easy to install anyone can do it! It fits well in my little cabinet space in my small apartment but I have teens who don't know how to rinse their dishes before putting them in the dishwasher and I was hoping this would take care of it but it does not. Dishes need to be mostly clean before they go in.
Why is this so highly rated? It doesn’t fit standard dishes. Is not portable in any sense of the word. So heavy you’ll need 3 people to even bring up to the counter.And the adaptors to the faucet do not work. Returning within 5 mins of “installation”
Called customer service and they said only have 1 size quick disconnect to fit and its too big for my faucet and NO solution..i tried to use every fitting solution but the water feed connect nothing American fits
"Just flooded an area of my kitchen because it decided to leak from the bottom. not the hose connections either. when clicking the link amazon gives for product support, it takes me to their website, where there is no product support or customer service for that matter.so far id never buy anything from this brand again and upon seeing other reviews that mention a leak from the same area, id avoid this at all costs."
"😡😡 I'm extremely frustrated with this product. It shows e4 error, leaks, overflows, and doesn't drain properly. I have changed the hoses two times,While the hoses function well, there's a persistent leak from the bottom. I have replaced the dishwasher with a new one and it has the same problem.Save yourself the trouble; I've wasted four weekends trying to fix it or clean up the mess it has made."
Did not work out of the box and Amazon ask me if I could work on it to fix it they would give me a partial refund. If I wanted to work on it I would buy someone’s used junk very disappointed in the product and Amazon for wanting the product back before a refund is issued like they don’t have my card info if I didn’t return it
What a waste of money to spend on an adapter. The washer machine itself already had one. You'll need to re-tighten the hoes becuase it's loose when arrive.
The dishes in their example must be for children. i cant fit a plate it in. may 3-4 bows and a few cups.was hoping to fit normal size dishes in there. Twice the dishwasher tab didn't get dissolved. not sure why. It is quiet and I think uses less water than handwashing. But I would not purchase again.Shipping was fast and well packaged.
"There is nothing portable about this!  This is just a half-sized dish washer.  Does NOT have a built-in tank for those who's apartments don't have the required hookups it actually DOES require the same hook ups as any other full-sized dishwasher.  It is about TWICE the size of your standard microwave.  So, if you're looking for a PORTABLE dishwasher THIS ISN'T IT."
1.) The water has to be on2.) You're can't use this product with a pull down faucet head3.)you have to use the extra drying cycle if you want the dishes to come out mostly dry4.) DO NOT BUY HERE. buy at the original retailer or you won't be eligible for the manufacturer warranty.  Which makes the assurant insurance useless.
"I bought this dishwasher, didn’t fit my faucet. I bought an adapter for the faucet and it fit. Once connected and running, water leaks from the back of the hose connected to the dishwasher."
"I figured with it being just my wife and I that this would be the perfect dishwasher, especially since we both work full time. Not even close. Had to return it and buy a full size portable one."
"It came in a damaged box.  That should have been my first red flag.  But I ignored that and went ahead and set the thing up.  I got it all hooked up, with the exception of the quick connect piece which also came damaged.  I had to go out to the local hardware store for a replacement on that.  After getting home from that outing I got it all set up and as soon as I plug it in, it gives me the E4 Error. Overflow.  Mind you, the water was OFF.  So I call Comfee to get assistance.  This guy I spoke to was rude and basically told me it's just defective.  Go back to Amazon and either return or replace it.  Take your P.O.S. back. I will NOT be purchasing anything by this brand again.  Talk about disappointing.  I was so excited for this.  Thanks for breaking my heart when I really needed something good, Comfee.  Thanks."
Worst purchase ever.  Worked for all of a week then wasn't cleaning!!
Finally found an adapter for it . Breaks with in 1 wash and has overflow error code. Having to return and they won’t even replace the item only will let me return for a refund. Don’t buy.
"I love the way the dish washer looks and how big it is. Issue is connecting the hose to any sorce of facet for water. We tried so many things and its been more of a pain than helpful, best bet to just go with a dish washer that can have water be put in the machine and connect to a facet. That way if you cant connect it at least you can still use it by putting in water, all in all woldnt buy unless ur willing to buy more things to try to connect it to your kitch facet."
Takes a lot of counter space but can fit a small to med load. Good if you more houses alot. Washes good too
"This dishwasher is terrible, it leaks and plates don’t even fit. My glasses and silverware came out dirty after two cycles."
I’ve used it 4 times. Teflon taped connections. Properly tightened. There’s only a drainage outlet and a water source inlet. Not too hard. All taped up nicely all tightened properly. Drainage hose is parallel to the sink and not kinked (connection doesn’t leak the machine fills up with water and leaks) it drains in but this thing does not drain. Anything more than one load my counter is full of water. I have to take it off the counter tilt it back to drain. Them tilt it forward to drain again. The photos are the result. Not happy at all with the purchase. With the amount of work I have to put into this POS I could wash dishes by hand. For the money I would never ever ever buy again. Pissed
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Yo, this thing was working great the first month I had it. I was stoked and used it all the time. But then, not long after, the back started leaking like crazy, and water was going everywhere on the counters. I tried fixing the drain pipe, but it didn't work. I ran it over and over again to see why it kept leaking, and it turned out that water was dripping from all the edges! The company that made this thing did such a crappy job that it takes less energy to wash dishes by hand than to clean up the mess this broken piece of junk makes."
If I could give it zero stars I would! The dishwasher displayed an E4 error code immediately upon pressing the start button. Called the company and talked to a man who seemed like he really couldn't care less. No repairman could be sent out. Apparently that is only done for larger dishwashers. He told me to call Amazon. So we had to do our best to repackage this monstrosity to send back. What a joke.
After a couple months it starts leaking underneath and calcium buildup is forming in the back some how.
"Broken right out of the box, didn't work."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It doesn’t get the dishes anywhere near clean!! Water leaks everywhere the whole time it’s running!! Idk how I’m even going to return it! The box it comes in can’t be repacked, once you cut the ties holding it together the box is done! So much more trouble than it’s worth! DO NOT BUY!! I’ll be heading to a home improvement store to find something that’s actually reliable"
"Installed and tried to use it.  Water ran out the bottom all over my countertop.  Was leaking internally.  I had ordered an extended  warranty.  Amazon would not fix it.  I called the manufacturer and they told me the part ( I figured out it was an incorrectly made valve )  was back ordered 14+ days.Less than a week later, I got an email from them saying it was NOW BACK ORDERED 145+ DAYS.Called Amazon again.  They gave me a refund on the dishwasher, warranty and other items for the washer. They didn't want it back.  Searched for a different model but ended up buying this again.  Working fine now."
"The long and the short of it, the unit broke the very first time I used it. Defective part. Should have been easy to replace but COMFEE customer service after a dozen calls kept sending me the wrong part even after sending them the picture of the broken part (it was the drain line going to the sink). Very ridiculous. Ended up just ordering the part on my own from a different vendor and spending an extra $50 out of my pocket. Very poor experience. Sadly, it was the only countertop dishwasher that could fit in my place. I needed one because of eczema on my hands. It was the most difficult customer service I have ever experienced. I would not recommend this product."
I got this all set up. Had to go out and buy a different sink handle. Turn it on for first time per the manual and kept getting the code E4. Looked up the code E4 which said leak somewhere. So I had to take apart the inside and when I did it was very apparent that there was a crack inside the drain housing area.
"To bulky for under cabinets, yo small for plates, delivered upside down and corner bent"
"Have been using this dishwasher for over a month now and have been completely underwhelmed. It does a horrible job cleaning silverware, even when loaded exactly as the instructions indicated (I have given up trying and just wash them all by hand still.) As for plates, bowls, glasses, etc. it does a mediocre job. I find I have to hand wash items after they’ve been through a wash cycle more times than I can count (even after rinsing everything before it’s put in!) The cycles also take an excessively long time to run. Overall I feel like it was a waste of money and would not purchase again nor recommend."
Don’t let the good reviews fool u like it did me. It’s nice and little but leaks really bad when in a cycle
Doesn't clean well at all. There was stuff left over on plates after a wash that came off by just running it under a sink for a second that this dishwasher struggled with.
"Came with dead bugs, scratches, dirt, missing parts to the point I cant even use the dishwasher to see if it works so I had to buy them on ebay. Hopefully it works.Update: works perfectly fine, had E4 setting error then tilted and adjusted drain pipe. Ran it on baby care cycle and everything drained fine."
"I bought this little dishwasher with low expectations for our needs. We have a small home and a lot of dishes! I will say that if you need to use this continuously you may not want to try this model. I bought it yesterday. I have run three loads in 24 hours. It is already showing an error code. Capacity is okay if you are good at Tetris. You cannot overlap however because the machine won’t clean the items (hence three loads, the first was done twice). Gave it three because it’s cool and has great potential and might work for a single person with a handful of dishes weekly."
"So I’m a mom and I bought this to wash bottles. We have a garage with a kitchen so my husband and I thought it would be great to use for bottles now and then use in the garage kitchen later.This is far too big for me which is one of the reasons I returned it. It took up basically the entire counter.Set up is easy, but you have to put water into it every time you want to use it. I did find that it did a decent job cleaning but it left a cloudy residue on the bottles. It’s also slightly louder than I expected but not annoyingly loud.I did order this as a “buy used” product and it ended up having an error that it would throw randomly an error. This is what made me return the item but I did not like it enough to get a replacement.I do think this would be great for someone who doesn’t have a dishwasher. But if you’re looking for something to wash bottles that’s aesthetically pleasing, this isn’t it."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I absolutely love this portable dishwasher!  It cleans my air fryer racks, without rinsing them first, to spotless perfection.  A glob of peanut butter on a knife?  No problem.  The only reason for 3 stars is (1) the flimsy little plastic thing they give you for silverware, & (2) I didn't receive the fruit bowl, even after calling the seller & Amazon.  So I bought a utensil rack & something I could use to rinse fruit in."
"I have not got to use this yet so I can tell you about that yet, but what I can tell you is I received a returned dishwasher! When I went to plug up the hose water came out of the dishwasher drain hole, because they test them first. I almost thought it had been returned."
"Pros;1. Doesn't need a hose connection to run. Very important - if it worked (See Con #1).2. Fits on countertops and rolling carts easily. Very important.3. Looks nice on counter alongside other appliances, sort of. Aesthetic, but not necessary.4. Window is nice to be able to see in. Amusing, but not necessary.Cons:1. Description said it holds enough water in it's own dedicated tank for multiple load runs, but the washer absolutely *refuses* to run unless the tank is completely full of water. This means you have to top it off Every Single Time you run it (This does not work me. Especially since the pitcher only holds so much water, and my sink hose barely reaches the fill hole).2. If the washer is not completely full of water, it makes a horrible grinding noise that doesn't stop until you realize what's wrong and how to fix it (fill the water tank back up until the machine beeps at you with several *piercingly* loud beeps).3. Steam vent is only on the left side (your right when facing the machine) and the only space I can fit it is directly to the right of my sink, against a wall. This is a problem.4. Soap is not always rinsed entirely off from dishes on shorter modes. Be VERY aware of how much soap you put in; if you think you put in enough, put less.5. Air dry option doesn't dry dishes at all.6. Pouring water into the flush hole on top is *very* difficult to do without spilling water everywhere, and I have decently steady hands and very good hand-eye coordination. Flush design with no funnel is a design flaw.7. If the washer needs to be placed under a cabinet, you cannot access the water fill hole. As well, forget about using any of the space above the washer for at least 15"" inches if you need to use a pitcher to pour, or at least 6"" if you're able to use a sprayer/hose of some sort.8. Doesn't fit dinner plats unless at an angle. Yes, I know the description states this, but what it doesn't state is that even putting one normal sized dinner plate in there severely limits what else you can put inside. I *only* recommend this washer for someone who owns two place settings worth of dishes maximum, otherwise you'll just end up washing the dishes that don't fit by hand, or having to run two loads for one meal's worth of dishes for three + people. It's honestly less effort to just wash an entire meal's worth of dishes by hand than to deal with the above-mentioned issues.Overall:Nice idea, cute aesthetic design, but execution is lacking in some fundamental ways.Used it one week and all of the hassle is just NOT worth $400. Maybe $150 or less. But definitely NOT $400.You're already paying $400+, spending another $20-50 for something that works better."
Worked well for 3 years. Started getting E3 error and contacted Farberware. They do not support this product. Also need a new door gasket and they will not supply even the part #s so I could order one. They responded by telling me to take it to a service professional but could not guarantee that they would be able to get the parts. And then told me that they do support their products? Again worked great for 3 years but when support was needed it was not there. I have researched and it is possible this was manufactured by Midea who also makes the Comfee model for what that is worth I am going to try and contact them to see if I can get parts. A bit frustrated I bought this model because of the name and was disappointed with their response and lack of support.
"You fill this machine manually, even when using a water line (you still have to manually fill the internal tank then shut off the water). Otherwise you use the included pitcher to fill the tank. You must have the unit powered on so you can hear the beep during filling when the tank is full.Mine seemed to have a struggle dissolving the Finish Advanced dish washing detergent powder. Powdered cleaner will not dissolve during the short wash cycle. I'm going to investigate if there exists a liquid detergent in stores locally.For a counter top machine the port to add water is on the top of the machine at the back so if used under an upper cabinet you'll need to be able to slide it forward to add water, then slide it back into position.To drain it comes with a ribbed grey plastic hose you lay across the counter and hang in the sink which limits the working location, it must be within a few feet of the sink since the hose is only about 3ft long. Cross tip screw driver needed to attach the hose and tighten the hose clamp.Inside the box, the machine is smaller than the inside of a dorm size refrigerator.The manual is poorly written with omissions and really lousy translations to English.Basically, you un-pack the machine, remove all the stuff inside the washer (hoses, fruit basket, two styrofoam grippers on the spinning nozzle, pitcher, and the silverware shelf). You unwrap and attach the drain hose, load it with dishes and detergent, close the door, plug-in, turn-on, add water (3 pitcher fulls) until it beeps, then select the cycle and press START. (the unit really only needs to be powered on when adding the third/final pitcher of water).It did a decent job of washing dishes and silverware. The internal LED only runs for a couple minutes which is handy to make sure nothing is hanging down preventing the spinning thing from spinning.You will spill water filling the tank, so be mindful of things around the machine that cannot get wet."
"So this product works, but everything I've washed has a lot of residue on it, esp the silverware. I use Cascade platinum liquid and only the small amt suggested. The normal cycle takes just over 2 hrs. It fits less than the pics show, but living alone I don't create a ton of dishes. Honestly the only reason I'm not returning is that I live in a 3rd floor walk up and this thing is heavy! I wouldn't recommend, but it does seem like it cleans."
"I receveived a unit that has damage on front cover. I bought it as a recycle here that was only supposed to have box imperfections. It was also missing the metal tie for the hose.Con:  It takes 2 hours and 10 min to do a load.  That is a LONG time for such a small load. I tried the quick wash cycle, 40 minutes.  It leaves the load totally wet.  You would have to take out the dishes and dry them yourself or put them on a drying rack and wipe out the unit, to use this on a regualr basis.  It just doesn't seem worth the counter space for me.-And it appears take up much more space than it seems, when I meaured out the dimensions, due to the bulk of it.-It is fairly loud for the whole 2 hours and 10 min. I wouldn't put it on while I sleep or watch tv.-It doesn't save much water, by the time you let water run to get it hot to put in it and also while you are pouring it in.  Turning off water in between pouring but also if you did by hand while washing would not be a lot different.Pro-Having a dishwasher is nice.  It held 4 large plates and about 3 cups and some silverware. I put an airfryer oven pan in it and it holds more but not a lot.-It is a pretty white, clean look-watching it through the glass is fun and entertaining.  I took a video for my adult son-he got a good lough at me!I wish I liked it more, but I don't.  It doesn't seem worth it to wash a few dishes that would take me 5-10 minutes to do."
"I'm writing this review to express my disappointment with the Farberware countertop dishwasher. While it seemed like a convenient option at first, I've been constantly battling the E1 error code. This code supposedly indicates a drainage issue, but my dishwasher seems to drain just fine.Following the troubleshooting steps in the manual proved useless. I even tried cleaning the drain filter thoroughly, hoping that would solve the problem. Unfortunately, the E1 error keeps popping up, interrupting cycles and leaving me with dirty dishes.For a countertop dishwasher at this price point, I expected much better reliability. The constant error code interruptions are frustrating and make using the dishwasher more of a hassle than a convenience.If you're considering this dishwasher, be aware of the potential E1 error issues. Where you may see the name “Faberware” and think, “this is a brand name that I should trust”, think again. I would recommend looking for other options that offer a smoother washing experience."
I have to roll the dishes out onto door and leave them for several hours to dry. Would like to just unload and reload quickly.
"Code was not in use, just started buzzing while we slept. Was never hocked up to water always filled with the strayer.  not lasting two full years is very disappointing"
"One of the only available portable models that can be filled without a sink faucet attachment so choices are limited. Unfortunately we have a fancy schmancy pulldown sink faucet in a rented apartment without threads and I loathe hand washing dishes!I will say this dishwasher worked wonderfully until it didn't work at all. Started getting an E3 code  1 year and seven months after purchase date (E3 - Not reaching proper temperature The heating tube is malfunctioning. Needs to be repaired by a qualified service professional).Cost works out to $22 a month for this ""disposable"" appliance. The manufacturer of this Farberware branded product is a mystery, no online support available, website doesn't recognize model number, etc.Doesn't seem worth the trouble to send away for servicing so plan on buying a new one every few years.Also for a small family of two, we had to run the machine multiple times just to clear a days worth of dishes now that everyone is working from home, breakfast lunch dinner. Wish there was a two tier model available to hold taller / more dishes.This dishwasher is just slightly too tall to push under the kitchen cabinets so we have it on a rolling cart. But since we're using it so often the cart stays parked in front of the sink and we just push it around the kitchen to get to the blocked cabinets and only put it away when we have company. Lame."
"It’s an adorable, compact, easy to use dishwasher, but I’ve had “water won’t reach proper heat” error messages after just a few times using it. I owned another model before and less than a year later had other error issues. It also doesn’t dry the dishes - so that’s a drag, too."
Worked mostly fine for 2 years. Then I got an e4 error. Followed tips online to just turn it on its side to drain excess water and it did fix it for another year. Then yesterday water started pouring out of the bottom of the unit. just took it to the dump. bought in june of 2021 lasted until may of 2024.
"We really wanted this to work for us. We are about to have a baby and we were hoping to use it to wash baby bottles and pump parts for my wife. We were attracted to this model specifically because it is advertised as having a baby care mode. We expected that the dishes and bottles would be dry when the cycle completed but everything is still wet at the end so we still have to spend the time drying.The biggest complaint that we have about the dishwasher is that it does not heat up to the stated temperatures. This units ability to sterilize is in question. We are going to buy a baby bottle washer/sterilizer instead. If you are not too concerned with this unit heating up to the stated temperatures, and only use it periodically, it may work well for you.It is very easy to use and to set up. It is a little more noisy than we would like. We are bummed that we have to return it."
We bought this in hope of cleaning bottles and pumping items. It had good space to place all items but the water pressure is high enough that’s tripping all items which results in poor wash. The wash cycle is also very lengthy at 2 hours which doesn’t help. Requires more than 5 liters of water for each cycle.This product would be more useful if it supported manual control of cycles and uses less water.
"So I've had this unit and it's been working ok. But there are two things that cripple it for my use case. First off is the internal size. It's great if you have a lot of flat ware and cups. bowls become an issue if they have steep sides then you can't get as much in. Same goes for the small tuperware bowls. getting them set up properly so the jets get them becomes a skill to be learned.But the BIG crutch........ there is no where to put any kind of rinse aid. so some dishes will come out with very hard spots or even rings. I've actually stopped using it because of this as just washing by hand ensured I wasn't grossed out. I really wish there was a way to ad a rinse aid, maybe it would fair better.If you're looking for a counter top washer, I honestly would say to try your best to get one of the others with a built in dispenser etc. Only get this if you really really have zero choice because of space( as was my case)"
"Farberware has a larger size portable dishwasher that I would have preferred, but this is the only one I could find that allows you to pour in the water instead of hooking it up to the faucet, which was not an option for me.  This dishwasher only holds a couple of place settings, so if the larger Farberware dishwasher is an option, buy that one.PROS:  It really saves water.  I hate dirty dishes in the sink, and my water takes forever to heat up.  I got this dishwasher because I felt like I was constantly running the water to wash a dish or two.  The dishwasher also heats the water well.CONS:  In addition to the small capacity, there is no option to add rinse aid.  The dishes come out spotty and somewhat damp.  The drainage hose can also be a challenge.  It needs to be secured, or it will spray water everywhere.  Draining into a bucket is an option that might work better for some.  I also think this is really expensive for its size.I recently moved to Hawaii, and dishwashers are not nearly as prevalent as they are on the mainland.  I hate constantly washing dishes.  If you don't mind washing dishes, I would not purchase.  You really have to hate washing dishes to justify the price and limited features."
"The size of this little machine is amazing. I’ve got a small studio kitchen and this fit nicely on the counter. Another pro is that you don’t have to hook it up to the sink - you can fill the water tank on top. Since we use our sink for a portable washer, disconnecting and reconnecting them constantly would be annoying so I really appreciate this feature.  It is also super quiet! I had it running while watching tv 10 feet away and it didn’t bother me. There was no leaking or mess. The clear front and interior light are pretty cool. The soap dispenser is a little indent on the front door. There is also a helpful suction cup on the drain hose so you can position it well.The cons are that it doesn’t fit very many dishes, even compared to other countertop dishwashers. I think this is because of its smaller size. It has a higher price tag. Similar to other countertop models, the wash cycle is pretty long, clocking in at 130 minutes for a full wash and dry. I also was a little disappointed with the quality of wash of some champagne classes that still had smudges after a full wash/dry cycle. I tried the rapid function and it washed adequately. I have not yet tried the other functions.This would be best suited to a household of no more than 2 people due to its limited capacity, but it’s a good workhorse for its size."
I was thinking I was smart by filling it with hot water. It seems like the internal pump is not able to pump the hot water so it’s gets funky errors. Every so once in a while it throws a fit and give me an E1 error. Which usually if I leave it alone for an hour and come back it works fine.
"UPDATE: After 2.5 years, the hinge mechanism broke through the plastic clips that attached to the door, and is no longer functional. An appliance should last at least 5 years, so Ive changed my rating from 5 starts to 2.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I got the version with the window in itOther reviewers have been quick to note the easy installation requires no plumbing. I noticed, however, there were no reviews from people who had plumbed it in like a regular dishwasher. I like this option better, since the hoses stay out of sight. I can also confirm it works. The unit has an automated fill valve that opens when it needs water and shuts off when it doesn't. The drain has a pump, so the drain line needn't be directed completely downward, despite what it says in the instruction manual. I plumbed the drain line to the sink drain line right above its U trap, which is actually above the level of my dishwasher since I installed it under the sink. No installation related problems yet.In terms of performance, it's very good. I bought this to replace my 15 year old Equator countertop unit, and this Faber ware cleans much better and more reliably.TWO MONTH UPDATE: Still working excellently. This is a phenomenal dishwasher. The only complaint I have is that there's a ""blind spot"" in the bottom toward the door that that water doesn't get to, so that part periodically needs to be cleaned by handTHREE MONTH UPDATE: still works great! I use it at least once a day, so I guess that's somewhere between 100 and 200 cycles at this point. I like that the food trap is very easy to remove and clean and that the silverware tray is easily removable, making it easier to wash a bunch of tall things at the same time"
"Mechanically this works fine, but I noticed the washing temperature for the rapid cycle is 122 degrees and for the normal cycle it’s 158 degrees.  I looked it up and both are below the recommended temperature of 165 degrees (usda website).  I haven’t had a problem so far, but then I live alone and don’t have sick kids getting their germs all over my dishes and silverware."
"After less than 4 weeks of using this dishwasher for only baby bottles and breast pump parts, this dishwasher has begun to have condensation in the display window, water pooling at the bottom of the display window, and the dishwater dispenser at the top of the machine does not spin and only drips water while washing the dishes. I attempted to contact Customer Service using the seller's information on Amazon, but the agent could not help me and gave me another telephone number to call for Faberware products. The Faberware telephone support has the worst hours of operation, closing daily at 4:30 pm EST. After 4 weeks, I have not found time to contact customer service about my concerns about their product. I'm a hardworking 8 weeks postpartum mom who wants to replace what appears to be a faulty dishwasher.I have since stopped using the dishwasher. This washer was not worth the price for only 4 weeks of use. If it did not have the condensation issues, I would have given it 3 STARS because it doesn't clean the bottles well. The dishwasher has too few low-pressure water jets to clean the inside of bottles properly."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Nice size… Only fits 12” plates at an angle. Neatly made inside.I hate that the tubing that drains to the sink is a hard plastic tube. You have to wrestle it to shape how you need it to reach. It should definitely be silicone so it’s flexible. Also the suction cup to attach it to your sink is complete worthless, cheaply made crap. Considering the price, a much better quality suction cup should be attached. You have to slam it against your sink to get it to stick because of the tubing being so hard and resistant to movement.Looking forward to using it, but not 100% happy with the included parts.  Will update review after a few washes."
"I got this a while ago and I’m now realizing that there is mold build up on the door! I have to constantly wipe it out, even if I leave the door open to air out! Doesn’t dry all the way either and the baby setting is backwards, it sanitizes the bottles before it cleans it. Overall not worth the price. Thankfully my baby hasn’t gotten sick. I will definitely just be hand washing the bottles. What a waste of money."
"This unit works well most of the time.  I did one  normal cycle to clean it out and then used the Rapid setting only.  Since purchasing (June 25, 2021), this unit has reported the E1 error code three times:  one about 2 months ago, and two more time consecutively yesterday.  According to the manual, E1 is ""longer inlet time"".  The explanation says ""It is a drain problem. Call a plumber.""  If the drain component is defective, that is a manufacturing problem that the manufacturer should have to fix.  Call a plumber?  I don't see that working for me or the plumber.  Sending it back is impractical as I no longer have the box to this unit and finding a replacement box will be difficult.I like this unit and want to continue using it, but the errors are unacceptable.  I am now getting incomplete cycles regularly.  I might just have to toss this unit and get a different brand or go back to washing dishes by hand."
"Update:  the dreaded E1 thing has happened and this is now out of warranty and useless.  Used it for two months until the built-in arrived.  Recently tried it and the drain works, but the water never comes out of the spray arms before the beeping happens.---Due to backorders in major appliances, a replacement built-in dishwasher wash not available for a couple months.  Decided to pick this counter-top up to bridge the gap.  Learned to run a load for prep-ware before the meal, to allow a more a manageable load after each meal.  If you can imagine, we were often running this washer 6 times/day!When loading, be aware of items that protrude below the rack that block the rotating arm.  One of the plastic clips in the rack is extra low and barely clears the spinning water arm.  Too much weight can also cause that to bump or stop the arm.Our sink has a pull-out spout that happens to just reach the top fill opening.  Takes about 70 seconds to fill the water tank using our faucet.  I tended to use the RAPID setting.  To save a few moments, I actually start the RAPID setting and then fill the tank with warm faucet water.  The water temperature for each setting is displayed and the RAPID water temperature seemed appropriate for a mix of glass, ceramic, stainless, and plastics.The glass viewing window is a sort of mystifying entertainment to watch.  The interior has an LED light that goes off by itself.  Press the START button to wake the light back on and make sure the arm is spinning.In my opinion, all things that make sounds and especially ""beep"", should have user adjustable settings for volume, mute, etc.  The display is very informative and well conceived.Only once, did we experience an error message for ""overflow"", that was successfully cleared.  This product was just a hand-saver that worked hard and consistently well."
"I loved this washer until I noticed both of the door's hinges were rusting, and the plastic holding the hinge on the left was cracked and falling apart. Now the door is hanging by a wing and a prayer. Although I can still use the dishwasher, I have to be extra careful with the door when opening or closing. I don't think it will last much longer. Unfortunately, the window to return had just shut 7 days prior to noticing the problem and the warranty I bought through Amazon doesn't cover rust damage."
"This was easy to use and worked well for about 2 years.  Luckily I bought the insurance coverage.  It cleans dishes well but does not scrub have a disposal.  It uses less water than handwashing.  The bottom spinner stopped working.  I contacted Asurion, and they had no one to fix it so they refunded me.It is very quiet.  The cycle is pretty long but I don't mind that.  It would be good for a studio apartment.  Just set it and forget it.  I was very happy while it worked but I am unsure about getting another one if it won't last that long."
"Parents hoping for a time save, don’t waste your timeNew parents here doing bottle feeding and pumping, we spend a LOT of our time every day washing bottles and pump parts, then putting them in a sterilizer. We bought this hoping to save time and it caused us more problems than it solved.The “air dry” feature doesn’t work at all. After putting in a load of bottles and letting them “dry” for 8 hours, they were still soaked. So we would have to take everything out and put it into our sanitizer for a dry cycle.It would also leave a soap residue on parts even if we used less soap that what was recommended. So we’re typically have to rinse everything off after a wash.The placement and configuration of the water inlet meant pouring 3 full pitches at the top and often making a mess while trying to do it.Between the extra rinsing, the extra drying, and the time it takes to load it, we spent more time trying to use this than it took to just wash things manually. Don’t waste your time."
"I was a little nervous about buying a product from a mfg who appears to be spoofing a different reputable brand. And the warranty issues I've seen in the comments did make me nervous. So I'll reserve awarding any more stars for now. That said, I really like how this thing functions. It uses very little water compared to hand washing. It's cool to watch in operation. And, it's perfect for someone living alone for most of the week who doesn't want to wait three or four days before filling up and running a regular-sized dishwasher. The only reservations I have are (1) there's no room for anything bigger than a small sauce pan, and (2) leaving the door open after the wash to allow the interior to air dry makes me nervous. I can't leave it just cracked. It's all the way open (and thus protruding into my kitchen area and making me nervous it'll be run into by a distracted child or an oblivious me) or it's shut all the way and won't dry naturally.  Anyway. for what it is, so far so good...."
"Arrived in a box that appeared to have been previously opened.  Set it up and didn't heat the water well.  Finally threw an E3 error and shipped it back as a return.  I did get a full refund with no issues, because it all happened in first week of getting it.  If you decide to try it, open and use quickly and determine if it's a dud quick.  Also make sure you measure the space under your cabinets for this."
"I wanted so badly to love this, but alas, I can't despite having several features i liked (Baby/steam cycle, fruit cycle).  It's great at washing a properly loaded load, and sucks at drying the same load. If I wanted to hand dry 3 loads if baby bottles and everything they entail every day, I'd keep this for the other features; unfortunately, I bought this to make my life with a new baby easier and all it did was create more work and take up more space on my counter than my other sterilizer + dryer."
"I got this for my tiny apartment because I truly hate hand washing dishes.  I intended to put it on the counter next to the sink.  But it sits under a cabinet and without the faucet adapter, I had to stand there longer than I wanted to slowly pour water into the top intake.  It only held 4 8"" plates, 1 small pasta strainer, 3 8oz glasses and a handful of silverware.  At the end of the 40 minutes quick cycle, I had a few clean dishes, that I could have hand washed much faster.  The temp gage on the front indicated the water never got over 120 degrees F.  So, not hot to sanitize the dishes. I'll try it out a few more times, but I am not sure this tiny thing is worth all the effort.*update*The coupler the product page recommends you use, DOES NOT FIT the intake hose.  I got an adaptor to make the first adaptor fit and it still didn't fill the tank up because the interior diameter of the hose that comes with the washer is narrower than a pencil.  The fill hose is worthless.  I'll have to pull the machine out from under the cabinet and fill it by hand forever.  The 'glass' cycle' is a  joke.  It goes through an hour long cycle, then just sits motionless for the remaining 40 minutes of the cycle."
"To get normal sized 11"" plates to fit you have to play tetris to make sure nothing is going to cover something else and stop it from getting washed. the amount of time it takes to fit the plates properly is as long as it would have taken to wash them by hand. The fill hole is very splashy and makes a mess. There is a seal at the bottom of the door that attracts a lot of grease and i can never seem to clean it well enough to stop the whole inside from smelling bad. It does a good job of making glassware shine and thats about it."
"I was so excited about receiving this product. I got it to strictly use for my pump parts and babies bottles. However, when I opened it up there was powder in it and water in the filter area. It looked like it had already been used."
"First unit was flooding the basin immediately because the pump meant to drain was faulty, resulting in an error code and bombing out of cycle. I thought maybe I got a dud and went the hassle of trying to get another unit and ship the old one back. Second unit pump works but it leaks on the left side and the heater element won’t heat up to over 80deg F, resulting in an error code and bomb out of cycle. The odds of getting one dud in normal manufacturing practice is 15% for cheap Chinese built to print electronics, the odds of getting two duds in a row is 2%. It is more likely the design and components are fundamentally flawed. Save your money and look elsewhere."
"I’ve had it about 2.5 years and I think I’m done fixing it, and replacing it now.  Works well when it works, lots of little things break or jam up, leaky.  It did usually get things very clean and is probably perfect if you just need to wash baby bottles or coffee cups."
Nothing dries. Nothing. I've used the air circulation feature and still everything is 100% still wet. I'd love to return it but the box was too large for my apartment and I had to get rid of it right away because we couldn't move in the apartment without doing that. It's pretty frustrating to spend so much money for something that doesn't work esp for this money. It's also insanely large for how few dishes it fits.
It works well enough but is too small for basic items like plates. You will not fit any pots or pans in this unit. I have primarily used it for cups and cutlery. The unit does not have an adequate drying system and the dishes will stay wet. There are too many downsides to recommend this item.
"This was a big purchase for my husband and I, it took us a while to bite the bullet and finally get a countertop washer because we weren’t sure how well it would work and it’s pricey. We chose this one, in part, because it’s a familiar name brand. I think overall it does a really great job cleaning the dishes, however, a few days after we got it and began using it I noticed the dish rack was rusting already. It’s been about 2 1/2 months since we got it and I see more rust in another area. I should note that it has a coating but the coating is missing in some areas and that’s where it’s rusting, so the coating appears to not be durable or came damaged that way and I just didn’t notice. I’d be happy just to receive a new rack and hope that it doesn’t chip and rust again, I’m concerned about the damage the rust may cause in the machine and shorten the life of the dishwasher which would be a bummer for us who are on a very tight budget but chose to invest in something like this. I suppose we’ll see."
"It's a nice little machine.  I don't use it often - which perhaps speaks more to me than anything else - but it did a good job for its admittedly (and intentionally, my needs are minimal) capacity.  So, why the low marks?  Well, even after incredibly minimal usage, it died a week shy of two years from when I got it.  E4 error means that there's either a blockage or a leak...and there's no blockage.  And of course, the warranty is only good for ONE year.  And I'm betting it's going to cost more to fix than the replace.Looks like I'm going to be buying a new countertop dishwasher.  Anyone got any recommendations?"
I bought this in 2019.  And it worked fine.  About 7 months later It started to leak water from the door.  I called the number they gave . And was told there was nothing they could do. ( Because they no loner made parts for this model.  OK?????  So after 8 phones calls the woman on the phone said it MIGHT be the Gasket around the door. And they did not have anything in stock. BUT they would PULL it off of another washer and send it to me. ( Can you believe that!! )  A few weeks later the Gasket came. And I installed it. It still  leaked.  It turned out it was the seal around the glass on the inside of the door that was leaking.  Due to the door being PLASTIC . So I ended up resealing around the glass on the INSIDE of the door. And that stopped the leak.  BAD COUSTOMER SERVICE.
"The good:  This looked sleek and good, it seemed simple to setup, and was.  The cons:  For some reason the waste water didn't go out the waste hose.  It leaked out on the floor, not from the hose but from under the machine itself.  It also returned an error code that required a service tech. visit.  Since this was on the first try on just returned it.  No manufacturing is perfect.  I gave three stars because it looked and felt like it was a good counter dishwasher and had I got a different one that worked right out of the box I would have been happy with it.  I may try this dishwasher later.  I think I just one of the ones that QC didn't check.  I hope you all have better luck."
I wanted to love this washer SO MUCH. I WAS TIRED of washing bottles and pump parts x3 times a day and drying. It’s too much for someone who breastfeeds and pumps. So I was more then willing to splurge on a $350 mini dishwasher specifically for baby items. However not only did it leak all over the counter but it didn’t even wash the bottle properly. There was still milky residue In the bottles and the pump parts will still greasy. I’m so bummed I really needed help trying to run a house hold and tend to my infant. So I thought I’d cut an hour or two down in washing but I guess not. :/
Doesn’t actually fit under standard counter without having to hard plumb water connections. Drain hose fell off twice soaking kitchen floor. Drying feature randomly stopped working and hasn’t resumed working. Takes about two hours … dishes need to be cleaned by hand before cleaning. 😂
"At first we were excited to have an extra hand around the house. But filling it with water every time was a hassle as we could not get the hose to attach to the sink or pipes under the sink, strike 1.Secondly, we don’t mind the really long wash time, its best if it takes long to really wash the dishes.. if it washed them properly. Often times we would find our dishes were still greasy and food was still stuck on them. We’d have to remove some of the dishes and end up washing them by hand anyway. Totally defeats the purpose of having a dish washer, strike 2.Lastly, it’s a little heavy, kinda bulky, and barely fit under the cabinets as we didn’t have anywhere else to place it. The constant refilling for use is also a little inconvenient. Only reason we have it still is because we missed the window for returns. Yay."
"I want to educate/warn anyone about my current experience. I'm disappointed in Farberware and Assurant.After 2 years I discovered the dishwasher rack is rusting apart and can no longer be used. The mnufacturer warranty ended after one year but I purchased Assurants 5 year protection plan (I'm still within coverage period) and they won't cover it because according to Assurant, it is considered ""cosmetic."" I had to pay $25 to buy the replacement rack from Farberware. But I've already paid about $15 for the extended warranty when I first purchased the dishwasher.I will see if I can escalate this and provide an update for anyone who is interested but I would not recommend the extra warranty or this product as both have left me dissatisfied at the moment.Me ranting now...I've never had to buy a dishwasher rack because the original rusted. Is it normal for a rack to only last 2 years?Why pay for the extra warranty if they won't cover parts?"
"Bought for the RV and it ended up being stored. Used it 2-3 times and each time I had to carefully support the drain tube.  It seems that any back pressure will cause it to fault.  We did like the fact you can connect to a water source, or use the pitcher to fill the clean water up.  Even has a nifty beeper to let you know when the water tank is full.  Overall, it was ok.  $450 is a lot of dishes done by my kids…"
Wasted money. Farberware won't do anything to help.
This was easy to use and it's small and holds enough dishes for probably 2 people through out the day 2 dishes a meal etc. But anything more than that and you'll have to do them by hand but it does get the job done not to worry about that! I have to return it because I've got way to many dishes and not enough space in that thing.
It was perfect for me because I needed the tank feature  as the only room I had for it was not near a water source.  My only problem was the plastic pitcher used for pouring water in the tank.  Its lip was too wide making pouring the water in messy. For me.  I have a plastic watercan  with a spout made for watering indoor plants  that worked much better for getting the water into the unit.
First off trying to set it up was extremely confusing because the drain and the water inlet are opposite of what is in the directions and the drain did not have a rubber plug but the water inlet. So the directions are wrong.After I figured that out now came the issue of setting it up. The electrical cable is short so I had Limited space to choose from. It is so bulky that it doesn't fit under my cabinets. My only choice was to balance it on my sink.Now comes the test run. I try running it and is starts leaking from the door. I shut it off and remove the basket and then I start getting a E4 error. Also it produces a burning smell when it's running which is worrisome.I drain it and tried again.  Error cleared but it's still leaking from the door.I'm thinking of returning it because it's been nothing but a headache and clearly leaks. Plus it hardly holds any silverware and it's really noisy.
I had another one like this before but bigger it was great this one is pretty good although a little smaller it will fit one load if you angle it right 4 plates 3 bowls 2 cups that’s it the best part of this is it really only needs a drain to work which helps the compactability you have the option to hook a hose to the sink to get water or you can just pour two gallons of water into the top two speeds and an fresh air dryer helps out really good buy
"I’ve used this for a about a week and a half now, it works as advertised. I would give it 5 stars but when I received it, it had a deep scratch on it from the beginning."
We had an issue with the E4 code out the gate then it seemed to stop a few days later. We have had it since January this year and every other time we use it stops halfway through the cycle and has the e4 error code and leaves a pool of water on my counter the past few weeks. Not very impressed that something that was supposed to help is potentially going to cause more problem from water damage and waste of money.
"First unit I received was actually leaky - the door would not shut properly. Luckily I received a replacement from Amazon. This second unit works well in terms of cleaning, but have noticed a brownish ooze that comes out of the rubber seals even when running empty loads. I suspect it may be some sort of adhesive that is bonding the rubber seals to the dishwasher, but am not 100% sure. EIther way, doesn't seem safe to be washing plates that you eat off of with that stuff around..."
This is called a “countertop” dishwasher. I don’t think it unreasonable to expect to be able to optimize counter space by having it under one of the upper cabinets. This cannot be done in a reasonable way with this appliance. The fill port for the water tank is on the BACK of the dishwasher top. This is the dumbest design choice ever. This means that you either have to have it always out taking up usable counter space. Or you have to keep shifting it in and out from under your upper cabinets to be able to fill the tank and use.Save your time and money and wait for the BOB to become available in your area. It actually fills from the front which would stick out from under your cabinets.
The only frying pans it will wash are the very small ones. The average frying pan is too big. The handle would need to be taken off before it would fit inside the machine.
I waited over a month for it to blow water out the front and not drain from the tub I am beyond pissed sold by amazon said they tested it I doubt thatEdit: recieved a replacement from amazon that so far is working I have my fingers crossed that it will last for a long time but we will see upgrading my rating to 3 stars. Still had a lot of trouble with the 1st one that wasnt worth it.
I really like this dishwasher but the hose doesn’t work properly. It took 4 different tries to find an adapter for the hose because the manual gives very little information. Finally got the right one and the hose leaks because the seal is bad on one end. I can still use it but it’s annoying to refill from the top since I have to move it every time. If the hose would work then I’d give it a 5.
"Dishwasher gone mobile! Yeah can use it anywhere as long as you have electricity and some water source. Excellent for little vacation homes, apts, rvs, with no built in ones. Only a few items can washed so if one has a sink full of dishes , big pots and pans probably won’t work for you. Left spots on dishes maybe need to use a rinse aid. The front plastic lid started peeling. Called customer service # disconnected.  Rather expensive and no extended warranty is available"
"I'm in the process of returning this. First off, even if it did work, it is pretty large, and takes up a ton of counter space, and doesn't even fit under my cupboards, and even if it did, makes pouring water into the top pretty tricky.But, it won't even run for me. I'm generally savvy with appliances, tech, etc. I build my own PCs configure my own networks, etc. So I doubt it's user error but if it is, I'm failing to see where. I've consulted the instructions, Amazon's question section, Youtube videos, etc. I finally emailed the company, and they said they try to get back in THIRTY days, which, is outside of my return window so I'm just returning it. Absolute waste of $400 and definitely not worth it for how few dishes it actually holds. Even if it worked, the ""rapid"" cycle is 40 minutes. That is not rapid at all. And the normal is over 2 hours. Just to wash a tiny handful of dishes. Not for $400, no thank you."
"Whatever water temperature you place in the hole seems to be the temperature it uses to wash, it doesnt heat the water before use. Bought for babys bottles but the baby cycle on the dishwasher steams before washing. So it steams the milk and other products on the bottles before washing with the soap. Now steam leaks out of bottle part of door and makes it warm. Also I cant trust the nipples to be in there because it doesnt wash well enough. If you place hot enough water into the hole the goal temperature seems to be reached.Its really easy to use and set up. Very small and extremely convenient."
"I bought this mini dishwasher for washing baby milk bottles just because it has BabyCare. After using it few times, I returned it because of few reasons: missing fruit basket, dry mold is a joke, and visible milk stains after 2h wash. The most horrible thing is the glass milk bottle looks very clean after wash, but if you wash it with running water again, both inside and outside are very soapy!!! I already feed my baby few bottles that are cleaned by this dishwasher. Now I’m very worried my 6 months old baby. This dishwasher should never be sold in Market anymore!"
"So first impressions not great, first one I got was defective, couldnt run any cycles, would start and soon later show an E1 error on the panel, I was able to get a new one sent to me relatively easily, spoke to a nice lady on the phone. Anyways, the replacement came in today, not defective thankfully, however, Im not super impressed with how well it cleaned. Ill be trying other detergents, but the utensils I have were left with what looked like food and detergent residue. It did clean my glass plates and spatula okay though. But yea, Im gonna try different detergent and see if that makes a difference, I did use finish brand tablets in case you're curious. Ill come back and edit if things improve."
"The unit is fine, and seems to clean dishes well. However, the tray that holds silverware arrived broken. It had been taped up inside the dishwasher and the prongs on the tray had broken due to the angle. Amazon rep was unable to reach the manufacturer for a replacement, and my direct contact with the manufacturer hasn't yielded results yet either."
"I was really excited about this purchase because I knew it was going to save me HOURS of hand washing baby bottles, pump parts, etc. Unfortunately, after testing it out, I realized everything was soaking wet when the cycle ended. Is this normal? Does it not dry the contents inside?"
"This is my first dishwasher ever and I'm almost 40. I live in a small house with a small kitchen. I felt silly at first loading my dishes, cups and silverware in this dishwasher and only washing my pans. It has been two weeks and I'm pretty sure I have never made a better purchase in my life. My husband I cook and eat constantly and this little bugger has cleaned up my sink and given me back some time to do things I would rather be doing. It is worth every penny and every inch of space. UPDATE:NOVEMBER 12TH 2022 IT IS HEADED TO THE DUMP AS IT NO LONGER WORKS  1 YEAR AND 7 MOS......I WILL NOT BE BUYING ANOTHER"
"I like everything about it, other than it leaked after a few uses. The machine is leaking from the door, I've had to place a towel in front to catch all the water."
Didn't like that the pitcher and water hose attachment for it is missing.
I received my order about 8 hours ago did to runs on it and in the middle of the second one E3 code pops up. I'm calling customer service tomorrow since they're closed. Hopefully they help otherwise I'm returning.Update: It's less than a week from the day i received my order and this dishwasher doesn't want to work. I called customer service and they told me E3 Code means defective. They said there's no fix for E3 but the manual says call plumber. The rep over the phone said don't do what the manual says. This sounds sketchy already.She basically said if the E3 pops up you better have warranty or 30 days otherwise they can't help you. I'm not risking it on exchange it. It was a horrible experience having to carry this around couldn't wash my dishes depending on this thing. If they had a solution for the E3 i would of considered keeping it/swapping but if you get unlucky once your warranty is up that's $400 down the drain in 1 year.
Overall the dish washer does great at the actual cleaning job. It has a poor design unfortunately. It leaks really bad out from underneath. Water goes all over the floor each time we run it. It would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the awful leaks
The product works pretty good my only complaint is it was obviously used. There was food in the bottom when I opened it up and all the papers in it were soaked with water. I paid full price and it REALLY makes me mad it wasn’t listed as refurbished.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Its only been one day I am impressed. It cleans good. I used the cascade platinum. I poured the hottest water my sink will give which came it about 125 to 130 F. I recommend reading the directions before opening its not many pages. Will try to review again in six months.Update late: Ended up having to send the first one back it stopped spinning. Second on was great. I recommend running a cycle once a month with bleach to prevent a mold problem. Other then that I love it. Had it for a year now but I don't use it often.After a year or so it goes out. Starts falling apart. Definitely not worth the money.
"When I first got it I used it a few times and noticed that it’s not as powerful as I wish it would. I don’t want to hand wash before putting it through the dishwasher I might as well wash it myself. I wanted to see if I could make it work by getting stronger detergent but by the time I tested it out it was too late to return it. So I left it alone for a couple years, came back to it and now it doesn’t work at all because of some error that won’t go away and is not fixable… complete waste of money. I got rid of it months ago."
I was so excited to try this as I need help with dishes in my small space. I let it run for the full time which is about 2 hours. I hate a few utensils and 2 bowls in there so it wasn’t full at all. The dishes came out looking the same when I put them in there and food was harden on it. I did rinse before putting them in there as well. I immediately returned. You shouldn’t have to wash dishes before putting them in the dishwasher.
"Product arrived used. There was dirt everywhere and water inside. The note says to expect that it was tested beforehand but there’s a difference between testing and someone else using it for an extended period of time. There’s dirt literally inside the machine and stains at the bottom too. The parts attached to it were placed in all the wrong spots.When I tried to use the machine, it gave an error once it tried to dry the plates. Manual said it needed to be returned to the manufacturer.Even the part that seemingly worked, the wash cycle, seemed to NOT work as well. I removed two sets of plates/spoons/forks/glasses and it came out still filthy.As a girl who lives alone the only thing this gave me was grief and back pain. Lugging this around was the worst experience I had in 2022"
"We ordered this dishwasher for our camper. It worked great for a few cycles and then it stopped working. It had an error code that when googled, said the dishwasher was not repairable!?!In theory it was going to be awesome but we will continue hand washing for now.."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was very happy with how the dishwasher worked the first use but after that it hadn’t worked since. The dishwasher doesn’t spray the water it just fills up the bottom them drains it. Not sure why it stopped working so quickly when nothing else had been changed. Not worth the money to get one wash out of it. Also the dishes don’t dry even when it did clean them. It doesn’t do anything the whole run. I tried to contact the manufacturer got sent to wrong department then hung up on.
"Advertisement photo is a little misleading.  Standard size plates and bowls don't fit upright (10.5'' diameter plates).  The ones in the pic must be slightly smaller.  However it's easy to install and use, and does a great job cleaning the dishes."
"Love it’s functionality! Cleans dishes spotless. 2 negatives— pretty heavy if you plan to move it after use (RV counter space is precious so I move it after each use) which brings me to the second negative, water leaks out somewhere besides the drain hose so have a towel handy when you move it."
I was never able to get a wash cycle to run. Always got an error of E1. Not help from support.
Was way too small couldn’t even put all the dishes from one meal and I live alone sent it back
"Had the dishwasher ~3 months, worked great, then one day an E4 error showed up and we couldn't fix it. No problem I thought, since this product was for my business I figured we had a 1-year warranty if anything were to go wrong. I called the number on the manual and was told that that number was only for microwaves and to contact amazon. Contacted amazon, I was initially told that I could request a replacement, great - I've always had good customer service experiences with amazon before, which is why I use them for my business. Turns out when they went to process the replacement there was magically nothing they could do. They couldn't even help me figure out an alternative of whom to contact to make a warranty claim. Super disappointed in Amazon and the fact that this has an advertised warranty that apparently is worth nothing."
"I had high expectations for this dishwasher. Cute compact design. It had a window for entertainment! It has a steam feature. ( I can autoclave  my dishes. ) What more could I want?  Alas, I wanted it to work. : (I followed directions, Not that they were followable. I stole a designated outlet away from my clothes dryer hoping the kitchen plug just had a voltage issue, I went on youtube and watched long winded videos. That persistent, annoying,  E1 error code would not stop. Apparently, that's appliance talk for the water wouldn't sprinkle, flow or DRAIN. I had to turn that heavy thing upside down to get the water out before i returned it. If anyone owns a small portable dishwasher that they are happy with, please let me know."
This product was very pleasing to the eye ! Very quiet when running . Havent had but few months the door started leaking around the bottom ! Was very disappointed ! Also it wasn’t big enough to hold enough dishes even for 2 piece setting !
"Crazy this things advertises that it can fit 12 inch plates and cannot even fit a 10.5 inch one standing up straight. Just outright lying, avoid."
"Worked great, unfortunately every time i used it it leaked all over my counter.It's not the soap, i tried to use it without soap and it would still leak."
Broke after less than a year. Had to toss it. Worked ok till then
"Mine did not fit my plates (they were too tall somehow) so it was rarely used. On about the 6th or 7th use (4 months after warranty ended), the top sprayer stopped working and now it has a permanent E1 error that occurs every time despite filling it with water manually instead of connecting to the tap. It honestly was not worth the price for me...super disappointing."
"When it worked it was great.  As soon as it went out of warranty, it died.  We called support and they told us that it was probably a dead control panel (the touch panel on the front of the machine), but that since we were days outside the warranty we were out of luck.  $400 for 1 year of dishwashing is a little beyond what I can justify spending.  This is beyond infuriating."
Got it  and it works goodBUTwe gave it back  just too small for us.Was easy to return.
"This thing is gigantic. Don't let the photos fool you! It is huge and deep, like an old tube tv. It takes up SO MUCH SPACE, and then it only holds about 4 plates. Not worth it -- we sent it back."
"It started leaking two weeks after purchase! This dishwasher will not remove any food or slight stains from silverware or dishes. Maybe my expectations were too high. In my opinion, It's almost like taking a water-gun and spraying your dishes with it rather than washing. I'm still puzzled on to how people can rate this dishwasher anything above three stars. I may give it one more try or try another brand since this was my first dishwasher."
"At just over 16 inches wide, it is a nice size with regards to counter space. However, the capacity is minimal. My dinner plates will not fit. Also, I am very disappointed in it's cleaning ability. If I have to wash the dishes before I put  them in, why bother?"
"Update.  Broke down.  Still within Farberware warranty period.  Error message requires repair by qualified service professional.  Customer service tel number in user's manual doesn't work.  Customer service email bounced.  I will report back if Farberware stands behind its one-year warranty.Update.  After many phone calls, I was unable to find a Farberware licensee to stand behind the warranty and repair the dishwasher.  I contacted Amazon to ask what could I do.  Without hesitation, Amazon sent me a replacement.  Thank you, Amazon."
"The absolute only reason I gave this three stars is definitely not because of the machine quality or performance; it just was so much larger and more cumbersome than expected. I’ve been shopping around for portable dishwashers, and I liked the shiny, black, sleek design and it seemingly fit all the measurements. I have absolutely no doubt that this machine will clean beautifully and efficiently, but it’s quite large. It literally took over my small apartment kitchen. Be aware that this one does require a hose hook up; the adapter worked perfectly for me, but I soon discovered that the best and most effective way to use this would be to store the dishwasher on a rolling cart of its own and make sure that the hose route is as straight as possible during hookup and use. It’s really just so much more work than I am willing to do—the whole reason behind getting a dishwasher being the elimination of extra work. I returned it and I’m getting one that has a top fill reservoir feature.  A little bit more on the size of this machine, it’s literally half the size of a regular size dishwasher so it has a large capacity and many features.  I would have kept it if I had more space."
"Let me start by saying that the product is absolutely amazing and if you're looking for a dependable portable dishwasher, get this one. It's absolutely amazing. I gave it three stars because of Amazon. They delayed our order so many times, and we pay for prime to have it on certain days. It was delayed 3 times and I'm not sure why. We were told that it was promised to come in one day, after speaking with a customer support representative, which wasnit true... I call again the following day after it was delayed again, and the only way I found out it was delayed was through me caling customer service. They were not updating the app nor the website on the status until AFTER we called in and made it a point to correct it... I just find it odd that the package was less than an hour away from our house yet they couldn't deliver it on time... I understand that Amazon drivers have a lot of orders to drop off, but it sat at the carrier location for many days... Other than that, the product is absolutely amazing. Cleans the dishes very thoroughly and we are very happy with it."
"I bought this back in July, installed it to its permanent home in September. we have used it to wash the few dishes that we use. now tonight (Nov. 30, 2024) this unit has started leaking water out of the back into my kitchen floor. looks like a very poor design by the manufacturer. other than the leaking water this is an awesome unit. I just hope that they fix this major problem before it causes someone to flood their home or burn it to the ground."
This product leaking after a couple of weeks.
"First time I used this, it leaked out of the back. I figured out that if I removed the black piece of cardboard insulation covering the back, it wouldn't leak anymore, but you can clearly see water in the tray in a gap in the back of the machine.This thing is so much bigger than I expected, and it would be a huge hassle to return it. I am just going to replace the cardboard with something that doesn't tuck into that gap because having something tucked into the gap is what caused water to leak out. I don't know if being able to see water in that gap is normal, but as long as it is contained in the machine and not leaking out onto my counter, I am happy.There was also fiberglass? insulation sticking out of the gap between the door and the bottom of the machine. It looked ugly. I pushed it back in, and it is still visible. I may need to take the door apart to put the insulation where it is supposed to be.I don't feel like the controls are very intuitive. I keep having to take out the manual to decipher the meaning of the different pictures on the display.It washes my dishes. So, poorly constructed/designed but functional."
The box it came in was a damaged but it was a thick cardboard. After I opened it up I saw there was some damage to the top and back. I just wanted it to work and there is no leaks. It is a little bigger than I thought but barely fits on my counter top. It's pretty quiet which is nice.
"So we set it up about 6 months ago despite buying it 18 months ago. ( we had a baby and life got hectic). It’s been working fine but lastnight it decided to break. Water backed up into it and destroyed all the tech in the bottom and the back so it is now useless. It was working perfectly fine, no leaks to anything until lastnight. It threw a code E4 and when we cleaned it out and restarted it, it started leaking from the bottom. Water got all inside its computing system and we don’t know why. It was a great little dishwasher until then but since we have only used it for 6 months it doesn’t make sense as to why it would break so easily. 300$ down the drain….literally."
Box came crushed at the corner and dishwasher came with a small dent but whatever. Dishwasher works great so far! I’ll edit the review if it doesn’t.
"I've had this dishwasher several months now. The packaging was great, beefed up with some metal framing and styrofoam. I was happy to see that, but somehow one of the corners still got dented in. Barely noticeable, so I decided to keep it. This dishwasher is lighter than the last countertop dishwasher I had. It doesn't seem to have internal heating elements, so that's probably the reason. The water temperature is what comes out of your tap, I think. It seems to cycle in & out of water intake during the wash - to regulate the temperature, I presume. This is a plus for me. I have hard water and it killed the heating elements in my last countertop d/w. This d/w may last longer. The water wand seems a little weak. It's not a strong spray. As a result, Eco setting for my lightly soiled dishes was not enough to thoroughly clean the dishes. I've since switched to the Normal setting and it works pretty good most of the time. I haven't tried the Heavy setting yet. I doubt it would clean heavy residue, but may be good for normal residue. Judging by the running time for each setting, the difference between, Eco, Normal, Heavy, etc, seems to be simply the running time. There seems to be no difference in the intensity of the water spray between the different settings. It has operated, so far, easily and without any problems. I'm OK with the weak spray, I just rinse better before stacking. Still easier and quicker than hand washing for me.  The instructions are adequate and easy to understand."
"I ordered my new dishwasher and was so excited to use it. I hooked it up, ( totally easy to hook up) loaded it, and turned it on. It was soo quiet! Eventually, though, an alarm went off that there was a leak somewhere in it. Well, not kiddin, there it was! So I cleaned up the mess, and called the number in the book! They got me all set up with a return. Very nice to deal with! I just wish Amazon had customer service IN the United States. They picked it up today. Very good customer service. I'm just bummed I don't have a dishwasher! Daaaaang!"
"Product showed up dented on the top, but otherwise good"
"After the first one I order got delayed several times and then lost in transit, my replacement finally got to me 2 weeks later. Needed an adapter for my sink. When I got it working I started leaking from the drain port on the dishwasher itself, as others have mentioned they’ve had happen. The dishwasher itself is 5 stars and amazing. If I can fix the leak I’ll revise the review. I don’t think the shipping was their fault either."
"Very difficult install for semi permanent installations where you will not be using faucet and the quick connect. None the piping is standard size.  You really want a plumber to come in if you will not be using the faucet for water supply.  Be prepared for two trips to your local home improvement store to match the sizes ,connections ,and converters.  After two trips to home depot , I still have a very very small drip leak from the drain connection that I will just haft live with. It very tight and snug.  I take a paper towel to wipe up the few drops of water after each wash.The dishwasher does it’s job.  It’s decent.  I like to do a pre rinse. Everything comes out clean. I have yet to stick  dirty dirty dishes straight into the machine. The manufacturer says you can. I would give this machine 3.5-4 stars if it was not for the difficulty of the installation and the slow leak on the drain that I suspect is manufactured defect."
It washes my dishes well. If you are a person that thinks you might need the separate faucet attachment. You won’t. The one you buy extra is the same one that already comes in the box. The only problem I have is it doesn’t dry the dishes at all. Even with the dry function the dishes are still just soaked so I either have to dry them off myself of open the washer and let them dry. Over all I like it. It was worth the money to me. When I got the washer it was wet on the inside but I’m sure it was just from them testing it.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Purchased 8/8/23. It has not yet reached a year. The dishwasher is noisy and has started to leak water. The dishes come out clean as long as you rinse first. The filter is easy to remove for cleaning. You’re not able to fit small cups on the cup rack like it shows. The overall performance of the dishwasher is great and easy to use. Unfortunately the leaking problem doesn’t appear to be fixable and will eventually cause the dishwasher to stop working.
"Was excited to setup and run as I could really use it in a house of 5 individuals cooking at the same time, but was disappointed to find that the faucet adapter piece that was supposed to be included was not. Had to find a replacement piece."
First thing is the little rack for cups. That is a joke. Unless you are washing your 5yr olds tea party dishes. That is my biggest complaint. Jury is still out on how well is washes. Due to the fact we have very hard water here. But the white residue left on the dishes did not start till we added the rinse agent. As far as size I guess I would not call it portable. But if you know how to load a dishwasher you can get quite a bit in it. Just make sure there is nothing blocking the soap. If it can't open all the way the pods do not dissolve completely. It is very easy to connect to faucet once it is set up. And the different wash cycles are nice to have.
The dishwasher worked pretty well until the pump stopped working a couple weeks ago. I use it about once a week so it's not like it's being HEAVILY used. Trying to figure out how to fix it has been a nightmare. I don't know if id purchase it again since it didn't even last a year before needing repairs
We’re a family of four with two kids under 3. We have lots of sippy cups and bottles so I ran it everyday. It only lasted 3 months before it started leaking and the motor smelled like it was burning up.
"After living in my rented home for 6 months with no dishwasher, I decided to get a countertop dishwasher on Amazon Prime Day in July. I got a good deal on this one and it came timely and looked great. The dish basket is well designed and it holds more than you would think. It does take a lot of room on the counter top though. Anyway when I tried to connect it to my kitchen faucet I found out that it is not compatible with the hose from a pull down sprayer faucet. I went online and ordered adapters. My son went online and ordered adapters but none of them work. One video online shows someone able to attach it after connecting a series of 4 adapters but you have to know not only diameter but thread size. We have spent and additional $50 on adapters but we cannot get them to work. I have not been able to use the dishwasher, we even tried wheeling it into the bathroom faucet like another person on the internet did, but it didn't work. I just think they should be clearer in the description that you may not be able to attach it. I would return it but it is 52 lbs. and I did not save the box, so I think that is out of the question. I am going to try to sell it on marketplace."
"I bought this in October, recieved it in November. It worked great for months, cleaned my dishes well, loved the little guy. Now its march and it went from Working fine to overflow error in one wash. The machine now can not fully drain so its basically useless.  Ive trouble shot the issues, the filter was shockingly clean for 4.5 months of use, the drain hose is clear, the propeller visible from the drain pan is clear. That leaves one possibility a faulty pump. 4.5 months of use x2 times per week and the pump crapped out. Unimpressed and sad because i really did like the washer.Calling customer service but i have low expectations.  Buyer beware you might want to go with a more expensive and reliable model.UPDATE, i took it apart, the drain hose takes a uturn immediately after exiting the drain opening. Stick a  wire in there and you can remove debre. Got it working again. Poor desight for a drain but fixable. It does leak a bit out the door  seal if you pack dishes close to the door. Once again not the best design but useable."
Does not wash very well. Sometimes the dishwasher pod is still in tact after the dishwasher did its job…. So that means the soap never washed. I don’t use the cheap pods….so I don’t understand…most of my mugs still have coffee in them… very disappointed
It worked great until the drain hose come off. It is a small rubber tube that you can not get out far enough to reattach.
"Bought this in Feb '23 (for reference, it's December '23). Unit stopped working within 2 weeks. Initiated a return and advised to ship back but the item did not come in a box, rather styrofoam and those reinforced cardboard beam-type of things. It was really well packaged and there was no damage, however, packaging is not conducive in the event you need to return the item due to malfunction. It's still sitting in my garage because I had to ship it back and had nothing big enough to fit it in without extensive searching online for a box to purchase (the ones at big box stores were either to small or too big to fit in my car to bring to UPS/FEDEX/USPS).With all of that being said, the unit is not small whatsoever and ""countertop"" is a stretch. It can sit in the counter yes, but it barely made clearance for my top cabinets. If you strategically place the dishes you can get a good amount in for a single person or maybe working couple who isn't home most of the day but it is not suitable for a family (although it would probably work if you used it in an outdoor kitchen/bar area that wasn't subject to the elements). It's about 24""x24"" so it takes up a considerable amount of space. It's loud but it does clean. I wouldn't purchase again simply because it ended up not working within 2 weeks (it wouldn't drain) and while the amazon return process in theory was relatively simple, the logistics of returning this just made it impossible. I hate that I have a useless, near-$300 item sitting on my garage counter with no way to return (bringing to an Amazon dropoff was not an option at the time). It was just brought to my attention that I had not reviewed this item."
"Washes well, gets plenty hot. Quiet except for the drain phase as the pump is very loud.  The drain point on this dishwasher is non standard making fixed installation to a drainpipe very challenging. It is threaded with non-pipe threads so swapping the hose/connector is an exercise in creativity. Would be nice if it came with a brass elbow that terminates in an 11/16th barb so you could easily affix a universal drain hose. Also does not have a dry-only cycle like my other portable dishwasher does. Arrived partially crushed on a corner but works fine. Only other complaint is Amazon reduced the price almost $30 immediately after I bought it."
"The entire dishwasher has become something I hate. It’s not space friendly for the amount you can fit into it. The shape and space inside is set up weird so you have to angle cups and such strange, which then you wonder how clean anything gets.The worst part though is that it won’t stop leaking. Everything is tight and put together correctly, but it’s leaking so badly I have to position the entire back half over my kitchen sink so it doesn’t get everywhere. Multiple places leak and I’ve only used it 5 times. The dishes never all look clean and I wish I never got it.I’d rather hand wash at this point, but I spent the money so I have to try and make it work.I wish it didn’t leak so I could put it on a rolling cart and just move it over to hook it up when I need to. That would at least make up for some of the other drastic pitfalls."
Leaks out the bottom constantly. I want a refund but the item is too bulky and water logged to return.
Back top left corner of the dishwasher came dented in. The box it came in had no issues.
"I bought this because I hate doing dishes. But I still have to. Dishes need a little scrub before loading. And although I put on the extra drying cycle, there is always water on the cups, silverware and inner walls of the machine. It also doesn't hold much."
My COMFEE dishwasher isn’t dispensing the detergent when I add the detergent and turn it on it runs great but when it’s done the detergent is still there so I’m not sure if I’m doing something wrong
"As the title says, we loved this when we first got it! Dishes have always been a struggle, and this was hands down the best home appliance we'd ever bought. However, after having it for nearly two months, it unfortunately will not drain any longer.We have done all possible troubleshooting over the past week: made sure the filter was clean (it was), checked to make sure the drain hose wasn't kinked or blocked (it wasn't), I even took the drain hose completely off and no water would come out of the back spout. We replaced it with a standard metal hose and tried to run it again, thinking maybe the drain pump would need to force the water out, but all we got was water all over our kitchen floor for our troubles when the machine overfilled. I'm not sure if the pump is the problem or if somehow something is clogging it further down than we can reach, though again, the filter had been kept clean and barely anything was on it when we took it off.I feel bad writing a bad review as it really was a great product up until it wasn't, but the return window was only a month and now we're stuck with a broken machine. The website says in order to get a replacement or refund you have to ship it to them along with a proof of purchase within 60 days of receipt. It would be far more expensive to ship than it would be worth, and then we'd have to wait and see if they would even cover it. No thanks. We'll be getting a replacement from another brand soon. :("
I was looking forward to this because since having a new baby I was sick of hand washing all the time. First of all it’s my fault for not measuring but this thing is much bigger then I expected! Pictures don’t do it justice. It’s extremely heavy it took me and my husband to lift this. It also barley fits under my cabinets I had to push it in and make it fit. I’ve tried every setting several different soaps and rinse aid settings and this thing just does a terrible job at cleaning my baby and pumping stuff. No matter what it always has some weird spotting and residue on it and sometimes they come out looking dirtier then they did going in! I even pre hand rinsed and cleaned a few and they still came out looking weird and greasy. I’ve troubleshoot everything and they just come out eh. It also doesn’t dry the dishes at all even with the extra dry setting and rinse aid the picture I included was after several hours of sitting out to dry. I have a 30 dollar sterilizer and dryer combo that dries better then this thing! For the money this should be able to dry the dishes. I’m just so disappointed I wanted this to help make my life easier and it’s just annoying I wish I had spent less for the smaller one probably would of worked better for less money
"I would have given it a 5 if it arrived undamaged. Mine had a good-sized dent on top. The box was damaged like it had been yetted by a forklift. It's like the driver knew because he hauled butt after dropping it on my porch. Was tired of handwashing dishes so I let it slide. The damage was only cosmetic.I permanently installed it where our old dishwasher was. This little thing cleans really nicely! Better than the big one we had. The only downside is the load capacity. We have a bigger family so we have to load it a couple of times a day, still better than handwashing!This would be absolutely perfect for an apartment, a camper, a person with a small family, or living on your own.Highly recommend."
"If you connect to your kitchen faucet, it's great, but if you want to do a permanent installation the drain connection is non-standard. By that, I mean there's no easy way to grab a drain hose from the big box stores and connect it like a typical dishwasher. The water inlet connection IS standard, but drain connection is some weird thing that has to be hacked to make work. WHY??? Horrible design."
"This is my 3rd portable dishwasher I have owned because I travel alot. They were different models, same price and have had no problems. But after a month of use, this model keeps stopping and showing a code on the screen... e4. The seals leak. Water seeps to the bottom catch and sets off the sending unit, thus stopping and draining the wash cycle until I dry out the bottom collection cup. If the seals didnt leak, it wouldnt happen. All the other mechanisms on the washer are fine. At this point, I wish I had bought a different model."
It gets three for customer service. I've used it two times and it's less than a week old...and just stops working. But I was very well taken care of so that's fabulous.
Would be cool to have a hookup onto the sprayer instead or another option to keep the sink faucet free to be used. Works really well.
"I like the size and it works really well and it gets the dishes clean, however it leaks a lot!  I am very disappointed with the amount of leakage. If it didn't leak the way it does I would've given it 5 stars."
"Bought and used for six months-then I get the E4 error. After googling (it wasn’t in the user manual) I found out that means water is getting into the motor compartment and triggering the flood switch. Open up the bottom and it is indeed wet, but none of the hoses or connections were wet or obviously leaking. Their website provides no email or phone number to contact for repairs or troubleshooting."
I have been at my current address for 1 year.  Bought my first one a year ago and had to return it after 8 months and now having the same issue with my current one.  E4 is the code that keeps coming up.  This time resulted in water all over my kitchen.  We tilt it over to drain it but that doesn’t fix the issue.  Super inconvenience!
"This little electronic thing which is the pump I think or one of them.. the corner was completely broken off and also the pipe it connects to had 2 chunks taken out of it. I couldn't repair this machine if I wanted to. HORRIBLE!!!!!! I couldn't even find the broken pieces either, was I sold a used returned piece of garbage? When I first set this thing up I kept getting E4 error, turns out it means there is a leak and no crap there is a leak the entire piping of the unit is broken off. Awful awful design.Edit: After reading other 1 star reviews.. seem this is extremely common. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TERRIBLY DESIGNED PRODUCT!"
"This is my second contertop dishwasher. The first one was very similar but of the other brand. It served for 3 years and I was very happy and then it stopped to pump water in the dishwasher. I decided to buy this one. When it arrived and I installed it, the screen immediately showed Error 4 and water leaked from the bottom. When we opened the dishwasher, the part which is marked on the picture was fallen apart. I must say that it is not very well made, seems to be very weak plastic. We tried to fix it with some stuff (like plastic bands) and seems that it works. But I don't know how long it lasts like this. I have read a lot of reviews where people were having  strange leaking problems. I think this is a common problem"
"I was honestly very excited for this product but unfortunately, it’s very inconsistent with the drying mode. I have even tried adding the extra drying cycle. Along with increasing the rinse aid level. However, I continue to have issues with drying. Dishes comeOut soaked! The main reason I got it was to wash baby bottles and pumping part but honestly baby bottle mode sucks. So I have to use the regular modes and hope my dishes dry but so far no luck."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update with video Dec,7 2023 Adapter to the sink now leaks water at multiple places that are at connection points. (Pot on faucet so not to spray water everywhere) Hope my husband is able to repair it. It isn't worth the water it is wasting, it pours & sprays water until you turn off the faucet.No more standing in front of the sink to wash dishes! I now get to enjoy cooking at home without the worry of clean up afterwards. It easily cleaned my large crockpot after cooking stew beef and gravy, which is a pain to scrub by hand. The only noise I hear is when it drains periodically, otherwise it is so quiet. You will not regret buying this if you are here shopping for it....Do it, quit second guessing it. You will love it. (I cook for a family of 3 adults) It installed easily on my faucet, which is an older style, came with all the parts to attach to my faucet, and even came with a package of 22 Finish detergent pouches."
"Overall, this is a decent dishwasher and cleans well if you get one that a) isn’t dented (the original packaging was visibly damaged…so, go figure)…and b) doesn’t keep giving error codes when you try to start a wash cycle. I had to go through the hassle of returning a damaged dishwasher (which was NOT a smooth process being that UPS failed to show up when scheduled).  The replacement arrived quickly BUT the unit STILL had a huge dent on the side (really?!) . If it hadn’t been for the hassle of having to return a defective machine and being sent a replacement with a huge cosmetic defective. I would give this unit a higher rating."
Won't even fit a standard dinner plate.
"Please save yourself my grief, it’s not a good a good machine. Mine is no longer working properly, I have only had it 3 months, and on the most only used 3 times a week !Save the mess, that it took me hours to clean up after. The water was gushing out the lower front. I of course  checked the hoses in the back, bone dry. I now have a broken dishwasher that is PAST THE RETURN WINDOW. Do yourself a favor, buy a name brand ."
I've done 10 washes since purchased. Get the dishes nice and hot and clean. I would have given this a 5 star review but the top of the washer came badly dented and was causing the door not to close. I fixed it but this is unacceptable.
Honestly it works great came with all the adapters everything however when we opened the box from the top we noticed 2 wooden pieces where bent inward upon further inspection we found the top of the dishwasher was dented inward from side to side like something much more heavy was placed on top of it this wasn't a small dent or shallow one it was pretty noticeable it did however still function correctly it was more of a cosmetic issue than a functional
I was very excited to get this dishwasher. It cleaned the dishes well. But I kept noticing my counter tops were pooling with water. I tightened the tube's. I thought maybe I connected it wrong.  Then I pulled it out a little while in use and water was pouring out of the bottom. I sent it back and was promised a refund but have not received it. I just wasted 300.00 and am very disappointed.
The silverware basket is broken I haven't even hooked it up yet to see if it works  tomorrow I'll review that
"I don’t love getting a pre-broken new thing, but I don’t have the energy to return the whole machine and wait for a new one just to fix the basket. It otherwise works fine."
This machine looks nice but it stopped working as soon as I got it. Didn’t even get to use it for a full minutes. When I paused it I heard a loud pop come from the door and now none of the buttons work besides the power button. I believe the door sensor or latch must of broke when I heard the pop.
A dishwasher was on my wish list for quite a while. Then I regretted buying it because setting it up was so complicated. I wasn't able to use it until about a month after the purchase. It did take up too much space on my counter since I live in a mobile home. I decided to place it permanently in a cabinet and lose out on storage for pots and pans.
"Worked ok for almost 2 years to the day using it once sometimes twice a week. 2 weeks past the warranty time if I had bought the extra 2 year protection plan the pump just seized up. Manufacturer and Amazon offer Zero support for the product, if it breaks it goes to the landfill. Garbage product. Buyer beware….."
We ordered this to build into a cabinet. We built a shelf to hold it. Pictures on the Amazon site showed the dishwasher installed under a counter. The only hoses that came with it were to hook up from on top of a counter. The attachment to the sink faucet would have fit a faucet from the 70’s. It was impossible to find fittings to adapt the dishwasher as a built in. We called a plumber to install it. $200.00 later we have a dishwasher.  Make sure you measure your dinner plates. 10 inches and not a cm more.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Tried it. Its working but didn’t do what it’s supposed to. I am not sure maybe because i put a normal dishwashing liquid and i dont have a rinse aid? It came out still dirty and not even dry. Tried it 3x. I will go to walmart and get some pods for dishwasher and a rinse aid hopefully it will work otherwise I’ll return it😔 I’ll update if it work.Update: returned it. The hose at the back bent and water won’t come in and company can’t send replacement
Purchased for rv and when you set it for the 140 min cycle an error message of the heating element comes on...not sure if it is because of the fact that rvs have smaller water heaters or what but using a shorter time the dishwasher will complete the cycle
"This was going to be second countertop dishwasher after my first stopped working after 7 years of service.Bought this brand had no clue about it, was a less expensive than the brand I wanted to get.As soon as I tried to use it for the first time, one could tell the pump was oddly loud, soon after the ""beeping of a problem"" came on and my kitchen was flooded.I returned this item immediately and ordered the brand I wanted in the first place, needless to say Danby brand worked perfectly at first use and since I received it.I am not sure if I received a fluke or got damaged in shipment but I should have gone with the brand I trusted in the first place."
"This is just the size and look I wanted for my small kitchen countertop, BUT…. There are 2 adapters that they recommended to get to fit your faucet (for faucet hook up). I bought both, because I wasn’t sure which I’d need.I followed their directions and what a mistake that was!!My faucet was not adaptable to either one of the adapters, the worst part is they tell you to unscrew the head of faucet- to try to screw in the adapter, but my kitchen faucet has not worked since….no running water !  I called the Company to speak to the tech department to help, but after giving the model number and name (right on the box), they DENIED KNOWING OF THE MACHINE!!  It still sells on Amazon, I mentioned, but still they DENIED IT!!Amazon was so kind about it, they said they’d give me a credit and to just keep it.The only problem is, with the credit I had to buy a different one and now I’m terrified to call a PLUMBER, knowing they charge so much!My new - different one, works great, but smaller! Has built in water tank, so needs no hook up.So, the other sits on my kitchen floor!!At least the Co. should own up to their own product!Shame on you Comfy!So buyer beware!"
Product arrived dented and silverware basket broke
"The wheels ahould be bigger so they dont come off track. Once off track, the sprayer jams.  The hook up hose is trash, too. Plastic. Should be metal. Ends on washer should be metal, too. Maybe another .5 inch clearance for plates, too. ."
Was thrilled to get this but it displayed an error code as soon as it was turned on. There were scratches and grease spots on the top of this machine so I suspect it was a return from someone else. Very disappointed because it was the exact size and color I wanted. The worst part is going to be trying to box this hot mess up to return.
"This is our second Comfee dishwasher. First one lasted a year then got the E4 code. We could not fix it on our own so we ordered another. This one lasted 2 months before getting the E4 code!! Just as with the first one, it stops draining and then leaks all over! What the heck! Uncool, lasting 2 months is unacceptable. Just missed the return window too."
"I bought this dishwasher since my new home did not come with one and thought it would work great. I’ve ran into so many issues with it like leaks or it just simply popping up error. I’ve been trying to contact customer service about getting a refund, it’s been over a month now and still have heard nothing back. DO NOT BUY."
"The E1 error has prevented me from even washing one load. It’s consistent despite leveling it, turning up water pressure, and unplugging the machine. This is literally a useless $400+ purchase.YouTube video coming soon."
"I previously owned a SPT Countertop Dishwasher and when that died (after more than 6 years of use) I bought this one instead because it was slightly cheaper. It doesn't load as many dishes as the SPT even though they are the same size, it doesn't clean was well as my old machine and within a day or two of first using it one of the handles on the utensils basket broke. Adequate but the SPT was better."
It's very easy to install anyone can do it! It fits well in my little cabinet space in my small apartment but I have teens who don't know how to rinse their dishes before putting them in the dishwasher and I was hoping this would take care of it but it does not. Dishes need to be mostly clean before they go in.
Why is this so highly rated? It doesn’t fit standard dishes. Is not portable in any sense of the word. So heavy you’ll need 3 people to even bring up to the counter.And the adaptors to the faucet do not work. Returning within 5 mins of “installation”
Called customer service and they said only have 1 size quick disconnect to fit and its too big for my faucet and NO solution..i tried to use every fitting solution but the water feed connect nothing American fits
"Just flooded an area of my kitchen because it decided to leak from the bottom. not the hose connections either. when clicking the link amazon gives for product support, it takes me to their website, where there is no product support or customer service for that matter.so far id never buy anything from this brand again and upon seeing other reviews that mention a leak from the same area, id avoid this at all costs."
"😡😡 I'm extremely frustrated with this product. It shows e4 error, leaks, overflows, and doesn't drain properly. I have changed the hoses two times,While the hoses function well, there's a persistent leak from the bottom. I have replaced the dishwasher with a new one and it has the same problem.Save yourself the trouble; I've wasted four weekends trying to fix it or clean up the mess it has made."
Did not work out of the box and Amazon ask me if I could work on it to fix it they would give me a partial refund. If I wanted to work on it I would buy someone’s used junk very disappointed in the product and Amazon for wanting the product back before a refund is issued like they don’t have my card info if I didn’t return it
What a waste of money to spend on an adapter. The washer machine itself already had one. You'll need to re-tighten the hoes becuase it's loose when arrive.
The dishes in their example must be for children. i cant fit a plate it in. may 3-4 bows and a few cups.was hoping to fit normal size dishes in there. Twice the dishwasher tab didn't get dissolved. not sure why. It is quiet and I think uses less water than handwashing. But I would not purchase again.Shipping was fast and well packaged.
"There is nothing portable about this!  This is just a half-sized dish washer.  Does NOT have a built-in tank for those who's apartments don't have the required hookups it actually DOES require the same hook ups as any other full-sized dishwasher.  It is about TWICE the size of your standard microwave.  So, if you're looking for a PORTABLE dishwasher THIS ISN'T IT."
1.) The water has to be on2.) You're can't use this product with a pull down faucet head3.)you have to use the extra drying cycle if you want the dishes to come out mostly dry4.) DO NOT BUY HERE. buy at the original retailer or you won't be eligible for the manufacturer warranty.  Which makes the assurant insurance useless.
"I bought this dishwasher, didn’t fit my faucet. I bought an adapter for the faucet and it fit. Once connected and running, water leaks from the back of the hose connected to the dishwasher."
"I figured with it being just my wife and I that this would be the perfect dishwasher, especially since we both work full time. Not even close. Had to return it and buy a full size portable one."
"It came in a damaged box.  That should have been my first red flag.  But I ignored that and went ahead and set the thing up.  I got it all hooked up, with the exception of the quick connect piece which also came damaged.  I had to go out to the local hardware store for a replacement on that.  After getting home from that outing I got it all set up and as soon as I plug it in, it gives me the E4 Error. Overflow.  Mind you, the water was OFF.  So I call Comfee to get assistance.  This guy I spoke to was rude and basically told me it's just defective.  Go back to Amazon and either return or replace it.  Take your P.O.S. back. I will NOT be purchasing anything by this brand again.  Talk about disappointing.  I was so excited for this.  Thanks for breaking my heart when I really needed something good, Comfee.  Thanks."
Worst purchase ever.  Worked for all of a week then wasn't cleaning!!
Finally found an adapter for it . Breaks with in 1 wash and has overflow error code. Having to return and they won’t even replace the item only will let me return for a refund. Don’t buy.
"I love the way the dish washer looks and how big it is. Issue is connecting the hose to any sorce of facet for water. We tried so many things and its been more of a pain than helpful, best bet to just go with a dish washer that can have water be put in the machine and connect to a facet. That way if you cant connect it at least you can still use it by putting in water, all in all woldnt buy unless ur willing to buy more things to try to connect it to your kitch facet."
Takes a lot of counter space but can fit a small to med load. Good if you more houses alot. Washes good too
"This dishwasher is terrible, it leaks and plates don’t even fit. My glasses and silverware came out dirty after two cycles."
I’ve used it 4 times. Teflon taped connections. Properly tightened. There’s only a drainage outlet and a water source inlet. Not too hard. All taped up nicely all tightened properly. Drainage hose is parallel to the sink and not kinked (connection doesn’t leak the machine fills up with water and leaks) it drains in but this thing does not drain. Anything more than one load my counter is full of water. I have to take it off the counter tilt it back to drain. Them tilt it forward to drain again. The photos are the result. Not happy at all with the purchase. With the amount of work I have to put into this POS I could wash dishes by hand. For the money I would never ever ever buy again. Pissed
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Yo, this thing was working great the first month I had it. I was stoked and used it all the time. But then, not long after, the back started leaking like crazy, and water was going everywhere on the counters. I tried fixing the drain pipe, but it didn't work. I ran it over and over again to see why it kept leaking, and it turned out that water was dripping from all the edges! The company that made this thing did such a crappy job that it takes less energy to wash dishes by hand than to clean up the mess this broken piece of junk makes."
If I could give it zero stars I would! The dishwasher displayed an E4 error code immediately upon pressing the start button. Called the company and talked to a man who seemed like he really couldn't care less. No repairman could be sent out. Apparently that is only done for larger dishwashers. He told me to call Amazon. So we had to do our best to repackage this monstrosity to send back. What a joke.
After a couple months it starts leaking underneath and calcium buildup is forming in the back some how.
"Broken right out of the box, didn't work."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It doesn’t get the dishes anywhere near clean!! Water leaks everywhere the whole time it’s running!! Idk how I’m even going to return it! The box it comes in can’t be repacked, once you cut the ties holding it together the box is done! So much more trouble than it’s worth! DO NOT BUY!! I’ll be heading to a home improvement store to find something that’s actually reliable"
"Installed and tried to use it.  Water ran out the bottom all over my countertop.  Was leaking internally.  I had ordered an extended  warranty.  Amazon would not fix it.  I called the manufacturer and they told me the part ( I figured out it was an incorrectly made valve )  was back ordered 14+ days.Less than a week later, I got an email from them saying it was NOW BACK ORDERED 145+ DAYS.Called Amazon again.  They gave me a refund on the dishwasher, warranty and other items for the washer. They didn't want it back.  Searched for a different model but ended up buying this again.  Working fine now."
"The long and the short of it, the unit broke the very first time I used it. Defective part. Should have been easy to replace but COMFEE customer service after a dozen calls kept sending me the wrong part even after sending them the picture of the broken part (it was the drain line going to the sink). Very ridiculous. Ended up just ordering the part on my own from a different vendor and spending an extra $50 out of my pocket. Very poor experience. Sadly, it was the only countertop dishwasher that could fit in my place. I needed one because of eczema on my hands. It was the most difficult customer service I have ever experienced. I would not recommend this product."
I got this all set up. Had to go out and buy a different sink handle. Turn it on for first time per the manual and kept getting the code E4. Looked up the code E4 which said leak somewhere. So I had to take apart the inside and when I did it was very apparent that there was a crack inside the drain housing area.
"To bulky for under cabinets, yo small for plates, delivered upside down and corner bent"
"Have been using this dishwasher for over a month now and have been completely underwhelmed. It does a horrible job cleaning silverware, even when loaded exactly as the instructions indicated (I have given up trying and just wash them all by hand still.) As for plates, bowls, glasses, etc. it does a mediocre job. I find I have to hand wash items after they’ve been through a wash cycle more times than I can count (even after rinsing everything before it’s put in!) The cycles also take an excessively long time to run. Overall I feel like it was a waste of money and would not purchase again nor recommend."
Don’t let the good reviews fool u like it did me. It’s nice and little but leaks really bad when in a cycle
Doesn't clean well at all. There was stuff left over on plates after a wash that came off by just running it under a sink for a second that this dishwasher struggled with.
"UPDATE / after running successful cycles for about a week, I’ve noticed the last two cycles that I’ve run with this (since I left my review yesterday), some of the dishes either have a white film all over them or they just aren’t totally clean. I haven’t been running full loads, I haven’t been using too much detergent, I’m manually adding water, so it’s not hooked up to my waterline and it’s not getting hard water. I may have just gotten a flaky unit but this is just not working for me now so I’m sending it back. The reviews for this are overwhelmingly positive so hopefully if you get one it will work better for you! I have been using it quite a bit since I got it because I wanted to make sure it was going to work for the long term. I didn’t want to be stuck with an appliance like this and then not be able to send it back if it’s not working. I may try a different brand. We’ll have to see.Original review:I have been wanting a countertop dishwasher for a while. When I realized there were some that allowed you to manually add water rather than connecting to faucet or waterline, I was super excited. I studied the available options on Amazon and I chose this one because the size seemed right, it had good reviews, it does offer at least one cycle with a sanitizing temperature, and the price seemed fair.I've now been using this dishwasher for about a week and while I'm generally happy with it, if I had a chance to do it over again, I might choose a different brand better unless Hermitlux makes some modifications to their design.THE PROS- Fair price- Dishwasher does a decent job of cleaning- Uses very little dishwasher powder- Easy to set up- No need to connect to water line or faucet and drain hose is plenty long to extend and drain in sink.CONS- Hard to add water because of position of hole- Grill over hole probably should be more of a funnel shape or something similar so water doesn't splash out when you pour a little too quickly- Utensil basket has a clip on the side as if it's supposed to attach to main drawer but it doesn't actually seem to attach to anything- Utensil basket falls over easily when you're adding things to it. I think the utensil basket should be in the front or on the side rather than in the back. There's always that one more fork or spoon or knife you need to add and then you have to pull out the drawer and reach over dirty dishes to add it.My biggest complaint is the position of the hole on top for adding water. If it's pushed back on the counter and well under a cabinet, there is no way to add water. You have to pull it forward at least so that the hole on top is not directly under the cabinet. Even once you've done that, though, the design of the hole is just not well thought out. You have to pour very slowly or water bounces out of the grill and makes a mess around the top and behind the dishwasher. This could be remedied by adding a broad funnel design for adding water. Another brand on Amazon does seem to have a feature like that — and it's something I didn't realize was important until I actually used this one.Also, I wonder why they didn't just move the hole a little farther forward. Surely they could've molded the plastic inside that carries the water to the reservoir to flow back and down so that the hole doesn't have to be positioned where it is since a lot of people with small kitchens will have this on a counter under a cabinet.The utensil basket appears to have a clip on the side to attach it to the dish drawer, but the clip doesn't seem to actually attach to anything. I think the engineering of the whole drawer/basket system could be a little better.CONCLUSIONI'm still glad to have a countertop dishwasher and this one is the right size, but I sure wish there were some improvements."
"I’ve used this dishwasher for over 6 months now, and biggest problem I have with it is that I’ve basically had to babysit it while it runs its cycle. The blades are CONSTANTLY getting stuck, and 9 out of 10 times this issue will not resolve without me manually stopping the cycle, reaching in and trying to unstick them myself. Which sometimes works, but more often than not it’ll go right back to getting stuck and I’ll have to do this multiple times throughout. It didn’t happen as much in the beginning, but has become a persistent problem, regardless of me cleaning the blades, filter, etc after every load. It seems like it really just is a poor design, because the lower blades especially are far too high up and can catch on anything (like a dish that dips slightly below the dishwasher rack when loaded) which wouldn’t be a problem if the design had made the blades sit lower. Even more recently, the lower blade has simply stopped working properly for no reason that I can detect or seem to fix, which has rendered the dishwasher unusable. Overall, it seems like this dishwasher starts out pretty good and slowly stops working properly/ at all, and for the price it should last years, not months. Would return it if I could."
"This dishwasher has definitely brought convenience back into my life in terms of having a small set of dishes ready at any given time, but there are several things that I think could be improved on.Starting with the good things:-Good quality travel dishwasher for a pretty decent price.-The cycle runs pretty quiet. It's almost like soft white noise.-It cleans well. Besides the occasional film on dishes, it does a very thorough job of washing your dishes.-It has a short ""eco"" cycle that works just as well as the longer cycle but it runs in just an hour.-There are two input options for water: you can screw it onto your faucet, but if you don't want to do that every time, there's a built in water intake funnel you can just pour directly into.Now, onto the not-so-positive:-The size of the unit. It's bigger and taller than I was expecting and hangs a few inches off my countertop since I can't push it all the way back due to its height. That being said, it's also simultaneously smaller on the inside than expected and I have a hard time fitting pots or pans into it.-The shape of the intake valve. It's in a shape that almost wants to resemble a funnel, but it's not slanted enough and often results in water splashing out of it and onto the electric housing unit while I'm pouring, so I find myself having to constantly clean up the excess water.-The little cup shelf is not really helpful most of the time but it can be versatile on occasion. It's not tall enough for most cups but I've been able to fit and clean a glass bread pan on it. It would be easier if the height were adjustable.-Speaking of adjustable, the silverware basket comes with a clip on it meant for it to be versatile in its placement in your dishwasher, but it really only fits in one or two spots. The cup shelf often gets in the way of the basket too, so I can usually only fit 7 or 8 pieces of silverware in it.Overall useful but I might get something with a better design at some point."
"Purchased in June. Had 15-20 cycles through it and it started leaking all over counter. Pulled bottom cover and ran again to find leak. The cover/inlet housing on the 'drain pump' (labeled as such but seems like it is for the tank fill system) is made of clear plastic and it cracked at all four screws (as if they were over-tightened at factory), loosening enough to allow water to leak past the seal. This likely would not have happened if it had been built with a conventional semi-rigid plastic like the rest of the housing rather than the fragile clear one (why clear? Who's needing to look at the impeller?). They do not sell this pump on their site like they do the main pump, and a message to customer service was never returned.I was unable to source this pump anywhere online, at least by the numbers on it. I managed to fix it for the time being with some flex-tape and zip ties, but I am ever-wary of it failing again. For anyone less handy it would doom it to the scrap heap. DEFINITELY CONSIDER THE WARRANTY THROUGH AMAZON."

Pros- very quiet- ease of use- sleek design- decent space for what it is- 2 ways of filling- variety of modesCons- leaks- doesn’t clean well unless dishes are scrubbed and basically already clean- always use in strong mode as normal is too weak- poor faucet attachment options- poor soap input option- the track sometimes comes off but it’s easy enough to put quickly back
My dishwasher came wet. Is it supposed come like it? It works well.
"First of all the plastic picture for adding water was cracked and broken. I must also mention you need an adapter for kitchen sink faucet to dishwasher hose. 15/16"" female to 3/4"" garden hose male. Local hardware store about $5. Each time I have run this washer it has thrown error codes? The manual is very vague. All you can do is stop it and restart the whole cycle :⁠-⁠(. I have only used it twice and both times there is leaking from the inside underneath. I double and triple checked the connections to no avail. Still so much so I had to put it over the edge of the sink. Can't leave unattended O⁠_⁠oI believe I'm going to send it back for exchange because I really like having a dishwasher after 20 plus years of hand washing >⁠.⁠< And it washes great!We'll see what occurs with the next machine??? The machine I purchased was the Hermitlux"
"We have had this model for about 6-7 months. It has been a big help, when it works. It gives an E3 error message (too much water) which was fixed by turning off, tipping the machine at 45 degrees for 20 min to let drain completely. Now that fix will not work, and instead of getting this message 1xweek, we now get it almost daily. Only by chance will the machine work as promised. According to other reviews, this is not a unique experience. Customer service is non-existent, not responsive to messages. We are incredibly disappointed because it had been such a great help for the first 2-3 months. Now we are back to hand washing and out +$200."
"Too small to really hold much, it certainly won't hold cookware, even a small skillet.  Photo is deceptive on what it can hold.  The flip-down shelf is only big enough for very small bowls (condiment-sized food storage containers), or often we put our spatulas and such on that shelf, since the dishwasher is too small to hold those upright in the silverware basket.  Things also don't really get clean and we often have to just restart and run it again.  Yes we pre-rinse, but there comes a point where you spend more time pre-washing and loading the one-meal-worth of plates, you still have to handwash anything bigger, it's barely worth the time.  I owned the Farberware Professional countertop dishwasher before, it's the same price, and was far superior.  My bad."
"I was hoping this would save me some time and energy by cutting down on having to do dishes by hand but this dishwasher doesn’t have a lot of washing power. Even if there is the slightest food residue on the dishes when placed in the machine it won’t wash it off. So, you are pretty much spending just as much time pre-rinsing your dishes as you would just hand washing. It is essentially an expensive dish rinser and sanitizer and I don’t think it’s really worth the money.Other than that it was easy to install and it’s very easy to use. A little noisy but nothing more than I expected."
"I got mine last year during the Black Friday and its lifetime was exactly 1year. I just needed to get another one because mine is not working anymore. Of course, I’m going to try another brand."
"I’ve been using my dishwasher for about 3 weeks now. I love that it sanitizes the dishes well and the noise level is about the same as my last big dishwasher. I am a little disappointed that my plates and bowls are a little too big for it, and it’s a challenge to get things to fit just right. It works well for 1 person, but 2 is pushing it. Tips: Use a tiny amount of powdered dish detergent (1 heaping teaspoon), and don’t use regular dish soap, as it bubbles too much, and you will need an extra rinse. I do not recommend putting full dish tablet in, but you can probably use a small broken off piece. Also, it takes 3.5 pitchers of water when using the pitcher provided by the manufacturer. It is more convenient to have it attached to a water source, and we are planning to get a faucet splitter so it can be attached, but we can also use the faucet for other things. Overall, I am glad I purchased this dishwasher and feel that it is easier to wash dishes now."
We’ve have the unit for almost a year to the day and it has been a life saver! But went to unload and noticed the door is cracked!!  I’m hoping there’s a warranty or someone I can talk to about it to have it fixed/replaced!
"It started out working really well.  For about four months.  Then the dishwasher stopped cleaning the dishes.  No amount of cleaning the filter did anything.  Maybe it's because it was meant for someone in an RV where they do dishes here and there and not meant for someone who was washing a few loads of dishes every day.  The load times were a little ridiculous, it wound up taking almost two hours for a standard load.  Not ideal but since the dishes came out clean it wasn't a huge detractor.  But the fact that it stopped cleaning and it was past the return or replace date, not thrilled about that.  Hopefully the next one I buy won't stop doing its job only a few months in and will be built better than this one"
"It does a good job cleaning and drying dishes. The intake valve on the machine is defective so I can't fill up the washer directly from the faucet into the machine. It is completely blocked (or perhaps they forgot to put one on that washer--they certainly didn't do any quality control on this part of my washer). I had bought a special faucet (AIMADI Kitchen Faucet with Pull Down Sprayer--which is awesome by the way!) with two spouts--one being used to fill the machine. I had to Jerry rig the end of the hose that would have been directly attached to the washer and put it in a container at the top of the machine and seal the area with silicone caulk and plumbers putty to keep the water from dripping out of the top. Because the machine is on a shelf--way too high to pour water in the top area--this was my only solution. Or, perhaps, I could have sent the washer back  which would have been a pain in the butt."
This is a nice concept and works great but so small you can barley do more than a few dishes
It can clean dishes that have been rinsed but it seems like there is remaining water and possibly mold or some type of bacteria building up on the bottom after a few months of use only. Not sure what to do about that.
"Overall , wish I'd gotten a larger one."
"Several reviews indicated issues with getting the machine to start!  I had to lean the hard way…that if you have a self fill, the first time you fill you may need to put in more than one pitcher full!  I had to put in three to get the machine to start!  Should have been included in the instructions!"
"This little machine is great!  It works so well and I'm super impressed with it.  Cleaning is easy and it's very quiet.  It doesn't hold a lot and I have to run it several times, but it's still way better than hand washing them and still saves on water.  Definitely recommend!!Edit: Dropping to 3 stars because it stopped working about 8 months in.  For the money, I feel like I should have gotten way more usage out of it.  Now I'm back to hand washing, or spend another $300+ on another one and cross my fingers that it last longer."
"It's only been a month of use, and the top sprayer does not spin. I've tried cleaning it, tightening it, loosening it, and it just doesn't move. The water comes out of it, but it doesn't spin. So it just hits the dishes with water at the same spot over and over for the top portion of the dishes. Very dissatisfied. I have it 2 starts since the bottom spray does spin fine. I'm still able to use the dishwasher thanks to the bottom spray, but it's not as great as marketed. I will be contacting support."
"The internal tank with the sensor signal for when it is full was very nice and the guiding directions on use are straightforward and informative. Also, the window to see the washing processing from time to time is nice. Through looking through the window, I could see how it did not clean the inside portion of the cups and bowls.I rinsed and placed dishes inside and yet there was a residue you can feel as well as a brown dust. The drying feature is also nice, but when it did not fully clean to begin with, it cakes on the food residue (eg. Smoothie). I ordered based on the comments and saw some saying they saw water spraying up, so the one I received could have just been defective in that way. Also, after returning. The refund took one month even with it being defective."
"I was so excited to finally a dishwasher in my small studio apartment. The set up was simple. I plugged it in, filled the water, placed the dirty dishes, added my detergent. I ran the standard mode and everything was fine until water started leaking from underneath the machine, spilling out all over my counter. I turned the machine off in a panic. I thought maybe I set it up incorrectly. I even tried the company's recommendation of tipping the machine at a 35 degree angle because I thought maybe the tank overflowed.No. Turns out there was a GIANT CRACK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE INSIDE OF THE MACHINE causing water to leak everywhere underneath. I was relieved that it wasn't a user error, but I am so sad that it came damaged. I thought they tested the machines at their factory before sending them off, so I am not sure how such a glaring defect was missed.Anyways, its probably a great machine. It's very quiet like they say, and it fit enough dishes for my use. Wish I had the chance to actually use it even one time."
"I have to say that I do love the dishwasher. Pros: 1) Dishes are usually clean. 2) I can look through the glass and see if both arms are rotating. 3) Low noise level. 4) I love the fruit wash setting.Cons: 1) I can only fit about five to seven dishes in it at a time. 2) My cabinets were hung 18 inches from the counter and it does not fit under my cabinets. 3) Has to run constantly to finish all the dishes.  4) There is no spot to add the rinse aid to the dishwasher. 5)  The small hole to put the dishwashing liquid in is just a divot in the door.All and all though, I am glad that I bought it."
This product is easy to use and it ran great for the two times I was able to use it. On the third time it flashed an error E7 which in the manual says no pump flow… However it’s not even hooked to a waterline I just fill it up from the top. I reached out to the manufacturer my phone by email no response no return phone call. So basically I would have to pay the same amount for a professional to come take a look at it which is the same amount that I paid for it brand new to only be able to use it twice.
Got for my apartment since it didn't have a dishwasher. 3/4 water supply connection is great if you have a water heater outlet nearby like I did. Unfortunately the lack of a rinse aid dispenser makes it really bad if you have hard water. Dishes all come out with horrible white residue.Also note from other reviews it seems like Amazon is shipping out used units. Mine was soaking wet inside when I opened it.I went to lowe's and got some adapters to a 1/4 water line and hooked it up to reverse osmosis water. I'm hoping that will make this thing usable otherwise I'll have to find a way to return it.
"This dishwasher seemed like a dream come true. It was a great size for my apartment and dishes for one person. Unfortunately, as time went on I noticed it was not washing the dishes as well and after 8 months it stopped working. The spinning spouts on the top and bottom of the washer stopped spinning and spraying water. I spent extensive time researching a fix and watched the manufactures videos on how to fix common problems and none of it worked.  This is way to expensive to stop working in under a year with regular use."
"First one I ordered got moldy after 2 uses.  Returned and made sure the new one stay open immediately after the cycle was finished.  It developed mold as well.  May have mold in the sump due to there being water left before shipping due to ""testing"".  Wrote to the manufacturer about this issue and did not get a response."
"We bought this countertop dishwasher hoping to be able to clean dishes more efficiently. Irregardless of what we try this dishwasher does not clean as well as other competitor washers. We first were just using the fill option the dishwasher had and thought maybe that was the issue as our dishes still smelled like the food they were used for (Sauceless spaghetti noodles for instance). So we then hooked it up to the sink, which then also did not work. Then, we decided to buy the cleaner product (automatic dishwasher pods from walmart) we saw some reviews recommend, and that doesn't work either. Dishes come out with stains still on them, the pressure the water has is not significant enough.I put some utensils in and they came out looking the same, so I rotated the container, that didn't work. I thought maybe the other dishes were blocking the water so I ran it with just the utensils and they still came out the same."
"While trying to select the type of wash the touch buttons are not sensitive enough.as a handicap personit can be a struggle to get the waterin the rond strainer on topwithout spillage give the design more of a funnel design.glad to have it as it does the job, as i cannot stand and do them by hand.heigjt is too tall tofit under wall cabinets by the sink."
"I choose this over other brands because of drying function. However, it failed to deliver. I always use the strong setting for washing (89 min) followed by dry function for another hour. I still need to transfer the bottle in my Dr. Brown dryer."
I sent my dishwasher back I used the pour in method for dishwasher and did not run very well. I sent it back and had know difficulties in sending it back that was easy. My thoughts even for two people just isn’t worth it.
"Didn’t get to use product due to upping open disconcerting moisture inside bay . The box it came in, in side and out was dry… didn’t even pull it out of box 🤦‍♀️ bummer… looks nice"
"I was absolutely in love with this little dishwasher until it stopped working recently. I had no issues before and it cleaned my dishes very well. It always drained properly and dishes came out clean and dry. I am disappointed that it broke in less than a year.Considering that I spent $350 when I first bought it, I am upset that it broke down so quickly. I went through the manual and tried all the steps and suggestions to clear it and reset it, but the water no longer drains. I even looked up solutions on their YouTube channel and nothing has worked. I saw in another person's review that they had a similar issue where their dishwasher stopped working in less than a year. It has a 1 year warranty, so I've emailed the company to see if they would be able to send me a new one. I haven't heard back from them yet, but hopefully I do soon. If they are able to help me with replacing my dishwasher, I will update this review to reflect it. Again, I had absolutely no issues before this, and I am sad that it just doesn't work anymore."
It’s a nice machine but it barely fits anything and didn’t find it useful.
"***YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE ITEM YOU SEE IN ALL OF THE PHOTOS***The item description, photos and review photos all show and describe this dishwasher as having a glass front door, which was a big reason why I purchased this model in the first place.The product I received just has a cheap looking solid white plastic door in the front that you can't see through. Not only does it look like a cheap ugly plastic box, it was also soaking wet inside and smells moldy right out of the box.Extremely annoyed that I now have to return this and find another brand that HOPEFULLY won't be a bait and switch like this one.If the glass front door of this dishwasher was a selling point for you, this is definitely not the right item to buy."
It worked great at first then it just stopped working for the price you would think the warranty would be more than 30 days. Didn't even last 5 months and I don't use it daily. Went straight to manufacture which is only through email took over 3 weeks for them to say it's under warranty then wanted me to pay to ship it back to get a replacement 2 months later that came broke.
"This product had great reviews however, when I received mine, unboxed it, filled the tank, plugged it in and hit the button as instructed, nothing happened. It powered up and the panel illuminated with all of the buttons but it would never start a wash cycle. The ""Tank Full"" indicator light never came on as the manual said it would. I even filled it up to where the water was about to overflow, emptied all of the water back out and filled it again. It appears that the sensor that recognizes the water level is bad, thus, not allowing the machine to work. I reached out to the manufacturer for assistance because I really wanted to keep the unit and not have to return it, but no one ever responded so I was forced to return it. I'm nervous about getting a replacement of the exact same thing. Based on these reviews, I guess this doesn't happen often, but clearly, it DOES happen."
"Unfortunately, it didn't work at all and I had to return it. I kept filling the machine because it wouldn't start. As a result, my kitchen got flooded."
When the product arrived the his was dry but when we opened it the bag it came in it was wet. When we plugged it in and turned it on we followed the set up steps and added the water but it kept on showing no water was added. We added more and it still said more water. It ended up overflowing with water and stop did not detect any water being added. I think the washer must have been returned since it was still wet on the inside.
It cleans dishes very well. But it’s too powerful for cleaning fruit. It destroyed strawberries and blueberries.
"I've owned this dishwasher for a since Oct 21 - at first it worked pretty good, then I started getting an E3 error message.  According to the owners manual, it was ""overfull"" and I should dump the water out of the bottom of the unit.  Tried that, still got the error message.  Well, finally a cycle started and it ran fine.  Then it did it again, and again and again - E3 message.  If it has water in it, it will drain all the water out and still give the E3 error.  Found the contact information and emailed the company - NO RESPONSE.  When it works, it does a good job, but once this message started coming up, you don't know when it's going to work and when it isn't.  I've owned this machine for less than 6 months and I'm already looking for something better and more reliable."
I didn't get a manual and I don't know where to put the soap
"Unable to use because the directions make NO sense.Can't get the machine started.UPDATE:Had to return.Apparently, the machine was DOA (dead on arrival)."
Mine is constantly leaking water of all different amounts from the bottom of the glass door. And the Hermitlux company isn’t too keen on helping fix it.
Unfortunately my new apartment’s kitchen counters are not wide enough for this unit. I had to return it.
It worked great until it didn’t. Just decided it was done and stopped. No warranty after 30 days.
"I am so sad to say that this baby used to do an ok job. I mean you and to pre wash before throwing them in but now it’s not even doing anything.  I clean the inside of of the machine, I use hot water. As of the last month it’s decided to just not work. Pretty disappointing as I have a small kitchen and work alot and really would like the time back"
"Skip ""dry cycle"" ... stop and wipe everything before putting away.  Leaves soap residue even with min. soap added. Have to run rinse  only cycle (veg./ fruit) too just to be sure but don't want to waste water."
"Cleans great, easy to maintain and use. Unfortunately regular coffee mugs do not fit on the pull down shelf. Have to run two loads for the items noted in the pictures."
"The product itself works great. Received damaged product that was used. Was referred to work with seller to resolve issues. Customer service is non existent. I am still using product but upset I was not able to return or exchange. Front cover of door was cracked (No leaking as the interior door is intact) Food was in trap, and stains/food in water reservoir. Again, the product works amazingly well, just disappointed I received a used and cosmetically damaged machine."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Product worked fine the first couple of uses but now the controls switch whenever they want and it cannot finish a standard cycle. I haven’t had it for that long so I’m disappointed that it’s already doing this
Barely had for a year and now it’s stopped working the screen says E3 as an error and now I can’t use it anymore $250 gone to waste
Product came as NEW but when I opened it and set it on counter I noticed it looke used
"After using another model for 3 years, we decided to switch to this Hermitlux because it came with more settings and we liked the window.  This model does not a good catch filter and the spray bar repeatedly gets clogged, requiring manual cleaning. Eventually during cleaning, the spray bar broke from hand pressure.Not worth the price, buyer beware."
"Got this to fill in while waiting on my full size dishwasher to be repaired. There was no drain hose included! Trying to figure out where to get one and have a bit of tubing clamped to the drain outlet in the meantime. Works wonderfully, though.EDIT 1/2022: Company never responded to my asking how to get a replacement drain hose and none that fit seem to be available anywhere. Love the dishwasher, very irritated about the missing drain hose."
"It worked good at first until it started pausing & starting on its own. It will turn on/off the dry feature as well, out of nowhere.. I only ever try to do quick cycles because it doesn't make it through the full standard one. Shouldn't have even bought this.."
"This is great for small spaces, however it did not last a year. As a busy mom I wanted something to help me stay on top of washing dishes. I used this 2–3 times per month and during the last use it started leaking everywhere and shit off without emptying. For context I used dishwasher safe detergent, filtered water and kept to the requested number of dishes as outlined in the manual. I would not recommend. Save your money and get a full size portable dishwasher."
"Filled tank. Turned on. Did not recognize water in tank. Would not start wash cycle. Only beeped at me and then apparently went into standby and did not give me any sort of error message to show me what I needed to do. Contacted customer service. Needed to be transferred to a technical support representative. ""We are experiencing difficulties and the chat has been terminated"" Noped right out after that due to my level of frustration with the so-so less than helpful ""user"" instructions, put it in the box and just got back from taking it to UPS. Should of ordered the other one I considered. Now have to wait probably another week or more to get it. This has been an all around not pleasant experience."
While I liked the countertop dishwasher again it was too small. I could not fit enough dishes in it to make it worth while
