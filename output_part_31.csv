It was a good kettle that was purchased due to it being metal so it wouldn't warp. The gooseneck was a nice touch as well that added to the aesthetic.Unfortunately this kettle didn't even make it 8 months for us. Stopped turning off after boiling water and then started draining power to the point it kept short circuiting the outlet it was in.We will spend a bit more and buy from a known brand next time.
"I purchased this a little over a year ago, and it’s already begun leaking, but not until the water is boiling. Fun. Hot water drips from the seam where the plastic meets the metal, and hot steam comes out as well. I burnt my finger trying to flip it off this morning. You can see in the photo where calcium has started to build up from the leak. I don’t recommend this if you’re looking for something for long term, everyday use."
"Very nice looking but won’t shut off automatically. It’s also much smaller than I thought. I’ll probably keep it instead of going through the hassle of returning it, just have to watch it while it heats up."
You get what you pay for with this kettle - first the auto shut off died a year ago and now it doesn't heat water. Worked well when it worked though.
"I gave this kettle a 3 star rating only because it shorted out after 18 months.  It’s a pretty kettle and light weight.  It holds enough water to make about three mugs of tea. I generally only use it first thing in the morning, so 1 time per day.  I take very good care of it and just think it should’ve lasted longer.  So although I liked it, I probably won’t be reordering it."
"I've bought two of these, one for home and one for my office. The one for home just broke. It didn't last even three years. I want things I buy to last a long time! I have no idea why it died. It was fine for my tea this morning, and then I went to make my evening herbal cuppa and it wouldn't turn on. The one in my office still works, but I won't buy another one of these to replace the broken one. I will try another brand. It is very easy to use and I like the color. It has auto-off which is a good safety feature. But yeah...the durability just isn't there in the long-term. Disappointing!"
"I do like the look of this product on the counter, and it worked well for a solid year, but after about 14 months, the thermostat or something is no longer working properly and turns on and off while I’m trying to boil water. Though it’s gotten nearly daily use, I would expect a small applicable at this price point to last at least two or three years without hesitation."
"I bought this particular electric kettle because I liked the look of it.  I wish I had paid more attention tot the reviews that said it leaks.  The first time I used it, I set it down on the vanity while I made my tea.  I got distracted and left the kettle sitting there for several hours.  When I picked it up, there was a large pool of water underneath it.  The second time I used it, I made sure to put it back on the base.  I didn't use all of the water, so later I picked the kettle up to empty it, and there was a large pool of water on and around the base.Although the kettle heats water quickly and to an acceptable temperature, and the auto-shut off works fine, I can't live with the leaks, so it is going back."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I love the look of the kettle, it’s very cute-but I can’t have a kettle that wobbles so obviously.  The element is so high it makes a space between the element and the base that makes it not sit fully on it.  I’m actually more worried that the element will malfunction due to all the weight of a full kettle that would be on the element tilting back and forth with use.  The base itself is so lightweight it tips up from the curl of the cord alone. That would work itself out I guess.  It’s very cute, fairly small at 1 liter, just enough for 2-3 mugs of coffee, I like that the top comes off to be able to reach into it more easily. The “max” mark is on the handle side, oddly, so you have to turn it to see when you stop filling it.  Sadly, back it goes- replacing for a new one that fits better wouldn’t give me more confidence in its durability at this point.  If you don’t mind a wobble with a kettle of boiling water, go for it- it will look adorable!  Though maybe yours will fit fine!"
"Love the color and look of the kettle; large volume and nice controlled pour. There is a distinct sulfur smell in reservoir, even with washing before use, that hopefully goes away with use. However, it did not seem to hinder the flavor profile of my tea. The heating process is a little louder than expected but short in duration.Overall, happy with aesthetic and speed of heating. Hopefully the smell dissipates within a few uses."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                The Good:  It makes water hot and looks reasonably nice. Bottom doesn't seem to get hot, so you can sit it anywhere.The Bad: It wobbles on the base and is difficult to clean, even for first use.The kettle doesn't fully seat onto the base.  It just kinda wobbles around (as seen in the video). I thought maybe there was a ""right"" way to put it onto the base so it would click into place, but it seems to be just be designed to work wobbily.Cleaning is a pain; sometimes literally.As you can see in the photos, there's a metal mesh at the base of the gooseneck, which can trap particles that sneak in. At the top, the metal folds over itself to make another particle trap. Think you'll just wipe it out?  Be careful, because there's also a little metal tube inside that prevents getting anything behind it.  Also, you can cut your hand on the unfinished metal at the top (I did).That said, I bought it to heat water and pour that water in a gentle, controlled stream, and it accomplishes that basic task thus far."
Using daily only lasted 1.5 year. I love it just wish it lasted longer.🤷🏻‍♀️
"I got this kettle a year ago and it worked great until it started increasingly forming condensation on the base, boiling hard and not shutting off, then the plastic burning smell. If you expect a kettle for only a year, buy this one ☹️"
I absolutely love the look of this kettle. It definitely heated quickly and we used it daily. However after about a year the coating or whatever was used on the inside of the pot started to break down and we would get flakes in our water. Sadly we had to throw out. If that could be rectified with the make/design perfect little kettle.
"The product looks nice, the quality seems good but it makes a lot of noise"
"By the third year, kettle doesn’t turn off on its own. It just keeps boiling. Fire hazard. Discarding and never purchasing again. Also leaker while pouring hot water by the 2nd year."
"This was great for one year. It died shortly after that. I've contacted the company, but no response. Too pricey and wasteful to be disposable like this. ***ETA*** another kettle showed up at our home -- not sure if it was in response to contacting the company directly or to this review! But glad that they're standing behind their product."
"The kettle I received appeared not to be a brand new one rather one that was opened, tried, then returned and then repacked and sold again as ""new"".First of the base is very wobbly and doesn't stay put which I think is super important when handling hot water. The handle to the kettle is a hollow type of plastic, which feels like it's not going to last more that a few years. Plus the one main reason I sent this back. Right under the gooseneck spout, where it connects to the kettle -water leaks out. Not constantly, but this should be a base line for all kettles to ""not leak"" at all at a major structural point(s). Also the water doesn't get get as hot as I'd it like to. As I've seen it commented on in other reviews as well."
Cute but always leaks. Automatic switch off stopped working so going to recycle this since it isn't safe to use.
"The scratch on the spout doesn’t look nice, I did write to the seller, hope they exchange it for me,  other than the scratch it looks very cute. I haven’t used it yet so I don’t know how good it is, will wait to hear back from the seller. It’s white color and the scratch is right on top and twards you, so you can’t ignore it and will be seen everytime you boil water in it. The seller shld pay more attention before they pack since it’s all waste  of packaging & labor."
"This kettle is small, compared to my older one, and does not sit firmly on the base. It wobbles and just perches there. It can be moved and tilted while heating, which could be dangerous. The kettle boils and shuts off as expected, but in only a few weeks the stainless steel inside on the bottom has worn off. This is disturbing to realize whatever this material is, it's in my tea water. My older kettle of 6 years still has nice looking stainless on the inside, so I'm glad I still have it to use.  This gooseneck kettle is being returned."
"We liked this kettle quite a lot. It looked great, boiled fine, cool goose neck, but we bought it in Jan and the on/off switch broke in Nov. And we aren't everyday tea drinkers and stuck with iced all summer. I believe most people would expect any kitchen appliance to last at least a year, if not two. Very poor durability."
"Cute and quiet, but the edges inside the pot and under the lid are sharp and can cut you. Not well finish inside. Also an audible tone when boiling is complete would be a nice touch."
"It leaked almost right away, had to return"
"Worked well, until the on/off switch failed after 16 months"
"This product looks amazing and does hear the water. I’ve burned my fingers a few times taking the kid off.  I regret moving away from a push button lid. Also, the button sticks so it doesn’t turn off automatically anymore. It runs and runs and I’m afraid it is going to start a fire.  I threw it away."
"This kettle worked fine at first, even though it does smell a little like plastic when boiling.  After 5 months, now the auto-off is broken and it will keep boiling even until all the water is gone.  I tried writing to the company and heard nothing back.  Buy a different brand and avoid this probable fire hazard.**Update - the manufacturer replied to my request and sent a replacement. Bumping up to 3 stars. Definitely keep track of the warranty info if you buy."
"The base is cheap looking brown plastic. Had I seen it in person I would have made a different choice. That said, it does the job so far. Can’t speak to whether it is durable."
"I got a few uses out of this, and it genuinely seemed like a very nice teapot… and then one day I attempted make myself a cup of tea, like usual, and something smelled burnt. I poured myself a cup, looked in the teapot, and the bottom of the pot was burnt. Like blackened, crispy burnt. I don’t even know how this could happen. I attempted to clean it off, to no avail, and now am too afraid to use it again as I am not willing risk consuming burnt metal. Seriously, what????"
"Very disappointed in this ""stainless steel"" tea kettle. It got two rusty spots within two months of using it. Nose there are orange flakes floating in my water? I'd like to contact the seller if I can find that information, to see about a replacement"
"I like the size, quick boiling, and gooseneck design, makes pour-over coffee and other precise pouring easy without dribbling.I didn't realize it was uninsulated though, so requires more care than coming from our previous insulated one.Also there is a metallic solder-like smell that comes from somewhere inside the base of the unit. I did some lead test strips and it doesn't seem to be leaching lead into the water or anything, but you get a whiff of ""hot metal"" here and there when using it."
"I really like this teapot, unfortunately rust developed on the interior of the teapot within 60 days it may have been sooner, but that’s when I looked inside and noticed it. This is very concerning, as it can be a severe health risk for most people. I will contact the seller and see if they have the integrity to replace their rusted product and I will update this review."
"Firstly it is cute and I love the goose neck, Bought it in December and shipped it to Jamaica, started using it the first night (Jan 9 2021).  When I saw it at the customs office I was surprised, because the collar is different from the one advertised.  It is as if it was painted with flat emulsion and the other with Berger 404 (oil paint)1.  The colour is much duller than advertised and smaller, did not realise that it would be so small.  When it came I had to review my order to confirm that it is the same thing.2.  The plastic parts are cheap and cheap looking -3.  There is a loud click when the water is heated, but the kettle does not shut off and the water starts spilling from the top and seems to be leaking from the bottom.  On first use I thought I had place too much water so the 3rd use I filled it half way and the same thing happened4.  It heats up super fast thoughI need a refund for $40 I could get a cuter and functional kettle, whomever heard of an electric kettle which does not automatically shut of f when the water is boiled?.  it is going to cost me too much to send it back.See exhibit A above. will post the video asap"
"This works fine but came with no instructions.  I left the lid on and mold started forming after two days. It says I can sign up for a 500 day warranty, but when I went to the website, I needed an order number to do that (the Amazon order number doesn't work). I tried contacting their support team and the link is invalid.I will order from a US based company next time."
"Started to rust after 2 uses. Smells of plastic and water boiled in it also tastes of plastic. I was hoping the plastic smell/taste was just because it was new but we've had it over a month now and it's still prevalent. It's super cute but it I knew so much of it was plastic, I never would have bought it. Won't buy from this company again."
"Purchased 2 months ago after replacing my electric  kettle of 10+ years. Last night I went to make some tea and the kettle would not turn on. I kept very good care not to get the kettle or base wet, checked the cord for damage (it sits near my toaster oven) and made sure the outlet was working. Two months in I have a non-working new kettle. I purchase a lot on Amazon- easily my worst purchase to date."
"Awesome kettle and cute design, but it stopped working after 1.5 years for no apparent reason. I expect products to be more durable and to last longer than that."
"I like this kettle. The shape is perfect for a pour over, and I like the color and design. Unfortunately, after only 10 months, the auto shut off feature is already broken.  For reference, the kettle is used one time per day, not getting heavy use."
Kettle started leaking water at the base and gives off a faint plastic burning smell. This is after 2 years of 1-2x daily use. Otherwise a lovely Kettle.
"Cute, but not as elegant as I thought. Also no keep warm function and smallish so not worth it overall"
Kettle is very nice looking. And has a beautiful finish on it. But Products leaked when on after heating was done.
Sadly this kettle only worked for 2 months and has died already today trying to make my morning tea.  Disappointed for sure.
"I actully returned this item because it's not copper at all. The pot is brown. While it looks nice and seemed like it would work well, I wanted a copper pot to match our kitchen and this pot simply isnt copper at all. Its 100% brown in color. It's not even metallic like the picture would suggest. If you want a brown teapot I'm sure it's great, but is defintely not copper like they say."
"It’s very cute, looks like picture, boils water.But it consistently leaks in the same spot and gets near the electric components.Troubleshooting was not helpful. I reached out to company"
"The switch does not work, so I cannot boil water.Water leaks at the bottom of the Kettle. I'm looking for a repair service but don't know the way."
"Sadly, my kettle didn't last very long. For a while, it acted as if the kettle and base weren't connecting as they did at the beginning. The light would flicker and then stop. A static like sound would happen too which was concerning. I have a basic Walmart Faberware kettle in my AirBnb and it has outlasted this one by far.Super disappointing."
"I really wanted to love this electric kettle, but I used it once and these random spots have popped up on the bottom. Does anyone know what these are? Trying to contact seller to either refund or replace the item. I have a friend who has the same product, but her kettle does not have these spots. Wondering if mine is defected."
"I love EVERYTHING about this kettle except the toxic smell it exudes upon use.  Part of the outside is plastic so when it heats up the plastic gives off a toxic smell that can't be healthy to inhale.  That's what we get when we buy toxic cheap stuff from China.  However the shape, color, spout, size, and everything else about it is perfect.  I especially like that the inside is all metal."
"I’ve had this for about 6 months and all of a sudden it started screeching/whistling while heating up. It’s just a really loud unpleasant sound. I am doing a white vinegar cleaning and letting it sit for several hours to see if it helps. Other complaint is the lid, when new it had a film of black oil inside the crevice. It took about 25 cleanings to clear it all out. Will try another brand next time. Wish more things were made in the U.S."
"It foes look like in the picture, so the colors do match. The metal heater part is very thin and feels flimsy, it doesn’t hold the heat for long so you can boil your water and it would be cooled off sooner then it would in a “regular” kettle. The lid comes all the way off it’s not attached to the body, gets kinda hot. It does look nice."
"I've had this kettle for about a year, and use it about once daily. However, it seems to have sprung a leak toward the bottom that has rapidly gotten worse over the last few days and now I don't feel comfortable using it anymore."
"Finally unboxed to use, left it partially full of water overnight on the base and most of the water leaked out all over the counter and onto the floor.  Looks like it is coming from the on/off switch.  Way past the return date.  Unuseable now, water and electronics don't work well together.  >_<"
"The first one sent to me wouldn't shut off after reaching boiling point. They had great customer service and sent me a replacement very promptly.I've been really happy with the replacement for several months now, only to wake up yesterday and find it too no longer shuts off once the water is boiling. It's a shame because it's a really efficient and stylish kettle when it's working properly, but sadly, I dont think I'll be getting another."
UPDATE!!I am disappointed of my New Kettle. It only works best when you use a cup of water. Today I tried adding extra water 2 cups and the coffee I made was boiling thru the outside of the cover and nose opening I had to unplug it quickly 😳. Scared 😱 the he'll out of me.Don't get me wrong the water gets hot fast but also as you're sipping the coffee it tends to cool down pretty quickly.
It started leaking at the base of the spout a little over a year after I bought it and I never heard from customer service after contacting them.
"Looks nice and is small and compact, but when it boils it leaks out at the lid even when maintaining fill level limit. Needs a gasket in its lid design. Updated: a few weeks in and the leaking is getting worse, when it boils and when it pours now. Kettles should NOT leak from the lid."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Every time I go to use it there's a huge puddle of water underneath. It seems like it's leaking from the bottom edges. Water would get all over my counter too. Also does not keep the water hot for very long.
"I bought this kettle mostly because the color matched my kitchen. That was my bad. When I first started using it, I noticed how hot the water got....too hot for coffee, it was boiling. I also noticed when I used it there was a smell of hot plastic in the air. I thought that would go away. Now, nearly two months of daily use, I still have the smell of plastic. I do not trust that this plastic is also going into the water I brew, then into whatever I am making, then into my body. This is not safe. I contacted the manufacturer about a week ago and they have not responded. 2-3 days ago, Amazon asked if the manufacturer had contacted me, I told them they hadn't. Still, I have no response from anyone.If you like your water above boiling temp and smelling like plastic, then this is the kettle for you!"
"Love the look, the color and theres no smell. BUT the inside has water spots when I haven't even used it.I paid for a new one, not a used kettle.Then when I tried to get the 500 bonus warranty, it claims my order doesn't exist."
"I have only had my kettle a month. It leaked from the bottom every time I filled it. I could never find where exactly on the bottom it was leaking from but if left with water in it would leak all over the counter (not to mention a huge safety hazard). After only a handful of uses it now does not work at all. Tried all of the troubleshooting, and there also are no return options. I don’t typically leave bad reviews but this one seems justified."
"Not the exact “stainless steel” as advertised. Plastic feels like a child’s toy. Aesthetically cute and small, (4 cups for coffee pour over). The green color is accurate in the picture. For the price paid, it’s constructed cheaper than expected. I don’t have high expectations that it will last as long as my electric kettle that’s still going strong after 10 years."
its only okay - you have to fill below the 'Max' line otherwise as you pour a little dribble of water will spill out- I bought it to replace my ceramic Bella electric kettle because its lighter. haven't decided if I'll keep it yet
Liked the size and how fast water would be ready BUT any remaining water left in the kettle would leak non stop. Returned.
Quit heating up in less than 45 days. Only used 4 times.
Broke after being lightly used for less than a year.
"Don’t buy it. Mine stopped working within 6 months, tried to contact customer service and they told me I have to reach out to the manufacturer. Manufacturer never respondedDon’t waste your time or money"
"This was a great kettle for about 3 months, then slowly the paint started to rub off, and the spots where metal meets plastic has started to leak.. as well as at the joint of the spout. Would not recommend for a long term kettle. Good to use as a temp until you can save up for a worth while sturdy one."
cute teapot but way too loud. am returning.
It’s just ok. A lot of cheap plastic. Skip it.
"I like the color and the build. It does what it says it does. My only problem is that its plastic parts seem to be made of really cheap plastic. When hot, they give out apparently toxic smell. I'm not sure if it will go away over time, and if it does, I will update my review. Until then, I can't give more than 3 stars to this product.UPDATE: I had to return this product after all. I cannot say that the smell won't go away forever, but it didn't easily disappear as well, unfortunately. It's unfortunate because I really liked the design of this kettle. I think they could find better material for the plastic parts."
"First I LOVED the color of this.  I wanted an electric gooseneck kettle. I really wanted a full liter size, but they are hard to find, so this one is a little smaller than I had hoped it would be. Also, the lid drips when pouring water out, perhaps the condensation of the water up on the inside of the lid come pools, but it is coming out where the brown plastic piece (with the lid handle) meets the metal green, water comes out of the seam there. It doesn't happen every time, but enough to be annoying. I'd send it back, but I really like this kettle....  So, overall, I like it"
"Good product. Looks nice and does what it needs to. Mine, However, vame with a small leak. It is small enough that it will not effect performance or cause alarm. But still wish it didn't have it."
I really liked this kettle and it worked great for a little while. The base ended up burning out after not too long and now it is useless. I switched back to my stove top kettle.
"Other reviews say that this kettle is fast at boiling. I agree, but it definitely not as fast as other kettles i have used that are around the same price. I timed the boil and with 1 liter of water, it took about 5 and a half minutes. I was hoping that the kettle would be able to boil in about 3 minutes, but at least it does boil well and has an auto shut off. Another annoying thing is that the kettle is the strainer at the spout. I am not sure if the kettle is supposed to be able to filter out tea leaves from the water, but it definitely can’t. There is a large gap between the filter and the spout, so all the tea just flows out. If the kettle isn’t suppose to filter tea, I am not sure why the filter is there."
"My ""Likes"" for this product is the price - 17.99 and the color-orange.As for the performance, I give it a 7 out of 10. It does heat up well, but it is LOUD! There is no 3am boiling of water without it being heard. a cheapAs for my overall ""Dislikes"" of the product, I would have to say it is definitely cheap in quality, and the 3-prong plug-in is a complete turn-off.Overall, for an under ""20 dollar"" purchase, it will do."
"I needed to replace my water kettle that went out, I was initially going to purchase the same one, but I saw the price on this one and decided to give it a try. I really liked the way it looked, and the fact that it held more water. However, once I received the item I noticed that the handle is large in width and the buttons are oddly placed. I have small hands and found the handle design and placement of the on/off buttons and the button to open the kettle cumbersome. Unfortunately, I will be returning the item. It is a really nice design, but if you have small hands it may not be for you."
"Made in China and top plastic lid gathers steam that drips into the boiling water, however if you keep the lid open to prevent this, the auto shut off does not work. I don't trust plastic materials from China or anywhere else that gets into food and water because of great potential for toxicity and microplastics.  Therefore removed two stars. If you are someone who doesn't care about microplastics and chemicals in your water, three stars for working well at least so far. I'm looking for a non-toxic one, no plastic anywhere near water or steam. In the meantime I'll use this with the lid open and keep an eye on it because it won't automatically shut off that way. Once I find a truly non-toxic model, this will be tossed."
I've used this several times now and I like it but it takes just as long to boil the water as it does using the stove so I hope it's at least using less electric otherwise it's just taking up valuable space on the counter. It's glass all around and the water doesn't touch any plastic except on the filter when you pour out so there's no gross taste or smell of plastic chemicals.
"Update: July 28th 2015. Six months after my purchase and the kettle is no longer useable. I clean this kettle daily and it still looks brand new and we use bottled water only so it's not the water or or a build up of minerals inside the kettle.When it's heating up there is a super strong odour of something burning and that odour is coming directly  ""inside"" the glass kettle.  My advise  for health and safety reasons is to avoid this kettle. I have owned at least a dozen electric kettles during my lifetime ( age 68 ) and I have never ever encounter such a problem. LOOKS GREAT BUT CAUTION. The best looking kettle we have ever owned is now in the garbage.UPDATE March 15th, 2015:  After 2 months of Use:Well here we are two months after my purchase date and I now have to give this item 4.5 stars instead of my original 4 stars.It still looks as good as the 1st day I received it. Like any glass kettle you may want to clean the insides  every day with 1/2 cup of pure white vinegar and an equal amount of water.  I like things looking there very best at all times so regardless if it was plastic or glass it would still be cleaned daily anyways. The outside plastic is just as easy to clean as the glass. My initial report stated I thought the plastic was cheap but after 2 months of use its actually very durable and easy to maintain and has no discolouration to date. The cord is just the right length and the kettle attaches to the base thoughtlessly like a magnet.The handle design and balance of this kettle is far better than first reported. It's very well balanced when pouring out the water and the lid opener button and on and off switch work flawlessly. It takes the normal amount of time to boil water but its very quiet in the process. I wish the tiny filter screen at the front was detachable and that would make it just a little easier for cleaning when I put my hand inside the kettle to clean it. The screen is not in the way, it simply would just make things easier with a dish rag in your hand.The boiled water tastes great, and there is no plastic taste that I can detect.  For the small price that these kettles are selling for on Amazon I strongly recommend that you don't miss out on a great product and try one. Many of the negative comments listed about this product are just not founded. My review stems from a confirmed buy,  and after 2 months of use I personally wanted you all to know I now give this product the 4.5 Stars it truly deserves. John Turcotte Ontario Canada.My  Original Review:Looks and works great but in truth this is not a 5 star quality product, but is far better than most other kettles for the price paid.  To start with,  all the plastic feels cheap especially the base.  The base really sounds cheap every time you place the pot on it. A thicker and smoother type of plastic should have been used and this is why I only gave this product 4 stars. The power cord is heavy duty gauge coated in nice rubber and it's long enough for most counters. You receive instructions to boil water at least 4 times to remove any odours or unwanted tastes and I did this procedure 6 times and I did not notice any foreign tastes or smells. The handle is much larger than required and is not the greatest of designs and feels slightly off balance when you pick the pot up half full of water.My old kettle was all plastic with a flat stainless steel burner plate in the bottom. Excessive mineral consumption causes a lot of the reflux and digestive problems that many individuals worldwide endure daily. I did know our town water had some minerals and that surprised me because it's chlorinated.  I had to boil a cup of vinegar inside a pot full of water once every two weeks to remove the build up of white scale that would accumulate on the stainless steel heating element constantly. So if your water contains a lot of minerals be prepared for a shock,  because all glass kettles will instantly reveal the amount of minerals in your water.The minerals float on top and instantly start to appear when the water starts boiling and these tiny white micro flakes look like hell through the walls of the glass kettle.  So if you want to own a glass kettle you better get use to the fact that you will likely be washing the kettle out after every use.  We use to just leave the water in the kettle after it was done boiling and just add more water to the kettle as needed. Once you view whats in the water after its boiled, you will never leave any water in any kettle ever again. You all know the old saying "" What You Don't See Won't Kill You "" . Well unfortunately when you use a glass kettle "" You will see it "".  I'm going to try distilled water to see if the water remains clear after boiling.I can just get my normal size adult male hand inside the glass pot to wash it after every use and its easy to clean right now. The pot being clear glass it will not take very long for the white scale to really be visible and build up on the inside of the glass walls. I wish the little hanging filter screen was removable when you go to wash the pot,  but I can't see anyway to unhook it from the lid. There was no indication the screen is removable on the directions / instructions that you receive. The lid and power on buttons and the automatic off feature all work very well. The blue Led Lights are absolutely beautiful and the kettle lights up the entire kitchen when you have no other lights on.The pot is much fatter than you think from the photos that are posted.  This 1.5 L  is only  1 inch shorter than the Ovente 1.7 L model. So that should give you a pretty good reference on how tall the 1.5L  really is and its true size over all.  Four cups of water ( 1 L  ) brings the level of water exactly to the half way mark etched on the side of the glass pot. Its quiet when boiling and boil's water at about the same speed as most kettles. As previously stated this glass kettle looks and works great but is just slightly lacking that 5 Star quality. In all fairness though, this is a solid 4 star product and for the price paid you will simply not go wrong.  I recommend this "" Ovente "" product to all.  I hope my review is helpful."
"it worked as intended first few months but now the auto shut-off feature is broken so if i don't manually turn the kettle off, it keeps restarting and boiling water over and over again. did not even last warranty given time!"
"Loved this kettle, works well, boils water fast but I have to give it 3 stars because after a year of use the plastic between the glass and black bottom is breaking off. Not sure how much longer we’ll be able to use it."
Decent product for the price and gets the job done.It’s been about a month 1/2 since I’ve had this kettle and already the mesh spout protector is ripping. So its purpose is already not being used correctly. I’ve contacted Amazon they have nothing to offer me and Ovente customer support also can’t help. Not upset at the seller but there should be options to be assist customers with defective products. I can’t even try to return this item since it’s past the time frame. Very frustrating as that piece of the kettle is supposed to filter the residue and all that’s in the water over time.Please keep that in mind when purchasing.Hope this helps someone. Other than that this kettle heats up and gets the job done.
"This kettle is everything the description said it is except for one area which is the internal mesh filter that is connected to the moving lid. By design the filter contracts a bit when you open the lid so it shouldn't be in the way and then when you close it, it'll swing back into position. Problem I've noticed that it takes an extra good few seconds to automatically turn off after the water is at full boil and is directly linked to a design flaw that where the mesh filter meets the inside of the glass it doesn't completely seal off the water spout exit and while pouring the water there's lots of room for water to pass around the filter. This also has an affect on the auto shut off which relies heavily on the steam inside to build pressure which in turn causes the kettle to turn off. As some of the steam escapes the filter it takes longer to build enough steam to make it turn off.Pictures show the space around the filter where it's not completely sealed."
Mine arrived with a cracked handle. Besides that it's a good standard kettle.
"I had used Ovente for many years, and after I checked my records. It looks like the unit life getting shorter and shorter. The one I brought 10 months ago not working again. It seems like from 2 years working time down to less than a year now. I will try another brand not this any more."
"I really wanted to like this kettle, but it smelled like burnt plastic and made the water taste bad.  I thought that the more I used it the less it would do this because the material would off-gas over time, but that didn't happen.  I bought another kettle to replace it."
Not really my favorite product. I wouldn’t necessarily buy it again or recommend. I found that the tea leaves would get stick in the corners at the bottom of the inside jug. I would only boil water in this and nothing else. I really wanted something that I could add rice to boil.
Stopped working less than 6 Months
"This kettle works great, looks nice but I’ve had this one for a year and there’s bits of plastic breaking off from where the glass and plastic meet on the bottom. It is used pretty regularly but still happy with the function."
"12/16/19 Update- this kettle has died- with the almost 2 years of daily use. I am not sure what happened but now some sort of an electrical malfunction causes the gfci and all nearby gfci outlets in my  kitchen to trip every time this kettle is plugged in.  Additionally I will comment - the black filter plastic under the lid melted a bit, to me is served no purpose since I would NEVER  pour hot water through plastic. The filter feature was in the way when filling with water. I learned that when the kettle when used at or close to the max fill line it would make a plastic smell likely from this plastic feature. I never used tap water and only used bottled water and R/O water from my water store and did not have a problem with scale. It looked good on my white counter top, and sadly I can not find another white kettle with no plastic touching the boiling water in any nearby stores. Because of the short life and because the pan I have been using on the stove until I find something else, boils water faster- I truly do not know if I would buy this again...................................................................................................................................The Unit is not all glass, the bottom of the carafe is stainless and the glass and the bottom are sealed together with something that looks like it does come in contact with the water.  I'm wondering what that sealing substance is and if their is any health concerns??2 stars for function and a 3rd star for good looks.I may as well use a saucepan on the stove for how looong this thing takesAfter the 1st  boil there is visible moisture trapped behind the glass and inside where the lighting is and I'm wondering how long 'till that causes problems. After the 1st boil the heating element is already stained.Other than coolness factor the light seems useless and may cause problems as moisture is already inside there after the first 8 1/2 min almost boil.The Instructions said to boil 4 times before using.  At max fill line 1.5L: using my cell phone timer1st ""boil"" after 8 and 1/2minutes the unit had not shut off yet or even produced steam, I was able to pass my fingers through the water(quickly)without burning.  3rd boil while unit was already warmed up took 9min 2 sec to get to a full boil.4th boil while unit was already warmed up took longer 9min 14 sec to get to a full boil hmmm?The stiff round white 5/16 inch thick 3 pronged cord needs to be wound internally inside the base and come out a notch in order for the base to lay flat reducing the cord to 15 inches of usable cord length photo attached. It was really stiff and bent the opposite way, I did not wish to risk forcing a made in china cord through the notch without winding to get the full cord length. The stiffness of the cord prevents the unit from being pushed back to the wall.I've owned an all stainless Aroma and have used it daily for 4 years it is still going strong and looks shiny inside and out.1.5 L.The Ovante seems to take a long time and the water does not get as hot compared to my Aroma kettle. With the Aroma after 3min 50 sec it produces steam and 4min 10 sec for full boil shut off. The only drawback of the aroma is that I just found that there is plastic inside at the bottom where the boiling hot water comes in contact.I purchased the Ovente to avoid consuming hot plastic water. I am not sure about the sealant in the Ovante and it takes a looong time compared to what I have become accustom to for boiling water, The Ovente is like going back to 3g after using 4g. The Ovente is also not as easy to line up on the base.I do have to say the main reason for purchase is health reasons and price, however it does look good, I bought the white one it looks very current. I have to turn on another light source to put water in the kettle anyway so the fun blue lights are in my opinion an impractical thing that could go wrong.Overall I will be on the look out for something better and likely spending more.  I may even send it back because of the moisture leak.Hope this helps your decision making."
Little cracks at the bottom rim and idk why - I still use it but it’s not ideal aesthetically or functionality because it leaks a little but when pour water :(
"Like the fact that this product heats water very quickly at a good price the outside of the kettle reasonably cool and like that it was made of glass and not plastic. Especially like the fact that the cover stays up when you fill it, that’s a big big plus. It’s also heavy on the bottom so it doesn’t tip over and that’s a good safety feature. The problem is that the handle is not designed Well, As if the person who designed it had never used a kettle before. Meaning No, you don’t burn your fingers because there’s a plastic piece to protect from that but it’s super awkward to handle if you have arthritis in your hands and it’s not well balanced. Also the pour spout spills  and drips.  I wish someone would make a well-designed glass kettle that has the good parts of this kettle like the cover staying up But itself, and you fill it easily, the large amount of water it holds  and the fastness of the boiling - Combine that with This kettle doesn’t have a handle that’s easy to hold and well-balanced in the hand and a good pour spout."
I bought it thinking I could boil milk in it for hot cocoa but it was a failed! It burn the milk and it stained the kettle! Heated fast
"Used this daily, it worked fine for a while. Now it's leaking and the seal between the base and the glass is breaking down and falling out."
"When I received it, I immediately did not like the blue lights at the bottom & the plastic filter on the spout smelled bad (as in plastic chems) & I never poured my water through it...I used it only to heat water, usually one pot 3 times a day.  About a month ago, it began shutting off after I started it & I had to juggle it & turn it on again almost every day.  This morning, it would not turn on at all & I had to order a replacement.  When it worked, it was fine...did have to use vinegar to remove the deposits about every 2 weeks; but may be about my water's content.  I am not buying it again due to it not lasting as long as seems right, the plastic filter that could not be removed by such as me & I tried & the blue lights."
This will be my third buy of this exact model. The first one I had only lasted about a month until the lid wouldn’t stay down all the way causing the boiling to shut off early.The next one lasted over a year but now the button to start the boil refuses to stay pressed down all the way. The boil gets to a point of small bubbles but never gets to the full boiling point it used to. What an odd thing to stop working. Here’s to hoping #3 lasts a while.
I’ve had this since September 2022 and I used it a lot. I has been a good product for most of the last two years. I recently noticed water on my counter top. After close inspection I found that the kettle where the glass meets the plastic was cracked. The glass is fine but the plastic is broken in multiple places. The repeated temperature changes the plastic part has degraded to where it is no longer sealed. If it had not leaked I would have given it 5 stars.
My Capresso heats 6 cups of water in about 5 minutes. This one takes about 9. It's pretty though.
"I do love my kettle, it boils fast and the blue light feature is a cute little touch. Unfortunately the plastic handle becomes very hot when the water is boiled. If I try to pour right when it’s done the steam can be felt through the cracks and it’s burnt my hand a couple times. If you wait a bit it’s okay but unfavorable when wanting extra hot water. Overall a nice kettle, reasonably priced, you get what you pay for."
"I like the bright color orange, and value for the money. However I think that the automatic shutoff is pre-mature and not allowing the water to get hot and stay hot. Boiling water in my pot was much better for me. I spend hours looking at reviews on what to purchase, I chose the wrobg ine in my opinion. I'll l keep it only because it's been used and it's not worth my time to pack and send back. #NotRecommended #Dissatisfied"
The glass started to break off after a few months using this.
"It takes 4 minutes to boil 500ml.My stove top can boil water in 2 so there isn’t much point buying this for your house.It could still be handy if youre going camping or if you just dont have a stove near by.Otherwise it is a good product.Fair price, decent quality and looks nice.Just very slow to boil."
"Very cute kettle/electric teapot.  Essential to unplug after use.  One day after a surgery I did not unplug mine, but was standing in the kitchen, and to my surprised horror, the empty kettle clicked and turned itself on. Not exactly safe.Also, for those with chemical sensitivity, even 3 months after initial use, every time I use the kettle, the plastic parts emit a lot of VOCs when the kettle is turned on.despite its cuteness, I would not purchase again."
Rusts on the bottom pretty fast just bought it a few months ago and already rusted. I only left water in there a few times on accident overnight.
"Product worked well and looked good but started to fail after 1 year. I bought this October 2023, and just relaxed with a different brand October 2024."
"It is 1 1/2 quarts—which is good—but it takes longer to heat & us not as user friendly with the buttons & switches, but the automatic shut-off works good, so I am satisfied with this product."
"Bought the kettle in 2022, just now started leaking at the bottom. Had to throw it away."
"This was my second one of these in several years. I bought my first one in 2015 or so, and it lasted maybe 4-5 years before the connection between the base and the kettle wore out. After that, it wouldn't boil any more. I bought a second one probably around 2019, and it wore out in mid 2023. I like the blue lights and the automatic shutoff. It took a little longer to heat up than I would have liked. Realistically, the durability is probably what I should expect at this price point, but it was still disappointing.I probably would've moved on to an electric kettle from a better brand, but I moved into a home that has boiler connected to a tap and no longer need one."
"It doesn’t shut off when lifted in mid cycle. You have to remember to press the off button.It takes a lot longer to boil less amount of water in a side by side compression with my old Hamilton Beach pot.The top cover doesn’t fully open make access to inside the pot challenging.The mesh filter appears to have some plastic material which is not so desirable.Other than these issues it appears to function properly so far, but I’ve only been using it for the past couple of weeks."
Boils slow but looks and feels great
"I enjoy the hot kettle. It's not going to last long.  What, less than 3 months? The plastic sealant on the kettle cracked off.  I thought no big deal, but now it is started to leak real bad.It really heated the water.  The on button showed ambiance.  I liked that.  Also, the kettle was faster to heat water and then filter.  Pouring spout was excellent designed.Wished that it would have lasted longer."
"I have purchased this product twice over the past few years. They work well for about 1 1/2 years and then die. Despite the low price, I can't see re-buying one every 18 months."
"This kettle will boil water quickly. I only rated it three stars because the base the kettle sits on seems to be made out of cheap plastic, which worries me a little and no where in the product description does it mention to use distilled water. I’m not prepared to have bottles of distilled water around for whenever I want to make tea so I just use my tap water or filtered water from my fridge."
I would have loved to give this a 5 star rating but unfortunately I cannot .The light only worked once and that’s the very first time I took it out of the box and used it .It heats pretty quickly and it’s easy to clean .Very light weight and doesn’t leak but I just wish the light actually worked .
"Now my kettle just started not working. As in, push the power button and nothing happens. Wait a bit, a few hours perhaps, and it works again. I’m waiting for it to break down entirely before replacing it to be sure I get my money’s worth."
Value for money - yesDurability - no10 months after purchase it won’t turn on anymore
"Only buy this as a short term/disposable kettle. It was okay while it lasted, but $20 extra I can get a more durable and more feature rich model. I specifically got this model so I wouldn't have to deal with digital controls, and there would be less points of failure. It failed anyway. I would NOT recommend this to anyone who is serious about having a dedicated water kettle in their life."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            We intended on this being a cheap temporary replacement kettle, but never got round to buying a better one. It has been used a lot every day since then-14 months- and still works. Not the fastest kettle and the filter disintegrated, not that it sealed to the glass to begin with. But for the price it was a good deal. We’ve had kettles costing 5 times the price that only made it past a year.It’s easy to clean and you can see when it needs descaling. Just don’t expect the filter to catch all the scale if any floats out when pouring, even when new."
"I got this for work, I am remote most of the time, but when I am at work I usually use a stinger to heat water and I finally decided to get a kettle. I picked this one because is was small, inexpensive, and had a lot of reviews with a high star count. It was packed well and looked nice, but had a chemical smell to it, like plastic and glue.I washed it a few times to get the chemical smell out if it. It still smelled very strongly, so I boiled vinegar water and let it cool, rinsed it out. It still smelled, although not as bad. I ran a full batch of vinegar water, the first time I only filled it half way and this time I filled it to the maximum marker, let it cool and rinsed it. I didn't get back to the kettle for a few weeks... when I finally got back to it, the smell was almost gone, so I figured one more vinegar water run should finish off the smell. I filled it a little below the maximum marker and it no longer powered on. By this time, it was too late to return it.Make sure you use it a few times right away... I waited too long to start using it and took too long preparing it for use.I guess I will be paying a higher price to get a larger kettle of a reputable brand that will definitely work when I am ready to use it. Plus, it won't smell as bed. I have a good one at home that I've had no issues with which I've had for about four or five years without any issue. Plus it didn't smell bad when I opened it up.Get a more reputable brand if you don't have time to properly prepare and break-in this kettle before the return window closes."
It worked fine for 3 years.  I suppose that's good enough for an appliance that cost $21.
Not happy with this buy. Will not recommend. Somehow it does not boil water all around . The water boiled in this kettle has been tasting funny. But water boiled in another kettle that i bought today from a store tasted normal . so i will throw this one away.
Worked well and inexpensive. However it recently stopped working after a number of years. Only ever used to boil water.
"This kettle brings water to a boil in a short amount of time…it does its job.  However, I am not a fan of it.The lid does not open far enough to make cleaning easy and if you don’t have sufficient room to place it directly under a water tap, it can be awkward to fill up.When you pour the hot water, you need to grab low on the handle or you will get the uncomfortably hot steam roll up on your hand.This is not a sleek as my old one.  I regret not buying the same Ovente I had previously but at the time it would have taken an extra week to get here compared to this.This one will do but in my opinion, it falls short in comparison to this (OVENTE Electric Kettle White KP72W)"
"To be fair my family used the kettle everyday multiple times a day so we shouldv’e known not to cheap out. It was affordable, compact, and did an excellent job while it still worked, just very disappointing it died less than a year into owning. Will be investing in a higher quality kettle next time!"
Bought one failed in 5 years. I guess it's not that bad. Bought another one.
"I absolutely loved the kettle until not even five months after purchasing, the safety mechanism that turns it off when its boiling, stopped working. I enjoyed this kettle because I was able to turn it on to get it to boil while I was doing something else in the kitchen without having to worry, it was going to burn or overheat. Now I have to turn it off manually. Other than that, I enjoyed it."
"How I went without, love this.use it nightly for tea. Was wiping it out with vinegar noticed tiny cracks in glass. Once a day use should have lasted longer. Amazon says nothing they can do."
"Love the product, until I picked it up one day, around the rim was cracked and fell off and now I'm hearing glass particles at the bottom of the kettle  Inside when I pour the water out."
The spout is very unforgiving. When you fill to max line (or lower) and try to pour the water comes spilling out. Such a mess of hot water.
"Bought the kettle and about 4 or 5 months ago then the glass portion around the bottom rim of the kettle kept falling out so I didn’t want the pieces to end up in our hot beverages so I wrote to support. Sent them the pictures of the glass and the kettle. They replied to me telling me to cut the cord, send them a picture of it and they will replace the kettle. Rather than send a replacement. So I am to do without hot water until they send a new one. That is really low of Ovente. I will be looking for a better quality kettle to replace it and until that one is delivered I will just have to use it until the replacement is delivered. I lodged a further complaint and support came through and delivered a brand new one so now I have cut the cord on the old one and sent them the picture. Happy the issue was resolved."
"The little blue glowing lights when it's on is about the only thing that was accurate. Difficult to fill with the strainer attached to the top,  took over 5 minutes to boil the water and doesn't stay warm enough. I suggest you look elsewhere for a tea kettle as this one is cute but doesn't work."
I have had this for maybe two months three tops and the glass on the top where the handle is just snapped! It was good while it worked and worked as it should have. I didn’t man handle the kettle or slam it down anything so as to why it cracked and broke I am not sure.
I loved it at first but after few months the auto turn off stopped working and the water keeps boiling non stop leaving a mess on the counter. do not buy!!
"Chose this one because of the price and the color. I figure this out everything about the same. But nope, it's not fast like I've experienced with other people's."
"Starts off nice buuuuttttt-had this thing for over a year and while at first i liked it i  slowly grew to loathe it and finally after this morning i was pushed to the limit that is me reviewing it on amazon-without coffee i should add because the combination of my pre coffee useless and its post design phase uselessness proves a caffeine killer-or at least delayer.Its good looking, compact enough and seemingly well designed. Oh look, theres an led light! It makes it look pretty! Oooooooo the buttons are on the handle, thats smart! In practice these neat little things do the opposite of what they should. It might not and probably will not bother you if you are not a crazy person like myself who thinks that if you're going to bother designing something then that effort may as well go towards designing it well.First off the buttons. You can reach the on and off button while walking to the sink to fill it but not the ""open"" button. This requires you to use two hands to press a tiny little button. Since i use the on button primarily while the kettle is settled in its base and therefore have two free hands to press a button it would make more sense to have THAT button out of reach. Sure, seems minor and if that were the only glitch id be drinking my coffee-the coffee i am currently waiting for the hot water with which to brew-rather than sitting here complaining about yet another s*** lousy design. Oh and pressing that button does not even open the lid all the way, a third motion is required to manually open it the last third so that kettle can be held level while filling. Brilliant.Second thing is there is no audio cue to the water being done. Ive notice that some regular old stove top kettles don't whistle anymore, strange, is it because the whistle is so jarring that people would rather just hope they remember theres a pot on? Is it engineered obsolescence? No whistle, water boils off while forgetful vengeful angry internet reviewer is angrily reviewing and blammo, another ruined kettle? It doesn't matter, for another 20 cents a tiny beeping bit could be where it should be-in a fancy electric kettle that already has a circuit board.Thirdly you might be thinking ""but the LED, surely the LED is a signal?!!?"" In that thought you are correct! The LED is a signal that you have turned the kettle on, because without it that information would be thoroughly difficult to acquire. The LED, ahem, the LED turns….OFF when the water is ready. Now, i am aware that early alarm clock technology was based primarily around the concept of a bell that rang throughout the night until a set time when it would switch off, the change in environmental conditions shocking the sleeper awake AND i can only hope that in one hundred, maybe two hundred years electric tea kettle manufacturers will heed my call to use whatever inexplicably non audible notification system they've developed to signal the water being hot rather than the water being cold….in the meantime this kettle will turn off its light and quietly skulk to the back of your awareness in an instant, the very instant in which you'd hoped you'd be medicating your already deficient awareness with caffeine. I don't know if there is a better kettle out there but you better hope there is or or theres not a chance in hell we'll be landing a spaceship on an asteroid so that oil rig workers can drill a hole and stick a nuke in there  to keep it from slamming into the earth when that time comes"
"I chose a glass kettle because I have poor health and wanted to avoid the potential for contaminants to leach into my water from a plastic or metal kettle. So I was disappointed to find this is (aside from the glass part) made with some very stinky cheap plastic. I left it out on the porch for a month to offgass before I could be near it without my lips burning. So choosing this to keep safe didn't turn out so great.  Aside from cheap materials, it's poorly designed in several ways. There's a small power connection on the bottom of the jug where it clicks into the base which is hard to center with no visual cues. Imagine trying to plug your cel into its charger in the dark. If the base maybe had a ridge around the edge, to center the jug as you place it, rather than being perfectly flat, that would solve this problem. I get annoyed when I have to slide the kettle around for several seconds to find the right position every time I set it down. And I wonder if the connections will wear out early because of all this fumbling.  The kettle won't restart right away after boiling. So if I mess up and don't put quite enough water in to fill the teapot, and go to boil up a little more... nope. I haven't timed it but it seems to need at least five or ten minutes before it can be used again.The lid can't be lifted by hand- it is opened by pressing a button. This button is positioned where you can't hit it with your hand that's holding the jug. The button that they chose to put furthest out on the handle, where you CAN reach it with your thumb as you're holding the jug? The off button. You'd never need to do that... it is automatically off whenever you pick it up off the base. They should have positioned the buttons the other way. You grab the jug, walk to the sink or water cooler, and turn on the water with your free hand while opening the lid with your carrying hand. I know it's not that big a deal, but they could so easily have made this thing more user friendly.  The lid opens only halfway, and has a useless screen thing sticking out to further block access, so it is like playing ""Operation"" every morning, trying to get the water into the kettle. The screen serves no purpose because it doesn't even come close to blocking the entire spout. I don't know if anyone would make tea in their kettle but if you did, the screen would not keep the tea leaves out of your cup. And it wouldn't keep a thirsty fly from crawling in while the kettle's sitting unattended. The gap between the screen & the spout is a quarter to a half an inch.  I guess it's cool that the kettle lights up blue while it heats, & turns itself off upon boiling, so you definitely couldn't forget it on and burn your house down. I'd love the light feature if it turned red upon boiling to catch your attention. I tend to get distracted tidying the kitchen and forget I had meant to make tea. Then I notice a few minutes after the kettle's shut off... water might not be properly hot anymore... but the stupid thing refuses to turn on again to bring the water back to a boil... until I give it five or ten minutes to rest up or whatever.  I tried to use this to sanitize some bowls & bottles for kombucha and I'd need two kettlesful to do the whole task. It was annoying being unable to boil two jugs of water in a row! So now when I process my bootch I boil water in a big saucepan... as if I didn't have a kettle.  I don't know if there are any superior glass kettles but when this one breaks I will certainly try something else not just rebuy this one."
I purchased this last september(2023) and the glass on the baseplate just cracked in multiple places and a piece broke off! I boiled it with water up to the lowest mark. I never registered the product.
"Initially I really liked this kettle.  I love that there is only glass touching my water, that was one of the most important things for me.  I also really like the blue light, very pretty.  It's not the fastest kettle I've used, but I was willing to live with that minor annoyance. After about 6 months of use, it started to have a pretty noticeable delay between the water boiling and the kettle shutting itself off.  Still, nothing I was going to fuss over.  Now after only 9 months of use, the lid no longer stays closed.  That means it will just boil all the water away unless I manually turn it off once the water has boiled.  I expect a kettle to last for years, not months.I contacted Ovente because it has a 1 year warranty. The customer service was prompt & courteous.  No complaints there.The options given to remedy the situation are1- to return the kettle to them at my expense, wait for it to be repaired & returned to me (leaving me with no kettle in the meantime) or2- a 75% discount on a kettle from their website (which is about 40% more expensive than Amazon) plus shipping (vs free prime shipping)So once you factor in the difference in price plus shipping, it's only about a 30% discount vs buying a new one from amazon.... not very impressive :-/I haven't decided which option is best at this point, but I am disappointed with the choices given.Update - I decided to send it in for warranty replacement, though not pleased with spending about fourteen dollars to ship it to them & wait, I beleive it was about a month, for the replacement.... when for double that, I could have gotten a new one from amazon in 2 days.  Anyway, the replacement is working, though I can tell it will likely have a similar failure.  The problem seems to be that #1 - it does not auto shut off as fast as it should, causing the lid to have to deal with an excessive amount of steam & #2 - the plastic on the lid cannot handle the heat & starts to fail in various ways due to that fact.  I've only had the replacement a short amount of time, but the lid is already starting to not open as freely as it should & I expect it will reach the point where the plastic on the hinge starts to break, as it did previously, causing it to not be able to stay closed.  Another nitpick about the warranty was that I was informed that, even though I received a replacement kettle, I was still limited to the original 1 year time frame should anything else go wrong... so if it manages to last 6 months before becoming unusable again, the warranty will be up."
"Update - Wow I forgot all about the below review! Can't really take 1 star away, but here I am 11 days shy of owning this kettle for 4 years and it suddenly doesn't work.I actually found that it boiled water fast. I had been using it every day at least once per day, often twice. Went to make a cuppa tea today and thought I had forgotten to turn it on. Nope, the switch is on, but the kettle is dead. Bummer.This review is for the product and the experience of owning the product. Because I think the two are intertwined.Functionality: This things boils water fast! Much faster than my stovetop kettle.Appearance: the product appears as pictured. It is a bit larger than I expected. The green is nice - a cool olive I guess. It's not lime.Materials: I read a lot of reviews of electric kettles before buying this one. Yes, the lid is plastic and the steam drips off the water back into the pot. I didn't see any kettles without any contact with plastic. The heating element is a flat metal plate at the bottom of the kettle. Yes it comes into contact with the water - It has too. That's how the water is heated. (Glass is an insulator, guys.) The filter flap thing on the lid I don't understand at all. When pouring, the water goes around it and out the spout. There is no way this actually filters the water. Can't figure out why it's there. Finally, there is a clear hard plastic ring on the outside where the glass meets the lower ring of green. It cracked once the first time I used the kettle when I cleaned it (per instructions). It now has several cracks. This doesn't seem to effect anything, but it doesn't give me great confidence. (see pictures)Ovente experience - Because of the cracks in that bit of plastic, I wanted to make sure I registered the kettle for the warranty. This is where mega stars are lost. First, the website listed on the instructions that came in the box gave me a 404 error (page does not exist). I managed to find the product reg page on the Ovente website and this is when I wanted to break things. It is an online form that you fill out with date of purchase, retailer, product number, order number, name, address, etc.For EVERY. SINGLE. FIELD. in the form, when I tried to tab to the next one, I was taken to an advertisement page. I had to use the back button to fill out the next field. I tried not tabbing and just clicking in the new field. Same thing. Every time. Totally infuriating. Then when I hit submit, I was taken to the same ad page. So I didn't know if I have successfully submitted. (eventually, I received a confirmation email.)The ad page looked like pop up spam. It was not an ad for another Ovente product in the same color, for example. It was not something I had recently shopped for.Ovente, what gives? Are you running some secondary scam on customers who bought real products? This experience resulted in one star for a product that would have been three or (maybe) four."
"I bought one of these back in early 2018 and was pretty happy with it. After 2 years or so, it stopped boiling water before automatically turned off, and just shut itself off while the water was tepid. I would have to hold the button down to boil the water, defeating the entire purpose of an automatic kettle, and the handle also developed hot spots, making it very dangerous to handle. Eventually, it just stopped turning on all together.Back in November of last year, I bought a second one and only a few months later, I started hearing popping & cracking noises, then began finding little pieces of broken plastic on my counter. Traced them back to the bottom collar of the kettle and saw that a bunch of people here have the same problem. It's cracked all the way around and clearly is not suited to deal with the kind of heat the kettle reaches. I have no idea if this thing will also stop working and/or become unsafe to use like the first one, but clearly these things are not built to last."
"Works well, but spills every single time I pour.  It is the way the lip is shaped."
The filter is in the wrong place on the lid  where we have fill the water. So not enough space in between. And the pouring pout is too short and small when taking water out in a small cup.
"Purchased in October, currently February. We use this daily and it functions well. However, the base of the glass kettle is already starting to show micro cracking especially near the handle where the weight/pressure is the highest. I noticed the sound of crackling/shifting glass starting about a month ago. Not leaking yet, but I'm planning to replace with a metal body kettle so this doesn't break in my kids' hands. Never been dropped, only ever refilled with filtered water. (For some reason the Amazon app will not let me add a picture to this)"
this kettle works fine but the part that keeps it shut while boiling broke so i have to manually hold it down or turn it off myself because the sensor that automatically turns it off relies on the kettle being shut. just something to keep in mind.
I used to have the same kettle about 10 years ago and it was wonderful even my mom bought the same one after seeing it at my kitchen . She still uses it to this day. I bought it again this week  but this one is much more  slower than my previous one . Returning it back . Such a pity as I like the  look of it.
"I drink a lot of hot beverages such as instant coffees, teas, hot chocolate, and the occasional mug of instant soup. As such, a simple counter-top electric kettle seemed a no-brainer. My last one gave me two years of good service, and this Ovente one was reviewed well enough that I thought I would give it a try. The short synopsis is that this is good for occasional use (a few times a week) but if you're looking for reliability and longevity... well, this isn't it.For perspective, let's say I drink an average of three mugs daily. Some days more, some days less or none at all, but most days I plug this in and flick the switch, and within 5-10 minutes I have hot water. Then exactly six months from the day I bought it (seriously, exactly six months) I flicked the on switch... and nothing happened. I checked everything, emptied and re-filled it, made sure there were no cracks in the glass, checked the power... everything I could think of, to no avail. It was done.Time for some simple math. I checked the day of purchase and the day it stopped working, and it lasted me exactly 214 days. Three times a day... that's 642 times this got used, if we go by this average. It was properly cleaned, unplugged when not in use, and was well taken care of, but that's all it was able to do for me.With that in mind, if you want to use it a few times a week, then by these numbers that should mean it would last you considerably longer than it lasted me. However, if you plan to have something for regular, daily use, or have multiple people in one household who will be using it, then you may be in for an experience similar to mine and have it fail you after six months. This product is advertised as being durable and long-lasting. I can certainly say I tested the durability, and that it didn't hold up.In short, if you're looking for an affordable or short-term kettle solution, this works pretty well. Then one day you'll flip the on switch and nothing will happen... so don't be surprised when this occurs far sooner than you expected it to."
"Pros:- Cute shape and interesting, lively colors.- Works as advertised.Cons:- Small opening on top, difficult to fill, difficult to get a hand inside and clean it- Big red STOP label inside packaging says - ""We strongly recommend cleaning your kettle. For instructions, refer to the Cleaning section in your Manual"". Guess what, the ""manual"" does not have cleaning section.- Lid open spring a bit too anemic for my taste, does not seem to fully open the lid every time, and may get worse with time (even weaker).- Not the most ergonomic button positions.- 12 hours later after boiling water, the condensed moisture on the glass inside wall is still there.Would I have bought it if I knew all these? Definitely not. That's why I took my time to write this detailed review, stating facts so people can have real feedback, different from ""it does what it has to do"" type of reviews. Am I going to return it - Very likely yes."
"I’ve had this kettle for a year and it was great for a while, but now it’s sputters and turns off without boiling anything unless I have it oriented in specific ways. It’s really cute and heats up water well, but one year is not a very long time to have something work."
"We have had these in the past and liked them.  This time we were replacing a smaller decorative unit which heated water really fast.  When we got his one, we found it felt a lot cheaper then our old Orvete and did not hear very fast.  So while it was a great price and is working well, we got spoiled by a higher end unit."
"Dirty, used and brokenI feel like there’s a country song or a romance novel in there somewhere, but, alas, it’s just the gross kettle I received.I ordered one of these a year or two ago for home and it’s great - arrived new and clean, and it still works well.Now I need another (for my daughter’s school) and this turd arrived - it had smeary brown stains on the button where you use your thumb to open the top (yum), someone else’s teatime mineral deposits in the  filter screen, and then, after I’d sanitized the heck out of it and did my best to remove the schmutz, it didn’t even work.Rude.I know that a new version of this kettle works and is good news, but I also know that Jeffrey’s QC needs to up their game."
I’ve had the tea kettle since February 2023 and haven’t had any issues with it until recently.It still heats up water but it no longer has the auto shut off option. I have to keep a close eye on it or the water will evaporate without alert
"I have been using various electric kettles for over 20 years and have used many different brands.  My experience is that they all last 1-3 years (usually exactly as long as the warranty!)  I chose this one because it comes in fun colors, has a glass body, and was inexpensive.It boils water and therefore it works.  However, it does so very slooooowly.This Ovente kettle takes 6 1/2 minutes to boil 1L of cold tap water.My other kettles (Cosori, Zeppoli, and Farberware) take 3 1/2 to 4 minutes to do the same, but cost more.Obviously, it will boil faster if you start with warmer and/or less water.This kettle has a filter at the pour spout and lights up when on (most do.)It also has both the lid release and on/off switch at the top (many have a lever at the bottom to turn it on/off.)We all know we are supposed to leave the kettle on the base until it finishes boiling and automatically turns off...and many people do not (guilty!)  This kettle does not automatically turn off when lifted off the base early (generally, the kettles with the on/off lever at the bottom will.)My only real complain is the time it takes to reach a boil - but that is the purpose of the kettle."
I love the operation of this product. But the plastic ring on the outside between the base and the glass is breaking off in chunks. Is this a safety problem? Or just an appearance problem?
Purchased a couple months ago.  It worked fine (other than it dribbled when pouring).  Went to turn on yesterday and it was dead.  Went back to a previous used brand.  Really expected it to work longer than 2 months.
Quality should be improved. Water leaks from bottom if you tilt and pour
"This was our 4th time buying @Ovante brand over last few years. We like the glass and various colors. However, first couple of times, it stopped working after 2-3 years. We still wanted to give this brand a try. I think, we are done trying this brand for good! This one stopped working after one year."
"The color is beautiful. The LED lights are so neat. It boils water so quick and the best part- the auto shut off!However! I noticed after use, there were some spots that formed on the metal in the bottom of the kettle. I couldn’t clean them off!!! That’s going to lead to rust. Also, even with the lid open, the inside doesn’t fully dry even a few hours after it’s been emptied. I tilted it upside down and more water leaked out!! I already got my return label. I’ll buy something pricier to get better quality."
"The main glass container sits on another plastic glass, which it couldn’t resisted heat and started to break and felling off. I used it for 6 months before it went bad"
"I was about to come on here and give this product a horrible review. But even though I bought it back in 2021 it still should have lasted a few more years. It died yesterday. I guess what I paid and how long it actually lasted, not bad"
After less than 2 months of use (only once a day) the plastic protector starts to cracks every time you turn it on. Wish to return or replace this item…
"Worked for a year before the base stopped working.  Bought this one a 2nd time as base stopped working on the first, and base stopped working on both.  Cord on base is not very flexible so impossible to hide."
This does not operate as quickly as my old one (different brand). The pot is VERY HEAVY and somewhat cumbersome. The pot boil for a long time before it shuts off automatically. I usually need to turn the switch off by hand. It does boil water.
The kettle heats the water quickly. The glaring flaw is the material on the lip. This has split and probably is not replaceable. See the photo!
"1. I like how fast water heats up.2. I like the blue Illuminated flame simulation of gas fire underneath the water kettle.3. I do not like the electrical plug. Once plug in it hard stiff and extends 5"" inches out from wall and the cord wants lays on the Kettle outter glass while heating this is not good. The manufacturer should redesign the plug to be flat against the wall when plugged in to wall this way the electrical cord doesn't happen to lay against the glass Kettle or you have to pulled the Kettle far enough away from the wall which cosmetically does not look good with other appliances on your counter top. See photos.4. I will be returning Kettle because of this electrical plug design flaw."
"Long term review - 18 months and diedThis thing did great for a while. That's why I gave it two stars. Sometimes the water seemed a little plasticy. The filter in the pour spout fell apart and I ripped it out. But it had one button and made water hot twice a day for almost 18 months and it was cheap.I've had hot water kettles wear out before. Usually a seal fails and it starts to leak. This one is cheap. I didn't expect it to last forever. But it failed spectacularly. After intermittently starting for the last week, had to find the right angle on the base, it sparked, blew a fuse, and the short melted the base and bottom of the coffee pot. It couldn't die gracefully. It had to be a fire hazard.Would not recommend. Will not be buying another one. If you want to buy a new kettle every year, get this one. If you want to be a volunteer firefighter during breakfast, get this one. I don't want either of things and will be replacing it with a Cuisinart I should have gotten in the first place."
"I don’t know how people gave this high marks. You can’t open the top all the way making it difficult to fill. Engineering fail right off the bat. The minimum water required is a lot- you’re not using this for one cup of tea. I don’t drink tea daily so if I fill this with enough water to make it work, it’s going to sit. In that case, I would want to use filtered water from a water cooler because we have very hard water. Which I can’t do because you can’t get the top off. I wanted to quickly boil water for a nice cup of tea. This is more hassle than it’s worth. I didn’t return it because I couldn’t repackage it. So this will collect dust.,,,,"
This heats up fast but sometimes it turns itself back on and other times it takes a really long time of boiling to activate the auto off feature. There is also no whistle. A little dangerous for anyone who is slightly absentminded (and who isn't?)
"I bought this kettle in March of 2016. I usually like to wait until I've used a product before I review it which is why I've waited so long.I've given it 3 stars because I really liked this electric kettle. I liked being able to see the water heat up, it seemed to do it fairly quickly but I never timed it, and the lid was popped up quickly and the handle was easy to use. It didn't get hot and it was easy to pour. I also liked there was a little filter or screen in the spout.While it is still working, I've decided to quit using it because It has not been shutting off after the water is at a full boil. It just doesn't shut off anymore. The lid has also been sticking a bit and that also just started, and while a minor problem, I thought I'd mention it, too.Another review noted there was mold between the glass and the heating surface. I was never sure if that was mold or not. But either way, I wonder if other models have this but you just don't see it because of the clear glass.  So while that is yucky, I'm not sure if that is just something that occurs in other models but you just can't see it. So I didn't deduct any stars for that.I'm giving it 3 stars because it has only lasted 18 months. It did only cost $20, so it wasn't like a very expensive tea kettle. Had it been more expensive I would give less stars. I do use it every single day and multiple times during the day. This gets a lot of use. It was really nice while it lasted."
This kettle is just OK.  It boils water and that's about it. Here's what I don't like about it.1. It does not turn itself off when you take it off the base.2. The lid is just weird.  I was used to my old one with a standard lid.3. You have the hold the handle very low otherwise hot steam burns your hands as you pour.It does boil water.
"Pros: Looks nice, works well, works quickly, has a comfortable grip, great priceCons: Stiff cord that makes the base hard to keep flat, light base that comes up with the kettle when you lift it, kettle doesn't click into the base and doesn't feel very secure, doesn't have a keep warm feature"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This electric kettle has worked perfectly for the last 14 months. However, there seems to be a design flaw that is causing the plastic seal to crack apart and fall off where the glass kettle meets the base."
"Well... this is my first venture into the world of electric kettles and I like it... but don't love it.When it first arrived it stunk to high heaven and no amount of boiling and dumping was helping. I finally determined that the smell was coming from the lid rather than the silicone seal at the bottom, so I boiled a few pots and when I dumped them I turned the thing completely upside down so the water ran over the inside of the lid, and that helped considerably. There's still a stupid little plastic mesh thing that covers the pouring spout so your water ends up being poured through plastic - which is not exactly what I had in mind. Seriously... what is the point of that other than to add some nice plastic chemicals to the water? Are we trying to filter something out of our clean boiled water? It makes no sense to me. I still haven't decided if it's worth trying to break that little part off of not.But the other issue I have is that the lid doesn't flip open to complete vertical, so you have to tilt the pot a bit when filling it. That combined with the fact that you have to put at least half a liter in it makes it a real pain if you're just trying to boil enough water for one cup of tea or coffee, because you can't tell how full it is with the thing tilted.That being said, the thing boils water nicely and it's great to get the kettle off the stove to liberate one of the burners. The shut off works perfectly and I haven't had any major problems.I'm thinking that if I had it to do over I'd probably get a stainless steel one that wouldn't have the plastic issue and that didn't have a minimum fill level requirement."
Heats water quickly - a bit louder than our last one.  Filter is difficult to remove - and extremely difficult to replace.  I expect to break it trying to put it back at some point.  Kettle design would work well for a left handed user - to have the fill line facing you - need to fill from your left hand.  Awkward for a right handed person.
"Worked perfect, convenient lid opens without removing, heats fast. But beware, the outside is the same heat as the inside and gets just as hot. Boiling hot. So anything around this pot needs to have a distance from it when heating. After a few burns, I went back to a pot that is stainless on the inside and a plastic type material on the outside."
"Love the size. Heats up fast. Looks good. This is my second one. Last one I got in 2022 and it eroded outside. This one is one month old started to act up with not shutting off when it cooks. Not sure what to do next. Sometimes it shuts off, and sometimes not."
"The instructions say to discard the first brew to remove manufacturing contamination, but I've discarded five brews already and the water still has a plastic taste.  Tea from water brewed in this pot doesn't taste as good as tea brewed other ways, and I question the chemical safety of drinking it."
"I’ve had this for a little less than a month right now and I’m not a fan of the hard water spots forming at the bottom. This is supposed to be stainless steel so I think we all may have been bamboozled here, no amount of soap and hot water will get rid of the water spots.It does heat up very quickly, under a minute, and I do like that you can heat up to a liter of water.I haven’t tried heating a whole liter of water up so not sure how long that takes but for the most part, this is a great tea kettle, just wish it was real stainless steel and not imitation."
"After only 1 use emptied water, left lid open for air, unplugged it. Mineral spots developed in hours in bottom of the kettle."
Does the job but is louder than my previous water boilers and hot when you touch it
"I've been using it for about a month and it works, but there is a lip inside the chamber that blocks a steady flow of water to the spout. This means that there is always a bit of water getting stuck in there unless you shake it and spray boiling water all over the place. Even dumping it out in the sink with the lid open is a hassle because the water gets stuck in that spot.If the designers had tested this product even for a day they would have noticed this obvious design flaw and gone back to the drawing board, which is especially weird because this is such a common product and there are so many other decent ones to copy. It's like Amazon hired a Chinese manufacturer to design an electric kettle who had never used an electric kettle. I had one from Cosori for about a year which worked great and then suddenly stopped working. It works and at least it's cheap, but I don't recommend it."
"Overall I love this kettle. It’s fast, effective and cute to look at. I give it a 5 stars for doing its job and love it! I don’t know if anyone else has noticed but it emits an extremely strong smell when boiling the water, it smells like burning plastic almost except it’s not super burnt smelling, but really really chemically and plastic smelling to a point where it makes my entire apartment smell, to a point where ai feel like I can almost taste it. I just want to know if this is normal and it’ll wear off? I checked to make sure there weren’t any stickers or tags touching the hot part to ensure I’m not burning anything, but every time I use it I cannot identify why the smell is so so so strong. Just wondering if anyone else has this issue, I’d hate to get rid of it because like I said, I love everything else!"
"Pros: Nice looking and compact. Boils water quickly.Cons: Poor quality, made in China construction. Base is wobbly (not sturdy) and the on/off switch is made of cheap plastic which will likely not last more than a few months.You get what you pay for."
"This pot works quickly and efficiently.  However, the exterior gets extremely hot, so use care.  Also, it is quite noisy, about twice as loud as my Bodum Bistro pot."
"This product has a filter that needs to be cleaned regularly.  However, the product comes with information about the kettle and the pictures with the filter do not align with what your eyes actually see.  I still cannot figure out how to remove the filter and clean it.  Several of my friends have looked at it, and we wonder if there even is a filter?  If anyone has figured this out, please do post.  I don't like the idea of not being able to access the filter and debris building up."
"I wanted a stainless kettle so I'm not drinking micro plastics when I boil the water. unfortunately this ""stainless"" kettle has a plastic filter over the spout on the inside (it's removable) but it also has a big plastic lid liner and hinge that gets steamed and very hot. this is not the situation that you want when boiling water."
Product too flimsy for my needs.
Besides the rusting it's good.
"This kettle is a great size and it works very quickly, however it is so loud! Anytime I use it, everyone in the office knows. Not a big deal for home use, but I don’t recommend this kettle if you plan to use it in a shared space."
It does boil quickly and is perfect except the lid does not stay down. It is fully in the up 90 degrees and doesn't latch. I guess it's easier to keep since I don't want to drive to town and return. I threw out the box already.
"Compared to other brands of electric kettles I've used, this one is pretty slow. Compared to European ones I've used, it's REALLY slow. Speed is comparable to putting a kettle on the stove. Appearance is nice, quality of build is good."
"I bought this to replace a stainless-steel kettle that wasn't stainless after all. This is not a good replacement; in fact, it is junkier than the kettle I was replacing. The previous stainless-steel kettle kept getting buildup on the inside bottom that needed cleaning every so often. Well, this replacement gets build up on the bottom of it every day and needs to be cleaned thoroughly every day regardless of the amount of use per day. The kettle itself does not sit very securely on the base and wobbles when you attach it. The filter does not stay attached and falls off almost every time I pour water out of this thing. All in all it feels cheaply made and is not worth the price. I guess I'll be looking for a replacement for the replacement."
"I bought this kettle about 1.5 years ago. Worked like a charm, until it just stopped working entirely. Good price but not built to last."
"I really liked this kettle, it boiled water pretty fast, way faster then the stove top. It shut off automatically once the water was boiling. But its been 8 months, using it at least once or twice and week and its leaking from the very bottom plastic part. There are no cracks or anything I can find. I am throwing it away since the bottom is what is connected to electric."
I liked this product but after 1 year the on/off light quit working. The pot still worked but the indicator light didn’t. Then after another year there was water all over the counter. The hard seal around the glass base cracked and fell out. Obviously it’s out of warranty so I won’t buy this one again as a replacement.
Couldn't it be produced without that plastic water level part? It definitely could be and that way maybe that burned kind of smell wouldn't be there I hope in time I won't get that smell. I can only suggest changing that plastic part other than that it works as it should do.
"We purchased this in May 2018 or right now, 8 months ago.  The AmazonBasics price was and still is amazing.  We knew we did not want plastic, which is typically at this price point.  The kettle's view port for seeing the water is plastic, but that's the only piece that is plastic, outside of the lid and handle.  The operation of the kettle was straight forward and we loved how the boiling base remained behind and the kettle could be taken to the table.  The stainless was also pretty swanky looking and we appeared to have paid way more for something than we did.  It seemed we had fallen in love with our stainless steel beauty.Like most relationships, nagging things began to show up.  It never left its wet towel on the floor or refused to put gas in the car, even when empty, but things cropped up.Even when fully opened, the lid remains firmly in the way of an average adult's hand trying to clean the inside.  When you do manage to get your hand and sponge or cloth inside, you are blindly wiping the interior.  Sometimes you feel like you did an amazing job, look inside, and realize you missed an entire area that's still foggy-looking while the rest of the stainless is sparkling.The cord is approximately 24 inches, which is fine, but it has nowhere to go to when not in use.  So this length of cord is always introducing itself to other items on the shelf next to it.  Most times it likes to be a loner and no matter how hard we stuff it in, the cord pops out and dangles from the base's perch.  You try to wrap it around the kettle, but at 24 inches, it is not long enough to get a good clinging wrap.  So it again pops out and dangles with a ""How you doin'?"" to the items below it on the shelf.These pale in comparison to watching the rust begin to form.  Clearly the direct visible bottom is stainless and the seam at its edges is not.  So now add the aggravation of trying to fit your hand in to clean and now trying to do something about the rust.  My photo is after me getting a good wipe for the photo.  The photo is looking down inside and the vertical post is where the handle exists.  Rust is forming at the seam and even where that post connects at the inside bottom.For the price, this was a great little kettle.  We had no issues as other reviewer's experienced.  It just worked.  It was used on average, once a day.  Wiped clean, the best we could.  And rust where the stainless ends and seam begins.  Can I say I got my money's worth?  Yes.  I just never believed I was buying a 12 month disposable kettle."
"This is a cute little kettle that heats water very quickly. It will heat 0.5 litres of water to a rolling boil in about 2 minutes. I live with just my husband so this is just fine as we don't need anything large or industrial-strength. If you have a big family or kids that are prone to being rough with kitchen appliances, this might not work for you. It is made of a thin metal alloy and is not reinforced on the outside by a layer of plastic like some more expensive, heftier kettles.This kettle is fairly easy to clean, although the lid only opens up to about 60 degrees. If it opened a full 90-degrees or wider, it would be easier to get my hand inside (and I have tiny girl hands).There is a screen before the spout which is not the easiest to remove or replace. Since you are only supposed to boil water in this thing, and not make your tea in it, I'm not sure why the screen is necessary. It shouldn't be a problem, as I don't see myself needing to clean it very often at all.The cord can be wound into the base, making it take up less space. It is nice but I don't like storing electric cables that tightly as they tend to stay kinked and resist straightening and it may place strain on the wires. I used to be a sound technician so am kind of nit-picky when it comes to storage and maintenance of cords and cables.One thing I don't like is that you are supposed to boil at least 0.5 litres at a time. Since I often only want one cup of tea for myself, I'm usually left with more hot water than I need. But all kettles probably have a minimum recommended capacity for the consideration of safety, and is not something particular to this one by AmazonBasics.The complaints I have about this kettle are that the thin uncoated housing does get very hot. So be careful not to touch it while it’s heating, or while it contains hot liquid because you could definitely get burned. This makes this kettle not a good choice for households with small children.Because this kettle is rated at 1500 watts (same as a space heater), it can overwork your household breakers if you’ve got it plugged into the same outlet as another appliance. I had to reset the breaker for my kitchen one time because of that. Since then I’ve been cognizant of making sure I plug it into its own outlet whenever I use it.Lastly, the material on the bottom has started to discolor (see pic). It hasn’t affected flavor and does not appear to be coming off, so I don’t think it is harmful.In summary, this is just an OK kettle. It has some problems, with the potential to burn users at the top of my concerns. Despite how quickly this heats water, we mostly keep this thing stored above the fridge and rarely use it anymore."
"Purchased in May 2024- use once a night to make my tea. The bottom is coming off leaving small particles inside, yikes! Poor quality. Heats up fairly quickly but will be looking for another durable kettle"
"It works great as a kettle, but the lid broke after 2 weeks of use. Now, it doesn't automatically recognize when the water has come to a complete boil. Cheap top, good burner."
"I just bought this and wanted to time it and see if it would be quicker to boil water in this than on my gas stove top. At maximum capacity, 1.7 liters, it took 9mins 20secs to rapid boil. This seemed very slow to me, especially since they advertise it should rapid boil between 3-7mins.I like the blue light, capacity and that it turns off right away after it began to rapid boil."
It is a simple kettle sufficient for my daily use. But it is broken after 1 year’s use.
"1. I bought the stainless steel version.  The steel exterior gets VERY (skin-burning) HOT.2. It is very difficult to see the water level in the (translucent-plastic) window.3.  Minor issue: The lid should open a bit more to facilitate filling the tank.All this said, the unit heats the water quickly and is attractive.  Considering issues #1 & 2 above, I might opt for the glass tank instead of the stainless steel."
Should have been placed in the center of the unit to accommodate left handers.
"Specifically regarding the glass-walled model. The plastic-framed spout mesh cover also includes the latch for the lid on the same piece. It just snapped in two and the kettle is no longer usable as the lid won't close. Used 2x daily for <2 months.2 stars because we were pretty happy with it, otherwise. Small footprint and fast boil."
"I owned this item for 2 year and had to throw out. The stainless steel at the bottom of the carafe pitted and turned a rust color I tried everything and could not safely clean. Also the plastic conduction plate would get very hot and take time to cool. lastly, very hard to clean unless you have a small brush"
It works well so long a I don't fill it all the way to the max fill line.  It boiled over when I filled it to just under the mix fill line.
Bought this in September for the colder months. Used for heating hot water for tea for 2 months before the switch broke. Was nice while it lasted but really sucks I didn’t get much use out of it. Would’ve rather invested in a kettle that worked longer.
"I was very happy with this kettle when I first got it.  It does heat up fast and as others have mentioned, it will boil over if filled too much and the glass gets very hot but those were easily managed.  However, after only a year, the heating element is failing. It takes 3 times as long to heat the water and gets slower with every use.  Unfortunately I now need to purchase a new kettle. I would not recommend this one."
"I loved the comfort, ease, and quickness of this kettle. But after a year and a half of using it, there was a rust spot forming inside the crease."
I can't turn my back on this once it's turned on. I NEVER close the lid in order to reduce the explosive nature of the boil-overs - and listen carefully for the sound of incipient boiling. But then I have only about 30 seconds to flip the switch to prevent covering my countertop with boiling water. The auto-shutoff doesn't work until AFTER the eruption. It's from a country with lower quality control than ours - so yours may work better than mine. Good luck.
"I got 1.0L liked it, then got 1.7 L - disappointed. Pros for 1.7:- It boils the water- It shuts off automatically- LED indicator on power lever- Water doesn't spill out from under lid when pouring into cup- Lid has unlock button and lifts up by spring- Power switch lit up- There is water level scale on exterior side.- Water doesn't spill out from kettle during boiling if to pour over scale limit- CordlessCons for 1.7L:- It came with corrosion like spots on the bottom inside and more of them appeared after 3 times of boiling- Water smells inside like plastic, even after 4 times of boiling, perhaps it comes from scale tube- Kettle shows signs of life in 2 minutes only after it's turned on and shuts off after it boiled water in 9 minutes- Kettle base cable of kettle, I received, was assembled wrong way and didn't lined up with passing notch of base, means 1.7L weight would press on cable with base sharp edge.- Bad design of cable stopper inside of kettle base. Cable stressed so much that pull off stop bracket chew cable isolation practically to the wire, creating potential short circuit. I uploaded the pictures.- Kettle Lid looks a bit cranked like cheaply made product would look, but deal breaker is a plastic smell.For Amazon Basics 1.0LPros:- No plastic smell at all- Boils water in 4 minutes- Doesn't spill out water during boiling even if I way too much overload it (up to like 1.3L leaving like 3/4 of inch from water level to the lid ) and then I can make 4 of 15 oz cups of tea- Not too loud- Shows signs of life and starts boiling right away- Auto shut off- LED indicator on tinted power lever- Lid has unlock button and lifts up by spring Cons:- corrosion like spots on the bottom inside of kettlePS I ended up buying Cuisinart JK-17P1 Cordless-Electric-Kettle, 1.7-Liter, Stainless Steel. It works for  over 7 month now. No Smell, no leaks, no corrosion."
The cord on this is VERY short. We have to build it up on something to reach any normal outlet.
"Overall, it works, but I'm not a fan of the design. There is a lip (approximately 1cm) that is inside the kettle where the glass and stainless steel meet at the top and goes all the way around. When pouring, the water has to cascade over the lip causing the water flow from the spout to be uneven and making it difficult to pour all the water for cleaning/drying. Also, when setting the kettle on the base, it does have a bit of a wobble to it. I'm not concerned about it tipping over, but it doesn't exude quality. A pro is that the heating element gets to work. Unfortunately, it works so well that the water boiling causes the kettle to slightly shake. Again, I'm not really worried about it tipping over, but its a small thing I would prefer wouldn't happen. We're keeping it because it suits our needs but wouldn't recommend it to others."
"My kettle did not work yesterday and after changing the socket, the overload protection on the circuit breaker was tripped. I was so anxious that I almost cried. My family told me to find the distribution box. After a lot of efforts, the power was restored and it was found that the kettle was leaking and causing the short circuit protection. How to tackle the leaking kettle?"
"I’ve purchased this kettle, and used it for a while, I’m disappointed to report a major safety issue. When pouring boiling water into the kettle, it leaks from the bottom, causing water to spill out unexpectedly. This not only wastes water but also poses a risk of burns. It’s extremely dangerous and should be addressed immediately. I cannot recommend this product until this serious flaw is fixed."
"The kettle is ok. It boils water pretty quickly.What I don’t like about it is that even after it’s removed from the base, it keeps boiling the water. It’s because the heating element consists of  the whole bottom and it gets very hot. I used to have a different kettle,  the Capresso,  which I loved. I didn’t re-ordered that one just because it is more expensive.Now I’m getting the Capresso again"
"I gave this three stars because until it broke, it was good. It heated up the water I needed pretty quickly and everything worked great! Until the third time I used it, it was cooked. I tried multiple outlets, different plugs, different extension chords...nada. It was never used incorrectly etc... it just randomly broke. Perhaps I got the faulty one though."
"I've purchased two of these kettles for different locations.  I liked the first one quite well as it boiled quickly and I could see how much water was in the kettle.  However, the second kettle gives off a burning plastic smell around the water level window.  I don't want micro melted plastic in my tea, so I'm returning it."
"Initially I really liked this kettle as it heats to a boil really fast. However, I was really disappointed that the lid broke after just a few uses. I’ve maybe used it 10 times total. The lid stopped latching which means I have to set something on top to keep it closed. So annoying!"
"Love how promptly it heats water, my only issue is the odor emitted by the plastic, if it doesn't go away in a couple of days, I  will definitely return it. This was never an issue with the Corsari kettle I have had 2 of those previously (on both of these the glass carafe broke), that's why I  tried the Amazon basics one."
"I bought this January 2021 and it is now May 2024, the lid got wonky and finally broke completely off. Not sure the life of these things as this was my first ever electric kettle. Everything is metal except the little window and part of the lid."
"I LOVED this electric kettle, but off & on it's lid won't close, then the water won't boil. Wish I could find a way to fix it"
"The water in the kettle comes to boiling in 1-2 mins. which is amazing. However, the lid is the weak point in the design of this kettle. The lid doesn't open far enough to fill easily, I had to use another vessel to fill the tea kettle.  I returned the first one of the same design because the lid would not stay closed creating a safety issue when pouring. I bought it because it was a smaller size but it really isn't worth the hassle."
This unit was the size I needed for a reasonable price. It heats water very well. The top/lid portion is not well designed/ there’s an inner lip with not sharp but annoying edges that make it much more difficult to clean by hand than it should be as well as making it hard to get the last bit of water out.
"Well first of all it's very disappointed when I went to make a cup of tea this evening and the lid wouldn't close, just doesn't close anymore. Which kind of renders the thing unusable.And then I looked up the warranty which said Amazon basics warranty will replace your item if it stops working within the first year.Well then I got hold of customer service and I asked them to send me a replacement and they said they couldn't.And a long conversation and they agreed that that's what it says in the warranty but still they couldn't do that.Well. Very interesting Amazon.Your writing warranties it's in a PDF. I saved it in black and white yet, you're not honoring them. I don't think that is a good business practice okay?So upon threat of me canceling my Amazon prime membership, CS did issue me a refund.So it's not durable.And for $26 it should last a lot longer than 3 months.If that's the kind of product you're going to put out, I'm going to stop buying things from you.There are other places to buy things.I just can't believe you wrote that in the warranty. And you don't honor that warranty. Shame on you."
The larger unit has beautiful blue lights that illuminate the water while heating. Not so the 1.0L.  It just has a blue lamp by the Amazon Basics label.  Not what I was looking for.
"I purchased this kettle twice. The first time it lasted 2 years before the lever to start the kettle heating up broke, and the second time it lasted 4 years before metal started flaking off from the bottom of the kettle. It's fast, simple, straightforward, and did a great job until those two problems! We used it every day at least 1-2 times per day, sometimes 3-4, so we put it through a lot of use. If you're planning to use less frequently, might be a great fit."
"I have had this teapot for two months. It worked, and I felt satisfied, but noticed it would leak even though we would underfill it. The leaking was consistent so we kept a towel under at all times. Now at two months of use, it shorts out our kitchen electrical circuit and no longer works. I would not spend money on this one since you’ll have to buy another one after a very short time."
Received a leaky one.  Returned.  It looks and feels pretty solid and high quality though.
Well made but my for a couple not a family that likes Tea!
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            After 5 months the carafe started leaking internally into the heating element portionUpdated- the leak was water from the steam outlet that drains into the base internally. Even when in careful walking it, I still get lots of water through there. The lights have fried out but heating mostly still works even with the water getting all through the electrical. So, not great but not an actual leak."
I don't like that the stainless steel is Stained :(
"I bought this item based on all the positive reviews.  I followed the instructions, but when plugging it in, it immediately lit up and turned off (standard 120v US power outlets).  I also lost power in other electrical outlets in the kitchen, blowing a fuse, so I packaged it up and sent it back."
"my kettle works well and boils water very fast. there’s a weird plasticy silicone type seal between the glass and the stainless right where the heat is applied, so not super happy about that. if you’re someone like me who doesn’t want plastic getting heated up and possibly leeching stuff into their water, buy a stainless steel only kettle"
"We had this kettle for several years, and it's worked great. Until recently it started to develop a melting plastic smell every time we used it, getting quickly worse and worse. We're not sure what happened or where - there was no visible damage anywhere on the kettle. But we had to toss it after a few years."
"Good kettle while it lasted. I bought two, and each lasted about a year before it stopped working. Never used anything but RO water in it (so no water impurity issue). I suspect it is just not made to last."
It’s too big/wide to put under the refrigerator filtered water dispenser so I have to use something else to fill up the pitcher. Heats well and quickly and looks nice on the counter.
It worked well for almost 2 years then out if nowhere stopped boiling even though the red light still turned on. I won't be buying again.
I nearly returned this because of the strong plastic smell and taste .  Baking Soda helped a bit Then I tried vinegar which was better.  I have kept it and I have either got used to it or it has diminished.  It boils the water quickly but the problem seems to be the see through part where you can see how much water there is.  I had returned a couple of things lately so I decided to try and get rid of the smell and taste rather than send it back.
"Works well but it is very noisy when boiling water, so loud that it is hard to carry on a conversation. We returned it."
"Simple, easy, fast way to boil water.  But the carafe is as hot as the fluid inside.  Wish there was insulation to keep exterior cool.  Otherwise it seems good early on."
Bought in July 2023. It’s April of 2024. It seems to get louder over time. Our kettle is used several times a day so getting our money’s worth. The loudness could be related to needing to be descaled. Would buy again.
"Worked great, easy to use but suddenly stopped working after a year and half. No return or exchange after a month!"
"I got this for the countertop to make a quick tea, however, after boiling the water has an odd taste. Furthermore, the bottom of the pot is supposed to be stainless steel but the finish is marred already. See photo"
"Kettle was purchased at the end of last year and now (7 months later) it is not turning on.Used daily, 5-6 times a day without any abuse. When it was working it felt like it turns off kind of late in the process.The fact that a top cover is not removable makes it hard to pour what in when you use fridge filtering."
"I loved this kettle for the ease of use and the sleek design. I initially bought one for a gift, then another for another gift, and finally bought one for myself in January 2023. It worked great for a little over a year and now will not turn on. I only ever used as directed in the instruction manual and it was never damaged or submerged in water. I double checked the outlets and other small kitchen appliances worked but not the kettle. I was even going to reorder one but they are currently sold out. Bummed my little kettle quit working and that I have to buy another one."
"The kettle is fast and it works, but it is the cheapest, thinnest stainless steel I have ever seen.  It also doesn't sit well on the base - I would never recommend this kettle  to anyone."
"I love this product as it’s easy to use and clean. However, I am seeing some leakage every time I put the water and noticed that it’s leaking from front which I didn’t like it. Called Amazon customer service but they don’t have option to replace the product but return/refund only."
Bought this to replace a failed one. They're cheap but they work while they're working. Id like one to buy for life but I don't yet know which one that is. 120v US kettles seem to be a disposable market.
"I was excited to try this. Easy to use. Worked as advertised and heated quickly. Love the auto shutoff. I followed the directions and cleaned it lightly, and then used it for the very first time. To my disappointment, it already shows spotting and staining inside from what seems to be corrosion. I mean, I wasn’t expecting it to last, but I certainly expected more than instant damage."
"This was emergency purchase to replace a different kettle that broke after a couple of years(old model started re-heating by itself...I could hear it turn on from another room...scary). I opted for this kettle because of solid reviews and small size, since I'm the only one in our house who uses it. It boiled in under 3 minutes(yea!)...and I let it boil for another 30 seconds but it didn't automatically turn off, so I turned it off myself. Kettle seems solid, but not sure about the weird on/off toggle switch that looks sort of like a thumb drive. Time will tell."
"Smaller than I expected, my light doesn't work, swivels on base which is kind of odd, and most importantly does not shut off once boiling. Seems like a hazard to me. Returning."
"I've had it for less than 24 hours, I've tried to turn it on to boil water 20 times and it just shut off, then I wait 5 mins and try again. It stays on for 3 seconds or sometimes 10 seconds or even 20 seconds then shuts off. I was able to boil water 2 times out of trying like 40 times for it to turn on and stay on. I obviously want a replacement, also I think it leaks, but that seems to have stopped now. I'm really dissapointed."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I want to say, that up until today, January 27, 2021, this has been an excellent electric kettle.  I might use it 10 times a month on average to heat up water for different things.  The size is perfect, not to big, not too small and I never worry about it being too hot to the touch.My reason for giving it three stars is because it sprung a leak.  At first I thought maybe I had overfilled it, so I quickly cleaned the water off the counter.  But, just in case, I filled it with cold water and left it on the countertop by my sink before going to work.  When I came home, the counter was covered in water and that's when I discovered the leak.  Where the clear part is embedded into the kettle to let you know the water level, at the very bottom, the water was leaking from that measurement reader.I don't know how it could have sprung a leak since I never drop or roughly handle the kettle.  I suppose my expectation is that I wouldn't have any problems with it considering the only reason I got this one is because my sister has had this same brand for over 5+ years and vouched for it.You can see in the video I uploaded that it's dry and once the water reaches a certain level, it begins to leak."
"I bought this product because I need some quick Ramen instant noodles cook. I chose Amazon brand over others brand because of the reviews and the name. I bought it for awhile before I actually used it. The first time I used I forgot to look at the max line. It was overflowed and that was my fault. I tried again and it worked wonderful. It’s quick and easy to use. I used its for a couple more times. Suddenly, it leaked. At first I thought maybe I did put too much like the first I used, so I tried again and again. It leaked from the hole that connected the pot to the base. So, I decided to do the replacement because it’s impossible after 4-5 times use and it leaked. It must be defective. The new one just arrived 2 days ago and I have not use it yet. I will update on how long the second one will last."
I had to return  this one because when I received it. It was dented and was damaged during delivery.Didn’t get to use it to find out how it was.
"Looks smaller than expected, but holds 1 liter. I like how quickly it heats up water, but caution, the water will be super hot. Also, the kettle is hot to touch, so keep far away from everything and everyone, especially the little ones. For those reasons, I give it 3 stars."
"I love how quickly it heats water. However, after 6 weeks, the hinge is becoming faulty and the top that opens isn't flat. When pouring, water can leak from the top. I wish I could return or replace it but I'm two weeks out of the return window."
"I have 3 kettles, all from different manufacturers.  This is my least favorite.  It boils the water fine.  Feels cheap and doesn’t have nice double insulated wall to hold heat like my others do.  Would not purchase again.  Plenty of other better options out there."
"I loved the convenience of it when it was working, but now after a few months of consistent use, it broke. We’re not rough with it and nothing’s changed about how we use it, but it just stopped lighting up and turning on. What a bummer"
"After only 1 day of use, a weird mildew stain developed around the rim of the bottom inside. I cleaned it out and got better only for it to returned after I boiled water the next day and each day I’d scrubbed and cleaned it out and same thing happens, tired of cleaning out the weird stains and mildew looking thing at the bottom, I don’t think this is normal and I think it’s the product. I have small hands and it’s also very difficult to reach in and clean due to the restrictive design of the lid. So unfortunately I will have to return it. I really wanted to like and keep the product based on thr 1000s of good review but this is a No for me and not worth it.  The only one good thing is that it boils water fast but the construction quality and design is very poor based on my experience ."
"Only had it for about 2 months and now it no longer heats up anymore, I’be tried to find the issue but to no dice."
"I really liked this kettle. It didn’t feel cheap for the price and boiled water quickly. But after about a year the glass spontaneously cracked while boiling water, and unfortunately it leaked from the crack and needed to be thrown out. Luckily no one was near and the water didn’t damage anything else, but I can see this being potentially dangerous. I don’t know if this was just a fluke or what, but I’m going to switch to a steel bodied kettle next."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Had this kettle for a while now. I noticed the water would look like it had shiny particles or flakes floating around in it after it was boiled and i'm not talking about the limescale at the bottom of the kettle.  I even had to be filtering the water and that wouldn't help. On closer inspection I noticed the inside white plastic liner thing ( idk what its called) looked odd so i used a fork to touch it and it just broke apart.  Pretty sure this isn't normal and plastic or whatever this material is may have been leaching into the water all this time. I also boiled water on the stove in a pot and it didnt look like this so it isn't the water itself . Would not recommend getting this .
"We have bought this same water heating kettle for about three years now.  We use it a lot every day.  The lid eventually won't open but not a problem for refills, you just refill through the spout.  The last one we bought is larger than the others.  The water measurement marks on the outside of the kettle wore off pretty quicky from simple wiping down.  Nothing intense, just wiping down.  But is is handy and easy to use and a pretty good price."
It’s not completely stainless steel. There are few parts that are plastic. If you are looking for complete stainless steel without plastic parts then I won’t recommend it
"I have purchased over 6 water boiling kettles from Amazon. I use them at different locations, and when traveling. This is the first one that simply was defective. It would turn on, start to heat, but suddenly turn off. Same thing if I pressed the “start” lever again. I g suspect another one would work fine, but I’m returning this ASAP, and will get a model I bought before. (I chose this because I wanted a smaller model.)"
No longer brings water to a full boil and does not shut off. Pretty useless. Will replace with another make.
"Cheap stainless steel, but the product functions well enough before it corrodes. Had no leaks or heating issues,"
This product would be perfect if not for the plastic level window that slowly adds microplastic bits to your boiling water.
I bought the top rated Cosori 1.7l kettle to replace a Hamilton Beach model that died from old age. It worked fine but I didn't like the ergonomics so I invested in this one and I really like it. It has a simple lift mechanism for the cover and the cover is wide enough to make cleaning easy. The 1 liter size is perfect for making 2 large mugs of beverage.Edit - After a few months of faithful service it quit on me. It started to boil slower and then began to stop before completion. There is a v shaped copper connector on the base and cleaning it made it work again but only for a few weeks. I'm going to look for another one.BTW it was a very nice machine for the time it did work and was a 5* item initially
"Not well made.  The Kettle does not sit stable on top of the heater.  Amazon used to have some quality control, but this purchase has convinced me that amazon has abandoned all quality control.  Let me put this another way  -- if you went into a store and you could see and touch this product - you would not purchase it.  Amazon is now contolled by manager that are MBA's in a vest that care nothing for their customer base.  The product is junk and I will try to return it.  There was a time when I ordered something that would be delivered defective and I would keep it and give it to the local thrift shop.  I would be ashamed to gift this kettle to the local thrift shop."
"UPDATE: Contacted HB Support. They accused me of damaging it (what?!) and no refund. Amazon won't refund either, they send you back to HB Support.THE INSIDE OF THIS KETTLE IS NOT ONE PIECE OF STEEL! At the bottom there is a seal and a gasket, etc. It is just a matter of time before the seal fails - mine failed in the first week of use. I would never recommend this to anyone.original review:I only used this thing a few times but today I noticed a burning electric smell... IN THE WATER! I opened the top and there was a weird foam on the top of the water. I emptied it and rinsed and saw the seal at the bottom coming out. How much contaminated water did I drink?!?"
"It's nicely built and looks good, heats up well. The issue I have is that the buttons are not super easy to push - you have to almost steady the pot with one hand while pushing with the other. The spout doesn't pour as well as others, seems to spill out instead of giving a nice steady stream. I like how this is totally metal on the inside.Improvements: More tactile buttons. More preset temperatures. Better regulated spout."
This electric kettle does what it says...it boils water fast. It is really much larger than I thought it would be. 1.7L is more than I need but I will put in only what I need. When I filled it up to the 1.7l line I was sad to see the amount of water coming out of the pot while it was boiling. So it seems to me that you should never actually boil the full amount. Since I don't need that full amount I am now filling it lower and not having that problem.
"There are many things I like: design, performance, heating speed. However, you can't see the water level with the lid closed. So it's easy to boil when dry ... and waiting 20 minutes for it to cool so you can start over is not convenient... and I worry if I start it again sooner if I'm doing any damage to the liner."
it takes 2 hands to turn off.
"1. The part where the touch screen is attached is not one level away2. When the water boils, a few drops of water drip from the upper door3. The steel inside was made by hand and has several parts and was in a rusty state4. The speed of boiling water was fast, I was satisfied"
It was okay for one week and it’s just didn’t turn on anymore
Metal piece under lid came off after 1 use. Seems very poorly made.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So sad as I thought there was so much good reviews. I even threw away the box because I thought it will be fine. Put water in it and start it up. The breaker comes on. Tried several outlets around the home and the breaker trips on all of them. The moment i place the pot on the stand, it trips. Sad paper weight."
"Kettle would be great except I can’t pour water without it going everywhere. It runs from the spout, down the front of the kettle, soaking everything beneath it. No matter how firm or gentle I try to pour, water always runs down to the base."
"I recently got the 1.8L Water Kettle thinking it would be a fantastic addition to my kitchen.  I won't lie, the kettle heats up water  surprisingly fast and the auto shut-off feature helps by turning off as soon as the water reaches a boil. The issue comes in after a full week of use, the Kettle died and refused to work."
"This will boil a full kettle of room temperature in about 7 minutes.  Three quarters or half full, considerably less.Design wise, it's nothing special. If you are equipping your air BNB with appliances with an electric kettle, this might be a good choice.The usual things apply: when using be sure to CLOSE THE LID ALL THE WAY BEFORE USING.Revised: this kettle loses a couple of stars because after only three months the switch has failed. The kettle still boils but the switch is smoking. May catch fire soon."
"I bought the Mecity Electric Kettle hoping for a durable and reliable product, but it completely failed me after only one month of use. It suddenly stopped turning on despite following all instructions carefully. I tried troubleshooting, but nothing worked.To make matters worse, there's no manufacturer warranty, and I couldn't find any way to contact the company for help. Even Amazon has been unresponsive to my inquiries.I expected better quality for the price I paid, but instead, I'm left with a useless kettle and no support. Very disappointing! Would not recommend this product."
"Overall, we have enjoyed this kettle and it has met our needs for the past few months. However, we have found it to leak from the plastic base when first pouring hot water. It is a little too small for filling an 8 cup pour over, and has to be refilled. Time for a bigger, higher quality kettle!"
Cute little kettle enough for about 3 cups. Heats up quickly and quitely. But lacks heat isolation on the sides and I burned my fingers a few times. Be careful with it around children and pets.
the kettle passes water through the base when pouring
"Overall this works well, heats and boils quickly. My only complaint is the fill line is low-doesn’t fill to a full litre.  I have to fill the kettle once, pour into my coffee press, then quickly boil a bit more to completely fill the press. The kettle  fill line is less than one litre. And if you add water over the fill line it boils over or leaks when you pour. Otherwise it’s works just fine."
You can only fill the kettle halfway or it leaks boiling water everywhere. So basically it’s half useless and dangerous. Don’t bother
Re-reviewing this.  It leaked horribly after first month.  It started with a trickle at the base and then flooded my counter.  The worst part is it was after the month return policy just ended on Amazon.  Maybe I got a defective one.  But just keep the return date in mind if you’re enjoying the one you ordered
"I really wanted to love this kettle since it was the more affordable option. I used this kettle maybe 5 times. I started to immediately notice a strange taste in my coffee. I thought it was the beans or my brewing method, even though nothing had changed. The kettle had this horrible metal smell and taste to it no matter how much I emptied and cleaned it out. What a shame and waste. Breaks my heart but I think I have to buy a new one and probably go for the more expensive option."
I bought this kettle a few days ago and I have only used it a handful of times. Today I notice it was leaking all over base from the bottom of the kettle. I leave plenty of room before FILL line so it is not overfull. The kettle and base are completely dry before starting. It looks beautiful but is clearly not durable - very disappointing.
It looks good but leaks
"Nicks easy but pours great! Taste funny but pours great! On the “ less than quality side” - but did I mention, it pours great."
This tea kettle intermittently leaks.  I often have to hold it over my sink when I use it and wipe up water leaking out of the bottom into the counter.
"Bought this tea kettle in August, been frequently using since and now it’s leaking from the side. Didn’t even fill it up half way and is still leaking. For the price it’s expectant, but still wished for better quality. Wait and invest in a better kettle."
This electric kettle heats up the water fast. However it doesn’t maintain the water warm. By the time you are ready for a second cup you need to heat up again.
"I love the look of this tea kettle…it was exactly what I had envisioned.  Unfortunately, I haven’t had it long and it has started leaking water where the spout connects to the kettle.  I’m so sad, because it was exactly what I wanted but now I can’t use it without water getting everywhere"
The Mecity Electric Kettle Gooseneck is leaking. It still turn on but it leaks water from the bottom.  It is less than 8 months of use. I ordered this kettle 5/26/2023.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            + Nice design- Small water capacity- Gets very hot to touch when using it- OverflowsI put water until them max indication and it started overflowing and boiling water was all over the counter. Not safe and the money I paid, with the shipping, were not worth it"
"I wanted to love this kettle but am SO disappointed. After only a few uses, and trying to dry it properly after each use, it still managed to start accumulating mold on the bottom of the inside. Definitely not a good design for maintaining cleanliness and of course, as these things go, it's a few days past the return window so there's nothing that can be done."
"After about 10 months , the kettle suddenly won’t work at all. Before that  , it would be very delayed in boiling water . In other words, it never worked as efficiently as other kettles . What a disappointment!"
"It leaks from the bottom a month after purchasing, but “my return window has closed.”"
It is started leaking from the bottom when I try to pull water
"I loved the look of this kettle.  It was very easy to use, unfortunately it had a chemical smell and taste when heating up water.  Conversation with the company, it was recommended to cut a lemon in half and put half a lemon and fill water to the fill line then rinse with water.  First put of water after this was great.  Second pot not so much.  After more conversation with the company I have requested another kettle with the hope that it will not have this problem.  Will definitely update rating if this is the case."
I purchased this electric kettle and really liked it at first.  It's easy to use and doesn't take up much space.  It heats quickly.  BUT...it quit working after one month.  I followed the seller's instructions and cleaned the contacts and that didn't help.  There doesn't appear to be any way to return this for credit.  So it has become a huge disappointment.
Making water for pour over and all teasStarted leaking profusely
Boiled water several times & it smelled & tasted like chemicals!
"Bought 3 months ago. We used it not often, since we have another kettle for tea, but this kettle started to leak about a week ago. Waste of money."
"Boils over instead of auto shut off working, never leave unattended"
Been using it 5 months and it's leaking from the bottom.  Boiling water leaking isn't great!
The kettle worked great until it died after only 8 months of light use (5-6 times a week).
The only upside is that my counters get washed often by how much this stupid little thing leaks. But I could wash my counters in my own
"After using this kettle for the second time, water had some strange metallic smell and flavor, I cleaned it but can’t get rid of smell and taste. This is very disappointing! Don’t buy this brand!"
"I love the look of this hot water kettle it’s beautiful, but I have only used it about 6 times since my purchase, the return wi die had closed and now it’s leaking. I’m completely disappointed"
"Very strong plastic and chemical smell. I washed many times and even boiled water with baking powder, but didn’t work. Definitely has plastic… it only looks nice and its fast but not usable for water!!"
Would not recommend as it leaks water from heating element at base.
"collecting condensation in the base, do to it leaking.."
This product leaks at the bottom.
"I pray yall do not experience what we did. We received this kettle as a wedding gift and after the 2nd month it stopped working and by the 3rd the base stopped Turing on. We have been out of a kettle since. Don't waste your money, go with a different Brand. I emailed and called no answer from Mecity. Mecity If you see this, I want credit applied to my Amazon so I can buy a replacement, or something else from the registry. Thanks. Would give 0 stars if I could."
"This is just so cute! I don't know why I think gooseneck items are adorable but I do. So I have very high hopes for this.I was not entirely disappointed. It is easy to set up and easy to use. It took roughly 5 minutes from turning it on until it shut itself down after reaching boiling point. Not too bad!It has a relatively small footprint as well which is good since I have limited counter space.The only flaw I can see is there is nothing that tells you where to max fill so you don't accidentally have an overflow situation. I checked the instructions, which say not to fill above the ""max fill"" line, but mine does not have a max full line anywhere to be seen. Very odd. Since that is a safety feature I deducted one star.Overall a nice product and at a decent price. Just don't let the kids use it unless they know exactly how high to fill it."
"Leaks from the bottom when its more than 50% filled, which is not much water given the small capacity. Disappointed, should've gone with a legit brand."
"Coffee lovers, this is it. Affordable clean white minimalistic looking electric kettle with a gooseneck sprout for precise control. I decided I would get rid of my regular electric kettle and replace it with this even though I'm not always pouring over my coffee. I never had a nice looking kettle. Albeit it's a lot smaller and doesn't hold a ton of water, it heats up rather quickly, like within minutes. When its hot enough, it auto shuts off and also has an opening on the lid for the steam to come out. Really simple to use, the lid stays on tight and its so satisfying to watch the click auto shut off. The interior is full stainless steel with temperature setting rods in it. I have a water softening system at home so I don't expect a lot of mineral build up in the kettle though I would frequently rinse and dry this by hand. The kettle comes at a really great price too for its aesthetic design.Edit: It's been about a month since I've used it and the steam holes on the bottom (I have no idea what that is) is leaking all my water every time I lift up the kettle."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Unfortunately, I had to return this kettle twice due to it leaking out of the on/off toggle switch, at the bottom of the pitcher. The kettle boiled efficiently and the lights worked well, but boiling water coming out of the bottom.. Wasn't great. I returned the first, thinking it must be a malfunction, but the replacement kettle did the same thing."
"Overall, the kettle is nice and works as intended, I love the led color indicators as the water slowly reaches its boiling point. Two things I don’t like is that when you open the lid, it will leak and I’ve noticed on the I side at the bottom some type of calcification has formed and after trying to remove it seems to be permanent which I am not a fan of."
"Auto shut off is not tuned properly. You end up generating a lot of steam while wondering why it does not shut off and if water level is low, it never turns off on its own. The colour thing is a pleasant gimmick and useful for those who are particular about making tea or coffee at the right temperature. The main drawback is its weight. It is just too heavy. If you are elderly or have less that athletic wrists, you might want to think twice before getting this."
"It has nice colors in the glass, easy to carry and use.... sadly, after only two uses, it started to change texture and color in the base, into a rusty kind of color and texture.Stopped using it after two uses due to concerns that it will release metals into my water."
"Heats quite quickly. Used 4 times (1st 3 to clean per start up instructions) and each time was quick.  Two concerns, with each use it took longer for auto shutoff to activate. Still within stated time frame but if the trend continues....  More concerning is the pot is not stable on the base. On level surface, checked to ensure cord placement (like the wrap around storage underneath) wasn't an issue. The pot simply doesn't fit sturdily on base. At full rolling boil even shakes a bit. May be returning..."
"If you want to be able to SEE the limescale that'll form almost instantly in your kettle and you like looking at glass with water steam all over it....  This might be for you.  Otherwise, keep your limescale and steam covered surfaces hidden in a non-glass kettle.It heats water fine though."
Worked great for about 4 months then cracked from what I can only tell is normal use. Still like the kettle. Would easily be 5 stars if the longevity was there
The kettle itself is pretty good. I like that it changes colors. But it steams so bad. I have a wall cabinet above the spot where I usually keep a kettle and I really don’t like that all the steam goes right to the bottom of the wall cabinet. None of my previous electric kettles was steaming that bad.
My packages damaged both boxes are ruined this is unacceptable
This kettle is made from Plastic!!Not safe for heating water!!Glass does not contain BPA!!Disappointed in Ham Beach and Amazon
"What a broken product.Good: It boils water. The light changes color to indicate water temperature.Not so good: After less than a month, it no longer automatically shuts off when it boils. It does shut off when you lift it off its platform. This is a safety problem - if you leave the room, you want your electric kettle to stop heating when it boils.We'll probably go back to our old kettle which was underpowered but at least can shut itself off. I was hoping that a name-brand kettle with good-ish reviews would actually work as designed. *sigh*"
The whole thing is plastic. I thought it was glass but it’s thin plastic so you are boiling water in plastic. That is a no for me. I had a kettle a few years ago from Hamilton beech that was glass and it was great but now it’s a flimsy plastic thing. I can’t imagine using plastic for boiling water given all we know about heating plastic and food exposure. I will be returning this. Complete was of time
"The shut-off on this kettle does not activate until 25-30 seconds AFTER the water has started boiling. I  thought it was just a bad batch and returned it for a replacement. The replacement has the same delay regardless weather full, half or minimum. Avoid."
The glass spout on this kettle is thin and chips/cracks with even a light impact.
I'm very upset that suddenly out of the blue the kettle stopped working
I purchased one precision that had multiple settings including warm setting after it heats up. This heats up and turns off. I do love the color changing effect.
"Compared to other kettles, it takes an inordinately long time for the water to warm up."
"It works just fine for boiling water, BUT within two months of getting it, the auto-shutoff failed and the kettle will boil itself dry if left unattended.Luckily, I have not yet found out whether it will melt itself into a puddle of plastic and metal on the countertop."
"I bought this one to replace my old Breville (great product) I had, that looked similar. Although they looked very similar i could tell immediately after receiving it that it just felt much lighter and much cheaper.The base and the kettle itself are so light that when not filled with water the chord to the wall almost lifts the kettle a little bit so does not sit firmly on the counter.however. for the price i guess it does what it is intended to do. It does look okay, and it does boil water relatively quick. Just feels a bit dinky."
"I had a Hamilton Beach electric kettle very similar to this one, and it quit working (after about 5 years), so I needed to buy another one. This new one is cheaply made. The metal is sharp (it shouldn't have sharp edges; they should be rounded); the heat element stand is very flimsy. I will not buy another one. Next time I need one I'll go into a store so I can see exactly how it's made."
The kettle works fine but it is loud. It looks good and it is a nice size.
"Just got it today June 6 and tested it/pre-cleaned it and it works. Sound is tolerable, and just about enough to know it's there working. I haven't measured the duration, but it appears that the boil time at maximum fill is not more than 5 minutes.We are at the end of August and the appliance stopped working over a week ago. It had also started rusting on the inside at the bottom. I have had the previous version twice which lasted me way longer (years)..Will not buy this again."
"Needed a kettle like overnight and this was the best deal with over night delivery. However, I didnt like the way they just send it without any cover exposing the whole box letting people know whats inside. Also, the base is soooo light and super cheap, iam scared that it might break within a month or 2. However, super fast and fancy looking and I love the blue light that comes on around the base when it's on. Automatic shut off switch"
I loved it then three weeks later the lever to shut it off stopped working. Water was boiling over and all over. Very disappointed. We tried it a few more times with different water levels. It still boiled over. Sent it back.
Cheap looking
I bought this less than a month ago and we use it daily.  A couple days ago I noticed a spot of rust inside the kettle.  Disappointed.  I'm not sure if this is real stainless steel.  Next time I'll buy a more expensive kettle.  Works great otherwise.
Pros:Can easily see the water level.Pot is not too heavy.Light around the base makes it easy to see when it shuts off.Cons:Takes a long time to boil.Base is flimsy and cord does not stay put.The filter on the inside of the pot falls off easily (but isn't really needed).I do not like the balance when the pot is full of water.Inside bottom is not completely flat and therefore harder to clean.I returned ours and am looking for something else.
"I did not realize when purchasing this, but there is no insulation layer between the part of the pot that is in contact with heat and the outside of the pot, and I burned my hand touching the metal part! Can't say I recommend it for this reason, and you should definitely look for an insulated pot if you are in the market for an electric kettle."
"Hamilton Beach is a durable electronic item, efficient and good b value for money. However the sound when water gets heated is too much."
We used this kettle for 10 months only and it already stopped working. It worked very well while it lasted. But I don't expect products go bad within a year from Hamilton Beach.
Replaced our excellent previous Hamilton Beach kettle ( model no longer available) just because it was starting to look old and worn.We ordered this model but were very disappointed.If you are left handed you will not be able to see water level no when filling because it does Not Have a water level viewing window on both sides. Furthermore the window is colorless so that the water also being colorless is not clearly visible.Poor design changes from the previous model to make it cheaper also make it more difficult to use.I would not definitely NOT recommend this Hamilton Beach model kettle. Too bad as they are usually excellent in design and function.Wake up Hamilton Beach!
This product was excellent to use. However it stopped working after nine months.
We bought this electric kettle October 2023 and within few months it started to rust from inside where the water gets in contact with the beating element. We contacted Hamilton-Beach company and the only thing they were able to help with was cleaning instructions which did not help. We are getting another kettle as we cannot use this one with the rust inside.Update after the company reached out to us stating that the defect is under warranty but…. They asked us to pay $14.99 for shipping and handling. I replied that I never knew of any company which product is covered by warranty and  ask the customer to take the burden of shipping and handling. Mire than two weeks now and no answer. Never buying from this brand again.
For the price it does what is supposed to doHowever it takes a long time to boil water. I have a bunch of electric kettles and this one takes linger than anyone i ever owned.Also be careful it is not “cool touch” the kettle gets HOT use handle and keep away from little kids
It was recommended by Wirecutter so we bought it. Just not so sure why it takes quite a long time to boil water perhaps the motor or power is not strong enough..... missed my Philips kettle
"Hi ! I am an Amazon member! I bought this electric kettle more than three months ago, and everything worked fine. It just stopped working in the past few days. I tried to check the usage information, but I couldn't find the reason for the damage! So please help me solve this problem! Thank you very much"
DON'T Buy this kettle if you care about a good tasting hot water as it will taste plastic. I don't understand why Hamilton thinks it is ok to poison customers with chemicals
"I bought this boiler and I'm just starting to use it. However, I've noticed that there are mold stains at the bottom of the boiler. I haven't been able to remove them!"
The kettle worked fine for about two months and then it started to make my house lights and electronics flicker every time it was plugged in. I contacted Hamilton Beach customer service and they responded once and then never again. I’d have returned it to Amazon if it wasn’t beyond the return window.
"Heats water fine, but it's so loud in the process it's quite obnoxious. We've since replaced this with a much quieter one."
"I suppose it's my fault for not examining the features thoroughly enough, but I did expect it to keep water hot for a period of time, but it just shuts off after reaching a boil.The kettle isn't insulated.You can easily find a kettle that does that much for much less money."
The window in it is plastic. I thought it would be glass. Not fond of boiling my water with plastic.
"only last  3 months,  bought it Sept. 2024 and broke down on November 30, 2024"
"My previous electric kettle lasted a decade, this one randomly stopped working after just 5 months."
"Because of the material, this item is very difficult to maintain. Plug in cord is extremely short. Needed to be longer"
"Mine was not working properly. I returned it and bought a different brand,"
"Electric kettle worked great for the past 6 months. However, recently, the kettle is not working. It heats for a second or so, goes off and then resumes heating. The kettle never used to do this. I trusted the brand and so hoped it would last for at least 3yrs. Disappointed that I have to get another electric kettle only after 6 months of use"
Supposed to be new? It came in with dust all over it and rust and malfunctioning. Won’t even turn on or heat the water. I haven’t even been able to use it once. Definitely don’t recommend it.
"Bought it in June 2024, threw it out November 1, 2024 - bottom is full of rust.  What a shame, thought Hamilton Beach was a good brand."
We bought this for our camper.  I don’t like that there are not different temperature settings.  There’s only one.  Push the lever down to turn it on and that’s it.  And it’s EXTREMELY hot!  Too hot!
This kettle is leaking after just 2 months. Quality is questionable. Do not recommend.
I've only had the tea kettle for a month.  The hinge inside the lid is loose and looks like it's going to break soon.  Also the stainless steel is thin and heats up enough to burn you if you touch anything but the handle.  I expected more from this brand name tea kettle.
Only lasted for a year and six months.
"I wish that I could list just one thing I like about this kettle, but that one thing does not exist. It is too large, heavy, and unwieldy. It does not have the features of every other kettle I've owned: doesn't sound a tone when water boils so you don't have to look in a dark ""window,"" and try to see bubbles; does not have settings for different temps needed for coffee and various teas, it is hard to pour without spilling, and it does NOT turn off after it boils until water evaporates. I am not going to keep this terrible kettle. It's nearly driven me crazy after only a few hours in my home."
After just one use of this product I looked inside and found nasty rust all over the kettle and even floating in the water
This is just over 1 month old like by a week and has rust spots developing inside very dissatisfied
"The kettle stopped working a bit over a year of usage. Nice design, but that's all."
This product is the Hamilton Beach water boiler kettle 1.7L . It is so unsafe. When you boil the water you have to be careful to not burn you hand since the stainless steel gets too hot.
Rusted after 16 months of daily use
"it has plastic in the sides, who would design a kettle with plastic?  i returned it."
"This item operates as advertised, and seems well-built. The problem lies in the plastic window that is in direct contact with boiling water. The resulting boiled water tastes strongly of plastic. It is strong enough that it can be tasted in tea or hot chocolate. I don't know how anyone can use this thing, or how it got so many good reviews. I'm returning it. Terrible, terrible product. Hamilton Beach should be ashamed to produce it."
"Saw it,like it,ordered it,waiting on it ,only to get a message not available was so disappointed ,but I got my refund back"
Terrible product (filter inside) falls apart after a couple/few months.  Do not buy this.
Leaks like a strainer after 4 months. Want my tea in a cup not on my counter !!!
Very thin junk steel. Cheaply made. Cheapest quality ever bought.
I just bought this kettle to replace my 1L one. I used the kettle twice and found black particles and weird spots on the bottom of the kettle. Returned. Not recommended.
Pro: good quality body and lid.  Water boils fast.Cons: gave 1 star because the boiled water has a weird smell and taste!
I just got it five minutes ago and unfortunately is leaking from the bottom in 3 Different Pl. not a good thing
Broke easily didn’t last anything
Very bad quality
"Worked great for 5 months, then stopped working - the switch mechanism clicks physically but the heating element no longer engages."
"I used it once and it worked fine, the second time it didn’t heat up stayed on the 46F forever"
The kettle doesn't seem to work. Will return.
"Purchasing this kettle felt like a splurge at this price point. We were impressed by the look and functionality of the kettle so we decided to purchase it to compliment our various pour overs. A little over after the one year warranty expired (purchased Aug 31st of 2023) the kettle began to malfunction. The display stopped working and now it is making an extremely loud rumbling and whistling noise. Hot water will also splash out from the lid at times as well. Up until that point we had not experienced these issues at all.We contacted customer service and after much back and forth and sharing many photos and videos, they informed us that the one year warranty had expired and they would no longer assist with our kettle. There was no solution offered on how to fix the issues but only prompted us to repurchase the base of the kettle…. at full price!!!!!No attempt to replace it or provide a discount either.I have now read many reviews and it seems to be a common reoccurrence with Fellow. Other cheaper kettles lasted us 3x as long and always worked great. I’m greatly disappointed in how quickly the Fellow Stagg kettles seem to break.I do not recommend this product"
"This kettle is pretty good. It's no longer my favorite though. It's also one of the most expensive on the market, and in my opinion, not as good as many of its competitors.The design is pretty nice looking, but there are a few flaws. The lid doesn't fit very well, it doesn't snap closed or seal in any way, which was a surprise. Water will actually leak through the top while you are pouring. The rate of pour is very very slow. You want it to be slow and consistent to make a good pour over, but this is slower than it needs to be. This means that when you try to make a big pot of tea, its painfully slow. A lot of steeping is happening before all the water gets into the pot. The capacity is about 20% less than what it should be given the size, I think that was a aesthetic decision to allow for its unique tapered look.Its 1200 watts, which many pour over coffee kettles with very fine temp controls are. But there are now 1500 watt kettles on the market, which take substantially less time to heat. Some of them now have fine 1 degree controls. This probably seems like first world problems to most, but if making a pour over takes 5 minutes instead of 8, thats a big enough time savings to help me squeeze it in between meetings ...Its also worth noting that when I heat this to 212, theres a slow boil instead of a full rolling boil. This leads me to believe the accuracy isn't quite there at the highest temps. And with a full pot, mine takes nearly an extra full minute to get from 207 to 212 degrees.In the past few years, there are other kettles on the market that are both cheaper, and better than this one. I think fellow needs to start working on a new version that catches up."
"I really like this kettle from a build and aesthetic perspective. The design is nothing short of beautiful and the temperature dial/screen are perfectly simple and satisfying to use.My issues and why I docked it 2 stars is relative to the expectations of a kettle at this price.The Good:1) Fantastic build with a premium feel when holding the kettle and pouring.2) Controls are exactly what you need them to be. Super simple. Spin the dial to *very quickly* get to the temp you want where the kettle will then hold that temp for quite some time before turning off.3) Insulated lid helps prevent heat from escaping exactly where it would be trying to escape the most. Great attention to detail that most kettles don't have4) Genuinely beautiful lookingThe Bad:1) The max fill line isn't accurate in my experience. I fill just below the max fill (I need as much water as possible so I can properly heat up my v60 and rinse my paper filter and have enough leftover for my pour over). However, even when filling it just below the line the water overboils through the top of the lid's vent holes which causes puddling and dripping of scorching hot water. The kettle is only a few days old now and it already has a ton of water marks all over the lid and top area of the kettle2) The handle gets incredible hot where it meets the kettle. No thermal insulation there. I wish instead of a metal ring between the handle and the kettle body they used a rubberized/silicone spacer that wouldn't get as hot. Because I have burned myself on it a few times because holding it with my thumb on the thumb pad feels awkward and unnatural (for me at least).3) While this is a fantastic looking kettle with a great build quality in general it's ultimately designed to boil water and pour it consistently. I don't see why this kettle is double the price of other kettles for just that reason.4) The spout pours VERY slowly. This can be a good thing too but I personally think a kettle at this price range isn't going to be for the casual person or tea drinker. It's going to mostly be for a coffee enthusiast that wants nice coffee equipment with a good aesthetic to boot. The problem with the slow pouring design is you have very little options. Imagine if your car only did the speed limit at most but when you visit another area and the speed limit is higher your car can't keep up with traffic. Depending on the bean/brew style/etc I like to change how I pour while I pour to encourage agitation of the grinds for even saturation/brewing. That's not possible with this kettle because it has two speeds: very slow or dribbling.5) As an extension of #4 - the slow pouring often creates an air flow issue in the spout making the water go from slow pouring to an inconsistent choppy pour. Think about if you hold a water bottle upside down and it does that blup blup blup pour where air is trying to get in while water is trying to get out making so you (in my experience) have to tip the kettle back then forward again to get the flow corrected. This happens very often and it's very annoying.So, it's a nice kettle overall - my issues are mostly nitpicky with one or two significant issues (for me) but I think they all matter the same when you're spending this kind of money. If this kettle was closer to $100 I wouldn't be too upset about those issues because the aesthetic and feel are very nice. But like my Fellow Ode grinder, I think it's overpriced for the sake of aesthetic and lacks certain functionality or some overlooked design. It's like buying designer wear intended for the outdoors - you're paying for name+aesthetic more than you are for outdoor performance. In the end I am exchanging this. Wish I wasn't because it's beautiful but I care more about function over form."
"I’ve owned the Stagg kettle in copper for almost 3 months and have used it daily in that time. I originally ordered the black version, but was sent the white, which I returned to Amazon. I reordered the copper version which is much better looking than the white or black, and definitely worth the extra $20 imho.The kettle itself is very solid and substantial feeling. The same can’t be said of the base though. The base is very light and flimsy and the switches on the back that set Celsius vs. Fahrenheit temp display, and hold vs sleep functions, are really, really cheap. The dial where you set the water temperature and turn the kettle on and off is also very cheap feeling too—and will probably be the first thing to break on this kettle. It feels really fragile like it will break with the slightest press too hard. The buttons on the back are set once and forget, but the on/off/temperature set dial on the front sees daily use. For a kettle that costs $170 it’s a real disappointment. Fellows could have spent a couple dollars more on parts and had a much better product.The Stagg kettle was a kickstarter project started in 2013-2014. The kettle I received was produced in Feb 2019, so it was a couple years old and probably part of the first gen design. Hopefully Stagg has updated or will update the product design and increase the quality of the switches and dials. This won’t be an heirloom kitchen appliance your kids will inherit, but with proper care, it should last 3-5 years.So how does it work in practice? The kettle heats water from 35 degrees to 205 in about 6 minutes. It maintains the set temp within 1-2 degrees once it’s reached. I verified this with the kitchen thermometer I was using previously with my Hario V60. The kettle is very well balanced and makes it easy to do slow pour brews. (e.g. 50-60 grams of water in 15 seconds) even if you’re still half asleep.  Once you get by the cheaply constructed base it’s a really nice experience.Some thoughts on things that other reviewers have noted-Water boils over when the kettle is filled to the fill line.This is true--If you set the temp for 212 degrees the water will indeed boil over. But coffee is brewed at max 205 degrees and tea around the same temps so there’s no need to heat water to boiling for coffee or tea, the intended use cases for this kettle. Just because your car will go 120mph doesn’t mean you should drive at that speed. There’s no boil over at 205-207. Works just fine, even when filled a little over the line.It’s easy to burn your finger on the metal connector part of the handle (the part that connects the insulated handle to the kettle).Yes, that part is metal and if you touch it with hot water in the kettle, you may get burned. But as Steve Jobs once famously said “just don’t hold it that way”.The kettle says there’s no water when it’s actually filled with water.Stagg acknowledges this condition on their website FAQ as a known issue that they are working to understand. Whatever that means. I suspect that the seal on the water sensor in the bottom of the kettle is not completely watertight, and if water is left in the kettle after brewing, it will eventually seep through the seal and short out the sensor. They recommend removing the lid of the kettle and placing the kettle upside down on a cloth for 2-3 days. Sounds like a defective design or manufacturing issue. One shouldn’t have to do this with a $150-$170 kettle.I follow the instructions I received with my Hario V-60 that seem to make sense and haven’t had any issues so far.- Don’t leave water in the kettle other than when it’s heating or brewing. Don’t leave it on ‘hold’ for a long time, start brewing as soon as possible after the water comes up to the set temp.- Dry out the inside of the kettle with a paper towel immediately after brewing so the heat from  the kettle evaporates any remaining water droplets inside. A paper towel wrapped around a small spatula works well for this. Let the kettle cool separate from the base with the lid off (wipe down the lid too) so water doesn’t condense on the inside.This has worked well for me so far.Bottom line—I decided to keep the kettle despite the flaws because it looks great on the counter and really improves the control over the brewing process. If Fellows spends a couple bucks more on higher quality controls in their next revision, and fixes the seal on the water sensor, they will have a real winner. But even in its current iteration it’s a good kettle and an ok value for the money, if you need precise control of water flow and temperature when brewing, and are willing to take a few extra steps to increase its longevity. It’s 3.5 stars, but rated a 3 since a kettle this expensive shouldn’t feel cheaply made, and have design/manufacturing flaws."
"The temperature control is outstanding, and cuts off power at the perfect time to allow thermal momentum to achieve the desired degree without overshooting, nor undershooting. Well done!However.While i like the design, and maybe i'm not an ""expert"", I feel the diameter of the spout is too small, and it take a long time to pour a cup. I would expect the pouring flow to be much higher/faster. Of course, this feature may be exactly what ""perfect pour"" experts desire... I'm just a regular joe, looking to get a fresh cup asap.I've been using this for a few months now, and am at a place where i just dump the water out of the top -- rather than standing there... pouring (for what feels like an eternity) due to the slow pour rate.The multi-action temperature control knob does two things:1. depressing toggles on/off.2. rotating adjusts the desired temperature.While its a cool design, it is a little touchy since while pressing down, often slight sideways action causes a temperature adjustment to ""roll"" to a new number, unless you press straight down. Since i'm a sloth in the morning, my dexterity is not running at 100%, so usually i press at an angle, which invariably causes the temperature to roll."
"It pains me to give this electric kettle a 3-star review because if it was stolen from me tomorrow I'd probably buy the same one (and maybe that's what you should take away from this review), but it does have some extremely annoying flaws.The good things first: this is an incredibly durable and well-built electric kettle, and there is no plastic anywhere in contact with your hot liquid. I expect this to last for quite some time based on the craftsmanship alone. It heats up quickly and stays warm.Unfortunately it has multiple cons.1. Lack of a beep when the desired temperature is reached. It heats quickly but there's no way to tell when it's ready unless you're monitoring it yourself. On busy mornings (see: all mornings) this means I usually don't start pouring it into my Chemex until I remember I'm making it, which sets me back a few minutes. Partially my fault, but my last electric kettle (the excellent OXO Brew, which is now discontinued) had a beep and it seems like an oversight to not have one.2. The handle. I have average-sized hands for an adult man and there's just no comfortable way to grip this. The stem attaching the handle to the body of the kettle is too thick to nicely put your pointer finger above and your other fingers below, but the handle is way too short to grip it with your whole hand below the stem. Even worse, the metal ring that separates the handle from the body gets VERY hot when in use. I have burnt myself on this multiple times, and no matter how you hold it one or two of your fingers will always be within a quarter-inch of this.3. The Max Fill line mark. This is engraved on the inside of the body. Unfortunately it's located on the side where the handle connects, not the side where the spout is, so you can't easily see it. The only way to monitor it while you're filling it up is to twist your whole arm around awkwardly while trying to keep the whole thing under the running tap. If it was engraved on the opposite side then you could just see it while you were filling it. While this is minor in the scheme of things, for a product that's sold in the MoMA Design Store I would expect issues like these to have been considered before mass production.4. The capacity. .9L is probably fine for some people, but it really doesn't make enough for two people. I normally pour 500 grams of water into a 6-cup Chemex when making coffee (enough for a travel mug), and there's not enough left over for a small cup of tea afterwards. If you have multiple coffee drinkers you might need to refill and reheat to get the desired amount. 1L capacity would be nice, but 1.1L or 1.2L would be even better.5. The pour speed. This can be a good or a bad thing depending on what you use this for. The spout is very well made, the metal is thick, and overall I love it. However, it pours water VERY slowly. This is great for an accurate pour in Chemexes, etc, but I find myself thinking ""shouldn't my mug be more than half-full by now?"" when I use it to make a cup of tea.All-in-all it's a great kettle. I just wish Fellow had caught and fixed some of its flaws before it was released."
"The ubiquity of this kettle is undeniable - it's seriously everywhere, featured on every influencer's countertop. And I obviously cannot blame them because, well, look at me now writing this review for the one I purchased. How can anyone say anything about its aesthetics? Sleek, modern design and matte black/walnut finish? Sexy as hell, by anyone's standards. However, having used it for a few months now, my feelings about this kettle are mixed due to some surprising and notable performance issues.The most frustrating thing is that there seems to be a clear defect with respect to temperature control as it has, on several occasions already, failed to reach the max 212 degrees. More recently, it just stops heating at 210 and won't go up any higher. So far, I've been able to fix the issue by unplugging and letting it sit for a bit before trying again........but I shouldn't have to, not for this price.Other observations: The water pours much slower than other gooseneck kettles, so be prepared for that as it may test your patience during busy mornings. The lid is not water tight and will leak if not handled well (even if you haven't overfilled), but some may argue that it's in the tilt and that you're not supposed to tilt that far (after all, water won't pour any faster at a deeper angle due to the gooseneck). I've seen some complaints that the kettle heats up too slowly, and, while it is in fact slower than the Balmuda one I had before, it hasn't bothered me enough to count it towards docking the 2 stars.So while no other kettle comes close to its aesthetics, there are some serious reliability concerns so I'd say proceed to purchase at your own risk."
"Fellow is a company coming into its own in the high end enthusiast coffee space. They have a couple of excellent grinders and brewers, plus this and couple of other kettles. The experience with the product feels high end. It’s beautiful and well made. The features are very good, but there’s something home made feeling about the UI and its programming features and options. It’s not bad exactly, it’s just not a fully elegant process. The firmware updater app straight up doesn’t work, and the alert beeps are kinda janky and cheap. To avoid going past temp, the heating element turns off before reaching the temp so it can coast up to the final temp without overshooting, but it does this when boiling to 212, and that slows things down and keeps the water from a hard boil. That’s bad. Finally, the spout gives great control for pour overs, but if that isn’t what you need, you’ll be frustrated by how slowly this thing pours.I would imagine the next version will be better, but I am satisfied for the time being."
"In general, I like this kettle.  It initially did a good job of heating to a setpoint.  It has a timer which is nice, but also a problem.  There is only a single button on the kettle, it controls both on/off and, when held for a few seconds, activates the timer.  The issue is when you select it to turn it off, after the timer is running, it only disables the timer, but the kettle still heats.  There is no safety shutoff, so when the water evaporates or is boiled off, it continues to heat.  This damages the heat sensor and it no longer maintains temperature.  This is surprisingly easy to do and, for that reason, I believe it is a design flaw.  Timer control and kettle on/off should be different controls."
"Cons: For how expensive this kettle is, I would expect it to hold up a little better. We’ve had it less than a year and the paint is chipping where we’ve rested the spout on the mug or pour over we’re pouring water into, however nothing we’ve rested the spout on is sharp, so it’s surprising it’s chipping away so easily. The reason we rest the spout on things while we pour? Because it takes AGES to pour. The cord is also incredibly thick and long and cumbersome. I’ve had much cheaper kettles in the past that have a way to wrap the cord in the base so it isn’t taking up much counter space. It’s also so thick that the base won’t go flush against the wall. The “on” and “off” button doesn’t work immediately and we usually have to tap it at least three times before the kettle will turn on or off. The lid is also starting to yellow a bit (as shown in pictures) because of the water getting so hot.Pros: I love the color and the sleek look of the kettle, you can hold the temp for a long time, it’s heats up the water really quickly.And unfortunately, that’s it for the pros. I will never buy this kettle again, which stinks because I have other Fellow products that I like and because this kettle was such an investment, I thought it would be a kettle that lasts many years. Unfortunately, I don’t see it lasting much longer than one or two. We’ve only had it for 6-7 months. There are much better kettles on the market for half the price. I wish I could return this kettle. I’m so bummed.*Update: the company sent us a brand new kettle for free. We’ve had it one year and it has held up so much better than the last one. No discoloration on the lid, no stretches, the on and off button works every time."
"Good so far, but taking away two stars for making it in China!"
"First and foremost I'm bummed to be returning this kettle. I saved for it because I like the aesthetic, have seen it used in shops I frequent and heard good things. Nevertheless, I am not keeping it due to design flaws that don't meet it's 163.00 (after tax) price tag.  In the end, I think FELLOW will appreciate the feedback to take what is a great idea and get it closer to perfect.The pot itself seems well made and cleverly designed. I love the look and feel. Compared to other kettles I've used, it is sturdier and has fewer crevices for rust to hide. Sure enough, the weighted handle does help improve control of your pour. Before I move on it is worth noting that there was a manufacturing defect where the fill-line was wrongly marked more than once, so there were weird impressions left behind.Now, my real problems with this product are with the elctric base. Though it's minimalism was a draw for me, it might be overly simple.With such a beautiful kettle sitting on my countertop, the thick, obnoxious cord has nowhere to hide. Considering the sure size of the somewhat awkward square base, cord storage wasn't accommodated. It seems Fellow knew the base was already too bulky and couldn't find a solution. Even in the images on the box, you can see Fellow is trying to make the best of this design oversight by hiding the cord best they could.Getting a few buttons out of the way by hiding them on the back of the kettle gives it a sleek, modern look.  Instead of buttons, they are toggle switches. However, due to the rest of the products sturdy and durable form, the switches lack of a satisfying *click*, or firmness feels shoddy and out of place.Due to the fact I'm unlikely ever to toggle the kettle to celsius,  I'm more concerned about the HOLD switch. Should I ever need to turn it on after the pot is boiling, I'm reaching my hand around a... um... boiling hot kettle. Because it is a toggle and not a button, once I have it on hold, it will always keep water hot every time I use it unless I remember to turn it off. This feature should be something I turn on only when I want to and not something I need to remember to change.Goodbye Stagg Kettle. We were nearly compatible. I will be upgrading instead to the much more affordable Bonavita variable temperature model, whose shortcomings are more justified by the cheaper price point. I'm sad."
"It stopped increasing the temperature in year 2 and there is no easy way to access it to repair. Online there are videos showing a $1 fuse usually breaks on these things but you have to basically destroy it if you don’t know how to open it In order to even try to repair. Bad design to have an easily consumable part not easily accessible.  When the kettle works, it works fine. But it’s a junk product once that fuse blows."
"First of all, I washed our kettle last week for only the second time in about three years (I had mostly just descaled the inside and wiped down the outside, but it had some kitchen splatter on it so I figured a good wash down was due). The kettle has not worked since then, with a variety of erroneous temp readouts and error codes. When Fellows says “do not submerge” they really mean “do not get the kettle wet”. Lesson learned, but a bit ridiculous for a kitchen appliance.Secondly, if you’re a fan of pour over coffees the capacity of the Fellows will frustrate you. You’ll need to top off the kettle and reheat it at least once to get a full Chemex.Now that ours is broken, I’ll be looking for a better option."
"This is a beautiful kettle. I’ve used it off and on for a few years, it typically performs great, however…One huge concern, is the safety, mine has  boiled over a lot. Not always, but it does happen. Doesn’t matter if it’s at the full line or just below, it will spurt out boiling water on the counter and your hands when you try and turn it off or take it off the heating element. I’ve dealt with this, because it still looked cool and the pour is very precise.Eventually, the handy temperature digital screen faded and I no longer am able to be precise with the water temp. Also, if you use the timer, that’ll be gone too.Look, it’s a nice looking kettle and I wish I could buy it again, but for the price and limited time that it will work, it’s probably better to shop around.Or just know the life of this kettle may be limited and maybe you do want to buy one every few years? Also, you may get burned.It’ll still looks cool though."
This is probably the best looking tea kettle on the market. I love the handle and elegant pour spout. I was totally disappointed in its function. The on/off button also acts as the means to set the temperature. Every time I turned it on  the set temperature changed so I had to double check it every time I used the kettle on. The lid has holes where hot steam comes out and could potentially burn your hand and the lid leaked when pouring . Not well thought out.While the pour spout is elegant and is supposed to be great for coffee pour overs I found it frustratingly slow when I went to pour water for tea. My husband laughed at my increasing antipathy towards an inanimate object. In any case I returned it for a highly recommended Zwilling kettle -also great contemporary design-which did not work-on and off button defective. I am now back to an old reliable Beville. Not the greatest style but works everytime.
"I’ve had this kettle for almost a year now. Yes it’s indeed aesthetic and the ‘keep warm feature’ is nice, but neither are unique to this produce. It’s small and can barely make 3 cups of tea. I thought that feature can be overlooked, but it drips even when water is filled below the max line. It’s incredibly frustrating to have hot water drip on you from a kettle. That’s the one thing a kettle should not do. I would return it if I could, but it was a gift."
"I basically used this once a day, in the morning.It lasted 1 year and just stopped heating. The digital panel worked, but it didn't heat. I tried problem solving. It was clean inside and out with no water residue inside the pot. I also didn't submerse the base in any water."
"I bought the Pro, believing that this would be an ideal premium experience.But here's what you don't see in pictures.There are four heat-bearing plastic parts.1. Lid is plastic. There is a steel insert that directly faces the boiling water, but...2. between the steel insert and the plastic lid is a 1cm thick rubber gasket ring, and...3. steam rises through a slot in the steel insert, and then is prevented from escaping by the plastic lid, except through a corresponding slot in the plastic lid.4. in order to measure water temperature, there is a steel thermometer probe in the base of the kettle. A silicone gasket keeps water from leaking out around the thermometer's base.5. finally, at least in my pro model with wooden handles, there is a plastic transition piece that directly contacts between the hot kettle body and the wooden handle.For these reasons, I am not in favor of this kettle, as much as I am intrigued by the features."
The kettle itself is nice and works. My issue is the display looks crummy on the base which brings the aesthetic appeal down.
"I have been through 3 bases in the past month and a half. Each have had the same problem. Idle mode does not activate if you remove the kettle from the base without hold on. On top of this the base does not stop trying to heat without the kettle on it. I walked passed the base without the kettle on it and it was hot and had a burning smell coming off it. For such a high end kettle this is ridiculous. I have received two replacement bases and all 3 (including the original) have done this.Update: customer service was truly awful. There’s no way it wasn’t AI. Any time I would respond to a message it would reset its response to only looking at the previous message. So if I asked a question it would offer advice and act like that was why I originally reached out. The base was broken but if I asked if a potential replacement could be tested before being sent out it would respond, “all our products go through rigorous testing. I hope this answered your question. If there’s anything else I can assist you with please let me know. Otherwise good bye for now!”"
"I purchased this Fellow kettle because my Cuisinart GK-1 Kettle stopped working after 6 months of use--not even on a once-daily basis.  So, I was disappointed with that brand and then went to this one.  So far, what I don't like about this model is that it has no alarm on it that sounds once the target temperature has been reached.  Also, the base stays on until you shut it off even if the kettle has been removed and there's no reason for it to stay on.  The water also pours much too slowly out of the spout and if you try to pour it at all faster, then it comes out of the top.  Also, at least the Cuisinart came with a brush that would fit down the spout.  The Cuisinart, although it didn't last long, did have an audible 4 beep alarm when the target temperature was reached and again when the base shut off after the kettle was not on it for about 5 minutes.  It also poured faster than the Fellow.  Oh well, I'm stuck with this one until it fails, hopefully longer than the 6 months that my Cuisinart lasted.  Why can't a top company like Breville make a kettle that would actually have the features I want on a product that would last!"
"This was the second time I purchased this kettle. When they worked, they worked great. The first one only lasted about four years, this one didn't even last two before the thermostat conked out. A $165 electric kettle should last longer than this. Will not be buying a third."
"It's accurate, and the spout is still great. Otherwise, it's disappointing. I own several Fellow products, including another Stagg EKG I purchased several years ago. I decided to buy a second, and regrettably the differences in quality are undeniable. The display, finish, and even the ""feel"" of the controls is poor. If it was a $50 off-brand kettle, fine. But I paid $165 for a premium product I was familiar with, and was let down. It's clear that margins have become more important than quality. I was about to pull the trigger on another ODE grinder as well, but I've lost confidence in the brand."
"I love Fellow’s aesthetic design. However, the quality of ALL of their products are problematics. I want their products to be good but consistently they do not deliver and this is no exception. I bought this on October 26th and within a week is abruptly stopped turning on. Tried to troubleshoot it to no avail. So I did an exchange. Second one arrived and it worked like a charm…for one week. Then it abruptly didn’t warm up my water on the timer. It was still on, but didn’t warm up at the time that it was set to warm up. I figured I would try an old It reset by turning it off and turning it back on. So I tapped the off button. Powered down just fine. Then when I went to turn it on it would turn on anymore. Unplugged it and tried it in a different plug…same thing…wouldn’t turn on.Bottom line, I cannot recommend this product based on my experience despite how much I wish I could. Fellow need to get serious about improving the quality of their products…so the aesthetic and lifespan of the product match."
This is a beautifully made gooseneck kettle. The temp setting dial is simple and easy to use. There are no bells and whistles despite the high price but I was ok with that given the unreliability of a cheaper brand that I tried twice before giving up. Unfortunately much as I wanted to love this kettle I did not have the patience to stick with it as the pour rate is incredibly slow. I could literally feel myself aging as I stood pouring! I switched it for a Mecity which has a much faster pour. Fingers crossed that it will not go on the fritz…
"It's very pretty, I love the material and the aesthetic design, but functionally it has a very small capacity, and drips water everywhere when pouring no matter which way the lid sits.I also like how quiet it is. If it would have more capacity and didn't drip I would love it"
"I suspect, and don’t disagree, that this design will stand the test of time; however, it is inexcusable at this price point for cheap plastics that still smell months later to be used in manufacturing. Infuriating that these cost what they do and have materials that smell like a Harvoe Freight store. This is my second one too because I do like them but c’mon."
"I honestly love this kettle, but I just had my 2nd one die - the first one was less than a year but I hadn't purchased through ""Fellow"" so it wasn't under warranty.  So the next time I purchased it via the Fellow store and it lasted 18 months - beyond the warranty.  Both times - it just stops working - nothing new happened to explain why.  I'm getting offered a 10% discount on a replacement base, which is $100.  As much as I love this kettle, not sure it's worth having to replace it each year."
"I have now owned the Fellow Stagg kettle for over a year. Initially I was quite pleased and even now I will admit that I like the build quality and the finish, however I don't think I realized just how slowly the pours water out or how turbulent the pouring is. I now happen to be shopping for another kettle so I can replace the this one because it pours too slowly."
"The lid broke, the wood split (even tho I’ve oiled it) then the knob came right off, I thought it was because of the split, but it’s not, the split didn’t go all the way to the middle. WAY too expensive to be breaking in under 6 months. HOWEVER, I’ve edited my review because they sent me a new lid in a timely manner."
"If you are considering this product, you are more than likely a coffee or tea connoisseur - as am I. Overall the product is fantastic; fast, controls temperature, and even has a switch to maintain temperature. However, scaling is a bigger issue. I have provided two pictures. Both pictures are after a single 400g water heating and after a complete descale. The water used is from a Kitchenaide refrigerator with a new (1 month old) water filter. The compared kettle is a Gator Coffee Stainless Steel ""Stove Top"" kettle.  NOTE - I have not tested with Distilled water as of yet. However the pictures tell the story. The heating element is not uniform thus creating a ""hot spot"" where build up occurs more rapidly. This is either a result of bad construction, inferior stainless steel, or both. Having purchased the unit in August of 2022, I have had to descale after 3 to 5 days of use. NOTE we typically use once per day and heat approximately 800grams of water in either a single dose or two doses. I have emailed the company with the same photos and will update this review upon their response."
First impression is it's a great looking kettle.  Great minimalist design and the base is short so looks good on the counter.  The top easily comes off and the opening is big for easy filling.  The max fill line is easy to see as well.  It heats up fast but once it's about five degrees from the target temperature it really slows down.The minimalist design has it's draw backs.  I switch between temperatures often and their are no preset temperature buttons so I constantly have to scroll the dial to adjust and it's pretty annoying.  The two switches in the back are impractical to use so if you switch between holding a temperature and auto shutoff this is probably not the right one for you.  The pour on this kettle is not great. It's very slow and the stream breaks up rather quickly.  If you make large pour overs I'd probably look elsewhere.
This kettle worked fine for just over a year until this week. The unit does not click on and when it does click on it down not control the temperature. The water continuously boils until the lid pops off and boiling water splatters everywhere. For $170 I would expect a kettle to last a lot longer than a year. This is very disappointing.
I bought this for my wife for X-Mas. She had been asking me for a good electric kettle and this one seemed like it fit the bill.With the first use we noticed that even though we had filled it below the max fill line water still bubbled up out of the top. You have to be very careful as the water gets heated to 212 degrees. There have been a few occasions where the water has burned us.It got to the point where we both got pretty annoyed with it. I went to return it and I missed the window by two days.In my opinion this is not worth the money. We have burned ourselves on multiple occasions. You have to get a paper towel and make sure all the water on the lid is completely gone before pouring.Also because of the holes on the top water literally shoots out and gets all over the surrounding area. Oh and sometimes the lid starts to pop off. Honestly I am surprised there hasn’t been a recall on this.I do NOT recommend.
"I love this tea pot, it’s very ergonomically designed (feels really good to hold) and I love the temperature dial and ability to maintain the temp for 30 minutes. However, a few years in the tea pot has starting to violently boil occasionally, boiling out of the top, spewing water and hot steam all over the counter, overhead cabinet and electrical base. This happens randomly every few days, and has nothing to do with the water level. Even if it’s an inch below it can happen. It also tends to read a temperature lower than boiling when this happens so it’s basically just losing its marbles every now and then.I have had this tea pot for 4.5 years, but for the price I expect it to last just as I do any investment appliances like my vitamix. For one of the most expensive tea pots on the market this shouldn’t happen or it should be under warranty but it’s long expired."
"**Update 10/2/18"" Here I am updating this review again, and again, it's sadly for an issue with the kettle. This time it's stopped working outright. It will no longer heat water - I can hear the safety mechanism tripping anytime the kettle is put onto the base. And yet again, the customer support is non-responsive/lacking. It's been over 48 hours since I attempted to contact them, and still no acknowledgment/reply. Last time I wrote my review, it took 8 days to hear back from their support team. I was finally contacted by the founder assuring me they were hiring a full time customer rep to support faster communication/resolution of issues, but it appears that hasn't happened, and that the process has not improved. It's sad that a kettle this expensive is so troubled with issues preventing it from working. It's not even 6 months old, and is no longer functional. I really can't recommend this kettle to anyone given all the quality assurance issues and the abysmal customer support.**Update 5/23/18** After my initial review, I was eventually contacted by support (it took 8 days to receive a response to my email). They said they would replace the lid and that this was a known issue with some lids. The downside is, they asked for my address for the replacement, and my response went back into the overly long support queue. They notified me 6 days after my reply that they would ship a new lid out. The new lid has been working well so far, and the kettle itself works very well. Therefore, I'm raising my review from 1 to 3 stars - however, their customer support still leaves a lot to be desired. If you're going to sell a premium product that is priced above pretty much all competition, being a small company isn't an excuse to take 2 weeks to resolve a simple matter concerning a product defect.I really wanted to like this kettle as it heats up quickly, and does a good job at keeping the temperature steady once heated, but the build quality leaves a lot to be desired. On my fourth day of using it, the knob at the very top in the lid fell out of the lid. I can't see how it was really attached to the metal underneath there wasn't any glue remnants, but either way, I can't reattach it without trying to super glue it back down. I contacted Fellow's customer support 4 days ago when it happened, and I never heard back from them. Very disappointing for such an expensive kettle to have such poor build quality and customer service. I'd recommend looking at a cheaper kettle like the Bonavita which I've heard very good things about."
"Splurged and bought the pink kettle to match other appliances.  Upon arrival noticed that color was inconsistent between the base and the rest. Disappointing for supposedly high design.Within a month the wooden knob cracked and fell off. Looks like a design flaw where hot steam emitted through vent holes in the lid not only burns you but accumulates on top of the concave lid, eroding the metal screw and cracking the wooden knob. I would have continued to use it without but the rusty screw sticking out gets blazingly hot so it’s really not an option.Took months of follow up for customer service to agree to replace the lid. after they assured me that they would send it in two months, nothing arrived. Also made me jump through every hoop possible submitting photos serial numbers, proof of purchase etc.They claimed they had no inventory for the wooden knobs and would not send me an entire lid. Only because I insisted did they finally mail one out. For an overpriced product they sure are cheapskates.Well, another six months later the knob has fallen off again and the screw holding it has rusted from the steam vapors. I give up.Shoddy all around. I had great luck with a stainless gooseneck kettle with all of the bells and whistles, just no form factor and not pink. It also never burned me once. Time to take it back out."
"When our Bonavita kettle stopped working we thought we’d give this Fellow a try. We use our kettle for multiple cups of tea, coffee, and formula daily.Pros: We really appreciate that the temperature range goes all the way down to 104 degrees (we use 120 for formula), conpared to the Bonavita which only goes down to 140.Cons: The only way to change the temperature is to crank the slow moving dial, spinning and spinning seemingly forever to get from 205 down to 120, and then spinning spinning again to switch it back up. If you only make coffee and tea with this kettle then it isn’t such a hassle, since you really only need a small temperature range anyway. But why give the kettle such a wide range if you’re going to make it so tedious to actually take advantage of the range?The kettle pours REALLY slowly. It might be the perfect flow rate for pour over, but it’s  painfully slow for making anything else.The “hold” switch is on the back. Why hide the switch on the back? Sacrifices function for a cleaner looking design.At this price point, the pros should outweigh the cons. Or at least this should be more functional than a kettle that costs half the price. We’re switching back to the Bonavita."
I see scaling occurring very often on this kettle base even after using a filter water from the refrigerator. Tried lime which helps to some degree. Also curious if there is any lead in your kettle given it’s manufactured in China. Do you have a material certification?
"Like probably everyone else who shelled out the extra money for this, I did so because it looks way nicer than the other gooseneck e-kettles. It would have been nice if they used that money to develop a product that was flawless, but they clearly did not.Even if you are below the fill line, the water will shoot out of the steam holes and in some cases leave a puddle of near-boiling water in the reservoir on the lid. If you don't clear out the water, it will drip off onto your hand while pouring and it does not feel very good.Additionally, the temp gauge only goes up to 204 degrees on mine. The water is clearly boiling, so I am not sure if the gauge is incorrect or if it just won't get any hotter.These shortcomings do not make the product unusable. If you just don't fill it up all the way, stop caring about the gauge, and are aware if water collects on the lid, you'll be fine. But it is pretty messed up that the most expensive option in this price range (or possibly overall) is built like crap.5 stars for design, 1 star for performance = 3 stars. Pretty disappointed."
"This Kettle shows a lid similar to the one they send with the stovetop kettle they sell in the same style. That lid has 3 holes for steam to escape out of and works fairly well. This kettle, on the other hand, has a couple of little holes on one side and that's it. This leads to having steam escape out only in one direction rather violently and no matter which way you pour you are going to get some form of scalding from the steam or simply tipping it too far and all the water comes out of the small holes all over the place. Next is the fill line, I am not sure who is magically filling this holding it from the spout rather than the handle, which seems to be how they think this should be used since the fill line is on the side against the handle. Unless you're a contortionist or have a way to set down the kettle in the proper direction while filling. Now, heat-wise this kettle keeps your water warm for quite a while but it's just warm. It has pretty low heat retention so though warm an hour or so later it will not still be hot, unlike other cheaper designs. All and all if you are ok with an expensive bauble that really is more for show than use goes for it. I humbly regret this purchase and have decided to replace it after trying to use it for quite some time."
"Too small! Doesn’t hold enough water, water spills when pouring. Too expensive for what you get"
"This kettle is extremely aesthetically pleasing and satisfying to pour- but for this extremely high price point, I was expecting much more.  The lid leaks slightly if you don't have it in at the perfect (unmarked) angle.  Also the kettle does not notify you when it hits the set temperature.  You just have to check it when the loud boiling sound stops to see if it's actually at the temp yet- although it quiets down before it reaches your temp so... Also the temp control dial feels plastic-y and the screen is limited in what it shows.  Again- you don't need much, but for this high price I was expecting more.Overall, it gets the job done but for $165 I was expecting it to be incredible.  I'm 50/50 on whether I will keep it or not.  Not sure why someone else doesn't make a similarly aesthetically pleasing one for half the price."
"This kettle has a lot of accolades and let me tell you - IT IS MOSTLY FOR LOOKS. I haven't seen yet any ting on the market that is a decent looking as this. The idea of dialing the temp is good but other products have it too. OXO, had it as well executed in an elegant way with the display in the knob. I can't speak about temp accuracy because I haven't tested it but there are tons of videos online with kettle pissing contests. I don't like how I have to press the button multiple times for a successful contact  - both turning it ON and OFF.  Another thing that I don't like is that this kettle is SLOW....it feels very slow....come on the coffee is done roasting and I ironed my shirt already and changed the oil on the car.  The third thing I don't like is the inside diameter of the spout. I am not sure if they meant it to be use as a syringe needle in emergencies but after you are done heating the water get ready to wait dispensing. You got to put this kettle on vasodilators."
"i've had this kettle for a year and it started showing signs of paint pealing off starting several months ago, even though i have never scrubbed it or used anything abrasive against it. i was too busy to leave a review earlier and kept ignoring it. then i decided i should leave a review and accept my annoyance and disappointment with this product. not good quality. in hindsight, i would not buy this kettle as the paint on it was not applied in a solid way. paint should not come off after intended use. i am disappointed. not worth it. i reached out to the manufacturer and they gave me a list of what not to do with the kettle. i had not done those things and still the paint had come off."
"Bought Oct.22,2022. It stopped working May 19,2024. We loved it until it stopped working. 5 stars until not working"
"I bought this kettle about 6 months ago, and there are many things it does well - its easy to slow pour for brewing pour-over coffee, it has excellent temperature control, and it's great at holding a set temperature.  What is terribly difficult is filling it.  I need to fill it to max each time because of the size of my coffee maker and the max fill line is inside on the side of the pot in only one small area - making it nearly impossible to see in anything other than a very well lit room.  If you accidentally overfill it - even a little bit - it will boil over and shoot hot water out.  I hate to fill it, and that's too bad because I love it otherwise."
"I love this kettle, it's beautiful and works well except for one major design flaw. Whenever it get's unplugged it defaults back to it's highest temperature setting which makes the water boil and overflow out of the kettle. This happened a couple of times so we were cautious about it and then our power went out and after turning the kettle on and walking away not realizing it had been reset with the power outage it overflowed and soaked the entire unit. It didn't work for a few days so we assumed it was lost, but then we realized it was still heating the water but the small screen that displays the timer and temp is broken. So we can still use it, but it's not very convenient. We would love to buy a new one, but these are so pricey and I would hate to risk this happening again after investing so much :( If it wasn't for this it would be a 5 star review."
"If you had asked me a couple of months ago what my review of this product was after a year of use, I would have rated it favorably. Recently, however, I came down to make coffee as I do each morning and the digital screen on the base of the unit was not operational. At first, I thought perhaps it was unplugged, but after I investigated I realized that everything was normal except now the display simply did not work.Never fear, I thought to myself - this is a premium product from a company that seems to position itself at the top of the heap. I'll just send them an email and describe the situation and surely they'll correct it. I wrote the email, fired it off, and waited. And waited some more. And waited a bit longer still. After over a week of waiting without a response, I finally get an email at about 6PM informing me that there was simply nothing they could do about my unfortunate situation, but that they would gladly provide me with a 20% off coupon for my next purchase.I might be wrong, but what exactly am I paying a premium for here? It's not quality, as one of the primary functions of the unit no longer works properly after just over a year. They aren't competing on price, because this unit is priced at the top of a crowded field. And it clearly isn't service or support if all they offer to do is allow me to spend more money with them. I find this to be galling and I will certainly not be spending another red cent on their products after this experience.I don't care pretty it is, if it costs twice the amount of similarly functioning devices, lasts only a year, and they offer poor service or support... isn't it just a nicely designed way to extract cash from consumers? 1 star out of 5, do not waste your money unless you just want to be making the same purchase again shortly and filling a landfill with anodized junk."
"I find myself rather annoyed with this thing, but it does make water hot.Issues:1. It is designed in such a way that it forces you to pour the water very, very, very slowly.  If you want to pour at a slightly faster rate than the speed of a sloth, the water pours out from the cap and boiling hot water spills out uncontrollably onto the countertop if you're lucky, or onto your feet if not.2. The power button incorporates a tactile bump to let you know that you have successfully pressed the button.  Unfortunately that tactile bump is completely separate from the mechanism that actually closes the circuit.  So you can press and press and press all day long and feel that bump all you want, but nothing is ever going to happen unless you press REALLY hard.  Then and only then will the unit come to life or shut down.3.  The unit sometimes (but not always) forgets the last temperature you set it at.  It remembers often enough for you to start to trust it, and then one day it will forget and it will produce 212 degree water instead of 204.  Seems like a small issue, but this is very annoying when you just want your morning coffee.It does work, but I wouldn't buy another one and wouldn't recommend."
"I love this kettle. However, the decision to include a plastic lid and base was a huge mistake. The smell of hot plastic ruins the experience of using the kettle. I’ll likely return it. It’s too bad, as it’s a wonderful product otherwise."
"Works great when it works, but the base completely failed on me with 6 months. The company replaced it the first time, but several months later it failed again, and they basically said I'm out of luck since the warranty is only a year. Pretty dismal customer service. I'd expect a product this expensive to last more than a few months."
"I've used a collection of different electric kettles from different moves, staying places, and recently replacing our Breville that broke when the glass shattered. This has been one of the most disappointing thoughPros:- It looks nice- It's not glass so shouldn't break like our last one- It gets the water hotterCons:- It's super pricey for the feel of it, lots of plastic- The one dial button is not responsive, pressing it sometimes produces no result and spinning it to get to the temp you want it annoying.- The temperature you set it to is not respected. You want boiling 212 water? Prepare to have water shooting out and boiling well past that (yes even when the kettle is below the max line and above the min line)- Did you empty the kettle and place it back down? Better make sure that you turned it off with the non responsive control button as there's no safeguards to make sure it doesn't try to heat an empty kettle.- The lid is difficult to use safely after having recently used the kettle, prepare to get burned.Overall would recommend buyers look elsewhere - thanks for reading the ramblings of one disappointed buyer who wished they'd returned it in the return window."
"I've used my kettle regularly for a couple years and the temperature control has been unreliable for most of that period. It will suddenly fluctuate, changing its mind +/- 10 degrees or more. I honestly don't mind if the more complicated electronics for precise temperature control eventually lose their touch, as they inevitably will.However, let's be very clear about one thing. First and foremost, a kettle is designed to boil water, and only after that should other features be considered. When this kettle decides that 200 degrees is actually 180, and proceeds to ramp up the heat, reaching boiling without tapering off, the kettle spews scalding water in a 2 foot radius. Why?! I have never had any other kettle, electric or otherwise, that can't contain boiling water. This is absolutely unacceptable."
"I wanted a quick to heat Kettle with some sort of scheduling function. This definitely meets that, but so do other kettles that are less.The main issue is the wifi functionality is useless."
Brand new and I set at 205f.  Tested with my thermal only 185F.  Does anyone notice?
"Had white kettle for less than two years, used daily for two cup of tea. The pour over spout eked a nice flavor out of the tea (though it takes a long time to pour) and the kettle looked nice in our kitchen. However, encountered many issues:- sticky button after about a month, no matter how hard i tried to keep it clear of any debris it got stickier and barely functioned at times- you have to carefully position the lid, hot water sputters out of it while pouring, even when not full- water often dribbled down the sides if not careful, extra clean up required- I was never able to get the fahrenheit temp reading to work - only celsius- and about 18 months in the display stopped working, so now we have no way to regulate the temperatureOverall not thrilled with the experience for $150, will not buy again. I could have dealt with the slow pour and mess if the basic functions worked better. My Breville and Hamilton Beach kettles may not be as design-y but they have both lasted longer than this pretty boy and have taken much more abuse. Also, if I had to buy this again I would get a color other than white, very hard to keep clean esp. on the handle and lid."
"- The LCD has a bad viewing angle when your sitting down and looking at it from the side on a desk, making it hard to read.  I wish they spent $3 more on their LCD for their ducking $170 electric fashion kettle.- The hold temp program uses a pulse of power every second which means it causes the lights to flicker every second if they are on the same circuit, which is the case for me.  While boiling it does not do this.  Something that looks this good is meant to be not just in the kitchen!- Their support form is incredibly annoying, when you just want to ask them a question they ask you to fill in a dozen things like your address, phone, order numbers, serial number (which requires precise capitalization), etc.  You should only ask this if you actually plan to send a replacement, otherwise you are wasting everyone's time.After having this experience and seeing other recent early failure reviews I have half a mind to return this.  High prices mean high standards!"
"As a consumer who appreciates both style and functionality in kitchen appliances, I was sorely disappointed with my experience with the Stagg EKG Electric Kettle. Despite the sleek design promised by the product photos, the reality fell flat when I received the kettle in a color that was completely different from what I ordered.Instead of the elegant black finish that I had eagerly anticipated, I received a completely different color. A color they had on their website but not the one I ordered. Not only was this a major aesthetic letdown, but the kettle also failed to deliver on its primary function: boiling water efficiently.Upon attempting to use the kettle, I quickly noticed its lackluster performance. It took an absurdly long time to heat up even a small amount of water, and when it finally did reach boiling point, it emitted a strange odor that made me question its safety. Additionally, the temperature control feature seemed unreliable, resulting in water that was either scalding hot or disappointingly lukewarm.In summary, the Stagg EKG Electric Kettle not only failed to meet my expectations in terms of appearance, but it also proved to be a subpar performer in the realm of functionality. I would strongly advise potential buyers to steer clear of this product unless they're willing to risk receiving the wrong color and dealing with its inefficient operation."
"After owning and using this kettle daily for a year, I only have a couple comments that would have greatly informed my purchase decision.It is not even close to as premium as the price would suggest.1. The handle and lid are made of a pretty cheap looking and feeling plastic.2. The lid/handle, main body, and base are all different shades of white. It’s the opposite of good design and looks terrible in hand.3. The handle is attached weakly at a single point and has had a disconcerting amount of play since day one.4. The spout outlet isn’t even cleaned up/deburred. It’s sharp and impossible to clean completely.The whole thing screams corner cutting for cost reduction. I bet the first versions and prototypes of these were stunning.It is very pretty from a distance; it heats water quickly and holds it at temp for an hour. So as a kettle it functions as it should. But so does my $20 Amazon basics kettle.Do not buy at this price point."
"I first encountered this teapot/kettle on staying in a hotel. I fell in love with it for its speed, simplicity and appearance. Sadly on receiving,Sadly, I discovered the one sent by Amazon seemed to take MUCH longer to come to a boil (212°). I clocked this at 5 1/2 minutes (pretty darned slow for a device that barely holds 2 cups)Stranger yet, it LEAKS / DRIPS  water when I pour from it, and there's immediately white residue from the water.I was really excited about finding this kettle, but now I'm considering returning it in favor of my old ($69 electric kettle).PROS: beautiful, extremely simple to use and set (temperature and hold)CONS: Slow, leaks"
"I love the design & easiness of the pour, plus the kettle stays warm once you put it in place.  In other kettles, you have to push buttons.  This kettle started to get water deposits (white powder) inside after about a week of use.  I use purified filtered water and, am not sure if this was a water issue, but disappointed and would not be so easy to clean with a smaller opening.  A big concern was the lid not staying in place.  I tried to reach this company without any luck...and appreciate a company that you are able to speak to directly for help."
"I wanted to love this so much. There is no doubt it’s the most beautiful, aesthetically pleasing kettle on the market. As a former barista, I’ve used almost every variable temp gooseneck kettle on the market. After three weeks of using this, I got really tired of burning myself literally every time I made a pour over. The lid does not seal and drips boiling water constantly. I am positive this is a universal issue as my sister has one and I’ve used several in coffee shops. Additionally, out of the box, the on button worked about 50% of the time, and I had to finagle the connection to the base in order for it to start heating. For almost $200 dollars a pop, it is baffling to me how many issues there are. I cannot recommend this product as such."
"Make sure to register with Fellow directly!!!! Loved this kettle and the perfect cup of coffee I could make. However, the base stopped working after 1.5 years. When I contacted the company they said there was nothing they could do since the warranty without registering it was only for 12 months. They had my receipt and were unhelpful. Not worth it for that price tag!!!!!!!!"
"I am judging this product based on its cost/value relative to comparable competitors that accomplish the same for 50%-30% the priceDislikes:The temperature switch and the hold switch are wobbly and feel cheapThe powder matter finish coat on the outside of the kettle seem to go up into the lip of the kettle, perhaps over spray during the coat/spray process.The gooseneck spout has some rough sharp edges that appear unevenThe gooseneck spout shaping process left the tip of my aluminum spout with a recessed bit that look darker and unpolished.Likes:LED screen that shows temperature setting and current tempKnob for gradual controlled temp controlClick knob for power on/offclick and hold knob for start timerSpout pour rate is controllablekettle heating pad has non slip silicone ringlooks gorgeous from far awayThis is a great product that looks gorgeous from far away but as you start to handle it on a daily basis and have it up close the wrinkles and scars become far more visible.I wish it was better made for something that obviously is trying to fill a ""premium"" market niche"
It is very good quality and precise temperature controls. You can get very similar brands for much less.It seems to be primarily for pour coffee makers in that it is extremely slow to pour a cup of tea which can take over 10 seconds. This translates to the water temperature being less than expected when you finally get the cup filled.
"I love the look of this and how easy it was to use, but for yours and it has stopped working. I read online that many other people have the same problem. It also leaks when you pour if you don’t have the top on the right direction, and don’t slow pour. I always had to warn guests to be careful."
"While this works as it should - heats water fast and to the desired temperature, it has a strange smell while heating and when hot.This seems to give a strange taste to the water, coffee, or tea.Being made in China, I wonder if it's a lead-based paint or something.Had to return this for health and safety reasons."
"Saw this at a couple of local coffee shops and in Wirecutter, so I decided to take a chance after our 3.5y old OXO gooseneck electric kettle stopped working. It looks great, but it just feels slow and clunky. Heating is definitely slower than OXO, turning it on isn't instant, it doesn't beep when the temperature is hit, and it can be easy to burn your fingers since a portion of the handle (the metal part) can get really hot. Feels like a downgrade."
"I like the style of the pot, but the base went out twice once within the warranty period and again a year and a half after the warranty was up.  This is a lot of money to pay for a product that's only going to last a handful of years and end up in a landfill.  I contacted them and they replied by saying they could give me a 10% discount so I could buy another one.  No thank you this is irresponsible.  Companies have to start thinking about the environment and be proactive.  A note to Fellow Check out a consumers right to repair initiative.  That's being responsible if you need an idea."
I put a cup of milk in it to heat and it broke. Would no longer work. The message said no water. Buy something cheaper
I've been having problems for a bit with the kettle not actually bringing water up to the set temp. You have to remove it from the element and put it back repeatedly to get it to continue heating up to 212 degrees. I contacted Fellow to see what they could do. They only sent troubleshooting steps and then offered a 10% off coupon when that didn't work. That's ridiculous for a $200 kettle that didn't even last 2 years. Don't buy Fellow products.
I have had this kettle for a year and 8 mos.  It stopped heating water :(.  I reached out to the company for assistance and they guided me though descaling with citric acid (their assumption was there was hard water build up on the temperature gage preventing the kettle gage from detecting water temperature to heat water.)  Unfortunately the descaling process didn't help the matter and since I'm beyond the 1 year warranty the only option was to spend another $150 to get a new gooseneck kettle. No thanks! :(  I'd rather buy a new kettle at a fraction of the price and not feel so bad if the cheap-y one peters out after a year or two.  Major bummer.  It's a beautiful product but looking pretty on the counter doesn't matter if it won't heat water anymore.
"I use this for tea and pour over coffee and it’s great but the price is staggering and I almost sent it back when I saw that the base was made of cheap plastic. Why ruin a masterpiece with junk. Base should have been metal. The buttons also feel a little junky. So, highly functional but if you can’t afford it don’t sweat it and buy something cheaper."
"This kettle is pretty to look at, but it was finicky from the start. Would turn off randomly. Never quite got up to the temperature you wanted. And after a year and a half it just stopped working. If you pay this much for a kettle you hope it would last at least 3 years with no issues, but that's not the case here. Go for a cheaper kettle without as much bells and whistles. It's not worth the price at all."
"For $165 this product is cheap. Plugged it in the day it came and it didn’t work right out of the box. Used the dial to set the goal temperature, but it didn’t heat the water. The second time I tried, it did heat the water but the dial temp never moved from 88 degrees. I could hear it boiling but the dial temperature still said 88 degrees until it boiled the top right off the kettle. Very disappointed, sending it back today. Don’t overpay for such a cheap kettle."
"This kettle, while beautiful, is not worth the premium price. It is extremely susceptible to changes in boiling point of water based on location. I am in a high elevation area, where our boiling point is 202-204. If i set the kettle to 204 or higher, it spits and spews like crazy because it reaches over boil. It is a very normal and standard feature for kettles to have automatic stops for overboil. My old bonavita gooseneck just never reached a higher temperature if I set it over boil because it clearly had a stop, and that was almost half the price of this kettle. This really does seem like a safety hazard having used it for a few months now, and I am extremely disappointed. As soon as it shows its first signs of malfunction, I am going to go back to something that won't boil over. I am really disappointed because it is a really beautiful kettle, and I keep my kettle out at all times, so it was great to feel like it was adding to the decor of my kitchen in addition to having function. Hopefully they will fix the overboil issues and offer a discount to customers who have this much more dangerous version of the kettle."
The look and feel of the device is superb. It looks terrific in my kitchen and I also enjoy the ability to precisely control the temperature. That it will hold a temperature for an extended period of time is also super convenient. One big issue is that powering on the device doesn't always work. Not sure why. Sometimes I have to hit the power switch (same as temperature control knob) multiple times for it to begin brewing. That's really annoying for such a high price. In hindsight I would have returned it for a refund but it's too late now that I've had the device in my home for about 1 month. Buyer beware. Could be a QC problem...not sure.
"I used the Stagg EKG kettle for a little over a month before it stopped working on a day I was sick and really needed hot water. I got a replacement and will see how long it lasts this time.Areas for Improvement:1. Pour - I'm not sure what exactly causes it but the pour gets very choppy which results in burns caused by splashing boiling hot water. I don't necessarily think this is related to pouring ""too quickly"" as I've tried different angles/speeds/ways of pouring and can't tell what's causing the choppiness.2. Indicator - I also wish there was some sort of subtle noise indicator when it's reached temperature--I walk away and forget about it. Too subtle for everyday use. It's times like that when I actually realize and miss the purpose of a click or beep or whistle from other kettles I've used.I like the stopwatch feature and the switch between F & C. Beautiful, but at this price point it needs to focus on the very basics of a kettle: reliability and practicality."
"Let me start by saying that this is indeed a very beautiful kettle and it’s aesthetically perfect. That’s pretty much where it ends for me.Function wise. It’s the worst. First of all it pours so incredibly slooooooooooooooooow. So unless you’re making a French press coffee and you need a perfect temperature of 205 and a slow pour, there is no point of holding on a kettle full of hot boiling water with steam burning your hands. It’s terrible for making tea. The lid has a poor design where the water would boil up the lid and fill it with water which will eventually crack the wood knob if you fill it to the max line. The paint also chips if you’re not careful.I’m conclusion, if you’re buying it for the looks that’s pretty much what you’re going to get, a beautiful kettle that’s just meh."
"I purchased this kettle in June 2023.  It worked well for about a year and a half and then just suddenly stopped heating.  I reached out to Fellow and they would not honor the warranty because I bought it on Amazon from an “unauthorized seller” and they couldn’t verify it was a new kettle.  For the price, this is ridiculous and it should last much longer than a year.  I would not give this brand my money."
"I could have sworn I bought this because of a Cook's Illustrated review but can't find it so I'm not sure where I heard about this product.  In any case, the first one I received just would not turn on.  At all.  So I returned and was sent another.  This one works but the temp control is all over the map.  I had originally set it for 195 and it kept going well beyond that so I set if for 193 and it still goes way over before eventually setting on 193 and holding.  I don't know what the point of this is other than precise temp control.  I am also not crazy about how long it takes to pour the water out and if you tip it too far (to make it go fast because, hello, it's COFFEE and it's MORNING) it leaks out the top.  It's nice looking but I will probably give it away (since I'm beyond refund period) and go back to my Oxo kettle.  I have limited counter space and this does not earn its place.Edited to add: this kettle is actively annoying me now.  It either takes forever to get to 193 (keeps hovering at 192, 191, 192, 190 over and over) or shoots to 197 before you can turn it off.  Mostly I'm annoyed at myself for wasting money on this when my old school kettle worked just fine.  Please save your money."
"I loved this kettle and used it every day for two years with no issues. Now it overheats and blows boiling water all over the kitchen. It's dangerous and I have to throw it out. its disappointing because the warranty expired a month ago and for 200.00, I expected this kettle to last a lot longer."
"This kettle doesn't protect itself from heating up when it's empty. When I took it out of the box I did what I think is a natural thing to do: plug in the base, turn it on to see if it works, then put the kettle on it (it was empty because I didn't intend to start it). 30 seconds after I heard a clicking noise and realised that the kettle is heating up, I immediately removed it from the base and saw a smoke coming from under the kettle. It looks like it wasn't damaged and all functions are working fine, but I don't understand how I can use it. For example, suppose I finished making my coffee and the kettle is empty, what do I do? I can't put it back on the base, because if I do, then turning it on will destroy it. Do I need to refill it AFTER every use? Do I need to open the kettle after every use to make sure it's not empty? Do I need to unplug the base after every use? There are cheaper alternatives that don't require any of those things.I think the root cause of this problem is that the kettle has only one button that turns on the display and also starts the heater. It's easier because there are fewer buttons but it's not safe. This is a design problem that I didn't expect to see in a $165 kettle."
"I don't usually complain but this company has the worst customer service follow-through. When the kettle works, it is precise with the needed controls and safety features. However, if it is out of warranty and mine was over by 10 months, their customer service at Fellow is slow, not helpful, and will not even suggest a repair shop. The cost is too high to simply throw away."
"It worked great for 2 years for my daily pourovers, but I expected a longer life from a kettle that commands $160 price tag. Customer service did not offer a discounted replacement or really any help other than ""did you try to unplug and plug it back in"" (they literally wrote this to me).There are other electric kettles with similar features that have a much longer warranty and guarantee on lasting quality. Save your money and look for those. I won't be buying a replacement Stagg."
"It's definitely a beautiful kettle but there are a few issues. You can turn off hold temperature, but it will hold the temperature for 5 minutes no matter what. It also pulses as it gets close to the set temperature, which takes another 30 seconds or so to actually get to the set temperature. Also, the button has become very unreliable to turn on and off. Not sure if it's sticky or about to stop working altogether. If you like the look of a gooseneck, and this isn't just about Stagg, it really does take a long time to pour, and there's a tendency to turn the kettle up and up until water starts coming out of the lid, because you can't tell if it's empty or just pouring slowly. My biggest gripe is the pulsing it does. I have LED lights in that room and they flicker like there's no tomorrow whenever the kettle starts doing it's pulsing thing. Since a HOLD is mandatory for at least 5 minutes, and it pulses when on hold, it's quite annoying. Giving it a 2 out of 5 because of the button starting not to work."
"I've had this unit for close to a week. A lot of people recommended this kettle. All of them warned me about how slowly the water pours out. After using the kettle the cons far outweigh the pros for me. Cons: no audible alert for when water temperature is attained (the other dozen kettles that I've had all had an audible alert);  leaks from the lid; it really does trickle pour!!; Kettle volume; takes over a minute to get from 205 to 212; c/f and keep hot function are manual switches on the back (really? Theres a display and control interface.). Pros: feels like quality; insulated so water keeps warm. I had an Aldi special for about three months. Other than it breaking, the only con was poorly insulated so water cooled quickly. I'd rather have a cheaper made kettle that has more features than a kettle that lasts for 5years and frustrates me. Value just isn't there for me on this one.EDIT: I decided to return the kettle because the leak at the lid let out more water than the spout! Ammy wouldn't touch it since it was passed the return window and the manufacture responded to my warranty claim that the kettles aren't designed to not leak! Basically refused to do anything. Buyer BEWARE>"
"Beautiful, functional, does the job, BUT, don’t hold your breath until you fill the cup; you”ll turn blue! What were the designers thinking?"
"I loved my kettle; however, it died a couple days ago. Since most reviews are based on short-term use of the product, I thought I would chime in, in case it helps potential buyers. I purchased mine in April 2018 and, as of Feb 2022 it will not heat past 70 degrees, sadly. If you feel that's a fair lifespan, then the kettle worked perfectly up until then. I used it frequently, probably 4 days a week. For me though, I will not be replacing it with another gooseneck. I LOVE the aesthetic but ended up pouring water out of the top-side more often than using the slow pour. :)"
"The kettle itself is well made and stylish and I like the minimalist design of the base.  After using it for two months, however, the button on the base has become unreliable and I need to press it several times to power the kettle off or on.  I reached out to the seller, but have not heard back."
Heats water fineStrays a couple degrees from set pointHas an off chemical smell still after 2-1/2 monthsCustomer service can’t find warranty info when I used the warranty registration confirmation email to ask for helpVery disappointed in this product.The $60 one I bought at the same time for deer camp has no smells and needs no customer service.
"Unfortunately, water is leaking from lid when you want to use it. Also, even though the water is under the line suppose to be, when is boiling pushed up the lid and spills."
"The kettle leaked from the seam at the base. Unable to exchange so I had to make a separate purchase of a new kettle. I waited at least two weeks before each one arrived.The kettle is great, I just would have expected better quality control from this brand. Water instantly dripped through the seam when filled so I'm not sure how it wasn't caught."
"The on/off button is very wobbly, and must be pressed at the perfect angle in order to turn it on. I often have to try several times to get it to work. That shouldn't happen with a kettle that costs this much.A very minor annoyance is that the lid is too tight for the strength of the handle. I've tried to push the lid in place while walking from my sink to the base, but the pressure from pressing down on the lid while holding it in the air would quickly brake the handle. It needs to be set firmly in the table or on the base before pressing the lid back on. Not a big deal, but again, for a kettle that costs this much, it should be built much stronger. It feels too cheap.Looks great though. Form over function here."
"I bought this kettle as a Christmas gift in November, 2023.  It would never heat water past 203 degrees, though the maximum was set at 212 degrees.  Hot water would sputter out of the air holes in the lid, so you had to be cautious when pouring.  Then in September, only 9 months after it was taken out of the box, it stopped working.  On the lookout for something that works instead of something that just looks cute.  Expensive and disappointing."
Kettle burnt out in 4 years. Customer service would not offer to repair or replace as warranty is 1 year. Better to buy cheap version for $30. This was a complete waste of money and the Fellow company has zero interest in building customer loyalty.
"I bought this in late December 2021 in matte black. Perfect to match my kitchen and I loved the sleek look but I wanted to wait to review for longevity purposes. The kettle has died, exactly 1.5 years later. The lid is comprised of a plastic handle portion and a stainless steel inset. These two products have separated on mine. So when you lift the lid, the stainless steel portion stays sitting in the pot. No epoxy, resin, glue etc. will hold it back together as water seems to sit between the layers and hang out. Rather unfortunate given the price of this product. Considering my old, ugly $20 kettle from my college days is still firing just fine 10+ years later. So I can't say for the cost that I would recommend this product."
"I wanted to love this kettle… the styling is first rate, and the narrow spout is what everyone recommends for pour over coffee. However, it’s just too small if you want to make a full pot. I use the Chemex 8 cup  & this kettle only holds 4 cups… I guess I should have read the details more carefully. In any case, it would be fine if you’re just making a small quantity."
"I want to say first that I got this when I was in college, and this thing has been a life-saver. I used it on a daily basis.However, it took maybe only a year before it started breaking down. The auto-shut off for boiling no longer started working once it got too hot, and the handle area where the button was grew hot on boiling. It felt unsafe to use. I kept using it for a good year, however (would not recommend for safety looking back), but as of 2024, a bit over two years since I've gotten this kettle, the on/off button has started to stop functioning entirely. So it would seem like it's time I find a new kettle. I would not buy this one again, but as a college kid on a budget, this was a good purchase for necessity."
"I bought this product because it is  smaller size than other kettles and am fairly happy with it. It came with nice packaging. However, after a week of use the light indicator on the handle, which is how you turn it off and on is no longer working. The kettle will continue to heat up but the light Doesn’t indicate when it’s done heating. I’ll continue to use it however I’m concerned that it will stop heating eventually because there could be a problem with the switch. I have not contacted the manufacturer yet."
"But it does get hot and boil the water. I like that it has an automatic turn off once the water is boiled. However, I'm giving it 3 stars because if you pour it too quickly, it comes out in 3 streams, so just pour slowly"
I haven't had it very long and it's already turning off by itself. I have to turn it off and back on in order for it to work. I also hear a rattling in it that I had not notice before.
"This heats water very quickly but after receiving it a friend told me that no matter what kind of plastic it is it can leach into your water, so I returned it and got a glass and stainless steel one instead"
"I have loved this kettle since I bought it 3 years ago. However as of a couple months ago it started not shutting off automatically which, to me, is a safety issue."
"Ordered the white one with gray lid button. It's very attractive (like the overall shape) and is quite comfortable to hold and manage. It's not as bright white as I thought it be. But what's disturbing is I think I got a used one that had been returned. The box had already been opened (the little tongue flap that secures it closed was mangled already), the electrical cord wasn't bound with coated wire or zip tie as most are when they're brand new. The manual was shoved into the bottom and was all bent and mangled as well. We know how nicely new electronic products are packaged. This one was not. Plus the ""new"" smell wasn't there. You know the one I mean - the ""new"" electronic smell? I ordered it for next day delivery because the big electronic coffee machine at the office broke down and I need my coffee. I already had a Melita brand drip pour over thing that sits on a cup and just needs boiled water poured over the coffee grounds. I thought this unit would come in handy toward that end. It does, but sorry to say, the microwave heats water A LOT faster than this unit. And further troubling, after the first use following instructions, little white spots appeared over half the hot plate at the bottom of the kettle. I used filtered water as instructed so wasn't expecting these spots. I mean it functions but I don't know if it's functioning as it should because I'm pretty sure it was returned. I'm not as happy with this purchase I should be. I've ordered refurbished items and items from amazon warehouse that were packaged so that they seemed brand new and I've really appreciated that attention to detail. This was not that.....at all. I'm disappointed with this item but I'm glad others who ordered it got something they could appreciate."
"handy, affordable kettle, although it takes slighlty longer than an expensive one it still does the job perfectly"
"I bought this for quick boil for my tea. Used it couple of time now. It takes +10 mins to boil max 1.7 L. That’s  about how long it takes using the stove. My previous one (different brand) heated up < 5 mins or less. It’s very disappointing. The picture looked white colored but actually has grayish shade. Oh well. For the price I paid, I kept it."
It has something like rust at the bottom not really sure what is it.
"The smell of plastic, I'm worried there are bad substances，Work is normal"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The heating pad is really cheap but I guess it’s worth the price. Water heats up quickly though so that’s a plus.The box it came in was opened from the bottom and the kettle practically spilled out when I opened it.
"worked good for a while then the coil in the base pad got stuck and it wouldnt turn on, fixed that, now the pin on the bottom of the kettle itself is bent and wont sit on the base properly so it wont turn on again"
Really lightweight…. Feels cheep🤷🏻‍♀️
"Super cute color and shape, the light is bright and it will heat your water fairly quickly.  The spinning base is a nice feature, makes spilling when you grab it from the base much less likely because it rotates.  With that said, it’s not the fastest critter around. Honestly, it’s only a little bit quicker than a pot and lid on a gas stove. Definitely faster than boiling water without a lid or on an electric stove lol.  My biggest complaint is the cord.  It’s ridiculously short and makes plugging it in where it’s easily accessible or where you’d actually like to keep it on the counter.  I doubt I’d buy this for myself again but it would be greatly in a college dorm or rec room. Fairly durable, definitely portable."
The size is perfect but when you pour the water it comes from not just spout but the top too.  Will keep for now but will buy a better one
"It's funny...and watched pot doesn't boil, and it takes a long time for this kettle too.Be careful opening the lid after it's boiled water because it found the condensation."
"I'm not certain that I am going to try this out. I liked the way the lid pops open and stays open by itself. Then I looked inside. The bottom is clearly stainless steel, that's good. The pot from the bottom up on the inside is plastic. The stainless steel bottom plate has a band of what appears to be silicon caulk sealing it to the plastic pot. This type of construction has severalpotential  problems. The laws of physics being what they are where I live dictate that dissimilar materials expand and contract at different rates. This means that the size that heated stainless steel is when water is boiling is not necessarily the same size that the plastic that the pot is made of will be. In other words this seems like a leaking pot at some time in the future. When that time will be I can't say, but the chances are it will be when liquid is inside the pot or there would be no leak. Another thing, I have used silicon sealant on several aquarium tanks, and it worked well. It didn't kill my fish, and didn't develop any leaks. It was also used with a water temperature of around 76-78 degrees Fahrenheit, not nearly hot enough to boil water. Actually I have not used silicon sealant in a boiling water situation, but it doesn't seem like a good idea to me. That's the main reason why I might send this unit back. Hopefully that can be done for free from the UPS store. I'm surprised that it wasn't damaged during shipping. It was just in it's retail box, like you might see at the store and not packed inside a larger box with padding.Wait a minute just thought of something. I have a water distiller that uses a silicone sealing ring to seal the condenser unit on top, to the boiling unit below it. The ring is not submerged in the water, but it's exposed to steam, and steam is much hotter than boiling water. I would have to admit that this pot could work satisfactorily, although I don't know for how long. It most likely will fail when liquid is inside it and that could be a mess."
I don’t recommend this product. It boiled water fast but the plastic material doesn’t smell safe to me.
cute kettle but not fast enough for me (boiling time around 8 min)
Takes a loooong time to boil water but otherwise ok. Not recommended.
"this pot becomes extremely hot and is all plastic from whati can discern...i am used to metal, so this item to me, was ok,but not great. it also seemed to put an excessive amountof heat out (it is all plastic apparently)..i would not buy it again..."
I have gotten several boil glass kettles all have broke within 6mths with little use of twice week This one l have had 3mths so l gave 3 for now l believe will last. If it's still works 2yrs now 5☆ 👍
"The water heater works well and heats up quickly. However, after using it a few times, I noticed the color at the bottom started to change. It's still functional, but the discoloration is a bit concerning."
Works well but kind of cheap. A bit of a pain to open lid  doesn’t pour out super cleanly but it does the job.  For the price I would buy again.
I returned this because the water smells like plastic. I used it multiple times hoping the smell of plastic would go away but the water still has a faint smell of plastic.
Bought this after our previous kettle of 1yr broke. This version leaks when pouring water and takes longer to heat up the water. Just okay but wouldn't buy again.
"Jan 24, 2021 Had a new kettle in the cupboard in Oct 2019 so used it until this morning when it gave up the ghost. Not worth claiming on the warranty. Love this kettle but after so long, the LITTLE CONTACT PIN AT BOTTOM OF KETTLE gets loose and that pin will not make contact with the base.  What a pity the company takes no notice of comments about that little pin.  Once it gets loose, you can move it around and it might work for a while, but it does not last long. Wake up Ovente!!!!October 24, 2019, I love this electric kettle, but as I wrote below, I bought one on September 19, 2019 and this morning October 24 it stopped working. The base is OK, it is the actual kettle that fits on the base.  Just over the month window so too late to return it to Amazon.  So guess it is now time to start looking at other better electric kettles. I have gone back to my Black and Decker that is only about 10 years old and works just fine.Sorry OVENTE I have had it with you. Goodbye.Sept 19.2019 I love this electric kettle.  However, the actual kettle does not last very long. The base lasts much, much longer. I have gone through several of these kettles in the last year. The bases are fine, but the kettle itself stops working.  It is cheap enough that I order two at a time and then just throw the old ones away, but the manufacturer/seller should know about the problem.April 9, 2017 Well I just bought another one of these kettles on arch 3, 2017.  Tonight it stopped working and the switch would not keep in the right position to boil the water.I must now give up on this piece of garbage, even though when it works I love it. I bought one June 25, 2016, Oct 31, 2016, Dec. 7,2016, and last one on March 3.  As it is now April 9, of course I cannot return it to Amazon within 30 days.A good idea and I loved the kettle WHEN IT WORKED. Being English I have to have an electric kettle and love the cordless idea, but this piece of garbage works for a few months, if that, then gives up the ghost.  I shall now be looking for a decent kettle.UPDATE: 7/4/2017 Now this kettle stopped working. Blue light would not go on, so can't boil my water. Base is OK, so I decided to look at the bottom outside of the kettle.  I cleaned the pin that goes into the base and straightened it. Voila!  now my kettle works again. For how long we will see, but at the low price I bought another one, just in case.  So, Ovente people in charge, maybe you need to look at that pin at the bottom of the kettle. I love this kettle as the handle does not get hot and I do not burn myself as I am pouring the water.  I love that I can at what level the water is.  I hope now that maybe this kettle will work a longer time. I only bought this kettle in March, I think it was.  I do not like the stainless steel ones as they get hot and rust, so hopefully now I have solved my problem and I won't have to use the new one that just arrived."
"Heats up quickly. But if you over tilt when pouring, water spills out the closed lid. I’m looking for something with a better lid seal."
"Bought this to replace an old Aroma brand kettle hoping it would compare. Alas, not the same at all! It boiled water very slowly. Disappointed."
"I ordered this one because I have white appliances on a white and grey marble counter, but it came in looking greyish beige, or ecru. It's not close enough for me to call it white, and I do understand there are many shades of white, but this is not one of them. Even the picture on the box looks dark beige or warm grey and the power cord is stark white, like they totally missed the mark on the color, so I think they should update the listing to say off white! The kettle is otherwise an inexpensive hot water kettle. It took a few minutes to boil, but stayed warm for over an hour after I turned it off. The power cord is quite thick, like an outdoor extension cord, so takes up a lot of room on the counter, and is heavy enough to move the kettle if there is no water in it. If I didn't care about color, I'd probably keep it because it does do what it's supposed to do."
"There are only two things to note that are ""bad"" and everything else is pretty great about this.  So let's get the bad out of the way first.Bad #1: The power cord is very thick and very stiff - completely inflexible so the base will not sit flat or stay where you put it.Bad #2: Strong chemical odor at first that doesn't wash out easily.  It eventually went away after washing it out multiple times and then filling and bringing to boil multiple times with a few drops of detergent.OK on to the good stuff.  The kettle boils water really quickly.  The lid opens and closes easily and it's easy to fill.  There is a light inside that lights up the water in case you enjoy watching the bubbles form as it comes up to a boil.  The power switch is in a very convenient spot.  It's very easy to lift the jug off the base and pour the hot water and then set the jug back on the base - easy to center it on the power fitting in the base.My house has ancient plumbing and you waste a lot of water waiting for it to get hot so I use this jug to heat water for shaving (manually turn the power switch off after a couple of minutes - no need to take it to a boil).  It is also very handy in the bathroom when you are taking a long, hot soak in the tub on a cold winter night and your bathwater starts to cool down - one jug full of boiling water added to the tub brings the bath right back to temp again."
Awesome kettle. Heats up quick but I thought the whole interior was metal. Only the heater on the bottom was
"I bought this product to heat water, and it does that great, it was a fun color which I love, and I also love the clear water level display.  The downfall is the spout, it is too small.  It works, you just have to pour really slowly or the water come out the lid and the sides.  I have dealt with it, but if you are not patient this is not the Kettle for you."
"Just got it today. Boiled water a couple of times as the directions say, and there’s already residue"
"It has been 2 years since I ordered this. I was hoping the smell inside of it (plastic smell) would fade in time.  It’s been two years and the smell is still there.  It is otherwise sturdy, boils really fast and has a little light inside to aid in determining the boil. I feel like I should have gotten a glass one."
"The first: the boiling time. This is the biggest issue, because it advertises that it will boil water with 2 minutes. If you have a cup of water in it, this is true. -However- if you have a full kettle, it will take upwards of 7 minutes to boil. Considering this is the same amount of time it would take a burner on high to boil a traditional metal kettle, I don't think there's a big difference in how much energy you're saving, which is also one of the big selling points.The second issue is that the lid only opens 1/4th of the time. First world problems, but it's clear it's just a cheap design."
It works as it should. It's just kinda too slow to boil.
Works quick but the kettle warmer bottom is not sturdy
"I accidently cracked my glass electric kettle recently, that I loved very much, so I decided to purchase this one to replace that one.  It's ok for the price, but the quality of the plastic it's cheap and everything feels and looks of poor quality.  I went by the reviews , but my personal experience is different."
Nice and fast.  Love the size and appearance
"It’s very sleek and clean. The kettle hold LOTS of water (1.7L to be exact). The instructions come with a desvaí lung guide which is a plus. One thing to note is that mine randomly pops open, whether it’s when the water is finished boiling, when taking it off the boiling plate before it finishes (which is a safety hazard because boiling water droplets flew onto my face) or when it’s empty + off and returning it back to the plate. It really has been a great edition to the house but the random opening is a bit unpredictable and poses as a risk."
"I like that it's got a swivel base so it can rotate, and it boils water pretty quickly, but the top leaks 90% of the time when I am pouring the boiled water. It's just so annoying cleaning up spilled water on the counter, I have tried pouring slower and at less of an angle and it just keeps leaking water out of the lid nomatter what I do. I will probably end up replacing it with a different brand."
It’s okay but to slow takes more than 5 minutes to come up to a boil.
"Wish it would heat up a little bit faster, stalled second third fourth time around"
Used it for a couple of months and it was dead
It’s nice for travel. Wish there was a keep warm feature.
"Everything about this kettle is great except for one glaring issue. The lid on top pops open to allow easy refill. However, there is no O-ring on the lid to seal it when closed. That means that when you're pouring hot water out the spout, if you tip it too far, hot water spills out around the lid and often splatters all over everything. Twice I was standing next to the counter as I poured hot water into my travel mug and hot water splattered onto my feet. Youch! A simple o-ring would solve the problem.Update: Well, durn. I went to make a cup o tea this morning and it seems my kettle has bit the dust. The switch will not come on. It was a pretty inexpensive item, but I was hoping to get a bit more than 8 months out of it."
i was scared after having it plugged in for awhile it wouldnt turn on but it does 😅i feel kinda lied to it says usb chargeable but is not you need to plug it on the dock to turn it on had i known it was not a portable kettle wouldve bought something else but i made coffee in it just fine i bought a pink one it looks like a toy but it cooks just fine it gets really hot i had water splash on me and that burnedoh ya btw the body gets hot after use and the charger cable head but is not to bad just pull the cord like normal andtouch the handle after use because the plastic body can get kinda hot but not stove top hot but i havent had it on to long also it cooks fast so overallspeed of heating up - 10/10plug 4/5 the cord heating conerns me but hasnt started a firecolor- is a slightly lighter shade but that could be lighting when they took the photo otherwise is pink 4.8/5overall use - 5/5no complaints here expect is plastic but ehhhh and the main one is not portable like advertisted i just bought a bright pink plastic kettleis cute #barbie lifei hope this helps happy shopping
"Consistent horrible after taste, and maybe smell. I tried for weeks to remove it. Different cleaner, vinegar, baking soda, but nothing helped. I finally decided to return it and simply got my money back, so I kept trying some more, but still taste remained after over a month of cleaning.It works great for boiling water, I just can't drink it afterwards."
"Cheap kettle, does exactly what you'd expect. Very annoying to use, though. The LED that's supposed to indicate if the kettle is on is very faint and is white, the same color as the switch. The top is very hard to open--the button mechanism only works as intended maybe a quarter of the time, otherwise it takes a lot of fiddling to get open. A good budget option if you just need a kettle, but if you can spend a few more dollars on something less annoying, you should.Pros: Huge capacity, under $20 at time of writing, boils waterCons: Useless LED indicator, very hard to open, overall annoying to use"
"It boils water. Unfortunately I can no longer open the top because it gets stuck. It's one of those press and it pops open. I press the button and it doesn't release so I have to try to hold the button while using my nails to get into the seal to get it open. My grandparents are having a hard time with it so they have to use a spoon to get it open. Will have to find a new one, and im probably going to go brand instead. Really upset I can't return anymore."
"it works fine, but I can’t get it to stop smelling like plastic. It makes my tea taste like plastic. Also, the plug is extremely short. Might return it."
When boiling water I noticed some plastic flakes off of the thing and I had to boil water multiple different times to stop that.
"Kettle boils water quickly, however, after a few weeks use, the light on the on/off switch no longer comes on. Other people have noted this as well. You can HEAR when the kettle turns off bit having the light made it more convenient and that feature is now gone."
"This kettle doesn't turn off on its own, must turn off or it will keep heating up"
"UPDATE June 10, 2018--Final assessment: Downgraded to 2 stars!Well you can certainly say I've given this kettle a fighting chance. I ordered my first one in August 2015. It lasted 8 months. I called the seller, and they gladly sent a replacement. While I was waiting for the replacement, I bought a second one to keep as a spare.Both the replacement and the new kettle broke within the next year or so. One was replaced free, but they wanted $10 shipping fee for the other, because it had been over a year. I paid it, but when the next one broke, I demanded free replacement, threatening to write a withering review if they did not do so. I got the free replacement, but that just broke. I had one spare left, and that lasted all of three days. That's five altogether, or maybe six--all toast!Well that gives you the idea. They are cheap; they are nice when they work; and they all break within a year or so, sometimes much less. Oh, and we boil water in it about four times a day most days-- for morning coffee and tea, and same in the afternoon. That's not light use, but a previous one (no longer made by Braun) lasted over 10 years at that usage rate.See below for the experience documented. I'm now shopping for a different brand.UPDATE June 18, 2017: I am upgrading to four stars. After I found the phone number for the importer in California, my defective kettle was very swiftly replaced. The new one has performed flawlessly for over a year. We use the kettle about four to five times every day to make tea and French press coffee.The first kettle had a defective thermostat switch, so it either cut off too early, or prevented you from reheating. The new kettle no longer suffers from these problems. It is reliable although a little slower coming to a boil than my old Braun that is no longer manufactured.UPDATE March 4, 2016: I've owned the kettle for over 6 months now, and am becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the fact that you cannot boil a second kettle of water without waiting at least 10 minutes for the kettle cool. You also cannot reheat an already boiled kettle without a long wait. Otherwise, the switch simply resets to off as soon as you release it--no matter how long you hold it down.It recently occurred to me that I may have gotten a defective kettle. So I decided to try to contact customer support. But every online link that I can find to Ovente defaults to a page called Magento, which reads ""There has been an error processing your request."" If anyone can help me with a valid address for their customer support, I would appreciate it. I'm wondering if they are out of business?Pros:--Well balanced--Nice looking--Great priceCons:--Slow: 7 minutes to bring 1 liter of cold water to a boil--You have to wait 4 to 6 minutes before switch will engage again to boil a second pot.Comments: My Braun 1500-watt electric kettle finally gave out after 12 years. This kettle is only 1000 watts. That means only 2/3 as much power, and 1.5 times longer to boil the same amount of water. The difference is noticeable. The old Braun also didn't have this annoying feature of thermal delay. No waiting to boil a second pot. Unfortunately they don't make them anymore."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I can say that it is a good electric kettle hot, but it takes a while to heat a large amount of water. It took about 8 minutes to boil the water. I have another one from Amazon that boils faster.But for the price, I can say that it does its job. The design is beautiful and easy to use."
I bought this product in August 2024 and before October 2024 these spots that look like mold started to appear. I’ve tried washing them off but they only smudge and do not go away completely even after boiling water. I used this kettle everyday including twice a day and would leave it empty and open to dry between uses. It’s convenient and cheap but unfortunately did not last long at all.
"We bought our electric kettle on Feb 7 of this year. We have enjoyed using it, and like the capacity.However, today I sadly found it is leaking. It’s just the two of us adults. No one has dropped or done anything to damage the kettle. I guess I’m going to have to try a new replacement. At least the price is reasonable. Fingers crossed!"
"A sleek look, a  pretty color and an automatic shut off; that's all I like about this kettle. It was on sale at a low price, or I would have returned it. The kettle is separate from the heating element,so you have to take it off, then reattach it, every time you use it.When filled to the water line it's heavy and not well balanced. A senior might have a hard time lifting it with one hand,and hot steam escapes from the lid when pouring. The cord to the electric base is thick and doesn't coil well, so it's hard to store out of the way. It's just a poorly designed piece of equipment."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I boiled water twice in this kettle, and it emitted a toxic plastic smell that was quite strong. I opened it up and on the bottom of the inside are several round spots that look like mold, but I have no idea what they are. See the video."
Product's appearance was exact.  The water did take longer to boil than stated.I was disappinted with the packaging of the product.Not a 5 star!It arrived at my doorstep in the manufacturer's box.  I always receive my Amazon orders packed in Amazon boxes.  The box is not strong so definitely needed a stronger box to protect the product!
"I love this kettle.  I use it every day several times a day and it has held up extremely well.The kettle is a large 1.7 liter kettle, which is approximately 9 cups.  I have a 6 cup tea pot which I can easily fill from this kettle.  Keep in mind this is a big kettle.  If you have a small kitchen, or don't have a lot of counter space or storage, it might be too big for you.  I was a little surprised when I saw how large it really was.The kettle is made of a very sturdy plastic which I think should last a pretty long time.  When I first received the kettle it had a very strong plastic odor.  I followed the instructions to use it with vinegar and water first and then clean it. It took several boilings and cleanings for the smell to dissipate.  I was getting a little concerned but eventually the smell went away and I was able to use the kettle.The handle is comfortable and stays cool to the touch.  A rubber grip would have been nice, but for the price a plastic handle is acceptable.The lid snaps into place while boiling, and opens with a push of the button.  I like how easy it is to fill, my last kettle required you to fill from the spout which was not always easy.  The side window has clear markings for .5, 1.0 and 1.7 Liters.  I wish it had more graduations in the markings since I use just between 1.0 and 1.7 liters.  Sometimes I overfill, and sometimes I under fill.The kettle does take longer to boil than many of the smaller kettles I have owned.  This may be due to the size, or maybe the heating element is just not as strong.  It's not horrible by any means, and I've adjusted to the amount of time it takes, but it would have been nice if it were just a little quicker.  I also like that both the switch and the water light up blue while it is in operation.  This allows me to easily look over to see if it's still boiling or if it is finished. If you are not a fan of blue lights, there is no way to turn it off.The base is very wide and sturdy and should not tip over.  The kettle just drops onto it very easily.  The cord has plenty of length, and is very thick which is good for durability, but makes it kind of stiff.  This makes it difficult to wrap it up and tuck it out of the way.  I use it so much that it's not going to be put away, but it may be an issue for others.If I had to purchase another one, I would probably upgrade to the stainless steel version, just because I'm not a big fan of boiling water in plastic.  Overall though I think you just can't go wrong for the price of this kettle.10/28/2017 UPDATE: I have started to develop a serious problem with the electrical connections between the base and the kettle.  This started about 3 months ago, the kettle would not turn on, and I would have to clean all the electrical contacts on both the base and the kettle before it would make a proper connection.  When it first started it wasn't happening very often and the cleaning helped, now 3 months later no matter what I do the kettle will not start.  I believe the metal on one of the spring clips has fatigued to the point that it will no longer make a solid connection.I guess I will have to start looking for a new kettle. It lasted almost 2 years, but honestly I had hoped it would have lasted longer.  My last kettle lasted close to 10 years.  For this reason I can no longer recommend this electric kettle."
Difficult to remove from the base otherwise does its job.
"I use my kettle daily, I remember this one not having a long life span and being disappointed with it.The speed was okay, and cleaning it wasnt the best due to the small top. On the other hand the size and portability was nice I guess."
"I've owned this in brown color now exactly ten months and today I am replacing it.  Its not working. As much as I can bang on it and play with it, its gone.  Rest in peace. That said, it was selected because it met all of my criteria: 1100 watts instead of 1500 or 1800 or more.  It was just about as quick as my Kalorik which also died (so it was a couple of years from the same causes but it cost much more). It was cordless off the base and it handled more than a litre of water at a time. I don't think there was anything I could do to make it stay longer. I was gentle with removing it and setting it back down on it base each and every time. I figured that maybe I was a little rougher with my Kalorik.  I recommend it for the cheap price.  10 months at this price is still more functional than three years on the Kalorik. Experience tells me:I thought the pin went on the first one and really, just because you can revive it once or ten times...just know its gone already.  So it was it did not turn on its blue light and I studied underneath. Lo and behold the pin was loose.  But there was a more subtle clue I think.  The water seemed to boil longer and hotter than before.  I think the thermostat or something else compromised that entire assembly with the pin.  Like I said, I was always delicate with setting and removing from base.  I am disabled so I am usually in the kitchen if I turn on the kettle and remain there.  It seems that I could actually turn it off earlier each time.  You may be on the go and so I would say its still a good product.  Basic, auto-off, economic wattage can handle an older home or small bedroom...my favorite electronic light color in blue. In fact, its easier to make some Nescafe. That coming from a coffee snob. :)"
There are $99 kettles and $19 ones.You get what you pay for.This boils slowly and takes time.Lightweight which means not a heavy base.Easily can be moved about.Overall not exactly satisfied.
I liked it a lot so after the first one broke I bought a second one which also broke. The top that flips open is not very durable at all.
"I love this product; however, it was delivered with the box partially open. There was no tape on the box and the kettle almost fell out and hit the ground."
"I've been needing a new Kettle, the lid to the one that's been servicing me well broke unfortunately.This was cheaper and looked quite nice, and the reviews for it were splendid, and it looked a decent size as well.However upon arrival I noticed the bottom of the box was super flimsy.(take note)Once I opened it I noticed the bottom part that's supposed to heat the kettle up was not even in the box, I got an electric kettle... without the electric part.Funny enough, the protective baggy that I assume it was suppose to be in was there, but not the thing it was suppose to be protecting -As of writing this I've already issued a refund and return.All I really need to say is, the box it was in did not do its job."
straight out of the box this had spots that look like mold. unsure if this was used before and returned (i did NOT pick a used option). shady stuff
"I like it a lot better than the Amazon Basics kettle, but I should have looked at the wattage. This one is noticeably slower than my Hamilton Beach and costs more."
Way too slow to heat water.  This has low wattage.This has been returned and I have purchased a higher wattage tea kettle
I thought this would be a rapid boil system but it takes 3-4 minutes for it to really boil. I thought this was a 2 min boil kettle but its not. It’s slower than heating water on the stove so I really think this is not amazing.
"how the item was sent.  It was sent in a way that it looked as though the item had been opened , as though it was returned by someone and sent to another customer.  The outside packaging was not taped or sealed in a way to make it appear as though I was the first person to open the item I was not pleaseed with that.  I'm sending it back and I will reorder to see how the item comes the next time."
I ordered this in August and JUST opened it… I cannot use it as it is somehow MISSING THE BOTTOM and plug!!  I only have the kettle!!! No way to actually USE it… so I wasted $$ and now have to buy ANOTHER one…
"As I get more worried about plastic, I’ve decided I would not recommend this plastic one, but I would recommend the stainless steel one."
Long time to heat compared to other brands but I guess you get what you pay for
Was delivered without the base so I was unable to use it. Luckily I was able to receive a full refund
"This kettle works as it should but the opening on top is TOO SMALL. It is very difficult to clean. I only put water in mine but due to the heating, there is sediment - white flakes and residue -  that accumulates on the bottom and sides. It needs to be scrubbed out but the narrow opening makes that tough. I'd prefer a different design."
"Within about a month of getting the kettle, we noticed that it has a tendency to turn on by itself, which is quite alarming. The issue seems to be that when the kettle completes the heating cycle, the button to heat the water doesn't get automatically reset, instead remaining in the 'On' position. Ok, not the end of the world, just something to watch out for. However, today and about 3-4 months after buying the kettle, the light no longer turns on when the heater is turned on to indicate that it's working. So now it becomes necessary to turn it on and then watch it for a bit to see that it's working. So enough is enough, this kettle is going into the trash can, would not recommend to anyone else - unreliable and potentially dangerous."
"I didnt read it all the way I guess, if I knew it was plastic I wouldn’t have purchased. plastic and hot water is not good. please don’t use. you’re adding so many chemicals to your body when the hot water melts from the hot water and it’s really not healthy.it does heat up very fast."
Its very hard to open for filling
"Ok, sometimes you gripe on Amazon because it's there. I like hot tea, and I drink it all day while I'm working at my desk. For twenty years I made it in the obvious fashion, heating water in a stainless steel tea kettle on the stove. The recipe is not rocket science. Then the Chinese took over the business. Try finding a tea kettle, at any price, that wasn't made in China. And apart from the problems of suspicious metals they allow in their stainless, the fact is that they're junk. Price point doesn't matter here - they're garbage. Three in a row literally fell apart on me, one dropping onto the stove and splashing boiling water everywhere while the handle remained in my hand. Improper welds. Ok. I gave up in despair and turned to these electric pots. I've used them a lot in my RV as well as in Europe, where they love them. I don't really. Yes, they're quick, but it's another appliance taking up limited counter space, and they're annoying to clean. Really annoying, because there are so many places you're not supposed to get wet, and you're never quite sure which ones they are. Also the lime buildup here in Indiana is a pain, and requires constant soaking with vinegar.So, I bought a Rival, and it was all right. Lasted about a year, which is all you're going to get out of one of these. When I tried to replace it, the Rival was gone, except for one that comes in ""environmental"" packaging. Translation - it's been used or returned and no one bothered to box it up again. They just shove it out the door. After all, if these people really cared about the environment, they wouldn't make crap like this that fills the landfills when it dies. Anyway, I tried this brand. After all, they're doubtless all Chinese anyway, so what's in a brand name? And I was a sucker for the blue light. I love blue light. And the blue light did work. It was really pretty. But after going through the odious task of carefully washing the thing, I filled it, plugged it in, and returned ten minutes later to find half the water all over the countertop and the floor. I let out a yelp, and my husband stepped in to unplug it. When he lifted it off the base, the pot was leaking like a sieve. I couldn't quite believe it, nor can I figure out how it happened. I sure as hell didn't do anything I haven't done to the five or six of these I've owned and used over the years.So now, I've actually been reduced to boiling tea water in an old pan on the stove. Yes, sooner or later, it's going to catch up with me. Sooner or later, I'm going to forget it's boiling, and it's going to boil dry and cause a minor disaster. But I've just had it with all of this, with it becoming impossible to boil water! I've watched the Walmart Chinese and their sub-minions in the underpaid East wreck one business after another with their crappy imports, from cotton underwear that falls apart after one washing to phony Native American turquoise jewelry that viciously wrecks their fragile economy. And all of my friends wonder why people went out in hoards and voted for Trump."
Product doesn't even sit on the base properly.
"Yes, I knew it would be cheap feeling at this price. My stars are not based on that.1) It’s made of plastic, but the cord is so thick, the base doesn’t stay in place unless in a very specific position. So annoying. Way more annoying than I ever would’ve thought.2) The button release on the top to open is crap. Thing hardly opens without me having to assist it open with my other hand.These two things are so annoying it warrants 3 stars. If you take quality into consideration, I’d say 2, but it was cheap and what should I expect there?Only reason I tried it was based on reviews. Our old one broke and was metal, just a nice pot. It’s not made anymore. Wish I would’ve spent $60 and just got the nicer pot. I’m sure this one will break soon enough with how the rest of it works."
"I love that this pot is lighted  while its heating. It is a bit slow...maybe because  the body is plastic. Its so cute and serves its purpose  at work in the nurses lounge at the VA. Oh, and it shuts itself  off  too."
"I have really loved this product! However, the bottom of it cracked after just a couple of months. It might just be this one so I'd love a replacement to try it again as this one has worked so well for us."
There is heavy plastic smell every time we used it. We thought it will go away but it did not. It can not be healthy to use! Otherwise it looks great and works well. Glass pot is the ONLY way to go!
Get what you pay for. Takes longer than just boiling water on the stove. Outside gets too hot to touch. Overall not worth it. Would have returned but threw the box out
"I originally loved this kettle but after only a few months & after the return period of course, it only works sporadically so when it won’t turn, I have to heat my water in the microwave which is frustrating."
"UPDATE:  In less than three months one of the kettles I got has failed.  I suspect the temperature switch has failed as it just stopped turning boiling water and the blue led doesn't come on.  The switch doesn't feel like it is going to the on position all the way... like a tripped circuit breaker.  Out of Amazon return period, but I'm hoping Ovente sees this and can help out.Original review. I got one of these for my house and one for school where I work after taking my cheap $12 one to the school I teach at and a student left it plugged in and turned on high overnight... melting it down.  I wanted the auto shutoff function and it works.  It would be nice if it beeped or something for a few seconds when it does so, so you don't forget the hot water until it cools down again, but it heats 1.5 liters in about 10 minutes from cold tapwater and way faster at the minimum fill mark.I very much like not having the heater directly exposed to the water, although it might heat a wee bit quicker if it did.  The blue light is nice to see that it is on and heating.The cordless part where you can pick up the container and not have to unplug it's base in order to move around and pour is good design although the instructions warn you to not get water anywhere on this thing.The pour spout is much better than the previous water heater I owned which would tend to send boiling hot water everywhere if you poured just a bit too fast.  You can tip this pretty much as far as you want and it doesn't send water anywhere you don't want it.A perfect 5 out of 7 :)"
"This is a mighty little kettle.  I don’t know why I said little… I can hear quite a bit of water in one go!  That being said, it’s been working for me for about three years.  It heats the water quickly and safely, and you don’t have to do anything other than listen for the switch to flip off once the water reaches boiling.  It has served me faithfully for three years… and now it’s dead.  $15, that’s hard to beat, but still, I’d expect it to last a lot longer than that, considering one of the info points boasts a long life for the product.  You can’t control the temperature output at all, but I didn’t expect that as a feature anyway.  I wanted one thing… boil water quick.  And that’s what it does.  Until it dies.  For some that’s reported as a few months.  For me, that was three years.  I might try another one… but maybe I’ll try a different brand.  We’ll see"
"Update: For everyone saying yOu JusT HaVE To ClEaN It and the smell goes away, I would LOVE to know how you cleaned yours. In order I: gave it a cursory rinse with hot water and soap, boiled water, poured the Urnex blue coffee pot cleaner in, let it sit for an hour, rinsed it out, boiled water, still smelled and tasted like plastic. Did about half and half vinegar and water, boiled that, let it sit over night, rinsed it out, boiled another pot of water, still tasted and smelled like plastic. Used citric acid in a boiled pot of water, let that sit for a few hours, rinsed it out and boiled another pot of water, STILL tasted and smelled like plastic. Boiled water and put baking soda in and let that sit for a few hours, rinsed it out boiled another pot and it still still still still tasted like plastic. I did the baking soda thing twice and I'm done with this. Over all I've boiled about 10 pots of water (some I started and then forgot about putting a solution in and then had to boil it again because it had gone cold) with assorted cleaners of all kinds and it is reeks and tasted like plastic. So I would dearly love to know what everyone else is doing that I haven't done. Returned for a refund. Just get glass instead, this pot is the worst.I'm on my last try with this to get the plastic taste out of the water. I bought this because my boss has one that she's had for a while and it works great. Mine however still has new plastic taste and I've tried everything to get it out. So three stars because I've seen how good this pot can be. If I can't get the plastic taste out then it's getting a one star and being returned. If I can I'll update to four (sans one for all the hassle) and post about how I finally got it out."
"I'm thoroughly disappointed. This electric kettle is lightweight plastic. The heating pad is also lightweight plastic. It has a heavy-duty electrical cord, so that's a plus. However, the thin plastic carafe will not preserve the heat for very long. I'm not sending it back, however, as it replaces a kettle that has a leak at the top band  and I'm tired of dripping all over the counter or floor when I pour water. This will be useful until I can get a better quality replacement (as in metal carafe), and then I'll donate it to the thrift store. Not recommended."
"Very inconvenient to pour water - overflows through the lid. Noisy, long time for boiling. Maybe I should not expect a lot from such price"
"So, I got this yesterday afternoon. I washed it and decided to try it out and make hot chocolate for my kiddos. The cord is thick and a little difficult to manage but the kettle heats up very quickly and stays warm after shutting off for a very decent amount of time.After drinking, it tasted of plastic. I soaked in vinegar and washed again but the plastic smell and taste is still there. I will use it a few more times to see if it helps to determine whether I return it or not!"
"This is the second product I have purchased from Elite Gourmet, and what I have realized about the company is that they produce cheaply designed products that look decent on the outside, but craftsmanship is lacking. In other words: It looks nice, but it does not perform well and will not stand the test of time.I will not return this item, but I would also not advise paying more than $35.00 USD for it. This entry-level electric tea kettle works as advertised, but it looks cheap, feels cheap. The kettle is very difficult to place on the base. This is a design flaw; there is no taper to guide the bottom of the kettle into the heating element. I suspect most people will find this to be the most annoying part about owning this electric tea kettle. It makes it difficult to use.The instructions specify that the exterior of the kettle 'must never get wet', and when you take the lid off after heating water, water will inevitably drip on the side. So, have a towel handy for when you wish to heat up a second pot. The instructions also refer to a 'minimum water level' line, and there is no such line, there is only a 'max' line, which is inside the pot and difficult to see.The control knob is very stiff and overall feels cheap. The preset temperatures are a nice feature.Moderately satisfied with the purchase, but I would not recommend this product to others for the aforementioned reasons. If looking for an inexpensive electric tea kettle, I would look for one that is easy to place on the base (which is difficult to do, when shopping online)."
"I liked the size. I don't like that it DOESN'T SHUT OFF automatically when water comes to a boil, but stays ON for much longer before it shuts off. That means I have to stay close by and watch it!! I didn't return it right away, because I boil some eggs in it at work, so this works out ok for me by not shutting off right away! But for just boiling water - it would be a nuisance"
"I got this during a prime day sale- it was roughly $30. I was a little skeptical based off other reviews but I needed something to replace my Govee kettle that began to malfunction after 2 years and figured it was worth trying. Disclosure- I also purchased the Stagg Kettle during the sale but was having a hard time swallowing the cost. There were some jagged pieces of metal on the spout that needed pulled off, after 3 uses it began to get spots in the bottom, I also wasn't a fan of the constant beeping (it can be muted but needed to be everytime it was turned on), and the construction of the lid on the inside was a single screw that I would imagine would begin to rust in no time from all the condensation. Overall it was functional with some corks with the temps but I returned it because I just didnt see it lasting even a yr..."
"It looks good, but has several problems:1. It has a plastic lid interior. The idea of heating plastic so hot repeatedly over steam is a recipe for disaster.2. The knob is quite cheap -- I expected a smooth turn but instead, it's a cheap plastic dial that clicks.3. Can't configure default temp -- I reached out to their customer service but didn't hear back by the time of their review. I make matcha in the morning and want it at 80°. So I have to dial it in every day.4. Something I can live with but it gets quite hot when boiling -- I was spoiled by my last kettle that was warm from the water itself not necessarily conducting the heat to boil the water the way this metal does.Ultimately I chose to return it to see if I can get something else that serves my needs better."
"I'm happy so far with this wireless tea kettle. The main reason and MOST Important reason I purchased it, was the safety that once the water is heated .. that outside the kettle won't be just as incredibly hot enough to burn your skin off.This kettle is double walled insulated & Very Safe enough to touch it on the outside of it.HOWEVER, there are two issues that is not pleasant#1: The light should stay on to let you know that the kettle is still hot (then shut off once the temperature is low enough then the light should shut off. LOL.. don't know if a Electric tea kettle like this exists)#2: Is the Loudness ... and I mean LOUD (From where my kitchen is from my bedroom with my door closed, I can still hear the kettle heating the water 🤣) So, if you don't mind the noise ... this is a great buy."
"It is extremely noisy.You have to pour it slowly or hot water goes in many different direction.But it is a lot less expensive than most kettles so if you don't mind the noise, it is a good choice."
"I have had this kettle for about a year, boiling water 2-3 times each day.Like: Stainless steel interior, no plastic touching waterDislike (minor): It takes 8 minutes or so for a full pot to boil, about 2 minutes longer than my Hamilton oneDislike (major): The spout has a design problem. It doesn't support precise pouring. No matter how careful I am when pouring water out of it, there is always water that drips to the surface below when the kettle is more than half full, creating a small puddle of water that I need to wipe off. This can be dangerous with boiling water as I was scalded a few times when I was not careful."
It was a very nice teapot until it stopped working in less than a year.
The kettle boils quickly but appears to leak a small amount when I use it.
"It sounds like a jet engine, but it boils water."
"Just received kettle today. I knew this was an inexpensive kettle, but still disappointed. The kettle auto shut off does not work, the kettle base wobbles on the counter, even when full kettle is on it—and when filled to the max fill line and water starts to boil, kettle bounces around A LOT.The lid does not open when I press the button, and the little plastic”catch” seems small and fragile. To open, while pushing the button I have to open the lid manually. The handle is thicker than is comfortable for me, but because the outside of the kettle does not get really hot, just warm, I can support the kettle with my other hand.All of that said, I do like the larger capacity, the not hot exterior (it does get a bit warm), and the metal interior of the kettle.I don’t expect this kettle to last very long, but at least it was only $20. Hopefully it will last long enough to get me through until I find a good replacement for my very expensive kettle that just died after 10 plus years."
"It works fine to boil water quickly and easily. I really wanted to like this item but think there are some design issues after using daily over 2 months. Although I thought I would get used to it, it always go against my intuitions. Lots of containers of this kind have a lid opening button on the handle where thumb can reach easily and naturally. But for this one, the thumb-reaching button is to turn on the switch to start boiling the water. The lid has to be opened by pulling the flimsy notch on top of the lid. Also, the base where you put the pot to boil water has a round rim, which doesn’t give you a steady feel that you placed the pot on an even surface but on a rather wobbly plane. It does the job fine, but I replaced mine with another kind that doesn’t give me “oh, wrong button again” feeling."
"I purchased this for my family, with someone using it most days of the week. It worked well but stopped working after about 10 months"
You have to push the top button many times for it to open. When the water is getting hot the kettle is very loud. Water does not stay warm for more than an hour.
"A hairline crack appeared in the glass after 14 months of use.  Unfortunately, the warranty is 12 months. Looks and works great.  Good price so I'll probably buy another one."
This is how my box arrived. Completely open. Product does not seem damaged.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I liked the compact size which is why I purchased it.When you first put this together you will find the base is very lightweight and cannot cope with the thick power cord. There is a small arched opening on the side of the base where the cord is supposed to fit through but it doesn’t stay in place. The cord pushes the base upwards. This means the base doesn’t lay flat on the countertop, even when you put the kettle on top, the whole thing tilts upwards. Give it a bit of time (10-15 minutes ) the cord does become a bit more flexible and the base will start to settle.Following instructions to wipe down the outside and inside of the kettle, I had difficulty fitting my hand inside to do this. Boiled the first batch of water per setup instructions and when pouring out the boiled water, found the handle is hot towards the base because of steam or heat escaping through the seam in the handle.To open the lid means you have to reach over the power switch and it’s easy to accidentally turn it on. I found I needed to steady the kettle with one hand on the handle and open the lid release with the other hand. Very easy for your hand to touch hot glass doing this if you are boiling a second batch.Kettle does not slot in place fully or lock to base so wobbles. All in all it’s functional but I decided to return and get something sturdier and safer. After all we are dealing with boiling water here as the main function of this appliance."
"UPDATE:  Six months later . . . The black finish is wearing off at the opening where the lid fits in. Chipping off by bits. The cord is so stiff that in addition to the duct tape I also had to place a rubber grippy shelf liner under it to help keep it in place on the counter.  And it still twists on the counter.It heats the water, it's fast 5 - 6 minutes, BUT the cord is too stiff, inflexible.  The cord clip to hold it in the channel underneath is worthless.  It won't lock the cord in place, I had to resort to duct tape.  Without the duct tape the pot pivots on the counter because the cord is too stiff.  I realize the unit is 1500w and somebody, somewhere in their rigid vision decided this was necessary . . . . however, I have other 1500w appliances that don't have this bully cord."
The size
Product came in damaged box as if it was used
"The stupid lid has a filter in the spout area that lifts with the lid (attached) and blocks being able to fill the kettle, always spilling water all over trying to fill it, till I finally broke off the damn lid at the hinge so it can be completely removed to be able to fill the kettle. Someone didn't think this design through...Otherwise, the kettle heats water and shuts off properly (if you make sure to install the broken top so it can sense the steam."
"Looks like it’d be more study from the images , but isn’t made with quality materials. I thought it was supposed to be cordless but is not which could be my mistake. Would prefer a stovetop kettle over this"
Boils water fine. Lid/lip is awkwardly small. It doesn't fold as far as it needs to. Designed like a rigid coffee machine.
"The goose neck, variable temperature and hold temperature features are nice; however, it stopped working after only 4 months. It turns on and you can set the temperature but the water doesn’t heat up.I looked into support and there’s zero. So, there’s some chance you’ll end up with a lemon - other than that it was a fine product."
"I know this kettle is on the less expensive side, but I didn’t expect it to die after 14 months. I’ve always had it plugged in to a surge protector, so I doubt my electric is the issue. I really liked it for the time that it did function though; it heated water quickly and never malfunctioned."
"This insulated pot is a bargain at this price. Often these products are at least triple the price. The pot works, heats a pot of water in just a few minutes, and holds onto the heat for about two hours without using any additional electricity.However, there are some issues. For one, there's a sharp edge under the spout where the sheet metal was left raw. Normally these sharp edges of sheet metal are rolled over or covered with plastic during the manufacturing process.Also it tends to boil over easily and dribbles water down the front, so you have to take some care, or you'll end up with water all over your kitchen.Maybe the biggest issue, there's apparently a fault thats allowing water to reach the electrical components. I suspect it's not sealed internally. The pot trips GFCI, so it may not be safe to handle while plugged in. If you assume the entire pot is electrified whenever the plug is in and carefully remove the plug immediately after boiling, you probably won't get electrocuted.Overall, a bargain if you are willing to accept some problems, but I'd probably not repurchase."
I’m not a big fan of this kettle. The lid doesn’t open all the way so cleaning the kettle is difficult  Also when the kettle is tilted forward to pour the hot steam burns your hand.
"At it's core, this does its job and well. It heats water, it does so quickly enough, and it pours it out. For those reasons, I'm relatively happy. But it has some key design flaws.For one, the base is impossible to keep flat on the counter without being weighed down, as the very thick power cord attached af an angle underneath and then loops through a side gap with nothing keeping it there. So you can't just keep this on your counter without the pot on top of it. Looks awful and flops around.And then the pot itself is impossible to open one-handed. I could almost consider this a safety feature, except you only need to open it to fill it, which means it won't be full of scalding water. The release is far from the handle, requires a lot of pressure, and then the angle by which the entire thing pulls open (no spring) isn't possible with the same thumb if you managed to stretch it that far. And the hinge is very tight, so it's awkward even to open with two hands.I guess you get what you pay for, but I've paid similar amounts for kettles that had neither of these design flaws. I'll likely replace this one with such a unit soon."
"Like: the look. Its a visually pleasing design.Like: black.Like: boils water fastNot like: NoisyNot like: the push button lock for the lid is not on the handle, its on the top of the lid. I find this awkward and a potential scalding issue.  Also, the fitment of the push button is off. It always remains a little depressed. I really don't know if its fully locked or not. With boiling hot water, that could be a safety concern."
I got this kettle and i used it for 5 months an i see this is not working and whenever i tried to power in the power socket is tipped and i tried with other device and it is working fine. this company said they provide an year warranty but no response
Breaks easy after 6 months.
"The Kettle itself overall is good quality. The only problem that I have with it is the button you  push to open the lid. It is forever sticking. I realize it is a safety feature but if you don't push it in just the right place, (which moves) it won't open. Very frustreating."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I purchased two of these, one for work, and one for my home.I like the look of it and that it is fairly inexpensive, but it is too loud for me.  I am not sure if mine is defective, or this is what it supposed to sound like. I am returning it. Too bad, I wanted an electric kettle. I will be keeping the one I purchased for work only because I don't have to listen to it, and everyone is excited about finally having a way to make tea."
"No amount of washing or boiling will get rid of the strong plastic smell and taste. Other than that, it works perfectly"
"In my search for a plastic free kettle I had high hopes this was the one!The kettle performs well in terms of heating efficiency and ease of use however the lid is NOT #304 stainless steel as advertised in the additional features section of the about this item, which is very misleading since it is 100% plastic. Given that hot water can cause plastic to leech chemicals into the water and it is not as advertised I'll be returning this item.If that doesn't bother you, the kettle is very simple to use, easy controls, nice simple display with intuitive buttons. The base doesn't take up to much space and looks great with an easy to pour feel.  The lid does heat up quite a bit if you boil water at the 212° so be careful if you attempt to touch refill the kettle for those back to back meeting days.It's a nice lightweight kettle that holds a decent amount of water but it's not for us with the plastic interior lid component."
"Starting with the good first, I like the large capacity and portability along with how quickly it heats up. It's very attractive and pors well.My main complaints are that it is extremely loud for the first two minutes, then goes to just kinda loud. Also the water cools down too quickly in my opinion. I'd recommend something more quiet and more insulated."
Faster to boil on stove
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            When I pulled it out to find the handle was plastic, I was bummed. It’s advertised as stainless steel and looks very nice in photos. But even the handle, a hollow piece of plastic, was not nearly as obnoxious as the fact that the pot would not sit flatly on the base.I added a video here so you can see. No matter what I did, the pot would not sit flush with the base. I tried rotating it, I tried pushing down a bit, and no matter what, the pot was always off at a slight angle, rattling around.Maybe it would’ve functioned even with the wobbliness, but I didn’t want to find out. Seems like a hazard. Even if the connection worked fine and the water heated, metal touching metal, wobbling around for extended time with unnecessary friction, will inevitably wear the pieces down.Pretty disappointed. The first one of these I ordered came used in a beat up box, even though I selected full price rather than the used price. So I got a replacement, just to have a faulty on delivered.Time to look elsewhere."
I really liked this kettle.  Unfortunately it leaked with 2 weeks of use.
"I bought this because it’s affordable, and that mattered. It works well, but the base is light weight and slides around, plus the power switch tab is chintzy plastic and feels like it will break in no time. I’ve had it for a month or so now, using irregularly, and so far it is working fine."
"this is okay.  heats the water quick.  however, very very noisy."
Used my hot water kettle this morning. Left it plugged in and empty and OFF. Two hours later I kept hearing popping sounds. Found the kettle was super hot and off! Put water in kettle and it sizzled. So unplug when not using and definitely do not leave it empty and off.
"I like that there’s no plastic inside of the kettle itself and that the inside lid is also stainless steel; however, I’ve experienced some problems with the automatic shutoff. Even when you fill water below the max fill line, it’ll still overflow so I have to stand by to turn off the switch so it doesn’t get to that point. I reached out to their customer service team which still hasn’t provided a solution to the problem. It’s a cheaply made product that I wouldn’t buy again."
"i purchased this pot October 2022. June 2024 I sent Elite Gourmet this message >“Dangerous Issue-We have enjoyed using this product since our purchase. Last week it stopped turning off automatically while we were out of the house. We had forgotten that we left it on. When we returned home, it was too hot to touch so we pulled the plug. I am glad we were not gone for a long time because it may have caused a fire. I don't know. I was going to leave a ""Dangerous"" review but though it be best to instead let you know of this issue. Has there been a recall? Anyway, if you could find it in your best interest to replace our pot, we would appreciate that gesture.”It took them 2weeks to answer my comment. Here is copy/paste of their messag>“ Hello, Thank you for contacting us, I do apologize for the inconvenience. We advise that the unit be unplugged after every use, this is also noted in the manual safeguards.

"Ok far  as electric water kettles go,  I'm sure it's as good as any.I thought I could use this to heat milk for my coffee truck on days we needed the extra (hot cocoa request days mainly).I know- not what it was intended. But I thought, it's liquid...The milk did not get hot at all...but it did scorch the milk on the bottom. I tried it as intended with water and it worked just fine. Who knew?!I thought there may be someone else wondering if it would work for something besides water."
"I have had it for a while using , I hate that you have the one switch at the base and it’s so loud and feels cheap"
It’s a pretty good product. Unfortunately it only lasted a year with everyday use. Would not buy again
"I find this product to be flimsy at best. Sure it looks nice with the color blue but shows how long it takes to heat up, which, is about 15 minutes when the water is at the water line for total amount of water you can put in it. The water line is half way of the total kettle.The base and kettle do not sit tight to one another.I would return it but I put some money into it so I’ll keep it."
"I was disappointed with this lovely kettle when it would not open quickly and consistently with pressure on the button to push in. Also, I didn't realize from the picture, how small the top opening is for cleaning. I need to comfortably get my whole hand into something like this, and with the lid in the way, that just wasn't going to happen."
"This water heater performs its basic function - your water will be hot. It is very loud when it operates. It also doesn’t keep the water hot, and it doesn’t have a temperature adjustment. If any of these features are important to you you might be better off with a different option."
Looks nice and Warms up fairly quick but also fills the whole room up with steam. Underneath of my cabinet are dripping with water after every use. Doesn’t know when to shut off.  Could be a defective item but not sure but at this rate I’ll also need new cabinets
"While we love the features of this kettle, the paint around the lid has started chipping and we’ve only had it a month. We missed the return window by a few days so I guess we will keep it. If it didn’t chip, I’d give it 5 stars."
The item has died on me and I received it one April 3rd doesn’t last long obviously but I loved it while it was working
"I like the size and that it keeps water hot for a while.  However, I don't like the spout.  Pouring water out spills because the spout is too round.  I also noticed that the bottom of the kettle starts to change color.  It is just ok.  I can't use it anymore because it is very loud.  It sounds like a lawnmower!"
Product wouldn't turn on right out of the box. Very disappointing.
This electric water heater does not keep the water hot very long.  I have to keep turning it back on.
"It’s an electric teapot, or an electric water heater… It works as expected it boils quickly it’s small and compact for my tiny kitchen… I use it to heat water and oat milk… One part of it obviously the part that’s burned that photo was taken from the top down, heats up more than the rest of the heating area… I’m keeping it it does the job. The blue light is cool, and, of course, like any electric teapot, it has automatic shut off when I’m not standing there, waiting for a watched pot to boil…"
This does boil water so I like that.  But it's extremely loud as it's doing so and the lid sucks to open.  I passed the return window or would have done that - not recommended.
I loved this water kettle. The problem is it stopped working 14 days after I got it so I returned it was afraid to get another one because I didn’t want same problem.
"The Elite is smaller, and the base is not as robust as Mueller. The lid and spout is cheaply designed. Still the cost was cheaper. Makes a good Christmas present, but I have a new lid on the way from Mueller, and I have been very happy with it even though I broke the lid forcing it."
"I bought this to replace my old one. I used it only three times, after heating up water on the second use, my counter and the entire base of the kettle was soaked in hot water. I could not send it back to Amazon cause I had thrown out the box. (Understandable). So I contacted the manufacturer. They wanted a video of what was wrong with it. I told them that the unit leaked when heating up water. Anyone with common sense would know that this is not safe. I told them that it is not safe to continue using this product and that I would not send them a video. I finally got them to send me aReturn Authorization, but never got a responsewhen I asked if they were going to pay for the return shipping.shipping. This product is defective and I would not recommend this for anyone."
"This kettle seems to work ok, but I do have a few small things I don't like about it.1)  It dribbles when you pour it - the spot seems like it could use a re-design to pour better.2)  The full mark is hard to see on the inside of the pot.3)  It is noisier than my prior kettle."
Initally I thought this was a great product. It was quick to heat the water. We kept it plugged in all the time. Then about 6 months after purchase we came home to a funny smell and finally realized the plug outlet was melted where the pot was plugged in. We swapped plugs thinking it could have been something else. Then recently we were stading in the kitchen and the pot just turned on!! There was only minimal water in it and if we were not there it would have melted yet another outlet. I just don't think it is safe.
"This pot is so noisy, it sounds like an engine. Very disappointed in it. I think it's a reject."
It's a designed and manufactured poorly. Do3snt resemble the picture
It worked as described at first and then inexplicably it just stopped heating although everything else acted just the same. I even hear the small tic noise when it was trying to start the heating element. I spent an hour troubleshooting to no avail. My conclusion is that it is a very cheaply made small appliance and a waste of my money. Apparently the return window in very short because I was around the 10 week mark and no return option was available. The “get product support” option offered some obvious trouble shooting that I had already done. Not really “product support” - I will avoid the brand in the Elite Hoirmet brand in the future.
"Extremely loud, takes a long time to heat up, doesn't stay warm very long."
Boiled water gets cloudy after several uses and must be cleaned frequently.
"UPDATED REVIEW:I have now had this kettle for over 8 months. There are a few notes I'd like to add to my original review.~ Proposition 65 WARNING? I'm not sure what prompted this, but there is now a Proposition 65 warning when I attempted to re-purchase this kettle. I'm almost sure that it wasn't there before when I purchased it 8 months ago.~ Price increase: I bought this kettle for around $20. It's now over $40?! I would not re-purchase it at this new price.~ Quality comments:1. The filter at the spout got worn down over time. I ended up having to cut it off because it kept dangling when I was trying to pour water out, and I didn't want pieces of the filter to accidentally fall into my cup.2. Not a fan of the abundance of plastic on this thing. Although it advertises BPA-free plastic, I'm just not a fan of how the lid and spout filter is made of plastic. This would mean that your boiling water is touching plastic every time you use it (unless you open the lid before pouring).3. The kettle is supposed to automatically stop boiling when it reaches a certain point. This stopped working after 7-8 months, so my kettle just continued to boil until I realized it didn't stop, and I had to manually stop the kettle. I was given a replacement, but I wish that I was told about the Prop 65 Warning before the replacement was ordered.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this kettle. I'm currently looking for a fully stainless steel kettle in replacement of this one.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OLD REVIEW: It's a really great 1 liter kettle! Every other nice glass kettle I can find is < 1.5 liters and this is just perfect! It was the only one I could find which was aesthetically appealing and it works super well. The lid shouldn't be forced open so I would just be cautious and gentle with it. It lights up blue when heating and boils a liter of water in like 5 minutes it's so fast! 10/10 highly recommended."
"It literally split in the middle of using it to boil water for the first time. Thankfully, I was in the room at the time. Since I usually work remotely, I never had the opportunity to use it in the office before now. Unfortunately the return window is closed. Never purchasing this product again. I would have given it 0 star but it deserves 1 star because of the beautiful blue light while the kettle was ""alive"""
"Wouldn't purchase again. It's very sleek and heats quickly, but it's quite loud, and the push mechanism to open the lid is very finicky. Not being able to open a kettle to fill it is pretty much a deal-breaker ..."
The mesh can’t be removed. Very annoying. Also the way to open it is awful with the latch on the lid. Keep burning myself.
"For the price, this is a good kettle. Boils fast, and keep warm for quite long time"
I like the sleek appearance and the cost was good. It is noisy and can be heard in the other rooms of the house. If you lift the kettle before it shuts off you must manually push the down lever to turn off the base.
Does not really heat water beyond Luke warm. Is nice design and sturdy but does not do as described. Water never got hot enough for even tea!
Don't like the fact that the lid doesn't open far enough to easily fill.
The  on/off switch gets BURNING HOT and the handle gets too hot to holdDANGEROUS!!!
I've only had this for a little over a month and now the AUTO SHUT OFF is defective.  It continues to boil if unattended!  This is the 2nd kettle i've purchased this year to replace an Ovente kettle that stopped working after 9 months.  Both brands are pretty much useless.  So now ive purchased the Hamilton one praying this one will last...
It’s good but the problem is it doesn’t turn off automatically.
This kettle spills everywhere. I’d return it if it wasn’t past the return window. Find a better kettle.
The box was ripped and old looking. The pot appeared to be used or purchased prior and not reboxed in a way that you could give this as a gift to anyone. I am returning this item.
"I was so excited to get my Electric Kettle  to place on my office desk to alleviate having to go in kitchen & using Tea Kettle on Stove or Keurig for hot water… I received the Electric Kettle & the first immediate issue - the cord is terrible short!  So short that from my desk top will not reach the power surge cord!! So, I had to purchase an “under the desk” stand to accommodate- major inconvenience, but I still wanted to use this new device! So my initial use - I fill to water line indicated to “cleanse” the interior of the pot (the first burn off smell is awful) but I set a timer to see exactly how long it will take to heat the water .  Contradictory to the description when purchased (2-3 minutes). It literally took over 5 mins before water reached boling point.  For all the inconvenience & trouble & time - I may as well have used my Tea Kettle on the Stove Burner - heats up a lot quicker!  On the flip side - it’s a very cute kettle - minus the ridiculously short cord - perhaps the manufacturer should consider a “retractable cord” it the primary reason for the short cord is for safety reasons- giving the consumer the option of movement & placement."
It rocks on the baseExcept for the rocking part it does its jobNo problem
The description says stainless steel lid but it’s plastic. Also the base is really cheap and light with a very still cord so it wouldn’t sit flat on my counter. I returned it.
Lasted 4 months and now it leaks through the bottom.
"The auto shut off broke, it will keep boiling forever if I don't watch it. I've owned it less than 2 years"
Had it for 7 weeks and it’s leaking already on the bottom.  Nothing is made like it used to. Wasn’t expensive but would rather have invested in a non leaking kettle.
"I love the appearance and cool blue light that turns on when heating water.  However there is a small spot in the bottom of the pot.  Because the lid doesn't open all the way, I can't reach to clean it.  I hope it is not something that will cause harm to my health.  It looks like rust.  Time will tell."
This water heater was working perfectly fine for about 4 weeks until it simply stopped this morning. I don't recommend - get a properly-made one for 20 more bucks !
"For a pre-programmed kettle, which I clearly didnt do a thorough check, is completely dumb. The settings are such in such an odd numbers first of all (104, 113, 122, 131...194, 203, 212*F,) and the kettle lid is made of plastic. I would clearly being having microplastics in my water. Not the greatest design. Buy it if you want cancer early, but for those who don't, cough up the extra money to buy a better build electric kettle."
"This kettle was fine while it worked. Two days, after the warranty expired so did the kettle. I contacted the seller but heard nothing back. Save your money."
"DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU ONLY WANT FOR 6 MONTHS. This product worked until it turned 6 months - now it’s bound for the landfill. Maybe they make them so you have to buy several times a year, great biz model. It’s too bad, until then, it worked great."
"I got a used kettle, the packaging was damaged, you could see where extra tape was put.  The outside had scratches, from the inside you can see that it had been used, it did not have the base with the cord."
"Started off great with this tea kettle, but after only a few uses, it started to discolor on the bottom. I use a paper towel to clean it, and the paper towel turns black from this residue. Note that it is not my water because I use bottled spring water ..it is the pot. What a disappointment.. other than that, water heats up so fast…pot is compact and well designed otherwise"
"I purchased it in December 2023 and used it for one and a half months.  I did not use it often, and I think I boiled water with this kettle only 10-20 times.  While boiling water one day, I heard a loud popping sound, and I found the glass cracked and water was leaking.  It cracked from the contacting area of glass and stainless steel hot plate.  The glass cracked without any impact.  Amazon website showed it was the item that could not give a refund and I contacted the seller by email.  The seller replied after 4 days and wrote that the warranty covers only 30 days.  They cannot refund for the glass cracked after 30 days from purchase.  I replied again that it was a safety issue and it was defective so it cracked easily.  Then, the seller did not reply and I am in the process of refund through Amazon.  It can be dangerous and the seller's customer service terrible.  Do not buy it."
"I really liked this electric kettle and used it every day for 3 years.  I recently began to notice water all over the base plate/pad and determined that it was leaking water from the bottom of the kettle.  The warranty was expired and there is no fix for this problem. The Hamilton Beach representative responded quickly and offered a discount code but I am unwilling to purchase another Hamilton Beach electric kettle due to the short life span.  I am trying to be very mindful of unnecessary waste going into our landfills and will only make electronic purchases that have a long life span.  Guess my only option is throwing it away and that's really sad as my engineer husband is very capable of fixing almost anything. As I have noticed with some other reviewers, I opted to give one star instead of two in the hopes that more people will see this."
"It worked well enough for a bit over 1 year, but then it stopped working.It will light up when I press the buttons for various heat settings, but not heat anything. The only setting that still starts heating is the ""boil black"" button, but that will start heating for only a few seconds before automatically shutting off while the water is cold. I tried following the troubleshooting steps from Amazon, but the problem continued. I'm thinking it must be a board failure, since only one of the settings works (though only for a moment).I contacted Hamilton Beach customer service, but they said the warranty is only for a year. At that point I had it for 1 year and 5 months, but I hardly used it in the summer and only occasionally in the winter. I probably only got 15-20 uses out of it total (almost never used more than once a week, sometimes went weeks without using). I bought it for around $40 on sale, so I essentially paid $2+ per time to heat up water, which is absolutely ridiculous. Guess I'll have to go back to old fashioned way of heating water."
Worked fine for a year and then stopped 🤷🏾‍♂️ for the price I suppose a year is good
"Mechanically,  this works great.  It's fast. Easy to clean.I have a very hard time pouring it safely. The balance is off and the handle is much too large.  I do have small hands.I replaced a nearly five year old kettle with the same capacity.... so I can attest that it is the design that makes it difficult."
How long should a kettle last? 2.5 years? I think not. Planned obsolescence. It did make the little ding when it reaches the boil so it's got that going for it.
Not sure if that is the life expectancy but it was awesome until it died a year later.  We probably used it an every other day.  Not a super lot but still worked well when it did.  Not sure I will buy another one or will try another brand yet.
"It's like they WANT to poison us! I was looking for a non-toxic stainless steel kettle with NO plastic but no, they've devised a plastic insert at the spout which cannot be removed.  It really serves no purpose and they could have left it blank. But alas, it will add to the toxcity of our tea. Thanks a lot. I should have sprung for the more expensive kettle ( you get what you pay for). Why is it so hard to find a true non-toxic kettle??????"
"I bought this  around a year ago and it has already developed a leak around the base.  I've used the kettle often, but it isn't like there have been people banging it around.  I'm disappointed."
Good kettle. It seems to do all the advertised. The hinge started having issues about 1.5 years in. It completely broke around the 3 year mark. The hinge is plastic. The cuisinart one has metal hinge and a 3 yr warranty. Trying that next.
"I purchased this kettle in March of 2023 and about 3 month's ago it’s started leaking. It was slow at first but it’s getting worse quickly. I like Hamilton Beach, but this is disappointing.I really liked this kettle, warms up quickly and is nice looking. So disappointed."
Loved this product for the 3 years it lasted. The bottom plastic seal started leaking recently and it can’t be repaired. It’s now $20 more than what I paid in 2021. Will try a different Brand. Too bad nothing lasts more than a couple years.
I loved this kettle until...now.  I purchased this item in Jan 2023.  Today is Aug 2024 and it no longer works.  Because the warranty is outside of the timeframe Hamilton Beach will not honor the warranty.  I now have to purchase a new kettle but this time I will get a 3 or 4 year warranty.
"I used and enjoyed this kettle from May of 2023 to Dec of 2024.  It started to smell slightly like burning plastic, so faintly I wasn't sure it was even happening, and then a week later it wouldn't turn on no matter what I tried; cord jiggling, multiple outlets, etc.  It was a fine appliance while it worked but I expect at least a few years of service from something like this."
Had this product for 2 years and about a month ago it started leaking water at the base which is dangerous if it reaches the center part of the base.
"Bought as Xmas present in 2022. Worked fine for a while. But just died this morning. Never dropped, abused, misused, anything like that.Not great for a $50 kettle. Gonna spend less than half that on a replacement from another brand."
It is a great kettle. Even after a regular use it did not deposit minerals inside the kettle. Easy to use and heats up water quickly. Unfortunately it suddenly stopped working after 20 months of careful use.
"Nice large capacity and used every morning for tea, but this morning, after a few short bursts of restarting it, it just won't work any longer.  Disappointing."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The kettle worked for the first thirty days and stopped working right after. It won’t light up or turn on. I’ve tried different outlets, cleaning the contact areas, and resetting. Nothing works, it’s dead"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Can't close after just a couple months, I moved in June and bought it since then (Dec 1st). Worked great while it was here, but the quality control is poor it seems."
"It boils water. It's overly complex because of course people need specific water temps now. Blue LED was on for so long that I thought it wasn't supposed to turn off. Thankfully it eventually does (after 3 mins, I think). It's meh. It's boring. The quality is about a middling/just good enough as I'd almost be willing to accept at this price point. I should've just bought the basic, click the button and the water boils kind. I'm so unimpressed with this thing. Or maybe it's my seasonal affective disorder? I guess I just dislike buying things these days, and only soul-less conglomerates sell affordable ""like everyone elses"" electric kettles. Your kettle is your phone is your car is your house is your job. Nobody wows anymore."
"This kettle was fantastic the first 14 months I owned it. I used it daily once or twice and I loved the varying temps as I drink many types of tea. After 15 months, it occasionally started leaking after heating, and this morning it just won’t even turn on. Won’t be buying this again."
I was happy with it for a year and a half then the base stopped working.  My previous kettle last years.  I believe an appliance ought to work at least year past its warranty.
"As long as you consider this a disposable item with a 2-3 year lifespan, it's a reasonable purchase. Ours is failing due to the clear window that shows the water level, developing a crack and seeping water. I'm going to attempt a repair with high temperature adhesive backed tape. We did not realize this small clear line in the window, which we first noticed soon after purchase, was an actual crack until it grew longer and began leaking. In other respects it continues to work well. Frankly this is typical of all the electric kettles we have purchased, which all fail after a year or two, cheap or expensive ones. Of course nothing like this is made to be repairable these days. The moment you are past the one year warranty, Hamilton Beach will be of no help."
I had a version by Cuisinart for a decade that was great but finally died. The Hamilton Beach appears almost identical and less expensive. However it constantly shuts itself off and randomly changes temperatures. Not happy.
Lasted about one year or regular use in the US. One day this summer it just stopped working. Not sure what happened and it was impossible to diagnose the issue. Ended up recycling it because the item was unusable.
"I used this product almost every day and it has been great, until it broke for no obvious reason.  I have never accidentally turned it on while empty.  I unplug it when it's not in use.  However, one day it just quit.  It lasted only 20 months.  Less than 2 years is not what I would consider durable."
"When it works, this is a nice kettle. However, a few months after purchase it just quit. I reached out to Hamilton Beach support and they sent a replacement. After a few months though, the replacement started to give off a weird burning odor after use, and then a couple of days later it also quit working entirely.Out of curiosity, I opened up the base and discovered the hot lead had melted through its insulation and the stranded copper inside was frayed. There is no evidence of any corrosion or water damage, so I concluded that either the kettle itself is drawing too much current for the cable/connectors supplied, or the sharp bend that the manufacturer puts in the cable as it makes its way to the contacts in the base is increasing the resistance beyond it's designed limits.I had kept the base from the original unit and was able to use that for a few days, but then it suffered the same fate. Original purchase was in July-22, replacement was in May-23, so each unit lasted less than a year. I considered contacting Hamilton Beach about it the second failure, but even if they offered another warranty replacement, I'm not sure I want this product in my home anymore."
This hot water kettle model has all the features I needed to make various types of tea.  I was pleased to be able to set the proper temperature for the various teas I drink.  I did not expect that in less than six months it would stop working.  The first sign I noticed  after three months is the  tea pot sticks to the base.  The second sign I noticed is that it will not shut off automatically and the water started tasting differently even though I used filtered water.  I am very disappointed with this model as I have bought several Hamilton Beach hot water kettles and I have given them as gifts.  In fact I bought two hot water model  kettles two months apart.  One as a gift and this model for me.  Most of the other models last at least four years.  I am very upset as this is the one I spent more money for and this is the first time I did not take an extended warranty.  $55 down the drain and make me contribute to the environmental problem within a year.  I think Hamilton needs to think and act on their responsibility to the environment and not just make more money by making equipment that works for less than a year.  Don’t buy.  This is the first time I am going away from a brand that I felt their products were good.  I felt ripped off. Don't buy.
"The bad:- you cannot see water level window because someone put the handle in front of it (design ""feature"")- this thing develops limescale ridiculously quickly (I had to descale 6 times in the month I owned it)- the boil setting is way too hot and the others are not hot enough- opening the lid can burn your hand, because the ""open"" button is entirely to close to the scalding hot condensation that develops around the lid (another design ""feature"")- you cannot get your hand inside to sop up any extra water, or spot clean it (""feature""?)- the plastic ring at the bottom (I think it's around the boil dry sensor?) started to leave flecks in my water after a few weeks (see picture)- you have to select ""hold temperature"" every time you use it; it won't retain the previous settingYou can blame the limescale on hard water if you like, but my old kettle had water in it 24/7 for almost a decade and never once developed so much as a spot.  It isn't just the water.The good:- the temperature presets are easy to use- the hold temperature setting works nicely, and lasts a full 30 min- it makes an audible (but not too loud) sound when the water reaches temperature- descaling is actually a pretty simple process, and does not require vats of white vinegarIf you don't require temperature accuracy and don't care about the myriad design flaws, maintenance, or burning your hand, then this is a fine option, though there are cheaper options available.  Personally, however, I returned it, and I do not recommend this or any kettle designed similarly (which, for reasons I will never understand, seems to be 90% of them)."
nice while it lasted. Did not last long enough. After a year it started to not power up occasionally when inserted onto base. Now it does not power on at all.
"I loved it while it was working, but it broke pretty quickly."
"Kettle looked nice enough, but it beeps when the water boils rather than just shutting off quietly. Unnecessary noise in the morning before I've even caffeinated is a deal breaker. Sending it back."
only lasted 18 months and started leaking
"This is my second Hamilton Beach water kettle  ($60.) and it stopped working after 9 months. It has a one-year warranty in the USA but it is IMPOSSIBLE to get anyone to review your claim - it is all done via AI - which apparently can only handle what it is programmed to recognize. They keep requesting a ""series number"" from the bottom of my kettle - which is not there - I have sent them photos to show there is not a ""series number"" anywhere on the bottom of the kettle. I've called four different numbers listed for Hamilton Beach and it is all computer recordings. I looked at their website and saw that many people had the same exact issue  - appliances that failed and they cannot get any response from Customer Service. Apparently they don't care about Customer Service - they wear you out interfacing with computers that cannot reason.  It's sad - H. Bch used to be a good company. I will never purchase any of their products again.FINALLY received an email from someone that sent an example of where to look for the numbers they requested - they are in the plastic and barely visible!  (it is not on the silver label, but to the right of that - can you see it?)  Apparently they will be sending a replacement kettle.  I will see how long it lasts."
I expected better but realized big brands really don't care about their products anymore.  It starting leaking and rusted.
"After using this for 20 months, the plastic in the base has started melting and leaves a smell of burning plastic after each use. The quality of this product is not very good. I do not recommend."
"I've used this kettle for a few months now, it does what it is supposed to do. For this price, definitely a great value. My one gripe is that it still gives off an odd smell if you try to pour before the heating element has cooled down a bit. Smells a bit like burned plastic, but I can't find any evidence of that actually happening. Water quality appears unaffected, but who knows these days. All in all, worth it as a secondary or budget temperature controlled kettle. I still use OXO's glass temp control kettle as my primary, and would recommend it to anyone that needs a good one.Update after 4 months: I would not recommend this kettle. It works, but is unpleasant and I can tell build quality is poor as condition is rapidly deteriorating. Plastic smell has never gone away, and now the temp sensor is leaking some kind of grease into the water chamber with every use. I believe the design of this kettle is so poor that it is built to swiftly self destruct. I've seen numerous reports of leaking through the bottom of the kettle, and I fear that may be the case for me soon once the grease runs out. Fingers crossed I do not get scalded, electrocuted, or start a fire. I predict I may get between 2-4 more months out of this thing before it is broken or too unsafe to continue using. Going to replace with another OXO, far better build quality for the money."
"Worked well for 16 months then failed.First 16 months:It works very well and has been reliable.  I wish they'd improve a couple things like:1. Make the default ""Keep Warm"" temperature to be the same as the last selected temperature.  Currently, it defaults to boiling.  It should ALWAYS default to the last temperature selected ... or lower for safety.  I've burned my tongue before because I didn't realize when I replaced it on the mount that it boiled the next pot of water.2. Sediment collects around the temperature probe in the bottom of the dispenser and a bottle brush can't easily get the downward force necessary to clean around it.  Perhaps if the probe was not sitting in the little ½"" depression, but on a flat or raised surface it might be easier to clean around it.Overall, it's a good buy and has worked well for the couple of months I've owned it.UPDATE: 16 months later- It doesn't work.  All it does is heat water and it doesn't work anymore.  Either it doesn't turn on or it doesn't heat to the selected temperature."
"The unit worked great until it failed after 9 months of occasional use.  It started to make a popping sound occasionally, until finally it no longer heats water.  Poor quality from what used to be a decent brand.Edit: Contacted support and they will be sending out a new unit - hoping for a longer lasting product this time!"
This tea kettle is no good. It was often not boiling and I needed to push the start button several times. Today it’s Dead Even though the blue light is on but no boiling action. I would not buy it!
"This is a basic electric kettle that boils water probably to the selected temperature. I got this to replace my Cuisinart that started falling apart after 8 years (a good life). It's fine for one-pour uses. It's pretty useless for things that may require a few measured pours, like for coffee.Upon unpacking, my first reaction is how cheap and plastic-y its construction is. But I gave it a try anyway. Lifting the just half-full kettle, I could feel the plastic pieces in the handle moving under my grip, which confirms the cheap construction. I am willing to look past that for the cheaper price ($55) vs. the Cuisinart ($100).I'm sure the kettle boils to the selected temperature, though I did not test this. Upon boiling, lifting the kettle of the base, then returning it to it's base, I found that the kettle does not retain any settings - the kettle turns OFF every single time, doesn't remember the temperature last used, and doesn't keep the KEEP WARM setting on. This renders the kettle essentially ineffective and a total pain to use.  What's the point of having settings at all if they are all erased every time you lift the kettle off it's base? I expect a kettle to stay ON immediately after use, stay at the selected temperature, and the keep warm setting on if selected, until I manually turn it off or it times out. Maybe this expectation is unreasonable and the Cuisinart spoiled me?Returned."
"We ordered this electric kettle when our glass kettle was accidentally knocked off the counter and broke. We use an electric kettle for business meetings, so the ""keep warm"" feature is very important. Our broken kettle would ""keep warm"" - with use - for 2 hours when pushed. This kettle's ""keep warm"" feature only keeps warm until you lift the pot from the base, then it cancels. THAT MEANS THAT EACH TIME SOMEONE GETS WATER, THE KETTLE MUST BE RESTARTED TO BOIL AND TO ""KEEP WARM."" For our meetings, the lack of ""keep warm"" means this kettle requires a babysitter. If no one uses it, it will ""keep warm"" for ONLY 30 minutes before automatically shutting off. This ""keep warm"" feature is completely unacceptable. All this kettle does is heat water to the temp you want, which you can find on any kettle for less than half the price."
"I loved this kettle. Used it faithfully 4-6 times a day. It got water hot very quickly and kept it at temperature relatively well.  Excellent for making tea, coffee, and everything in between. However, it lasted LESS than 2 years.I'm so glad that I discovered this leak and not my children. There's water dripping out of the electrical box & it could have been disastrous. There's no rust on the interior & no visible holes. I am so disappointed. A new kettle is on the way but I would think twice before ordering this particular model."
Very easy to use. My only complaints are 1. The “stay warm” function does not stay on for 30 minutes. Mine barely stays on for 10 minutes which is a little inconvenient. 2. It’s a little difficult to clean the inside.
"It was fine while it worked, under almost daily usage. Haven't had another electric kettle before so can't say if it absolutely should last longer than 26 months, but it just stopped initiating the boiling process one day, even though the buttons work."
"Overall, this does exactly what I wanted it to do, which is heat water fast.  It does a great job and it does it so much faster than anything else I have to heat water.  But shortly after using it I noted the top wouldn't stay closed and there is a defect.  I take the blame for not trying to return it sooner and now have to finagle the top every time.  All in all, however, if this is a one off mishap, then it is a 5 star item.  If, however, others have this issue, then there is an error in its manufacturing.  Still, overall happy with the product."
"The kettle started leaking after about 18 months and completely quit heating after 2 years.  The auto-shut off was inconsistent and unreliable almost from the start. And the temperature is inaccurate. I scalded many a green tea. It also tends to build up scale and wasn't the easiest to clean. That being said I did use it for 2 years. The design is nice, the base is quick and easy, and it heats extremely fast. That being said I'm sure there are better kettles for the same price that will last longer and at a higher quality."
"I bought this kettle a little over a year ago (November 2022). About 6 months into using it, I started noticing that the base would become moist. Fast forward to last month when I realized that the kettle is no longer holding water. Luckily I use it close to the sink, so have not had a flood, but the base of the kettle corroded and although it's not possible to see the size of the hole, it drains out most of the pot overnight.  It does still boil the water, just very small amounts of it.I reached out for tech support, but am ONE month out of the warranty period.To their credit, I was offered a coupon for another kettle, but I don't think I want to repeat 11 month kettle at this price."
"We treated this Kettle very gingerly. We only used it to boil water. Kept it clean and handled it with care. Non-the-less, while it was working it was just fine, but it died right after the one year mark. For this expensive electric kettle, that is way too short of a time. I do not recommend this product unless you want to take the gamble of it dying way too soon."
"I use a kettle every day for tea, multiple times a day, so granted, it gets a lot of use. I go through these a lot. Honestly, not a terrible life for this product, considering it started leaking after a few months somewhere around the bottom of the pot (houseguests: ""Are you sure it's a good idea to use an electric kettle that's leaking?"" Me: shrug).There's a more expensive cuisinart model that also has the temperature settings and lasted about the same length of time for me, but didn't leak. I'm going back to that model."
Was just fine until 4 months after the warranty expired.
"This kettle worked great while it was working, but less than 2 years after purchasing it totally stopped working, no longer appears to be receiving power at all. Tried all the troubleshooting tips but none have worked so far."
I bought this kettle exactly a year ago and it just recently stopped working. Luckily we bought the warranty through Amazon so we sent it back and got our money. It’s a good product but only lasted a year.
I’ve had this for about 6 months. I use it once every day in the morning. I noticed recently that it’s getting louder than before. It’s pretty loud now. Not sure why it developed over time but here we are.
Great kettle when it worked. I understand that the warranty is 1 year but a 2 year life span of a kettle is unacceptable. Not sure if I will buy another from this manufacturer. This looks like a hazard waiting to happen.
"The kettle seems to work just fine. I purchased this because of the brand name. I assumed the quality would be better than one of those Chinese no-name kettles. However, even though it boasts stainless steal materials, soon after we started using it, there is already a spot of rust on the inside, at the seam between the base and the wall of the kettle."
"I was very happy with the performance of this kettle until it started to leak. I fill it up to about 1 liter mark but it leaks no matter how low the water level is. It is a small leak but counter top has water around the base after each boiling. I filed a warranty claim and was sent replacement. Now 8 months later the replacement kettle started to leak. Very similar leak to the last one. After boiling water when the kettle is half full there is water slowly dripping from the bottom of the kettle. I contacted the seller and they told me since it has been more than a year since the purchase date there is no longer any warranty on it. I purchase my first kettle at the end of February 2023. Now at the beginning of April 2023, 14 months since purchase date and I have two broken kettles. It was a nice kettle while it was working but they simply don't last and are obviously of poor quality. I still have an old kettle I bought from Walmart years ago which is till working fine. It does not have any fancy settings like this one but after over 10 years of daily usage still works."
"I like that you can choose the temp of the water. However, the base gets so hot that it melts sometimes. I ended up buying another base, and it ended up breaking too. I don't recommend this kettle. The base is about $15. I don't want to have a subscription to use my kettle. The sad part is that u thought the kettle malfunctioned, so I bought a second kettle. It seems like melting bases is a feature now."
"Update 9/20/2023The replacement Hamilton Beach sent has also failed>>>It began to emit a burnt plastic odor from the base.  Today it refuses to turn on.  Time for different brand with better warranty.This was the second one.  the first one failed on the control switch.  In the short period of time I had it, the covering on the on/off switch wore off.  I replaced it without complaining.  The new one arrived and in another very brief period of time, it failed to turn on.I have been promised a new one from the manufacturer for three weeks now.  It has never arrived.Send these clowns an email and they respond with  ""We have received your recent email and you should receive a personal response within 5 - 7  business days. Please note that this excludes weekends and holidays, as we will be closed.""Buy  a different brand from a company that cares."
I loved this kettle until the OPEN button jammed and now the lid is open and won’t stay closed. Really frustrating to have to toss it over such a small detail.
"I've had two units die within 3 months of purchase. Just totally stopped working - light didn't light up, no response when pressing buttons. I was especially careful to keep the second unit clean, descaled, etc. following the instructions but still died. Amazon didn't cover and the manufacturer only offered  a15% discount on a future purchase.  While they worked they were great - looks good, multiple temperature settings, boils fast, etc. but reliability seems to be an issue."
"I really like the idea of a temperature control pot. As an avid tea drinker, not all hot water is the same. Unfortunately, my pot started to leak after 18 months. I will try to buy it again and how this one lasts longer."
"I got this kettle on September 15 for my office. Great temperature settings for a variety of teas. And great capacity so I don't have to fill up a couple times per day. Five months later, the kettle no longer heats water. When attached to the base, the buttons don't light up most of the time. When they do, it will turn on, very quickly make a sizzling sound for 5-10 seconds, and turn off.I've reached out to HB customer service and am awaiting a response. Unfortunately, the warranty states that I'm responsible for shipping my unit back and receiving a new unit. Assuming $10-$20 for this shipping garbage, getting this kettle replaced will tack 25-50% onto my original purchase price. I also won't have a kettle during that time period. Disappointing..."
Loved this worked well but broke without reason
"This product is neither wonderful nor bad.  I bought this kettle because I liked the idea of different temperatures settings because my husband makes tea often. I typically boil my water for coffee and I liked the idea that I could keep it on a boil in case I couldn’t get to the kettle as soon as it was ready. Problem is — that function doesn’t seem to work. Water does cool off and I need to reheat it or re-boil it because they keep warm doesn’t work. Also my husband doesn’t seem to use many of those temperature settings for tea.We find the kettle to be a bit cumbersome and large on our counter too. Hubby finds ithe handle awkward to hold. Also every time you return the kettle to the bass it seems to turn back on, and you have to press the start button twice in order to prevent it from reboiling. That is annoying.Yes, it boils, and I’m glad it didn’t come w a plasticy smell like our old one, but the bells and whistles it has don’t make it as special as I’d like."
"I loved this kettle to start with, variable temperatures, keep warm setting, button flip lid ... but after just 1-1/2 yrs, it's already stopped working. The few times it turns on, it goes off after a minute or two, never reaching the desired temperature.Only buy this if you need a short-term use product. Not built to last."
"I purchased this to replace an ""all plastic, it just boils"" kettle that quit after about 5 years of daily use.  I bought this because of brand name recognition, the features (I wanted the temp control) and the construction.I've been using this 2 or 3 times daily, usually on one of the temps below boiling.  They seem to work fine (I haven't actually checked the water temperature, though).  The ""keep warm"" feature usually works - once in a while, for some apparent random reason - it won't ""keep warm"".  The biggest issue, however, is that when set to the default ""boil"" temp, it actually does NOT shut off after reaching a boil - it will just keep boiling.ADDENDUM JULY 2I requested support from Hamilton Beach and (to their credit) they sent me a new kettle (although it took nearly 3 weeks).  The new kettle operates in exactly the same manner - all temperatures work great - EXCEPT BOIL, WHICH DOES NOT SHUT OFF.  I suspect the issue is that I live at high altitude, where water boils at about 202 F, not 212 F.  However, I have used other kettles that have no problem shutting off when a full rolling boil is reached.  Latest attempt to get help:  ""Send us your kettle, we will evaluate it, and we will get back to you.""  No thanks.  I'll keep the kettle, heat water to 200F, and look for a less expensive but more functional kettle."
"I drink hot tea every night and was looking forward to having this kettle and be able to adjust the temperature and keep warm.  After 3 months of use, it started to have a loud popping noise in the kettle and then began to leak from the bottom.  I contacted Hamilton Beach directly, after multiple emails back and forth about getting all of the order information, they said they will not warrant it because I purchased it from Amazon.  So just be ware and purchase the extended warranty, when possible."
"First off, this water heater is still in daily use and I find the rapid heating to be quite good.  The issue I have if you push the open too far there are issues closing the pot.I have found if I just push the open button barley enough to open the pot it works fine.  The real issue is either there is some binding on locking hardware that likes to stick.  If it sticks; it is easy to free up by just pushing on the locking detent on the inside of the pot."
"When the kettle worked, it was your standard electric kettle. I almost exclusively used the boil function - so the other buttons served little to no purpose. The plastic handle surface housing the buttons isn’t great - a hot pot grazed the kettle and melted a cut-like dent…Kettle received daily use, but unit started leaking over Christmas…support stated the warranty had expired so there was nothing to do about that. Next time I purchase a substantial kettle like this, it’ll probably be the Cuisinart for a little more."
"We use the kettle regularly, boiling water an average of 6 times a day. It worked pretty well up until this week and then it just stopped coming to a rolling boil.When I looked back at my order history, I realized that we’ve bought 3 Hamilton Beach electric kettles since 2016. Perhaps it’s time to change brands."
It’s probably the last time I’ll buy used . It clearly has been used multiple times since there were stains inside and marks on the outside of the electric kettle .
"I purchased this kettle several months ago for  my work office. It is much heavier than my old kettle, especially when filled with water.  The keep warm feature is not very helpful. You have to remember to select the keep warm button when you turn it on, then anytime you remove it off the base, it shuts off. So, if you do not remember to select the button again, then next time you were ready for a cup of hot tea or hot chocolate, the kettle is off and you have to reheat the water again. Very frustrating."
"Our previous electric kettle (not this brand) lasted many years before wearing out the only bits of plastic it had. This kettle didn't make it 10 months before button presses stopped registering.It took 3 business days to get a response from support, where they told me that they're going to charge me shipping and handling fees ($14.99, so not breaking the bank, but still) and it could take 7-10 business days to get whatever they're sending me, which they have not yet specified. I'm currently trying to decide if that amount is better spent on a kettle I can get tomorrow and has as better chance of lasting, or if I pay $15 for an unknown that at best stands to lasts less than a year."
"Bought this in Oct 2022. It’s us now not quite a year later and it has a leak at the bottom of it. Every time I go to pour, I have hot water leaking from the bottom. Inconvenient and unsafe to say the least. It was working great up until that issue. Wish it had an easier stay warm feature also."
"Pros:It does work. Temperature control is cool.Cons:It’s very slow to boil.No way to turn off beeping function.Hard to tell how much water is in it through the tiny window.When you want to add water to make more soon after use, the button to open the top flings the top open and boiling hot water is sprayed around. It’s a terrible design.Seems unnecessarily bulky to try to convey quality, but it’s just unnecessarily big."
"I have a similar kettle at home but wanted one for my RV. The only difficulty I have is trying to tell when I’ve filled the kettle. The one at home is glass but I wanted a more durable body on this one because of it being in a bumpy RV. I find it hard to tell when this enclosed one reaches max. Could be my old eyes or the design. Otherwise… makes a lovely cup of tea! ☕️Ok, you're looking and seeing that I gave 1 star and a glowing review... that was until we'd used the kettle a couple of times and then water started coming out of the bottom of the kettle as well as the spout. I hadn't noticed the reviews that mentioned this when I was shopping for this kettle... Now I wish I had just bought the same one that I have at home.  NOT a HAPPY CAMPER!"
"I liked this kettle and was very satisfied with its function and appearance until just the last couple of days when I started having problems getting it to turn on. This morning it stopped working altogether. It lasted two years and two months, since I bought it Nov 2020. I think countertop appliances should last longer than that, and manufacturing items to last only two years creates needless waste and harms the environment. We used it two or three times a day, on average, and we enjoyed it while it lasted."
Loved it at first. Now 5 months later the open button sticks in the down position and you have to use a knife to pry it it to open it to add water
"These are wonderful while they work.  I’ve owned two.  The first one had all of its control buttons freeze up after about 2.5 years.  Since I loved the way it worked I figured I just got a bad unit so I purchased another.  After about 2.5 years I noticed the bottom of the pot had separated from the body which left all the electrical parts exposed.  At first I thought maybe a screw worked loose, but there was nothing attaching the bottom.  So, it must be made with some sort of glue fastening it together.  Couldn’t see any traces, but there was no sign of what attached the pot bottom to the pot..  exposed electrical wires being dangerous in something us3d with water, I will trash this one and try something less functional that is less hazardous."
Too noisy when it starts boiling
Liked this kettle a lot. It just stopped working after 20 months. A small pice of copper fell out of the base assembly and now it doesn't work.Too expensive to be a throw away item.Might be worth it if you take out the extended warranty and can handle some downtime if it stops working.
"We loved everything about this kettle - the performance, the temperature control, its efficiency in heating and its sleek look on the countertop.  We are big tea drinkers - we probably used it 3-4 times a day.  Today, however, 15 months later, I am online shopping for a new one.  This one just stopped working...."
I HATE that it beeps really loud 6 times when it gets up to temp. Apparently there's no way to turn that feature off.The kettle also gets hot to the touch on the outside. Don't love that.Pros: Great for volume of water and I like the settings for temp.
"purchased on October 8, 2023, failed on December 31, 2023, less than three months.  Amazon replacement window is one month.Suddenly shuts off prematurely before reaching temperature and will not resume operation if replaced on base.  Simply goes dead and will not resume operations.  Sometime later, it will accept operation, but, again, shuts off prematurely.  The same thing happens repeatedly.  The water level is at mid-full in window gauge.Features are wonderful, when they work.  Durability and reliability are questionable.  Probably not the best choice for a $50 tea kettle produced by an American brand."
"Works great, but after reaching a boil…it shuts off.  Doesn’t keep the water warm enough for that 2nd cup of tea before shutting off completely"
The water started leaking out of the bottom after a few months. Otherwise works great. It heats up much quicker than a kettle on the stove and is easy to use. Customer service is excellent.
I’m disappointed in the length this product lasted. It quit on me after only 2 years. I previously bought the same model a few years back and it performed the same way. Will not recommend or buy again.
"As others has also complain, it is leaking from bottom after 2 years of moderate use.  My $15 cheap plastic electric kettle lasted way longer than this. No product support either. Would change review if they replace."
"We received this kettle last week and were using it once or twice a day. Suddenly it stopped working. We did not drop it or do anything to cause the issue, it simply will not turn on anymore. Unfortunately i tossed the box and paperwork and not able to ask for a replacement. I ordered a different brand and hope that one lasts longer."
"This kettle was great until it wasn't.  I saw another review that said it failed after 9 months, mine was 6.  Wouldn't turn on until you reseated it several times, and then the water was not hot enough even set at max.  Didn't even boil.  Gonna try to engage customer service for HB, but based on other reviews, don't have high hopes.  Look elsewhere."
"I bought the Hamilton Beach tea kettle and it worked great for about 6 months and then just stopped heating.  I reached out to customer service and they quickly sent me a replacement.  Great… I thought, until the 2nd one died after 3 months.  I use a tea kettle probably 5 times a week, not excessively.  I won’t be requesting another."
"Loved this at first, easy to use, easy to pick a temperature. But now the spout has come ""unstuck"" on one side from the body of the kettle, so when you go to pour, half (and I mean half) of the water leaks out all over your counter, your floor, everything. So basically within 8 months of very light use, this kettle has become unusable. Would not purchase again."
"It seemed to be a nice kettle. I have used it for a year and two weeks to boil water twice a day. Naturally, I used it carefully, never dropped or anything like that. Today it leaked. Now there is no point to describe how good this kettle was. Now it’s garbage, because 1-year warranty expired on December 23, 2023 - two weeks ago. I do not recommend it for purchase, since I don’t like its short life, no longer than warranty."
"Do NOT buy this product unless you live at sea level.  As others have pointed out, this tea pot will NOT shut off until the water reaches 212 degrees when you select the ""boil"" option, or simply turn it on.  I live in Denver and this tea pot will not shut off when ""boil"" is selected because the water cannot reach 212 degrees since water boils at 202 degrees here.  I watched this pot boil water down from 1.7L to 1.5L in a matter of just a few minutes and if the boil protection is faulty, like others have pointed out in their reviews, then you are looking at a potential serious situation.  I'm surprised this product has not been recalled as this critical design flaw could result in serious consequences (like a fire) if you are not actively attending the pot.  I will be sending this one back and looking at other options.  It's too bad, as I like all the other features but the hazards of continuing to use this product out weigh everything else.  Buyer beware!"
"The keep warm feature was questionable, and then after just a few years, it just died out of the blue. Shame on you Hamilton Beach!"
This kettle worked great for about one year and then it started leaking.
"This was a very good product for about a year. After that point, the bottom started leaking quite a bit. No, I rarely find it in the morning without a puddle of water around it. I would probably spend my money on a more expensive kettle that I don’t have to replace every year"
Picture is deceiving as it does not have an interface showing different temps and selections. It is quite loud when boiling
"Loved this kettle but unfortunately after 6 months it randomly stopped working. It isn’t something I use every single day even, maybe 3x a week so it doesn’t seem to be very durable."
"I absolutely loved this kettle while it was functioning. Bought it in January and used it several times per day until August or September of the same year when the cut-off-at-boiling-temp feature stopped working, and the kettle began steaming, sputtering, and leaking. Toughed it out for another couple of months, but it's October now, and we're calling it. Time to start shopping for a different kettle."
"Functionally, it works great. It heats water very quickly and efficiently. But these spots show up after each use. I've scrubbed them off a few times, but they come back after each use."
"There is a smell of burning rubber whenever I boil water. I have cleaned the kettle with soap and water, rinsed many times scrubbed with baking soda, boiled and rinsed yet again many times. The odor does not diminish. I think the odor emanates from the plastic base that is made to be countertop-friendly.When I pour boiled water out of the kettle into a clean cup, the odor remains with the kettle – – there is no order in that cup of water.The handle of the kettle appears a little bit loose after a few days of use.Everything else about this kettle is lovely. It boils water reliably, holds enough for several cups of pour over Coffee, has a spout which delivers the water perfectly for a Chemex or other coffee filter system. It is pleasing to look at. The temperature gauge appears accurate.It is simply not enjoyable to smell, burning plastic or rubber in one’s kitchen."
"Size is just right. A bit thin material tho, plastic lid."
"This kettle works fine. Unfortunately, the product photos did not show the power cord for the kettle. I ordered a white one that would look nice in my kitchen but the power cord is a thick, heavy, black cord and it looks... well, it looks terrible. Not sure if I will keep this."
I have had a cheaper kettle that has lasted for 10Years and still works. I bought this one when I moved and it’s cuter than the really functional one but it was more expensive and just stopped working after about 2 months. As of this morning when I push the tab the light doesn’t turn on and it doesn’t heat up.
"Gradually shifting from French press coffeemaking to the pour-over method. My somewhat clunky water heating kettle does not easily accommodate pour-over so I started looking for a gooseneck-equipped replacement. The price range is surprisingly wide and I concentrated on midrange options. I soon realized that a wooden handle was very desirable, which narrowed the field. The EK02 also features a built-in thermometer linked to an external temperature gauge; this was not particularly appealing since removing the lid introduced spillage or leakage - not sure if either term is strictly accurate to describe the small puddle left behind by the lid. However, that occurrence is not a real concern. The unit is made with a very light gauge metal tank which does not instill great confidence in its durability. So, I’m going to retain the older kettle expecting it will be needed eventually."
"Works pretty well. Single wall, so exterior surface gets about as hot as the contents. That's fine, but something to consider. Pours nicely. However, the temperature gauge on mine is very incorrect and cannot be calibrated. Mine reads about 9 degrees high."
"The listing for this kettle clearly states ""the interior, lid, and spout are made of food-grade 304 stainless steel"", ensuring it is ""safe"" for the consumer. HOWEVER, the listing did not state the thermometer probe or the metal tube, which is located inside the kettle, are made of that same food-grade 304 stainless steel.The photo in the listing does not show the tubing inside the kettle, which appears to me to have been done purposely. If that tubing and/or the thermometer probe are made of aluminum, this kettle is not safe as it is stated.Aluminum in cookware can be toxic to humans, and this kettle heats up to a boiling temperature. See the photos below where the inside tubing is shown. It is a different color and texture than the kettle's interior walls."
"Don’t let them talk you out of your original remarks. They promise all stuff to get a good rating. Truth… nice design, easy to work with. Pot not real copper & cheaply made"
"I love the copper and the design.  This is already showing rust on the inside of my pot.  It’s on the seam on the inside bottom of the pot.  I don’t leave water in the pot.  For what I paid for this item, very disappointing.  Would not buy this again."
"Just one month ago, April 2024 I purchased this kettle and already it’s falling apart. If I use the kettle and it’s hot, I can’t remove the lid to add more water without put myself at risk for a severe burn."
Works overall. Does seem a little cheaply made.
Leaks at the seam just above the on/off button. Did not overfill and only used it for 2 days. Returning and trying a different brand. Gave it 2 stars because I do love the look and speed to boil.
The thermometer will read 192 when it’s a rolling boil and auto shuts off. Edit: the thermometer works. I find that it just has to be tapped a lot to get it to work. I don’t know if it would loosen up with wear.
Loud as heck. It's OK but I wish I got the uglier one that worked better to be honest
Love this kettle but the auto shut off stopped working after a couple of months. Wish we could get a replacement for it.
Like how you don’t have to worry about the pot if it should be low on water. The pot will automatically torn off. Also like the fact that it has a thermometer and tells you the temperature of your water. Never goes above the boiling point. Pot will shut off automatically when fully heated. The exterior of the pot is pleasing to the eye and can match any decor. Would certainly buy another one for my home but bought this for my son who is moving into a dorm.
"Very cool and convenient until the thermometer handle popped off and so did the top of the lid, making it extremely difficult to open while hot or open in general. Everything else is great, the interior is nice, it's sleek, easy to clean, functional, and overall a good piece. Too bad about the durability, just wish she lasted longer."
I bought this in September and have used it a total of 5 times. It’s now 11/16 and it’s broken. About 1.5 and 5 uses.The return window has closed so I’m stuck with just throwing it away.
"The screw connecting the top part with the inside metal part comes loose after 2 months that makes the temperature part loose, and the inside metal piece accumulates lots of rust that isn't easy to clean."
"We really liked this kettle. Both looks and functionality.But obviously a poorly designed lid. Within 2 months, the lid broke and only the top half lifts off."
"Even when filling below the MAX line, it will leak when it begins to approach boiling.Poor quality control."
Purchased back in July 2024 and has fallen apart.  No warranty available so would not recommend purchasing this product.
"I got the black pot.  When heated it has a strong smell of hot paint type of odor.  Also, the spout has constant leak / drip from where it attaches to the kettle.  The quality is less than good."
"I love the way this looks. It worked great for about three months, and then just totally stopped working."
I bought this just a mont ago and somehow it start leaking from nowhere. The product doesn’t work anymore. I recommend buying the warranty.
Really like the product. Have bought 3 for friends and family. But one of them started leaking within the first month and does not appear to be any way to get it repaired or replaced or contact the seller.
"This worked very well. Very easy to use and heated water quickly. After about a month of use I returned the kettle after noticing that the inside coating started coming off, with flakes of whatever it was floating around in the water."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            …maybe 2.5?It’s now a fire hazard, as it doesn’t shut off. It’s now bound for a landfill.Save the planet and probably your house. Don’t buy this one."
Worked great for a week and than died. I don't recommend it.
"After less than 3 weeks of use, the kettle stopped turning on. My very handy husband was unable to figure out how to fix it. Cheaply made, I am very disappointed to have to just throw it out."
"Every time I turn the electric teapot on, it blows a fuse.Nothing else blows fuses like the teapot does.I've used a similar teapot at a friend's house and loved it."
We got this to use in our office for clients to make tea. It got used maybe once a week for the last 2 months and the lid has completely fallen apart to the point where you cannot open it. Definitely do not recommend this product.
This pot leaks water every time I pour it no matter how full the pot is. I have to pour over the sink every time. Guests get water all over the counter and themselves. Three people have scalded themselves. I missed the return window so it's going in the landfill which sucks.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Buyer beware. The ""auto shut-off"" on this doesn't actually work. When the water boils, it shuts off the kettle. BUT the lever doesn't actually turn off all the way! It remained partially in the on position, allowing the kettle to keep heating even when it was empty. After a few minutes it was scalding hot and definitely would have caught fire if I had not been home. I am absolutely returning this product."
"This product fell apart within 6 weeks, use once a day  see photo  Amazon will not accept return can’t get on touch with vendor."
It blew a fuse upon first use ! Loved the designPoor quality in performance !
"This is kettle is garbage. Look elsewhere. While it is aesthetically pleasing, listen to the reviews that say it leaks. I’ve used it thrice and it’s leaked on me. It’s as if it’s not properly welded at the bottom. I wish I could rate it lower than one star."
It leaks out of the bottom seal. The return window is short so be sure to check if yours is faulty as early as possible.
"It looks great and quicky heats the water, but it leaks a lot out of the bottom - annoying and disappointing."
Worked once before the leaking water soaked the base and made it inoperable.
"The thermometer, plastic lid, and metal lid all feel apart within a week. The threads on the bottom of the thermometer look solid, but the hole on the metal lid is too big.Now I'm having issues returning it because I don't have the original packaging. It lasted just long enough for me throw everything out, but now I'm stuck with this piece of junk."
"While this kettle is aesthetically pleasing and more affordable than other goosenecks, I will have to return it.I simply cannot get the chemical smell and taste out of the pot. I’ve tried vinegar and boiling and scrubbing and tried a replacement. It is also pretty flimsy as the temp gauge has shifted loose.I’m sad bc this could have been the electric kettle of my dreams."
"Water leaked from the bottom, soaked my entire countertop and everything on it."
"Does not work, right out of the box. 😡"
The kettle leaked out the bottom on the first use! Very dangerous!!!
"The product itself seems fine, but the quality control needs some work.I've only ever boiled water in the kettle to make coffee/tea and it started rusting after a month."
First it leaked and smelled like burnt plastic and so I sent it back and got a replacement now the handle and lid fell apart
Worked 7 times and no longer turns on
"I'm returning this product due to a strong chemical smell. I do not feel safe drinking water from it. Besides the stainless steel interior lining, all other material is plastic."
It BROKE a few weeks after purchase.the top part somehow separated.now unusable
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It looks nice but is very fragile, the gooseneck is very thing and its not properly welded to the base so is dripping water"
"The hole is a tiny pinhole (barely visible, but I'm pointing to it in the photo), but water leaks out of it. Sending it back."
The lid broke right after my return window closed so I was only able to use the for less than to month very poor quality !!
Disappointed in the quality. It arrived broken from seller. Returned for refund.
"Very unimpressed wobbles, dies not stay on stand etc."
"Started to leak from the bottom, two weeks after I started using it. Very disappointing and dangerous for an electrical appliance."
Not a good product
"This morning around 1:00am we were woken up to the smell of burning plastic. Ran to the kitchen to find this kettle smoking from the base. Then catching fire. I tried to turn it off but the kettle was not on, only plugged in.After taking the kettle outside and letting it cool off. It appears that there was a short in the wiring.It doesn’t seem possible it was turned on since everyone in the house had been sleeping for a few hours and it had not been used since early that morning.Keep this kettle unplugged when not using it!!"
"Received this as a gift, the kettle is cute and warms quickly. However, the thermometer seems to have been stripped out straight from the manufacturer as the nut is constantly falling off. I expect better from  a brand new kettle."
"It’s really bad, doesn’t work and it doesn’t last even a month. Do not buy!"
"I used this kettle for less than a month and it stopped heating water. Before, when it worked, the kettle would take a very long time to heat the water and it was very very loud."
Not worth for the price it charged and not working properly
"Nice shape, but not solid like other kettles. Material is thin. The seller did not honor its advertised promotion."
"The kettle's black design gives it a modern and elegant look, making it a great addition to any kitchen. The automatic shut-off feature ensures safety and prevents the kettle from boiling dry, providing peace of mind during use. Its ergonomic handle and easy-pour spout make handling and pouring effortless, reducing the risk of spills."
"Ninja products just aren't what they used to be. I used this daily when after only a few months, it decided that all the water was better off on my coffee cart then it was inside the kettle. This thing sprung a gigantic leak overnight. Ninja customer service was a pain, and after paying $16 in shipping for a replacement kettle (not the base), I was specifically assured by the rep that it would be the same exact blue color I ordered. (notice that this is $40 more expensive than the same machine with just the stainless kettle on Amazon) I paid dearly just for that color, and wouldn't you know it, the bright silver stainless one shows up instead. After calling Ninja warranty support again and explaining this, they basically told me to kick rocks and that they weren't going to do anything about it. I should have spent my time and money elsewhere. Also, please note that they ESPECIALLY don't care about you if you bought this on Amazon. Stay away from this faulty kettle. Read all the reviews about it leaking."
"The folks at Ninja do a pretty good job, and this is no exception. It's attractive, heats quickly, and the preset temps are a nice feature - esp. since you can easily fine-tune the temp from there.It's a fine kettle, but for one veeerrrrryy silly design decision: if you lift the kettle off the stand, the cycle is cancelled. This is true even if you have selected ""Hold Temp"". If you're doing multiple pours over time (as I often need to do) then you have to push the start button again every time you return the kettle to the stand. Annoying! Also, there is no way to silence the beeps. This would be a nice feature for people who live in a studio apartment and have a sleeping partner, child or guest."
"The products heats very well and relatively quickly; however, I was expecting it to keep the water warm for at least 30-45 minutes.  It did not."
"I was hoping to get an electric kettle I could control to the actual degree. Lots of useful preset options but it’s a shame that you can’t control it to the actual degree. You can go up or down in increments of 5 degrees but only preset options can end is something other than 0 or 5. Heats quick, sounds are friendly and fun. The outside of the kettle gets really hot. Not sure if I would call it an upgrade from my less advanced electric kettle. I would consider getting it on sale."
"Bought the Ninja Electric kettle in August 2023 because we wanted one with temperature control.  Absolutely loved it.  Now, in February 2024, the temperature isn't working right.  When using the coffee button (200 degrees, and often adding 5+ for 205 degrees) it isn't heating as hot as the temperature display shows.  It is still displaying 200 or 205 but we know it's not that hot because you can tell the temperature is much lower when drinking the coffee.  Checked the bottom of the kettle and cleaned the base to see if something might be interfering, but all clear. Really disappointed it only lasted 6 months."
"We have not had great luck with our electric tea kettles. We had gone through two kettles from another brand and after the second warranty replacement with that brand we decided to try the Ninja as we've been happy with their other products.  The Ninja kettle we got died in the first week we used it. We promptly contacted Amazon and they sent a new one.  So far so good, maybe the first one was just a dud.  Can't really recommend it at this point because we have yet to see if it will last. The things we do like about it are the color/appearance, variable temp and ability to keep warm."
"Needed to be replaced after 2 years of regular use. Other than that, it was a good product while it lasted."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Pros: I love the temperature control and that at some of the lower temp settings, I can steep my Turkish tea for 15 minutes and keep it at the temp. The wide opening would make it easy to clean when needed. (I have not needed to yet.)However...... This was a Christmas gift and was not used until late December. I used it 8 or 9 times and loved it, until it leaked yesterday. I thought that perhaps I'd accidentally spilled some tea from the pot or my cup, so I cleaned it up and enjoyed the rest of my tea as there was still tea in the pot. Today, I put a paper towel under the teapot, just in case it was leaking. And it is leaking.As I love my morning tea and the microwave doesn't regulate water temperature, I'm sad to have to exchange this. I am exchanging instead of returning and if the replacement works well, I will update my rating.**Strangely, I tried to register this on the Ninja website for an extended 3 year warranty and it won't accept their own model number. I used the QR code on the bottom of the base and it took me to the registration site. I entered the exact model and serial number as printed on the QR sticker and Ninja claims it isn't valid. I'll try again with the replacement and update then."
"Works and is pretty fast at heating up 2-3 cups at a time but takes significant time to do a full pot. The second it hits the temp you set it to, it immediately starts losing heat... fast. Ill have a pot hit 200 degrees and within 5 minutes of being hitting temp, it will now read 165. 35 degree difference in 5 minutes is insane temp loss. On top of that it does NOT hold temp at all. The light will turn on but it will NOT hold temps no matter what."
"After only a few months of use the kettle started rusting inside..Then, after the 2-year warranty expired the kettle started acting funny: would start to boil/heat the water to the desired temp, randomly turn of, refuse to turn on, etc. Kept in the same place, clean/dry during use. Was frustrating to hit the start button, walk away, and come back to the same temperature (or slightly warmer) water than when I pressed start. (Called Ninja support, since was past the warranty period they couldn't help - they did try and I appreciated that.)Really loved how I could set the exact temperature that I wanted for my tea/coffee/beverages. That was awesome.Unfortunately, at the price I paid and only 2 years of viable use I've decided to replace it with something else. Am very sad about this, I loved this kettle until it started acting wonky.If you don't mind maybe needing to replace your kettle after two years, then get this!"
"UPDATE 6/12/24: My original title to this review was, ""Why did I wait so long to go electric?""Now, my answer is...I think I know.When you get up in the morning and want a cup of hot tea...and the button no longer works reliably...it's annoying. We literally have to press the on/off button multiple times for it to ""catch"" and start the water boiling. Granted, it was great for the15 months we've had it. Now, it's just ANNOYING and aggravating. I'm debating on whether it's worth it to buy another one...only because I wonder if this is just an anomaly. Sigh. Why do these electronic things have to be made so poorly? We can't make something that lasts longer than 15 months? This is why we have so much trash piling up all over the world.OLD REVIEW 3/24: Seems that every stove top kettle rusts unless you spend $200+ on one. So, after trying to find a reasonably priced, aesthetically pleasing one that doesn't have issues or rust, I gave up. The reviews for this kettle were great so, I pulled the trigger. I couldn't be happier that I did. It is super easy to set up, boils consistently, looks great and it's easy to clean. I like that I've opened up more space on my stove because I can set this kettle on a table in the kitchen nook. I like this kettle so much, I bought one for my Dad for his birthday. The only thing I don't get is why the BLUE one is more expensive than the GREY one. They are the same thing but different color."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update! December 19th, 2023This product worked perfectly fine out the box the first 2 usage.Now less than a week it leaks! This is terrible. My entire countertop is soaking wet.I do not recommend this product. At all. Electrical hazard and can’t trust it can hold liquid without h it leakingAfter meticulous consideration, I finally found the perfect hot water kettle on Amazon—the Ninja KT200BL. Unlike its counterparts, this gem stands out with its flawless design and unwavering quality, addressing the common issue of leakage.The Ninja's lightweight build, user-friendly interface, and convenient water gauge immediately caught my attention. What sets it apart are the temperature settings tailored for various teas and coffee preferences, with a special nod to the remarkable stay-hold temperature feature.Picture this: a 7-cup capacity Raspberry Lemon Honey tea, steeping to perfection on Green Tea mode, preserving maximum lemon oil and citrus essence at an optimal temperature. The versatility is a game-changer, making it an indispensable tool in my daily routine.In essence, the Ninja KT200BL not only saves time and money but elevates the entire tea and coffee experience. It has become my go-to, ensuring a consistently perfect temperature beverage whenever I desire.Without hesitation, I wholeheartedly recommend this product. The Ninja brand has earned its spot as my preferred kitchen appliance provider. Don't miss out—make the wise investment in this electric kettle today for unparalleled convenience and beverage excellence."
"Theres so much to complain about this item. I bought this for a mother's day present but had to send it back because it broke. Water started leaking from the bottom and then it wouldn't read the pitcher anymore.Even if it didn't break, if your serious about your tea or coffee, then you'd want a variable temperature kettle that's ACCURATE! The unit reads the water temperature to the set temp, but it's actually over anywhere between 5 to 10 degrees (F) higher! It won't even read the correct temperature until after you take the kettle off and then put it back on, but even then its sometimes off a couple degrees. What's the point in being able to set a temperature if it wont heat it or even read it to the correct temperature?Not to mention the unnecessary amount of plastic. It doesn't even add anything aside for reading the waterline, which they could have embossed instead to make it all stainless steel. It's not insulated at all, which I assumed it would be given that theres so much plastic in the build, AND its heavy! My elderly aunt hated using it because its heavy. All that weight is on the bottom of the pitcher that probably wasn't even soldered on properly which caused it to leak.I bought this cause it's highly rated and from a trusted brand. What a disappointment. It must be rated by people that haven't had a quality electric kettle before. Even off brand variable temperature kettles I've bought for half the price before are better built. And accurate!"
"I bought this refurbished from Amazon warehouse and the lid sticks. I like it otherwise, but it’s annoying to have to pry the lid open."
"There's a lot to like about the design.  I love the color, the wide opening.  I love setting the water temp.  I used it about 4x/week for boiling water for cooking and the occasional tea.  But now it's slightly leaking, and it never hits boil.  It's such a shame.  I looked at other reviews and I am not the only person with this problem.  It seems to have hit other people around the 1 year mark too."
"This is a review 3 months into owning this product. I loved the look of Ninja products and bought this as well as some other items. 3 months in, I can safely say the product is faulty by design and now does not register the correct temperature and has stopped boiling water. It will flash on the start stop button when activated, and then deactivate a few seconds after. To address, we have to fiddle with it, and rotate on the base until a better connection occurs, and then it boils. It's temperamental and suprising this would happen 3 months in. So I contacted customer service (registered with 1 year warranty), and they wanted to do a live video demonstration of the fault. Unfortunately, since I have one of those things called a job, I was unable to do this, and they wouldn't offer a replacement without this. They sent a link for me to post a video and email to them with the ticket number, and the autoreply stated I would hear from them in 1 day. One week has gone by and still no response. Have to call back and endure another 40 minute wait at an inconvenient time, but this is how customer service is provided by Shark Ninja. So sure, go ahead and purchase, but be prepared for some major frustration if you have to reach out."
"This kettle is unsafe and completely broke just outside of warranty. We’ve been using it regularly and after just one year it completely broke. The sensor malfunctions and it will shut off once it boils. It must be completely unplugged to turn off the heat feature, and it smells like burning plastic. This is obviously a fire hazard. I usually love Ninja products, but am sadly disappointed with this one."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Review update: the new body started leaking. I can't understand what's causing it, but it heavily leaks from time to time. I still use it but with much less water. Removing one star and looking for an alternative.—————-It's been in use for less than a year when the lid lifting mechanism almost stopped working. I contacted manufacturer and was told it wasn't covered by warranty. The only way to fix it was to buy the whole new kettle body for the price of $50 without taxes and shipping cost. Insane! I took a deeper look and was able to identify the problem - rust. The small thing in lifting mechanism came out because of rust. I sent pictures to the support and they generously offered me the new kettle body for $25 including shipping cost. Even though it's clearly  manufacturing defect - why this part is not made from rust-resistant material? I accepted the offer since the absence of choices. I would not recommend buying this kettle."
"Let me first start off and say I love Ninja products. We have Ninja coffee marker, blender, and air fryer. So I was real excited about the kettle for hot water. But I’ve only had the kettle for a year and it started leaking which affected the base causing it to stop working altogether. I’m so sad and disappointed with this product."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            When we bought the kettle, we really liked it, and it functioned as it should. We only use it to heat water and have never used the hold temperature function.However, about six months after the purchase, we noticed that the control started to glitch and would reset after we pressed the boil button. Then, we noticed a puddle on the base under the kettle and thought it was from the spill when we poured water (probably ~10 months after buying it). However, we just realized the water leaked from the seam (see the video)! The constant water in the base also presents an electric shock hazard.Unfortunately, it's been 14 months since we discovered the leak, and it just passed the 12-month warranty. The customer service was nice and offered a ""50% discount"" if we bought the kettle from them directly, but it would cost $65! We are very disappointed about the situation."
"It's okay and easy to use.  However, the product box I received had been cut open before and retaped so I don't know if it had been used before or what.  A full pot takes about 7 minutes to reach boiling and that is longer than what I had expected.  Lots of reviews state it boils fast but don't list the timing so it wasn't clear what to expect."
I thought I was getting a stainless steel pot but the inside is partly plastic. I question the safety of plastic exposed to boiling water and have returned the item.
"This kettle will rust even if you air it out after every use. It happens within 3 month. Also a major heads up, Ninja DOES NOT COVER the kettle as part of its warranty, just the base. Worked flawless for 2 months till the rust starts happening in the base. So much for ""stainless steel"" quality."
The body and the lead gets hot and it is hard to open it up when the water is hot.
"Overall the kettle is great, but the water-level window oddly does not work. It fills with condensation, but not actual water. This, in itself, is a small detail, but when you pay over $80 for a kettle, all of the functions should work perfectly.What makes it worse is that I tried for 25 minutes to get in touch with Ninja's support via phone and email, but their system was unable to direct me to talk to an actual person."
It is hard trying to find a good electric kettle that is over a liter. Unfortunately this one wasn't it. It was smaller than it said it was and had a lot of plastic in it for a metal kettle. What bothered me the most was the oddly sharp edges inside the kettle and the low end scale filter. All of that and the cancer warning on the box made me return it. You would be better trying another electric kettle
"Got a great deal on the item a month ago. Great kettle when it works. Does everything as advertised but only for a month. Afterwards, it leaks from the heating coil on the bottom of the kettle.Could not use the manufactuer's 30-day warranty because we did not buy direct from Ninja. Amazon only offered for exhange of a different item so had to opt for a full refund.RIP Ninja Kettle. We enjoyed your short stay with us."
Started to show error code just after 1 year. Do not recommend.
"When I contacted customer service, a supervisor authorized a full refund. A week later and with no refund I called again and was told that they could not refund my money and can only get a replacement. No more Ninja products for me because of poor quality and terrible customer service."
There is a 1 year warranty on the BASE ONLY. I bought this kettle September 2023. Its June 2024 and this little circle on the bottom of the kettle started rusting (2 pictures included). I called and they said they could give me the body only with 70% off or replace the whole kettle&base for 70% off. At this time they only had the whole thing which would of cost me $22 dollars. Just a warning. The warranty does NOT COVER THE WHOLE THING
Don’t get if you have hard water the kettle turns off prematurelyI think because of hard water
"I really love the idea of this kettle. The telltale adjustments, the hold temp features are all things I’ve used right away but just trust I was cleaning it and noticed that there is rust forming on the spout after only a few weeks of use. How sad that a seemingly good product was so cheaply made."
I bought it in August 2024 and in 10/2024 it is already damaged.
"The first one we got leaked right out of the box, returned it and replaced with the same since I like the temperature features. New one doesn't leak however the temperature hold feature doesn't work as expected. It will hold the temperature as long as you don't remove the kettle from the stand. Once removed the temp hold no longer holds temp. Light stays lit but it doesn't kick in reheat cycles."
"Update: worked for 6 months and stopped working. Now, ""dry"" error constantly and water not boiling anymore.I had to replace my 8 years old Breville, which was made like a tank from high quality materials and thick stainless steel. I was choosing between this Ninja and Krupps smart kettle. Krupps made better, no plastic parts inside, but heavier. We have many Ninja home appliances and kept this Ninja. But, I regret. Only good thing is known Ninja double loud chime when it's done:) Steel very thin and a lot of spots after one month. Cover inside made of plastic. Be careful when push button to open boiled hot water- that cover jump up and splashes with hot water. Push and hold cover to open slowly and safe."
"We bought one and it worked for 2 months and started breaking, usually ninja is a good brand. We decided to get another one and now right when we got it shipped the button doesn’t open it’s stuck."
I liked this kettle while it worked but it developed a fault after a few months. I was outside the Amazon support window so had to work directly with Ninja support. They sent me a replacement kettle but it was the stainless steel model. When I queried this they told me the blue models are sold only to retailers and they would be unable to send me one.  They said I had no other option but to take the stainless steel model. This is poor customer service and I'll think twice about buying Shark/Ninja products in the future.
The base of the kettle controls everything and we keep getting error codes. They sent us a new base and it has the same issue. The quality is terrible.
"Everything promised to be great about this tea kettle: looks, functions, flexibility... Within 2-3 days, the lid got stuck and would not open without prying. Seems like defective design and many complains from other customers on the same issue of lid getting stuck. Will be returning."
"I have to return this tea kettle because much to my disappointmen, the inner lid is made of plastic. I didn't get further than that so cannot comment on its function or efficiency. I want a tea kettle with no plastic parts that come in contact with the water or the droplets of water that then fall into the water. So this does not work."
"Already have a Cuisinart kettle at home, but purchased this Ninja as a cheaper ""comparable"" unit for work to save $30. Quite disappointed of the quality control, especially since I have other Ninja products and love them. As soon as this kettle arrived, I followed the ""before 1st use"" instructions. The base appeared to be okay when plugged in, but when I tried to set the full kettle to boil, the kettle window never illuminated and would not heat up. Nothing I did could get the kettle to work. So returned it the very next day. Will be using my refund to invest in a 2nd Cuisinart... a little extra money, but well worth it.  Lesson learned!"
"When I bought this kettle, I didn’t realize there were plastic parts in contact with the water. I think this is unacceptable in such an expensive kettle. I returned it without even plugging it in."
Lasted 1 and half years that’s bad
I'm bummed that my kettle started rusting on the bottom after just a few months of use.
"For a ninja product , was expecting it to work. It stops halfway half the time."
"After just just a few uses the lid stopped opening. You can pry it open with your finger, but seriously, there isn't that many things the sucker needs to be able to do and for one of those things to fail is a bit ridiculous."
"This kettle is trash. Initially it worked fine, but now it will not stay on for whatever reason and I have to say in the kitchen watching for it to shut off so I can hit the start button numerous times to get the water up to temp."
"The temperature control, ease of use and all of that are great but after 5 months of use, this kettle is rusting on the inside.  I don't want to drink rusty water nor brew it into my tea so this is a wasted $99.00 kettle and I should have went for a typical $30.00 one since those last at least 8 months before throwing them away."
"It was great for the first few weeks, but started to notice the build up of rust around the rim. very poor design, especially for the price."
"I bought this since I drink yerba mate and I needed a water boiler with a temperature control function. And it did just that… for about a month. Afterwards it became pretty much useless; when I place the boiler on the plate, the display wont show anything, it only beeps and shuts off immediately. This is not the first Ninja product that fails me and I will steer clear from them. Also I think its interesting that they dont offer guarantee for this particular product."
"Had the product with light/medium usage for over 7 months and getting dry error every time I turn it on for 10 attempts and then suddenly the kettle would work. Got so frustrated with this, when we know that a 20$ kettle worked without any issues for 3 years which I had to replace as it got broken when it had a fall.Ninja had different reputation in our minds, but now on going to stay away from the brand..."
"We loved this kettle, but after 6 months of use there is a burning plastic smell every time we try to use it."
It only worked for 10 months and then the electrical system failed to work. Didn't expect this to happen at this price point.
"The illumination for the water level in the kettle died in less than two months.  Random shut offs and wonky beeping started about at about three months.  Look like a junker for the money spent, compared to the 15 year old electric kettle it replaced.  Looks like we now get to play the warranty denial gymnastics with a Ninja….  Oh Joy!"
"Great kettle while it worked, but stopped working after 5 months. First temperature started fluctuating wildly, then failed completely. Stopped heating, displayed error code. Wasted multiple calls with manufacturer who agreed to warranty replacement but failed to deliver - TWICE! Save your $ and time...  surely other more dependable kettles available elsewhere."
"Brand name didn’t work on the quality. I bought this coz it’s ninja and when I opened it, it was such a disappointment to see that there was plastic touching water . No no for me !"
"Started leaking. Had only had it for 10 months. Too bad, I really liked it, but will not purchase again. Ninja, I expect better of you. After reading the problems, it seems this is a common problem."
"I purchased this item last September, it quit work in just 6 months, I don't know what I can do with it?"
This product came with lid would not open without being pried open.
This kettle didn’t last much longer than 6 months. It just keeps turning it self off then you have to start it over and over.. so disappointed!! Especially since this thing isn’t exactly cheap…
"It worked great for two months, then it started leaking.  I can't leave water in it at night or there will be a flood on my counter.  I've had great luck with Ninja products and own several of their small appliances, but this tea pot is junk."
I paid the extra money for a new one and it definitely was not new! There were smudges all over it!
The quality was not good. I used for about 10 days and the lid couldn’t open properly. I had to press the button really hard and even use a screwdriver。
Is a beautiful kettle. But the button to release the lid does not work. Hence you have to force it open to put water in it. What a shame
Wanted to make tea 🍵 in my roomOne minute later it blew out the lightsOI
"I purchased a used kettle—silly. I did get the water to boil eventually, but it took nearly twenty minutes of constant resetting, button pushing and beeping to coax it. Definitely a return item."
Product looks nice and works well for a few months but then started having issues with the electronic panel and then stopped working all in less than 6 months. Unacceptable for the price.
The kettle worked properly for only seven months and then began to constantly turn off a few seconds after turning it on.
This kettle stops working as desired after a few months. It turns off after few seconds. They sent a replacement but it had the same exact issue after a few weeks.
"I used this product for a month, it is very nice, but very dangerous. It has a piece that rusts inside in contact with water."
The product needs to be repaired or replaced because it is still leaking water
"I got one of these for a present eight months ago, as I had wanted a temperature controlled kettle to make tea with. Since then it has worked less and less reliably, often refusing to start heating, shutting off immediately after starting, or at any point during the process. Often, unplugging it and plugging it back in will help, but that's obviously not a good solution. I also don't like the plastic parts inside it very much, I am sure it isn't good to be boiling those over and over again and drinking whatever leaches out of it.Look elsewhere for a higher quality kettle."
"Liked this for the style and functionality, but after a year of use it stopped working properly, would give error codes, or just not boil the water."
"Positives:I enjoy the ninja button interface.  Feels responsive when you press it, and the lights all automatically turn off several minutes after you stop using the kettle.Although subjective, i think the stainless steel material looks better on this than my previous hamilton beach kettle.The inside has a slightly different type of stainless steel, cant guarantee but it looks like it would be less likely to build up hard water minerals.Negatives:The plug in cable is VERY short than what im used to.  My previous hamilton beach is at least twice as long, im unsure why they do this if they want me to own multiple ninja appliances lol.The push button doesnt feel responsive and almost cheap in comparison to the rest of the kettle.  It uses a piece of plastic to push the lid open, i have my doubts over the longevity of the lid but so far the lid hasnt been stuck (it just feels like it will get stuck sometime if that makes any sense)Overall i would still recommend this for those looking for a nice kettle that has preset and manual temperature settings. I will update my review if i have any challenges with the poor construction of the push button/lid.Edit/update 1/8/2022:  i ended up returning the ninja.  I do want to point out as a positive the cord is longer than i first noticed, ninja hides the extra cord under the kettle which i didnt see at first.But for me i returned the unit because the plastic that pushes the kettle lid up was already beginning to show damage.  For just one week of use that is unacceptable to me, my hamilton beach unit has a steel panel so i will continue to use it.  I really like that ninja interface though! I took another star off because of the poor quality if plastic underneath that pushes the lid open."
"When I start the kettle , it would turn off repeatedly before hitting the set temperature . So one has to wait next to it until it reaches the temp ."
"This worked well for the week I had it after Christmas.  Lots of specific temp settings, heats up fast.  Then it just stopped working. Power would be on and I’d press the temp setting and  the start button and nothing would happen."
"This is a really nice kettle. Is it worth paying 3 times similar kettles with a few less features? I dunno... If this were $50 I'd give it five stars, but at $80-90, it's a really expensive kettle.I have multiple Ovente kettles, couple in different parts of the house, one at the office, one I travel with... they're inexpensive, have five preset temps and work well... BUT at 1100w they're a bit slow and don't have a lot of features.The Ninja kettle is 1500w and will heat 1L of water to 175 degrees in 3 minutes vs 4 minutes for the Ovente (I drink a lot of green tea, those minutes add up). Also, the Ninja has a Keep Warm function that the Ovente does not and it shows you the actual temp of the water which is very cool. Overall it is a much nicer kettle with more features. The speed is really nice as who wants to sit around and watch the kettle? And if you're really in a hurry and the temp gets to 170 you can be like 'well, that's good enough. let's go'.But... all that stuff is really just 'nice-to-haves'. The Ovente does a good job at a third of the price. If money is no object or if it's in an office where people are making tea all the time, this is a great kettle and you'll be happy with it. If you're more budget conscious, the Ovente is a great buy and will give you all the preset temps you need."
"I believe there is a big design flaw.  Yes it does what's its supposed to but the design flaw is that it warms up the whole outside body and becomes a potential Hazard issue , specially if you have kids or guests who don't know the whole surface is hot. I even burnt my hand.."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            DO NOT BUY!Very expensive and sometimes refuses to heat up, its only job..."
"We purchased this item and worked great.  then it just stopped working and had message ""Dry"".  Called customer service and they told us it was no longer working and we have to buy new one."
"I love it at first … now I’m disappointed!It turn off in the middle of getting the water hot, green, white, boil or any other setting, I have to turn it off wait and turn it again.Not good at all"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The carafe is not designed for easy cleaning. It should be scrubbed down periodically and the way the lid has a lip around the edge plus all manner of complicated surfaces in the lid, so this is going to be a pain to clean.The base has way too many buttons and lights and words to fool with upon wake-up. That’s too much confusion. Also the preprogrammed temperatures are just dumb. Do we seriously need all that confusion and chaos when we just woke up?I’m not impressed with this machine at all. I’m glad it heats the water and I welcome suggestions for a better kettle. This is not it"
Very dangerous if you touch the stainless steel by mistake you burn your hand
"I bought this kettle after replacing my previous Hamilton beach kettle that I had for 5 years. 1.5 years into the ninja kettle use, it stopped working. The light would flicker in the kettle and required numerous prompts to get it to boil. Eventually it gave out and their warranty is only 1 year. I should note that I used the kettle once daily and kept it in pristine condition. Great features but the longevity of this device is poor. All of my other products are Ninja but I will be going in a different direction for kettles."
The overall quality is goodBut the main flaw is the whole thing heats up.The whole surface which is metal.  And because of that it becomes a hazard. Would avoid it if you ba e kids
"The kettle looks good and the reviews I read are great. However I bought this for my parents for Christmas, didn’t think of checking in the box…. Sadly it came with a US plug not UK. Technically this is not a proper review as it’s not able to be used! Rather disappointed, will be returning, but unable to replace this as currently unavailable. So for the plug issue I am giving only 2 stars!"
"It started because I ruined my stove top kettle by turning on the wrong burner (whoops!)Checked out Amazon for electric kettles in this was one of the most highly reviewed items in the list. I went for it and just recently unboxed it and this was my experience:Unpacking was easy. It wasn't so tightly packed in that I had to destroy any part of the box and the instructions were right on top as well as the warranty registration information.It came in two parts, the main kettle and the base. Plugging in the base was a little inconvenient because it has a very robust electrical cord. Tip to the manufacturer if they might be looking at this review: Upgrade to a right-angle plug.The base is also very lightweight. Being a base, that might not be such a good thing as it is very want to flip over from the rigidity of the cord. It does have very nice rubber feet on the bottom though.Looking at some of the other reviews, I inspected the kettle & the base for damage or imperfections and found none. In fact, I was pleased to find that one of the largest complaints (being that the lid opens at only 45 degrees and can't fit a human hand for cleaning) was not true for my unit, as seen in the pictures. I have medium-ish sized hands and it was a bit of a squeeze, but I know I'll be able to get a scotch pad inside and scrub it down from time to time.Now comes the moment of truth! Does it boil water quickly and efficiently?Well, that all comes down to your interpretation of ""quickly"".I started out with one liter of water cold from the tap, as it's an easy metric to use.From the moment I turned the switch ON to the moment the kettle turned itself OFF after boiling was just over five minutes, which coincides with other reviews suggesting that the full 1.8 l takes about 8 minutes.That said, I was surprised to find that when the auto-off feature activates, it physically toggles the switch on the handle back to the off position, much like a rice cooker does.Conclusion?For about $20 at the time of this purchase, this is a fantastic buy. I have a particularly small kitchen and I value my stove top space. On top of that, my entire abode is electric, so anything that will cut down on that bill in particular is a win in my books. Really it's a simple question:Does this electric kettle do the electric kettle stuff?It does for me.I gave this 4 stars as of the unboxing based on the metrics. 5 stars for ""safety"" and 3 stars for ""easy to clean"" and 5 stars for... Performance? It pours nicely into a mug.I go through a lot of hot water with coffee and tea and whatnot, so I'll update this review after a few months and give an update to its longevity, as I've seen a few reviews talk about how their units cut out after a couple of months.UPDATE: a few days later I've noticed discoloration on the heating element inside the cattle. It would be nice if the entire casing was glass in the heating element was placed underneath to avoid this issue, but like I said before it's not much for a $20 purchase. What is more prominent inconvenience is that the lid requires you to press down in order for it to pop up and it's a bit of a balancing act. I find myself pressing the button multiple times before the lid finally releases. A stronger spring would be nice to avoid this issue. The last bit is that it's not very easy to drain. I want to avoid keeping water in it, but even putting it upside down the glass has a bit of a lip at the top that keeps water inside. I have to manually dry the inside which is a little bit of a pain. All things said and done, I'm going to keep it at 4 stars for now as I suspected little hiccups here and there for such a low priced object.FINAL UPDATE:I've decided to return the item. the lid is just not very well designed. I understand people's complaints about squeezing their hand inside to clean it, but for me the way the release mechanism directly counteracts the opening of the lid was just too annoying to deal with on a regular basis. You have to push down on the button for the lid to pop up, but the spring for the button is stronger than the spring for the hinge, so as you released the button the lid simply relocks before it can lift up. Ultimately, I had to push the button multiple times for the lid to hopefully open to be refilled.Returning the item was easy as I could drop it off at my nearest UPS store. I have a different kettle on order and I will post a review on that page."
"This is my third kettle, 2nd in a year, by Mueller. Aesthetically I like it a lot. If I have to watch water boil it might as well be in a glass kettle with blue ambient light.But that's as far as it goes. My first kettle worked fine for up to 2 years. Used it once a day for morning coffee and then one morning it just wouldnt start.So I bought another. Within 4 months, outside the Amazon return window and the return policy for Mueller wasn't worth the expense.  shipping back was on me so boxing it up, paying shipping would cut into half the price of kettle so I opted to buy another one.Yes. Three strikes and Mueller is out. This third one would start to boil and midway click off as if lukewarm was perfect for any cup of coffee or tea. Used tape to hold down button and I flicked it off when boiling.Now, like the first one, it doesn't want to work.I'll buy another brand and take my chances.Oh, I don't use tap water in the kettle either. I use spring water and filter it thru a ZERO filter so I don't have to worry Abt scale buildup so it's definitely not that. No scale ever builds up."
"Rating: 3.0 - 3.5 starsThe Negatives:1) The lid release button gets hotter than you might suspect.The external surface of the lid stays hot for a quite a while after use (obviously more so if you haven’t used all the water). While this isn’t ideal, it’s not the primary reason I knocked off a star; the unfortunate design choice is more the Lid Release Button. It’s a large silver-colored circle located in the center of the lid, and it somehow manages to feel hotter to the touch than the surrounding plastic. This was a less-than-pleasant surprise that I discovered when dutifully following the manual’s pre-use instructions (boil a batch of water, pour it out, rinse the kettle). It’s not so hot that it’s a hazard—it just seems bizarre to me that the button people are supposed to press would be hotter than they might expect based on the surrounding plastic.2) The large on/off switch is on the handle near the top, so it’s easy to hit with the palm of your hand.This typically happens when there’s water in the kettle, since a full kettle feels the most balanced to me when my grip is around the top of the handle. This is lower on my list of gripes, though, because I think you’re more likely to flip the switch to the off position rather than on, and I’m not sure whether it would be actually be problematic to have the kettle already switched on when you put it on a plugged-in power base. I would assume not, so the placement of the switch is likely more of an annoyance than an actual problem.3) The power cord doesn’t quite fit in the notch in the side of the base where the cord is supposed to exit.The notch is sufficiently tall but too narrow, so you have to press the cord in firmly. After you do, the base does lie flat as intended—it’s just an extremely tight fit, and the thought of the plastic edges scraping against the outer material of the cord makes me wince. To be fair, I don’t know whether there’s any damage to the outer coating of the cord, and I’m not going to take the cord back out of the notch just to inspect it for this review. I just wanted to mention that the coating around the cord might not hold up if it’s repeatedly pushed in and removed (since you’d be giving the edges more chances to actually carve a groove in the coating).The Positives (beyond the fact that it is functional):1) The blue glow is a fun touch.2) The on/off switch makes a notable and satisfying click when you press it, similar to a key on a mechanical keyboard.Overall, I’d say this kettle is worth the money if it’s on sale, as I think the positives do outweigh the negatives (particularly once you’re aware of said negatives). I just wouldn’t recommend paying full price for it."
Bought this kettle in 2023. It died last week after two and a half years use. The on/off switch failed. Up until last week I was very happy with it.
Nothing wrong with product except I have reservation about the plastic lid & filter.  Boiling water & vapor in contact with plastic is not ideal for consumption.
"Nowhere here is there a good place to see it on the site, but this Mueller ""Living"" is made in China now, poorly. I have purchased probably half a dozen of this particular product over the last decade for various job site. It went from being produced in and around Austria (Germany usually) to being made in china and having the living label tacked to it. The last one that I purchased about two weeks ago is offensively poorly constructed. The mold lines for the plastic are visible and sharp, the base which used, on previous models at least, to be of appropriate weight is not now. The base is so light that if you unplug it, the cord is heavier than the base and will pull it off the table if the glass kettle is not on top of it. I am considering double taping it to the table to prevent it from sliding off while in use. I will add pictures next time I am in this office to show its quality. I have no complaints yet about its boiling capabilities, but I have yet to time it against either European versions that I have. I just wish that the price drop over time did not reflect a commiserate drop in quality."
"I guess it boils water fine and I like the lights, but i have a hard time getting the lid to open. There is something messed up with the mechanism. Also I've noticed that there is now a jangling sound like seething is rattling around inside the base of the pitcher. It also doesn't boil as fast as I hoped."
"It started off fine, but after about 2 months it would shut off early.  There's nothing in the literature to show of the sensor can be reset and not stop early.  The only option is to hold the switch down until water actually boils.  For the price, I'm sure there are better options"
"It heats the water good. That's what it's supposed to do so check.  Unfortunately, the lid doesn't come off and I can't get my hands in there to clean the darn thing."
Was working for a long time but button switch quit.  I would prefer to make purchases that last.
It works fine. I’ve had it for 3-4yrs and it’s grown what seems like mold from the inside bottom. Which is weird because it always has water so not sure how to prevent that. But it does its job. Just sad I have to buy another one. Probably will try another brand
Well. It was great till it died 11 months later. I made at least 2 cups a day. Didn't ask very long. This review  is for the muller tea kettle
"The handle is large at the top then narrows down. When I have the maximum water I can not comfortably or safely hold and pour, it takes two hands and the one holding the handle usually slides down the length to the narrow bottom of the handle as I tilt the teapot. The teapot itself works well but I have to do three fills with smaller volumes to fill my ice tea pitcher."
"We purchased this kettle in August, and after three months of use, it started malfunctioning. Initially, it would occasionally stop working while in use, but as of today, it has completely broken down. Although it can turn on, it stops functioning within a few seconds.11/19 The customer service is great. Problem solved."
"I bought this a couple years ago and used it every day. I loved it at first. Over time it took longer and longer to boil water.Today when I used it, there was water all over the counter. It came from the kettle. I saw that the spacer between the base of the pot and the glass portion had melted. Fortunately I was not harmed but came very close to being burned."
When you pick up pot after heating the bottom plate sticks and you have to use both hands to pull apart. Hope it will loosen eventually !
"Edited: After contacting the manufacturer 3 times after the kettle failed while still under warranty, they notified me they would replace the kettle with a new one. I did not have to send the old one back. Within 2 days, I received a replacement. My advice for anyone who has had a problem with a kettle within the 1 year warranty window: keep contacting them until you get a reply. They were slow to reply to me, but were very responsive once they made contact. For now, I am happy.A month ago, I would have left a five star rating for this kettle. I purchased this kettle in July 2023. We’ve loved it. It’s heated water faster than if I put a kettle on my gas stove. Suddenly, it stopped working. Don’t know if it’s the base unit or the electronics inside of the kettle. It has only been used by 2 adults that have not mishandled or misused this product. Press the handle to turn it on … nothing. The product comes with a 1 year warranty, so I emailed the manufacturer, along with an image of my Amazon receipt. A week later, I left a message with their chat bot, which acknowledged that someone would be contacting me. Three weeks later, no one has contacted me. I expected this item to last more than 10-1/2 months. Maybe it’s a fluke, but I am disappointed, and their customer service is nonexistent."
After 8 months would not boil a full pot before shutoff only half pots would boil.
Stopped working after 7 months. But I really liked it until then.
"good capacity,  but broke after only 5 months.emailed customer service and they helped me right away and are sending a replacement."
Worked great for two years and then suddenly stopped working. Took the bottom off and cleaned the contacts and it still won’t work. I wish they made appliances that last as long as they used to.
"I purchased the Mueller Ultra Kettle (Model No. M99S 1500W) with high hopes based on the positive reviews, but unfortunately, I've encountered a significant issue that has me concerned. After a few uses, I noticed that small rubber or plastic parts inside the kettle have started coming loose and floating in the water. This is both frustrating and unsettling, as I’m now worried about potential safety risks, especially since the kettle is intended for boiling water.The kettle itself performs well in terms of boiling speed, and I appreciate the sleek design, but the quality control regarding the internal components seems to be lacking. It's not something I expected from a product of this price range or brand reputation.I’ve tried cleaning the kettle thoroughly, but the issue persists, and I don’t feel comfortable using it any longer due to the possibility of ingesting these plastic/rubber fragments.Unfortunately, I can’t recommend this product unless the issue is addressed in future models. I’m now considering returning it for a replacement or refund.Pros:  Fast boiling time  Attractive design  Easy to useCons:  Rubber/plastic bits coming loose into water  Concern over safety and long-term durability"
"I love its design and the basic functionality of it has become a staple in my house (probably why I bought a second one- although would I have been happier with a different brand? 🤔) the first time I bought this it was amazing- after about a year- the auto shut off broke and it became an item you needed to mind carefully once it got to boiling point. No biggie- I adjusted. Then about 2 years later it started just acting weird until it eventually just died. Not bad for roughly 3 years. I repurchased this because I got anxiety over trying to find a new one- what if I didn’t like it as much?! What if it didn’t feel as good in my hand? What if it didn’t fit the spot it’s in as well?! An anxiety nightmare- so I succumbed and purchased it again. I had hoped they would have updated the model, maybe to fix those quirks and while I have yet to run into any of the previous aforementioned issues this model is a bit wobbly on its base. And on the original base (yes I tried - and while it still works it also still wobbles) 🤷🏼‍♀️ sometimes the open button gets a little stuck but nothing I haven’t already lightly dealt with on the other one. I overall give it 3 stars- depending on the life of the current one- that may change."
"I loved the first of these I purchased, which lasted more than two years. I replaced it with an identical kettle which, unfortunately, lasted only 9 months. However, they do have a customer service system that seems quite responsive."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            tl;dr: Works great, but beware that it will likely last just over a year and out of warranty. If you are looking for something longer lasting, look elsewhere.Pros: Boils water quickly and the blue light provides a nice aestheticCons:- Small opening makes it very difficult to clean the inside- Mesh over lip fell off in the first 6 months showing that it’s not the highest quality- After owning it for about a year the on/off toggle switch suddenly stopped working."
"I loved this kettle. Super easy to use, boils water super fast and it’s super hot and shuts off on its own when it’s finished. All that to say it stopped working in a little over a year."
"Easy, reliable, until 22 months after purchase when it inexplicably stopped working. Always clean, never exposed the base to water."
"This kettle was a replacement for my 8-year old Hamilton Beach kettle which started to leak. This kettle looks nice and heats water fine, but it sticks to the base after it’s done boiling water.I was going to return it and get a new Hamilton Beach kettle but the product box got wrecked so now I am stuck with this sticking kettle."
"This is my 2nd Mueller kettle. I liked the first one but after years of use the inside metal plate began to show signs of rust. But I liked it enough to replace it. The 2nd one has problems: 1) the top doesn't fit tightly so the liquid comes out between the top & the filter. 2) the bottom doesn't fit tightly on the heating part so it wobbles a little. One plus though - it's a lot faster at heating the water, but this causes more condensation inside. I'd like to be able to dry it out between uses but the opening is too narrow. So I do what I did with the first one & leave the lid open until I remember to close it."
Cheaper materials.  Not as easy to use.  Works fine though.  I'm keeping it because I like Mueller overall.  But I want the old model back.  Sigh.
"I needed to replace my old electric kettle, so based on all those great reviews (and the price), I decided to get this one. Yes, it works fine. It heats quickly and is slightly smaller than my old kettle, which makes it a little lighter, which is a bonus. However, I wouldn't buy this model again. The on/off switch is high up on the handle, which I'm finding annoying (note to self: be more careful when I'm searching, and be sure to buy the next one with the switch at the base). What's more problematic is that when I pick it up and pour, enough steam is released around the handle that it's nearly too hot to hold. To avoid the steam, I have to pick it up quite low down on the handle, and that makes pouring a hassle, which is annoying as well."
"I've purchased two of these kettles over the past couple of years, overall just fine but the appliance stops working after about a year."
I purchased this item not even 3 months and it stopped working.  I didn’t have the box to return it so I had to throw it out.  The switch would turn on but the kettle would not begin to heat.  The glass look was beautiful but I was highly disappointed that it stopped working so soon.
It does the job but lid never opens  Have to fill up by using pour sprout.  Would not recommend
"I considered this to be a 5-star product when I first got it. It looks nice and all, but two big design features we enjoyed in my house was the very simple opening it allows and the easy power switch. It's not obvious to anyone without finger problems, but those are hugely beneficial for persons with arthritis/knuckle pain, especially when they use the kettle several times a day.I purchased the kettle in September, and now in November, it has been flaking out on me, and there's no apparent reason for it. We flip the switch to get water cooking, but nothing happens. The lights don't turn on and it just sits there as if it's unplugged. When it first happened, we thought it was a circuit breaker thing, but everything else nearby and even in the same power outlet had power just fine.We just left the power switch turned on and were frustratingly annoyed. After a while (20 or 40 minutes maybe), poof, the lights just came on and it started heating the water like normal.After that one time a week or two ago, we were concerned, but didn't really take any action. Now today, it has happened several times. Our previous kettle was fine and served us for a few years before we decided to replace it with this.This thing barely lasted two months, and now we're placing an order for something else. If you decide to buy this, keep your fingers crossed, and hope that it won't just randomly refuse to work for no reason at all."
Bought in July of 2023 and button just went out.  Had little over a year.
"I added one star because, while it worked, it did the one thing it was supposed to do: it boiled water.  After a year, it started having problems starting and staying running.  A small (1/3 full) pot would come to a boil, but a full pot would shut off early.  And if I refilled the pot when it was warm, it would fail to start until it completely cooled down.  Eventually (after about 14 months), it stopped heating up entirely, and I had to throw it out.  I would disregard people's reviews praising ""Mueller quality"" - I certainly didn't see it in this, and I won't be buying another Mueller product."
I’ve had mine a month and sometimes when it starts getting hot the light flashes on and off severaltimes. Normally it just heats up and turns off like it is supposed to. Its been plugged in constantly so theres no reason to expect a short in the cord.
"I had bought for someone as a gift but they already had one so I set it in a closet until I moved one year ago and pulled it out to use during the move. I loved it, the ease, the efficiency, the blue lights, the speed and I began to  use it everyday, several times a day. Then at about 13 months of use, I noticed the handle was sometimes too hot to touch with my hands, and that steam was pouring out of the tab on the  handle that  would burn my hand if I didn't wait several minutes for the steam to abate. Then one day I put it on, went do do something quick and came back to see half the water had boiled away, and water was pooled all over the counter from steam and all over the hot plate for the kettle. This breakdown of parts is very disappointing as I think something should last for more than a year, and it is now dangerous unless I babysit the kettle for each use. And it could be dangerous  - hot steam, hot handle - what if a visitor tried to grab it  and burnt themselves."
"I really liked everything about this electric kettle. But without warning it stopped working today. I purchased it April 2023, didn't even work for 18 months. Disappointed, my last one, different brand worked for years."
I use this at least once a day and after buying two of these here is what i found.1) it’s not made in Austri or germany it’s made in China and Mueller currently had a class action lawsuits over misrepresentation of this detail i got the paperwork as all did that bought it.2) the Kettle leaks at the base intermittently so you could have a pool of water if your not watching it and very dangerous esp since it’s boiling hot.3) the on switch in the handle sometimes will not power in the kettle as the leads get loose/corroded i had to take apart my second one and clean the contacts to work.When it works and doesn’t leak it’s great but it doesn’t last as i had bought two in last two years that both had same problems leaking and power button on handle stopped working usually due to corrosion on contacts.  I’m going to buy one not from china and that is stainless as these just have too many problems. Most of the reviews on here are after a month or less and haven’t had time to see these issues.
I've owned several electric kettles over the years. Last few have been made out of glass and would lit up when the kettle is heating water. When a spring popping up the cap broke in the previous kettle after a few years I was on the market for a new one. It's hard to chose from many brands available today so we went with a recommendation by a reputable magazine to buy a Mueller kettle.When it arrived it looked just like any other cheap kettle - lots of black plastic everywhere.The thing that immediately bothered me was an obvious design flow - the button is position on top of the cap and to open it you're applying force to close it. It took several attempts to open it from the very beginning and it's only getting worse with time.The second thing that started happening to this kettle is much worse and I might stop using it altogether and replace it soon if it gets worse. You can't leave this kettle unattended because it shuts off well before the water starts boiling. The switch will not stay on after it happened and I have to hold it pressed for a couple minutes so it actually boils water. It doesn't look like a safety feature and there is no reason I see that could be causing it. It might do ok for a few days before it'd start doing it again.Next time I will probably buy a more expensive kettle with temperature control. It's hard to find a glass one with this feature though.
"I bought this one to replace our previous electric kettle- it still worked but the lever was getting tetchy. It has several features I liked-a glass body to see the water, and a wider lid so you could clean more easily. But only lasting 24 months is pathetic. The one it replaced was >7 years old and still functioning, albeit temperamental."
"Heats water fast and blue light is cool, but the flip lid opening is narrow and is not removable."
"I love the way this kettle heats water; however, after a month, the lid stopped popping open when I depressed the release button.  At times, it takes 10 - 15 pushes on the button before it opens.  Of course, the window to return has passed, so I am ""stuck"" with this faulty kettle."
"The lid is a push-button design, which jammed and would no longer open within 1 week of purchase. Also the button to turn on the kettle is in the same place that other kettle put a button to open the lid, which was a bit weird.I also did not like the way the handle feels in the hand. It tapers to be much thicker at the top, which makes it feel like it's going to slip through your hand and tip forward.Otherwise it did seem sturdy and boiled water fairly quickly. I also liked the clear glass, and that the entire bottom is lit blue when on, so it was easy to see from a distance whether it had finished boiling or not."
"I really wanted to like this electric kettle; it has a nice appearance and worked well in the beginning (not too loud, the light up feature is nice and boils up pretty quickly). However, I had to return the first order, due to having a missing filter. Once the return was validated, a replacement was sent out (that was when I originally purchased the kettle). Fast forward one year, the boiling speed is slower and three months later, the kettle no longer works. So, three months past the 1-year limited warranty…it had to be thrown out and produce more waste..,even though this was supposed to be a better quality product. Now, we did use it frequently…but, it’s still a bit of a disappointment. I hope this review helps and I hope that you have a longer lasting product, should you decide to purchase it yourself."
Used daily for approximately 45 days and for no apparent reason the carafe cracked. Disappointed.
"I loved my Mueller kettle but then it stopped working a couple months ago, less than a year after i bought it.  I have to press the button 6-7 times each time for it to start boiling water.  The blue light also goes away immediately and it took 6-7 times for it to stay on.  i am so disappointed that it lasted only 1 year!!  i was really liking it until then!"
"Updated 12/13I emailed customer service regarding my defective kettle and they promptly initiated shipment of a replacement kettle.  They did not require that I return the defective kettle which saved me the hassle of packaging and trip to the post office.  Customer service was fast and efficient.  However, before emailing customer service, I tried calling them multiple times using the phone number listed on their website and got an automated response saying there was no one available to assist me.  Very frustrating.  So I would avoid calling and just send email!  I am going to upgrade my review to 3.5 stars based on great customer service. If the kettle last for 1 year, I’ll upgrade to a higher rating.Original reviewPurchased the Mueller glass kettle on Sept 13.  Started using in early October.  Worked for two months and now will not turn on when I press the power button.  Trying to initiate a return or replacement for a new kettle.  Will update once I can speak to a rep to initiate the replacement."
The kettle wiggles and doesn't fit right with the base.
"2 years in, steam started coming out of the handle and the off/on switch, so had to wait to pour til it cooled a bit or risk getting burned.3 years in, the switch only turns kettle on for a second before dying.I do not recommend this product if you're looking for quality items that last. Happy to adjust my rating if the company makes good on their long-lasting promise."
"I can’t speak to its longevity, but here are my observations after using it awhile.PRO:1. Stylish design.2. The pot seems to be of solid build quality.3. Water heats very quickly in under 5 minutes.CON:1. Ergonomics—The handle is Very Thick and Wide, and with squared edges makes it a bit ungainly and uncomfortable to hold, especially so because the pot is relatively large and heavy.  It also feels unbalanced when holding.  The effect is obviously more pronounced for smaller and/or weaker hands and arms.  Do you really want a pot this big?  It may be handy if you serve 8 or more people at the same time.  In addition added weight, a larger pot takes up more real estate and adds to the price.2. No Thermal Control—The pot is non-thermal and cools down quickly, and there is no feature to maintain a desired temperature afterward like a coffee maker, so you need to manually restart the thing between cups and wait on it.  (Another reason why the pot doesn’t need to be so big.)3. Noise—exceptionally Loud when heating.  If you need to communicate w/someone, best go to another room, and perhaps shut the door.4. LEDs—more novel than functional.  The pot shuts itself off and the loud noise immediately ceases when the water begins to boil, and the pot is see-through.  So not sure what the benefit is to justify the added cost of LEDs. There are several reviewer complaints associated with cracks forming in the plastic casing housing them, and LED failures.5. Base Issues—The base is so light it tends to move when you’re trying to the place the pot back down on it.  It’s also difficult to place it just where you want it and keep it there because the cord is so thick and inflexible.  When you plug it in the cord will tell You where it wants the base to be.6. Cleaning—The narrow opening on top restricts entry to smaller hands.  And its fixed.  For those w/hands not small enough, you will likely need a long-stemmed bottle/glass/dish brush to scrub the interior.This pot is very stylish, but at a cost to convenience and practicality, and perhaps longevity."
"stopped working after less than one year. Still turns on, but the thermal turn off switch is acting up. Sometimes it turns off after just a few seconds, way before boiling, at other times it will not turn on after just completed a heat up cycle. I descale every 3 month, there was no a trace of limestone in the pot as the water here is not very hard and we use filtered water most of the time anyway. My old electric kettle lasted a few years, so I would not recommend this one.Update - reached out to their customer service (external web site) and they agreed to replace the unit under warranty. Upgraded from 1 star to 3 star. Customer service is good, the quality of the product questionable. Maybe I only got a bad unit. Let's hope the new unit will last longer than a year."
"I have owned this kettle and other similarly designed glass electric kettles now for the last 3-4 years. There is some sort of design flaw where, after a year of daily use, the terminals become corroded in the switch on the handle. This most recent time, my spouse found videos on YouTube and tried to fix it. But every time it wad fixed, it would stop working again within a matter of few days. Such a bummer.If you don’t mind replacing your electric kettle every year, it’s a fast-boiling and efficient kettle that we have genuinely enjoyed using on a daily basis. But if you want a kettle that lasts longer than a year, I recommend looking elsewhere. I am disappointed that this kettle isn’t better made, especially since it’s glass."
"I like that heats up the water very quick. What worries me is it turns on and heats up by itself even when it doesn't have water, and so I have to unplug it whenever I'm not using it."
"Overall the water kettle functions well. The handle is not designed in an ergonomic way and is too large for normal-sized hands to grab comfortably. It's about right at the lower end, but the diameter gets larger at the top. The button that opens the lid from the start is finicky. One can't push it down in the middle, but has to push along one edge to get it too open. Not a good start for a new product.The LED light ring that turns on when in operation is nice enough, but more of a gimmick, since it unnecessarily lights up the whole area around the kettle. I've had others that have a simple on/off switch with a built-in light which is more than sufficient to see that the unit is on.It does the job, but I wouldn't buy this model again if I had the choice."
"We have had this Mueller kettle for more than two years now and have loved it. Unfortunately, the removeable mesh filter in the spout has recently shredded and is unusable. I have reached out to Mueller, but they do not sell or provide a replacement for the filter. They have offered me 20% off to buy an entirely new kettle. I bought Mueller because I expected high quality; unfortunately, a mesh filter like this one is clearly a weak spot in the design, with a high likelihood of failure. I regret to say that I discourage the purchase of this kettle."
