"I’ve had a couple of these, I’d suggest spending a little more for something that is better quality"
"Nice selfie stick, nice tri pod but no instructions on using the remote.  Bluetooth hooked up and still no luck. Decent quality though."
"This is very solid and meets the advertised specifications. Linking the button to the phone was a snap. Solid purchase..... SEE EDITED UPDATE BELOW:Okay.... I initially gave this a 5 star review. Changing to 2 stars, and that's generous. Upon my second time using it, it worked fine for a while.... Until it didn't. This was after successful pairing and several shots (iPhone). So yes, the setup was correct and working. Then it just stopped working. I swapped out the battery (they provided a spare). Still didn't work. I then re-initialized the bluetooth. No go. My iPhone was connected as normal. Looks like I will return this. Disappointing."
It is a good product except for a couple things:- The legs can’t be closed. They feel like they will break. The beams from centeral shaft to legs are poor material.- The remote lock is not solid. It will fall.
"UPDATE: the seller reached out to me, unsolicited, and offered a full refund. Still not a fan of this item, but I trust this seller and would feel perfectly secure in purchasing some thing else from them. There’s a lot to be said for excellent customer service.I use this for two months and it has completely fallen apart. I have been duct taping it back together for a while but now it won’t even stay extended. Absolute trash."
We got this to use on my husbands buisness when he goes live. It's not great nore bad. It works though.
Works as it should however I use it for roof photos 2-3 days a week and the phone attachment is already loose after just 2-3 weeks of use
It works really great and very compact to take to the gym. UNFORTUNATELY mine did break about 2 months in but the return window is closed. So sad because I really did love the product
"The overall is good, with the size and stability. The worst thing of this selfie stick is the remote. It is not a good place for the remote socket at the base, that’s makes the remote to flip away easily. I used this selfie stick for the first time and the remote was gone and got lost!"
"i like the overall design and length, but it sure isnt very sturdy.the slightest breeze rocks it.  trying to figure out a way to stabilize or weigh it down.cant be bothered to send it back since its ok, otherwise"
"I had high hopes for this tripod, I really do. Unfortunately, the whole thing was not stable at all. Furthermore, the three legs have to be manually opened, and they were made of plastic (minus points, in my book) When closing them, beware of your fingers and hands, the legs snap shut with an enormous force.I felt uneasy putting my phone on it (and the tripod wasn't fully extended) The whole thing wobbled for several seconds (and this was indoors) I was worried for my phone.I can't recommend this."
We bought this a few months ago and had never used it until we took it on our recent trip. To our surprise we were unable use it and the part where you put the phone would not stay standing and would fall back. Very frustrating that we cannot even return it. Do not recommend!
The remote control isn't secure in it's holder and could easily fall out and get lost.
"This is the second selfie stick I purchased, the other one was more flimsy so I bought this one because it was more sturdy. I tried to collapse it and the plastic snapped right off, this product was only used for about a month. Very disappointed."
It wobbles terribly.  Can’t film video with this tripod.  Any slight movement causes this thing to wobble for 30 seconds or more.
"Dislike your product, set up is unclear and remote doesn't work. Information is left out. Will not recommend! Go back to the drawing board."
"Very light, cheap and top heavy even for iPhone 12 I can’t imagine putting a camera on here."
"But… this one wasn’t a great one, the remote doesn’t work for snapping photos :( it only works to turn up the volume which is not the reason I bought this. I’m sad about it cause I was really impressed with the two black ones I bought. Also I’ve tried all the troubleshooting to fix the issue and nothing has worked."
"What I ordered and what it looks like on the box is a telescoping feature, but it is JUST a short stick that you can use as a stand for your phone."
Not simple
I like this light weight and compact phone tripod and have been used it to take videos of my tennis practices. The phone holder was just suddenly broken on one side yesterday after 2 months of usage and now it becomes a piece of garbage. It can’t hold my phone now. Feel a waste of money and cheap plastic. Hope they can manufacture a better quality so the product can last longer please
Unable to separate selfie stick
"I liked how compact and light this was,  but when I put an iPhone 14 Pro Max on it the holder was unstable.  Each time I closed it the remote fell out. It's going back."
"The tripod itself is ok. It’ll work. But, the remote control is useless. It only controls the volume on my phone. I expected it to let me control the shutter at least. That’s the feature I needed. I can’t think of a reason why I’d need to control my phone volume when recording a video or taking a picture."
I don't recommend this product. The remote is attached to the side but there is nothing protecting it. We lost the remote somewhere which made the product unusable.
When this package was delivered the remote control was missing and I try to replace it
Phone attachment broke quickly.
"This was purchased for my 88 y o father. Within 14 days it toppled over and broke the phone holder. Cheap plastic snapped off and entirely useless  You get what you pay for @ 15.00 too cheap.UPDATE: THOUGH I DIDNT ASK FOR A REFUND, THIS SELLER DID REFUND IT FULLY."
My wife and I are Youtubers so we use these sort of things (Tripod / Selfie stick) everyday. The very first time I pulled the tripod out of the box and extended it to it's full reach it refused to retract back to it original position not what we tried. COMPLETE FAIL. Had to order a better option asap.
It broke. Won’t recommend
"Great design. Good construction.However, instructions for setting up connective software was incomprehensible. Gave up and trashed."
Doesn't work as a selfie stick - phone doesn't stay put and keeps falling while using it. It's also heavy and bulky.
Had this a couple months even bought two. But the cradle broke and had to buy another model. Not happy.
"The “71” Phone Tripod, Aluminum Tripod for iPhone & Selfie Stick Tripod with Remote, iPhone Tripod Stand & Travel Tripod” is a very long selfie stick. I like it because it is very lightweight, and the handle has a diamond grip for easy handling. The Bluetooth shutter remote works well. Unfortunately, they chose to use CR1632 batteries instead of A rechargeable shutter remote. It comes with a replacement battery, but I fear losing that little battery long before I need to replace the old one.As a tripod, it lacks the ability to spin 360 degrees. If you wanted to take a panoramic, you would have to pick up the tripod and turn it carefully, or if you wanted to shift your shot a few degrees to the right or left again, you would have to pick it up, turn it, and set it down.I would give this a five-star review if it had a rechargeable shutter remote and a 360-degree swivel."
"I've got a lot of selfie sticks and I use them all the time. I like this one for the 71-in length. What I don't like is the permanently attached camera mount. It's scratchy and gets in the way and I wish it was something I could remove. I also don't like the metal tubes. While they allow me to get to greater heights, they are hard to extract and hard to insert. It's odd because if I'm using this as a selfie the camera will sometimes spin or twist in the poles. I also don't like the tripod legs. They are a real pain to open at times. They clip in just too much. You have to dig them out at the base to deploy.The remote works really well. It's probably my favorite thing. It's just a simple remote but it always works. I like that it has a switch."
"I tried this out a few times but it was really flimsy and unsteady, even on a flat surface. It seemed like a good gust of wind could blow it over. I don't trust it enough to keep using it."
"Edit: Broke after just one month of usage, Not good quality.Old review: overall good for the price. But a little hard to operate."
it’s nice that it’s portable but it’s not stable at all if you use it as a tripod the smallest movement will make it continuously shake which is extremely annoying
"I really like it, and I was able to make good pics with a full background or even to have it stand so me and my friend could be both on the pic. I was very happy until I lost the remote bc the remote holder part is not very good so it must have fell somewhere.. now it will be hard to have pictures with it.. I’m disappointed.Tips: keep the remote in your bag or in a pocket so you’re sure not to lose it."
"I returned it after 5 min from delivery, the item that was delivered is only 67cm (26 inch) instead of 180 cm (71 inch) that is written in the description.Also very cheap plastic quality.I bought it based on the reviews, however it seems not true."
"The tripod turned out to be very heavy. Before that, there was another company, not significant at all. Plus, it is painted on the box that there is a separate button for convenience, it was not included. The legs inside are very flimsy."
"The quality is below the price of the product. Arrived without a remote control, return and look for something else."
"It doesn’t look exactly like it shows in the photos, and the quality feels cheap. It also didn’t come with the camera/ring light screw placement. It still does what you want it to and it has all the other functions."
All good except didn’t recieve the remote with it
It's a good product besides the plastic mount for the phone. Mine broke after the 3rd use.I barely got to use it.
Bluetooth geht bis max. 5m
I bought this to use with my iPad but the piece that comes with it doesn’t open wide enough to hold it. The tripod is solid but I did have a problem pulling out one leg that was stuck.
It was lightweight. Plastic parts are not the best quality.  I was not confident they would last long. Loading camera with heavy zoom lens did not give me a warm & fuzzy feeling it would be able to handle the load.
"I got this tripod for use with my DLSR camera, phone, and small telescope. I chose this tripod over other because the Amazon product page says the weight limit is 11 pounds, however, the instructions that came with the tripod lists the weight limit as 8.8 pounds, so it will not work with my telescope.The worst problem is the swivel at the top of the tripod (so you can pan left and right) is reasonably tight when moving clockwise but if I try to move counter-clockwise it immediately loosens and the whole top of the mount will jiggle (left/right, up/down). I need a tripod that can pan in multiple directions smoothly and securely. It also is hard to pan at all when angled up; I feel like I have to force it and it is going to break.The phone holder really only works with the phone in horizontal mode because in vertical mode, one of the sides will block the phone's camera (unless you move it to one side which seems like the phone might fall out).Pros: lightweight, extra 1/4 inch screw mountCons: panning in only one direction (too loose/unstable in other direction), hard to pan when camera is angled up, phone holder doesn't work very well"
"At first glance, the tripod seems good, but after putting it together and using it several times, the hand crank to lift the head up or down, feels low quality, the same with the carrying handle that is attached to the middle stem, also, panning from the left to right, the main head can come lose, very entry level tripod."
"I like everything about this tripod below the head.  The legs extend easily, it's nice and lightweight and quite sturdy.  What I don't care for is the head.  It's got too much plastic, and the catch for the camera mounting plate relies on a low-strength spring clip.  There's NO WAY I'll going to trust my multi-thousand-dollar kit on that thing.The good news is that I was able to get a replacement head that has a much-more-stable Arca Swiss Quick Release Plate.  Now we're talking!Would I get this tripod, knowing what I know now?  Maybe, particularly if I had a better head that I could switch in.  Lacking that, probably not."
It works good except the foot plate could be more stable to hold the camera.
"Great height. Sturdy leg construction for a light-weight tripod. Ease of release and great compact folding size. Phone holder appreciated.However, the life of a tripod must be the head. And whereas I did not pay for a fluid-head tripod, I actually panicked on a job when I had difficulty adjusting the head into a fixed locked position with 0% lateral and vertical movement. I had to take the camera off and  ask my assistant to fiddle with the head/handle/lock controls.I did not return it only because I was overseas when Amazon's 30-day return window closed. For a tripod with so many positives going for it, it seems like commonsense to put just a little more effort into stabilizing the head...I have not read any other reviews. If I am the only person with a head problem, then perhaps I was unlucky enough to land a defective tripod."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this as a gift for someone who is tall and needed a tall tripod. It does what it needs, however I believe it was already used and was repackaged. There were dents and scuff marks as if someone dropped it and decided they didn't want it anymore. I don't know if it was the seller or Amazon."
I really wanted to like this tripod - had everything I wanted and more. It just could not hold the weight of a standard DSLR camera
"I have a pocket camera and I use this tripod for slow shutter photography, just to keep the camera steady during exposure. Works well, however, there's no lock for the pan head. To be sure that the pan head is not gonna swivel at the slightest touch, you have to rotate the pan head clockwise until tight. If you have to swivel around, make sure you swivel to the right.Sometimes during shooting, you swivel to the left and the next thing you know, you have a very loose pan head."
"Recently purchased this Tripod and for the entire duration of the time that My PTZ Camera was on it, I was skeptical that it would fall or drop because of1. The overall top end flimsiness2. The physical Unsteadiness because it felt as though a screw was NOT fully connected or put together correctly.Additionally, When the Tripod was rotated the head loosened up and the movement was NOT smooth causing visible kinks in panning and rotating Left and right during Video collection.It appears as though this camera is for lighter Smaller Camera's only.These factors were NOT made clear before purchase.We are Requesting a Refund"
"The ZIKZOK Tripod 75"" Camera Tripod is a complete disappointment. From the moment I assembled it, it was evident that this tripod was constructed with the cheapest, flimsiest materials available. The entire thing feels like it's held together by brittle plastic parts that threaten to snap at any moment.But the problems don't end there. The camera top mount is shockingly insecure, unable to handle even a moderate-weight lens like a 70-200mm. Attempting to mount my camera with such a lens resulted in a precarious balancing act that left me fearing for the safety of my equipment.As if that wasn't bad enough, the handle to adjust the camera angle is utterly useless. No matter how much I tightened it, the camera still drooped down, making it impossible to capture a steady shot. Save yourself the headache and invest in a tripod that won't jeopardize your expensive camera gear. The ZIKZOK Tripod is nothing more than a flimsy, unreliable disaster waiting to happen."
"While this is a good option for those first-time users, you start to see that you really do get what you pay for when you only spend a little bit of money. The main negative I have about this is that the camera I use has a zoom lens, so it is a bit front-heavy and the mount does not tighten enough to keep it from falling forward. It worked great for two uses but now the mount falls forward no matter how much you tighten it."
"It looks nice and is sturdier (though also heavier) than the small one that came with my Canon - and if the legs would easily slide in and out, I'd love it. But since they need to be pushed in and out, setting it up is more cumbersome than any of my other tripods, so only 3 stars from me."
Not as heavy duty and solid as I expected.
"Advertised as working with GoPro, BUT does NOT include attachment for GoPro!  You have to find the attachment and attach it yourself.  This is why I rated only 3 stars.  I don't like vendors who bend the truth.  Either remove the GoPro compatibility or include the attachment.  It's that simple."
Tripodis made of cheap plastic.  Not sturdy at all and cannot even hold a DSLR  properly.  The knobs do NOT tighten enough to hold camera in place.  Wish I could get a refund.  I JUST opened and used this yesterday.
"Difficult operating controls while trying to take photos and keep it steady, returned it"
"The tripod itself is very sturdy, which I like. However, it does not come with the Bluetooth device to be able to take your own pictures, which is very disappointing."
"I was happy having it for months now, but the lower part to clamp the leg broke so it drops the leg, and now it won’t stay put :/ I want a refund"
"I like the stand, but one of the leg locking tabs was broken when I opened it. I had to use a pair of pliers to lock the leg out, and will have to use the pliers to retract the leg, so I’ll just leave it extended. Other than that, it’s most definitely a pretty awesome stand."
"I use this tripod 3-5 times each week to support my camera while I livestream my children's youth sporting events. This week, when I was extending the legs of the tripod, one of them came right out in my hand. I know this wasn't an expensive tripod, but I didn't expect it to fall apart in my hands in less than 90 days."
"For the people who are saying their $100-200 tripods are no better, what? This thing is nearly all plastic and shudders in the wind. The 80% aluminum claim may be true (for the legs), however all the important parts that hold the tripod together are just plastic and feel flimsy.I originally got this for my mom as her first tripod for her phone however I think it's not even up for that. Honestly, I'd just spend the extra $20-40 bucks and get something that'll last longer than a few months.That's what I should've done from the start, and probably what you should do too. Even if you can't afford anything more expensive right now; save up! Or look for another brand that's cheaper, because I promise you, it won't be worse than this."
Nice enough for the price but I returned it for something with less plastic parts and more stability. I ordered it to hold a 7lb (when loaded) pochade box. It may be great for a camera but there is far too much wobble to paint with it. Ordered a sturdy projector tripod instead for a few bucks more.
"Product itself is great.  Can't say the same for their response to issues.  First tripod receive had one foot not treaded.  No way to use.  Found two different contact addresses to see if the foot could be replaced.  No answer from the first, second one was not valid.Returned to Amazon for another one and it arrived in good condition and works as advertised.  Light weight but sturdy."
"Bought 4 of them.  1 broke in a matter of minutes.Rated featuresLight weight:  yes it is light weight.Sturdiness:  Other than the legs, we couldn't get any of the locking parts to hold without swaying or slipping.  Most of those parts appear to be plastic.Value for money:  It wasn't the cheapest but it was in the lower spectrum of prices.  It is what you pay for."
"The tripod has a hard time holding my m50 & telephoto lens (~2lb setup) still, lots of drifting."
"Not sure if I just got a dud, but the unit I received had clearly been open and used before. Box was torn up, product was scratched. Still gave it a shot, and found it to be very flimsy compared to the Joby I was replacing (that unit was too short). I am probably guilty of having too high of expectations from a budget tripod. Ended up purchasing a significantly more expensive, and higher quality Neewer."
"This is not for cameras with zoom lens.  Very flimsy.  Would be great for cell phones, but that is it.  Claims it's heavy duty, not even close."
"Guess the description lead me to believe this would be a nice upgrade to the $20 Canon tripod I have. It looked/felt like a modest upgrade. But first time I mounted the camera I knew it was getting returned. Camera tilts forward despite tightening. The upper ext tubes has nearly 1"" of play when raised up. Light pressure down causes it to lower and the adjustment knob to spin freely as it lowers. Possibly a defective one? Total junk really. Wouldn't pay $5 for it. Might work for a cell phone."
"This tripod is… fine. But I bought it to use with a laser level and I would NOT recommend this for that purpose. It was very difficult to get the tripod itself level, and not easy to move the attached laser at all. I wouldn’t recommend this tripod."
"I'm not terribly fond of how this tripod is designed now that I have it in hand.  It would be easier to deal with, but this was supposed to include two of the mounting plates and one remote.  It only came with one mounting plate.  Zikzokgear is unresponsive.  Fairly disappointed in this and would not recommend this to anyone."
"Even with a small 24/millimeter lens on my Nikon, Z6 camera, it will not hold my camera in place when shooting up the sky. Had to keep readjusting and tightening. Returning it."
"It looks nice, fresh out of the box.It's nice that they include a carry bag. It's not a great bag, but it is a bag.Fit and finish are good, nothing loose here.Since it's made almost entirely from brittle plastic be prepared to either baby it or replace it."
"Cheaply made. Broke in less than a year, with fairly light use. Plastic gets brittle and snaps. Oh well. Should have bought something a bit nicer."
The Tripod seems sturdy. Came with a broken smart phone holder which looked flimsy to start with. Returned for refund.
Very cheap materials and not sturdy.  Returned right away and got another one (under $100).
Really nice tripod but I got it for my phone and it doesn't actually include a phone holder even tho one is pictured.
"I’ve only used it maybe 2 times, and a knob fell off of it. it stays in my back seat. i tried to return the item and the truck never came to pick it up, or called about picking it up.this thing is literal garbage. spend the extra money and get a good one."
Returned. Felt cheap. Didn’t trust it to hold our camera.
It did not work with my gopro.
I don't understand why the piece for the camera is breaking off.
The parts that should be metal are plastic. For the money it’s ok but don’t expect much.
I use this tripod in a light duty setup. No raveling. The leg locking clips are coming apart in my hands. I'm using Gorilla glue to keep using it.
This product was cheaply made. I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone using a iPad to record video.
"Because of some crazy Christmas discounts, I was able to get this from Amazon for $15!!  Probably the best deal on photo equipment I've made in awhile.  I'm older and really don't like hauling my 10lb+ Bogen tripod out with me on photo excursions.  It's just too much.  This is very lightweight.  This tripod is perfect for the occasional field trips!  It is not meant to replace other tripods you might have and it is not meant to be your main go to tripod.  The legs seem sturdy enough, the head with all of it's tilts and turns is pretty flimsy with a lot of plastic!  But you have to figure out what this amount of money will buy you.  For my purposes, I think it will do just fine."
Plastic center post has gears that are too coarse. Unable to precisely move up/down. Jerks at about 1/8 inch increments as the center post is cranked up or down. Tripod is also quite wobbly.
"Bought this and just had to return it.  The Tripod thread that receives the PanHead camera plate are NOT matched in thread.  Two totally different thread types makes it so you can NOT screw the pan head onto the tripod.  I then tried emailing the distributor ZikZoK for service, etc.  All my emails bounced back and undeliverable.  There is no other contact information available.Save the hassle you will endure, and don't buy!"
"I bought this tripod stand to take a Galaxy photo. When I received this tripod stand, it come with a lot of accessories. However, this stand couldn't keep my 5d3 camera (with a 24-70mm lens) stable. So I return it."
Not sure if it was the carrier's fault . The stand where the camera clips in was chipped a bit and the screw kept coming off . But it could be damaged while shipping .Other wise it looked good . Pretty sturdy. We had to return it though.
Don't expect it to be a $100 quality tripod but I liked that it came with a cell phone attachment large enough to attach my Galaxy S-24 Ultra
"If you don't want to spend a lot, it's a good choice, when you extend the legs all the way, it feels fragile, but overall it's good"
"I've had this product for a year and a month and although I like the height and the sturdiness of the tripod legs; if the tripod head is slightly tilted, it cannot hold itself up with my Sony ZV-1 or DJI Osmo Pocket 3 (which I both are compact and light cameras!). Therefore, I'm always having to keep it at one angle and not bump or slightly tilt the camera down, or I risk my camera's lenses being damaged. I tried everything to looking up tutorials, reading instructions, re-reading the description, etc. If it could hold up my two cameras at different angles, like it advertises, I'd give this 5-stars."
Tripod is decent quality but it comes with a remote but has no instructions
"It's a completely made of plastic, and very cheap at that. So if you plan on using this for anything other than a cellphone, I'd give it a hard pass."
It gets the job done but it's a frustrating product. The kickstand legs on the tripod is sometimes difficult. Propping open the clams is a game of either it propping up without a problem or you clawing your nails to pry it open. Not very intuitive to be owning a tripod that can hurt your hands.
The phone tripod legs has a middle gatekeeper to stabilize the legs and doesn't take up a lot of ground space when expanding.  The ipad tripod legs has nothing to keep the 3 legs together.  Very easy to tip over and take up a lot of ground space when expanding legs to stablize
Handle stripped out after minimal use. Contacted customer service and they wouldn't send a replacement or offer me anything.
The handle that screws in to the mount stripped after two uses. They should have used a metal threaded material instead of just the plastic mold.
Was trying to use at church...one leg not locking..so not usable for what I needed it for.
"Difficult to operate, instructions not helpful, returned immediately."
Great for phone and camera but it falls forwards or back when you put the 12.9 iPad Pro . The iPad seems to be too heavy for it unless you’re ok with just keeping it at one angle and don’t move it at all. You need to take the case off for it to fit too so there’s no protection when it starts to fall.
I do like the attachments and covers. Wish they were more secure while shipping. One has two broken leg locks. The other is fine and works amazing
I guess for $30 it's not that bad. I want it to use this for hunting (spoting). I doubt it will even last one season.
Material is so fragile and weak. Not good for something like tripod which has to be strong and stable.
"Have yet to try it as i had to hunt down replacement batteries for the dead ones shipped with order.  The battery type listed on the product is the incorrect battery type, it is NOT CR2, it appears to CR2032, so I wasted money on batteries that cost as much as the tripod does.. get it together people sheesh"
It maybe good for someone but for a professional it’s cheap quality
Handle broke during normal use. This sucks not worth money.
"This product cannot support a mirrorless camera set up that weighs a total of 3.9 pounds. My camera fell off of the quick release plate and was luckily saved by carpeting.Buying this could be a VERY expensive mistake. I will be purchasing a more expensive, reliable option.This product would be fine for a phone."
Did not have all the parts so I can’t use it and will be returning.
I tripod I received does not extend to 8 Inches as stated... Cannot hold any tablet as what I needed it for..Waste of time and money.
does not recommend. Flimsy. Only good about ut is the convenience of the remote. Find something else. Don't be deceive with its reviews that inaccurate.
"i used 3 times and the plastic broke, poor quality hence i returned.do not buy this ; you will waste time and money."
"Beware, this product is made of plastic and it is flimsy and cheap. This is made for phones, not for your expensive cameras. Will be returning it."
It didn’t come with a remote.
"Not bad , but not a professionally"
Cheap plastic
plastic crap
"I read a few glowing reviews of this tripod, so I decided to check it out for myself. After I did so, “glowing” was not a word that came to mind. Instead I found myself thinking, “If you’re reviewing a tripod and you start thinking about how the bag is kind of nice, that really isn’t a good sign.”When I titled this review “That’s a lotta plastic,” I did not mean that in a good way. I didn’t mean it in a completely bad way either. Plastic can be an indispensable material. But as I examined the tripod, I found it to be a curious mixture of strong and good parts, as well as cheaply made and poorly thought out ones.For example, it has aluminum legs. Good. But they are aluminum legs that are linked to the center post with unimpressive plastic connectors. And then it also has a center crank that is not only plastic, but plastic where the handle feels ready to fall off. Why is the elevation crank not only plastic, but poorly designed, thin, and awkward plastic? Trying to answer questions like that is an exercise in frustration. Please give me robust, impressive plastic in the future.With this tripod, set it up and push down on the legs, and they will split apart—a lot. Like a ballerina doing the splits. I don’t want that. It’s just got that cheap tripod feel. It’s not that I cannot take this tripod out and have a pretty good photo shoot with it. I can. But I do not want to worry about the stability of my tripod. I wan’t to worry about my photographs. My tripod should be a dependable thing I can set and forget about. This is not that tripod."
"I used this to livestream 3 hockey games, and ultimately, I was not impressed. This is more for a usage where there won't be much movement and a lot is that it's just too light. The legs moved far too easily with every pan turn, and it became hard to manage as I had to hold on to the tripod with one hand, and then move the camera with the other. Not that user-friendly.However, it is lightweight which I liked, and I'll have other more stationary uses for it for this reason."
"Was pleased with this a light weight travel tripod, but I to say its not durable at all, what I thought was metal is just plastic that is made to look and slightly feel like metal. the middle bar is already cracking and I really dont use it for all that much.Overall it does the job, but not sure who long its going last."

The locking sections and the tightening screws wear down extremely fast to the point where it becomes unusable
Description is not fair and doesn't hold the samsung phone I reached out to seller which didn't care to help. I wouldn't waste my money on this unit
"Product is different than the picture and also there are missing parts which is the phone holder and the remote, the bag is so different than the picture. The material is plastic and looks cheap, not like what they wrote “aluminum”."
"I bought 2 of these as i needed extra tripods for a 3 angle interview shoot. I put 2 cheaper camcorders on this and it was great, but another shoot i put canon sl2 dslr with a heavy lens and it almost fell over when i accidentally bumped into it!. So if you will not be outside, in harsh environments with a lot of wind I say get it, but if you need something on the sand on uneven terrain, i wouldnt trust my gear to this. Just way too light."
"Seemed like a really nice tripod when I opened it up. It's clearly rather sturdy and felt pretty premium considering how much was spent on it.Unfortunately, one adjustment of the pan head screw caused it to become threaded - and now the tripod has no pan function at all.Thankfully, I never planned to shoot any videos on this thing so it won't make a too much of a difference to me, so I'll probably not bother returning it just because it is so cheap and seems decent otherwise.But yeah, hard to give it more than 2 stars since it broke so easily and quickly."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Threading stripped and no longer holds position from swivel. Minor piece to fix and thats my only criticism. Everything else is perfect.
I actually liked this but no remote included.
"It's a good tripod overall, the legs are a bit fragile when fully extended but still serves my purpose. It's nice and light and compact."
2nd time using and product was stiff. Use lube as recommended top popped off waste of money. Dont buy this looks good but does not last poorly made. Had to give it a one star as zero was not an option.
"I attempted to use this with a tablet and small projector.  If it had been made out of metal it would have been fine but since it is entirely plastic, both devices were swaying."
I purchased the stand around couple of months ago and just opened it today. Its top bracket is very low quality that it doesnt hold a DSL camera. So disappointed that I wasted money on it.
"Resending it to Amazon, glad I got it from Amazon"
"I bought this a few months ago, however, it has already started giving me issues. The holder that holds your phone/camera has gotten loose and no matter how much I tighten it, it never holds the phone and the phone always tilts down. This seems to have happened recently as when I first got it it wasn't a problem.This is kind of useless now because I cant properly shoot certain angles as the phone keeps tilting down"
"While I know it’s $26 the order came today, rusted at all metal joints, dent in one of the tri pod legs . Looks like someone used outside maybe wiped it down and returned"
"The angle adjusting mechanisms broke after a mere few uses, and it won’t hold anything up anymore. The tripod has become useless, and I’m unfortunately long pass the return window."
The quality of this product is horrible! No point in buying
both the metal and plastic used is brittle. metal in the stand tends to bend/break under light pressure.
Coming with missing part
Only half way to full height and it is a lot of movement. Easy to set but not useful
Bluetooth remote will not pair with iPhone or android. Too much hassle to return due to amazon policy. Really dissapponted as will now have to pay extra for a 3rd party remote. False economy.
Poor quality product. The top nut can't hold the bracket in place let alone if a phone is attached. I've had to wrap tape around it to be able to use it. Avoid this product. Not sure how it's gotten so many good reviews. It's junk.
I’m guess my phone is too heavy or something because my phone will not stay upright if it’s on the stand at an angle or anything and the adjustment doesn’t work. It’s also really bad at actually keeping my phone in the holder. It keeps popping out of the place where the phone goes
"I have arthritis in my hands and need something to hold my phone when I'm facetiming my grandkids for long periods because it hurts after a while, anyway this is a nice lightweight little tripod with adjustable legs. The only downside to this tripod it that when you attach your phone and adjust it pointing towards you at a forward sitting angle the tripod falls forward so it's almost too lightweight, there is a point where it will stay but I don't want to spend 5 minutes everytime finding the sweet spot."
"It looks fine, but i was c oncerned because the box it was in was open when i got it. it was inside anothe rbox with a different order."
"This is not a precision quality piece of equipment.At first glance, it appears to be something very cool.However, I am unable to tighten the knobs that countto hold the camera in position.It is just way to plastic. I can't position the cameratwo.Photograph or video upright.Because the stand will fall over every single time.It's only positioned to load horizontally. I thought perhaps I could live with it.But now that I'm seriously trying to use it.It is a complete and total frustration.Because I cannot get it to suit my needs due to the lack of precision in this instrument. It does not support the weight of the phone.It does not support the size of my particular phone easily.The phone keeps falling out. Even trying to use the feature where you can position off a limb of a tree or in an unconventional way not using the prongs, as legs, it still is extremely difficult to use at all.It is of no use to me.I wish I had returned it sooner. It's pretty much garbage If you like high quality this isn't it."
"Tripod is great but the remote literally stops connecting after a month, phone won’t even find it anymore. Was great for the short time it lasted."
"it works, but i wish it was more stable. you really gotta mess with the legs to try to stand it up. it’s real lightweight, and i like that you have options for different set ups. just wish it was more stable"
"It is TERRIBLE at controlling its own weight. It will topple over just from standing up after a long time. A total mess. It grips on to things well but I hate that it can’t hold up my phone either. The head of it doesn’t allow for any sturdiness from it at all so you better either be pointing it up or downward bc that’s all it can do. Plus the latch that holds the phone doesn’t clamp which is a good and bad thing bc you want it to feel secure which it doesn’t but it also won’t pinch ur fingers like the other ones. Idk it’s portable and it’s decent for certain purposes but lacks greatly at others. If you can find a better one, get it."
it's okay. kinda weak. I thought I would have more place to set this on and twist and hook it up on for pictures and videos but I don't. I had an iPhone 11 and my 11 was too heavy and now I have the samsung s24 ultra and my phone is really too heavy. I tightened it all the way and it would still fall with my phone on it. you can definitely get it to stay though you just have to really mingle with it for a while.
"Just got my Tripod today 12/11/2024, the phone holder works great, so the the Gopro holder. The tripod and legs work great, However, the gimbal with the screw that you tighten down to hold a phone, camera, gopro camera still it will not hold either of these still. The problem is the screw and gimbal. I have tightened down as much as I physically can and my phone, gopro and camera all fall to the side."
I had this for the last 6 months. I found myself avoiding taking pictures because I didn’t want to deal with this poorly made tripod. I ordered a replacement to the last one I broke. But this was a different listing and modeled differently. The legs are just a touch shorter. It could not stand without tipping over or positioning in such a way to account for the weight of the phone. Which takes more time away from taking the picture.The clip had a hard time holding my phone and I had to take off the case. For a tiny portable quick grab tripod it’s a very frustrating tripod to work with you miss the moment you are trying to capture more often because you have to fix the tripod that keeps falling over.It might work for you with a smaller lighter device or phone. I found it to be a kill joy to my travel photography.
"The idea is great and everyone was so jealous when I had this holding my phone attached to my stroller. It’s so versatile, but I’ve actually ordered it twice and it broke as shown in the photo both times. :("
"I don't know why this thing has so many positive reviews? The build construction is cheap and flimsy. The design is poorly thought out and a certain features just straight up don't work .The top of the tripod has a little rubberized platform that screws onto the threaded piece of metal. It is there so you can securely attach the gadget you are trying to secure to the tripod. But guess what? It doesn't work haha. It's literally a nut sunken into a piece of plastic and when you twist it it just keeps spinning because metal is stronger than plastic. The whole thing popped off and then I realized the only reason it was held in there was because there was a piece of tape over the top?The other main issue I have is with the legs, they have this weird function where they can move on their own? Which seems really counterintuitive because you definitely don't want a tripod to move on its own. I got this flexible tripod so I could grip onto trees or other irregular objects but the legs move on their own after you tighten it down! What the heck. Also, the foam around the legs is not very durable so, you're going to get a lot of ripping and crud built up in there over time.I kind of got this thing super rushed before I left the country for my projector and now that I'm out I can't return it but I wish I got the one you see everywhere with the little black balls and gray rubber rings. That one I had before and it's way way more durable and a much better designI think if you only use this thing for like holding a phone inside of a bedroom or something it's probably fine but don't assume you are getting a professional piece of equipment."
"It was either pay shipping or pay the same cost but get something else with my package, and I thought this would actually be a good tool for making videos. It would be, if the mount wasn't on a ball head. You can tighten this thing with power tools, it still won't stop it from flopping all over the place. I can sort of get it to stay up if I'm delicate, but ANY precision is out of the question. I'm still young, so having this issue was quite unfortunate, ba-dum tss.Ball head mount aside, you simply cannot get a good shot with this. You can wrap it around a pole as tightly as you're able, it will slip upside down, it will lean to one side or the other, there is nothing you can do to get the shot you're trying so hard to get.I've gotten a lot of cheap stuff over the years, and I think it's safe to say that this is below the bar of ""good crap"". I genuinely think the company needs to look at this and say ""Okay, we can't make this kind of product for this price"" and just stop selling it, simple as."
"I absolutely loved this, I even got another one for my mother.Then today, I was just adjusting the legs and it snapped off, completely!!I bought it because of the flexible legs!!.I am in a wheelchair so maybe taking it in and off of the arm of my chair was too much bending for it??? They should know, and tell us!Of course it’s too late to return it. I would send both of the ones I bought back so I could find something better suited to us.I’m sad, believe me. Maybe if you’re not planning to bend it….🤷‍♀️"
"I like how it can bend and all. When I am using wide angle lens, my iPhone 14P does catch sight of the tripod. After a while of use, one of the legs fell off. I can lodge it back in to use, however, it is a little annoying having to deal with it often.Edit: Turns out i was being dumb when using this product. Has grown on me more now that I am using it correctly. Still getting 3/5 due to being poorly made and breaking easily but i do recommend as a good cheap starter tripod."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is easy to use the quality not so bad size is as shown,stability not so much. I wish the Manufacturers could Communicate with iPhone stores to discuss the weight of the phone because our phones are too heavy for the stand🙄🚮 example, I use an iPhone 14 Pro Max And my phone is too heavy for the stand! which makes it hard for me to Record my content"
"i should have trusted the reviews, it tips over for vertical mount, i don't know if there is a tripod that adjusts the center of balance so verical origintation works.  if you want horizontal its fine."
I was so excited about this and it fits the phone securely but the tripod head moves around even when the knob has been tightened so so you are unable to set it where you want. Besides the knob not holding the ball head tight the remote works well.
I bought this for my Pixel phone to use on hiking trips. The build and quality is is good but you cannot swivel the base that the legs are connected to which means there's no leg in front of the phone so it tips over if you bring the phone all the way up. If the base would swivel so you could change the position of the tripod legs. When you have it set to fully vertical it would probably be a great tripod.
"Well functioning device, but the legs seem weak"
"Title: Disappointing Experience with the Flexible Phone TripodI recently ordered a Flexible Tripod for recording my travel adventures, and unfortunately, my experience didn't quite match up to the seller's description. As excited as I was to document my trip, the product left me feeling a bit underwhelmed.Upon receiving the tripod, my first impression was that it looked rather poor in quality. The materials used felt flimsy, and I couldn't help but question its durability. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a chance and set it up for my first recording.One of the main issues I encountered was the tripod's stability. The legs were far from easy to position in a way that would ensure a stable base. It felt like a delicate balancing act, and I had to readjust them constantly to prevent my phone from toppling over. This was not only frustrating but also affected the quality of my recordings.Additionally, the height of the phone tripod was shorter than I had expected. This limited my ability to capture the scenic vistas and landscapes I had hoped to include in my travel videos. It made me realize that this tripod wasn't versatile enough for my needs.In the end, I found the Flexible Tripod to be less durable, stable, and versatile than the seller had described. Despite its affordable price, it didn't meet my expectations, and I felt that it wasn't worth the money I had spent. I was disappointed that I couldn't fully capture the beauty of my travels due to these limitations. If you're looking for a reliable and sturdy tripod for your recordings, I would suggest exploring other options to ensure a more satisfying experience."
"The tripod is great. It has three attachments allowing it to securely hold a camera, phone, or miscellaneous GoPro type camera. The legs are bendable so it can be placed on even or uneven surfaces. They can also be shaped into hooks so that the tripod can be hung from the wall or from overhead. I also see no problem with the end caps coming out from the end of the tripod legs, as others have noted.The problem is the remote. It does not work with the Google pixel 7. Not at all. It pairs easily enough with the Bluetooth, but when pressed the Android button does nothing but cause the camera zoom to zoom in in increments. The sellers claim that if the remote does not work to download the app camera 360, and use that with the remote to operate the camera. This does not work either, it allows you to snap one picture. Then you have to run to the phone and press the download button then run back to snap another picture. Video mode does not work at all either with the regular camera or through the camera 360 app. In video mode, the remote only zooms in the zoom again.I am returning this purchase. There are plenty of tripods being sold with remotes on Amazon for me to continue to try to fool around with this one. I do not like the idea of downloading an app like camera 360 just to try to make the remote function. The app itself seems shady to me. At this point it must be a known issue to the sellers that this device does not function with a whole class of phones like Google pixel. This should be stated in the description of the product."
"Bought this with the intention of using it to anchor an external microphone.  And it would be a decent little tripod except for one thing:The mounting turret does not swivel horizontally, so while you can move whatever you have attached to it up and down to some degree the only way to reorient left to right is to move the entire base of the tripod.  The problem with this approach is it has a fixed axis with two front-facing legs and one rear facing-leg.  This makes whatever you attach to the tripod ""front-heavy"" and unstable.  This isn't a big deal if you rest it on a perfectly flat surface but if there's any bit of an incline you run the risk of having the tripod fall forward onto its face.Also, even on a flat surface, the vertical gimble is such that you can't aim (whatever you have attached) downward beyond the perpendicular -- like if you wanted to place the tripod on a shelf and have it look downward on an angle toward a chair.  This would all be unnecessary if the mounting surface allowed for horizonal rotation in which you could place the single leg facing forward and have the other two legs behind."
"Decent little stand, just not able to turn the phone vertical without it tipping over"
"The legs are very light so the weight of my phone makes it nearly topple over. When mounting the phone landscape mode, there’s no way to spin the legs to make them more sturdy where the weight of the phone is pulling. It’s ok, but I would not repurchase."
"It initially felt like a solid product, but the knob on the side, which is supposed to tighten to make the attached phone stay in its position, doesn’t work. The phone continues to move around. Super annoying."
"I was so excited to get this, when it arrived I tested it out and learned that the legs were not connected as sturdy as everything else was. My 1 year old pulled the leg right out of the socket. The others could come out too but with more effort. I’m going to assume this particular item wasn’t built to last but I got what I paid for. Also, the remote had a loud enough click that you could hear it on video. For those reasons I returned it."
"The legs are very loose in the sockets so it takes a lot of maneuvering of the flexible part of the legs in order to get any kind of height but stability is compromised.Also, the camera connector is extremely loose and will not hold a phone straight up. The mechanism to tighten the connector just does not work well and even when tightened to the point of near breaking it still has trouble holding the phone up.I have found a few uses for the tripod though, just not for what I actually wanted it for, which I is why I ultimately kept it."
"The design of this phone holder isn’t great. My phone keeps slipping off, and it’s hard to keep it steady. I’ve tried adjusting it to different angles, but the issue persists. While the material seems okay, the practicality is lacking. I hope the design can be improved."
Limited instructions to accompany this item. Difficult to work all parts. Battery pack difficult to open without a special and very small Phillips screwdriver.
"Once you attach a phone or camera, you then want to use the ball assembly to move it into the perfect angle. There is a screw, then lock in that position, but that screw cannot type it enough and the phone or camera can still wobble around and its weight will move it, I think the plastic on plastic is not strong enough for today’s product"
What a crappy product. I’ve had it for a while & finally thought to use it. Falls over constantly—I mean WTH??? Unfortunately I think it’s too late for return. Don’t waste your money.
"I should have read the low reviews too instead of letting the good ones sell me on the product. It does what it needs to do in landscape mode but as soon as you put it in portrait, it topples over. Has no stability or weight to it whatsoever."
I did receive this but I ended up returning it due to me needing it for my trip but i did not get this on time due to my shipment was delayed. I ended up purchasing something similar quick out the store. The product was as described and Im pretty sure it works greatly and would of loved it if it was shipped on time.
The legs will most likely break so 3 stars
"This thing is nice in theory but the legs don’t go wide enough to hold the weight of an iPhone pro max. :/ yes, they are bendable, so you can make it work - but it isn’t ideal.  It also really don’t hold the phone at 90º even though the description says it does."
"When you bend it around to where you want it, it just flops over"
Overall I wasn’t sure how to rate this because it worked great but broke during my first use. Definitely can pretty much position it however you’d like and the remote was great. I gave it a 3 out of 5 because one of the legs broke off after just a few uses which then made the rest of the photos I took really difficult. Overall it lasted for the solo day trip to the redwoods which is why I bought it.
"Remote is great, tripod is well made, phones in vertically are no problem. Bigger phones (example: Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra in a case) start to get heavy horizontally.The phone fits the adapter just fine, it's the weight. This is especially true if you are attempting to film horizontally and down. With a big phone, this just topples right over.Maybe some added weight to the back leg or something. Would also be great if the legs spread out a little more, they have limited movement at the joints (where the legs connect to the main tripod body). Legs themselves can wrap around a thin pole, but the joint isn't as generous. If you wanted this tripod to do a full split for example, it cannot."
Hard to keep balance with an iPhone 14 Pro Max.
The product seems pretty solid for now but I’m disappointed in the false information provided in the bio. This item does not weight 87 grams.
"I loved the tripod and used it regularly while hiking and backpacking. Unfortunately, however, it is not very durable, with legs falling off several times and hard to reattach. Now one of the legs completely broke off, rendering the tripod useless."
It’s not so easy to work with …
"The ball head assembly is entirely plastic. As a result, it's impossible to tighten it enough to keep the mobile phone stable and secure. I didn't even bother trying a small camera. Of course, using it while attached to a moving object (say a golf cart) would be end in a disaster. Returned item since it won't work for my needs..."
"Bought this tripod to hold a 4"" PC fan with speed controller to suck my solder fumes out of my face when soldering. When I got the unit I noticed the clamp  wouldn't spring back or rebound. I opened and closed the things numerous times with much effort and it's like the clamp is binding inside. I can make it hold my 4"" fan but it isn't clamped onto the fan like it should be.So I contact the seller and ask for a ""clamp"" replacement. The agree and they end up sending me a clamp with one threaded mounting point instead of the two like the original. The clamp is also a lesser quality clamp and, best of all, it won't hold a 4"" fan. The only reason I purchased this ""kit"" is because of the ability of the clamp to open up so wide. I haven't even had a chance to use the tripod to leave a review on it since I'm still battling the clamp."
Holds the phone tightly and works at basic angles but it is so lightweight that if you want to tilt it certain ways or utilize the flexibility of the legs for different positions it often can't hold the weight of the phone and tips over. I would get something more sturdy/heavy-weight.
"This tripod isn't even sturdy enough to hold up my phone. It tips over every time I let go of it. In addition to that, the tilting is just as bad. If you try to lift up your phone angle it goes right back down. Disappointed and wasted my money."
"The tripod is simple and decently constructed, but you cannot position the phone vertically. Had to buy something else."
It broke. It was nice when we had it. But it did my last long. We was not too rough with it either.
"The stand works great but the remote does not properly connect with my Pixel 7a. The remote goes to a solid blue light, indicating that it is connected, but the phone Bluetooth settings don't recognize it as a connected device, and the buttons do not work in the camera app."
I have the 15 pro max and it’s too heavy for the stand to hold. It just falls over… so maybe for a smaller phone or iPod? Idk but not worth it especially it you are using for influencing
"The knob to tighten the camera into position does not tighten sufficiently. Even when screwed in all the way, it is not tight enough and even a slight weight will pull down the camera holder so that it droops out of position."
"This is a pretty neat item. I was super excited to receive it and have used it pretty much everyday since it arrived in June. Well, I was setting up my camera with it a few nights ago and one of the legs just completely snapped off. I’m not rough with my products at all, and I was surprised that this happened. Only giving three stars because the product itself is great, but the quality didn’t hold up."
A little too bulky for me. Serves the purpose.
"it sort of works, but there’s no way the tighten it so the weight of your phone will cause it to slowly droop. Also it’s designed for the back-facing camera so good luck."
"This might be a decent product for a smaller camera or phone. However an iPhone 13 Pro Max is beyond top-heavy for it. It does not support the phone well even with all of the flexibility in the legs. I was looking for something that I could adjust quickly and easily, and this is definitely not for that purpose. Did not try the Bluetooth remote. So I cannot review that. Unfortunately, I will have to purchase something else."
Not heavy enough and doesn’t allow phone to be a full 90* from the surface it’s standing on.
"The jaws open up just barely wide enough to hold my son's 2022 Moto G with it's case on. It also struggles with the weight of a modern 2020s phone, toppling easily because there's no mass in the legs. The manufacturer should put weight in the feet so you don't have to struggle to get the feet spaced widely enough for the tripod to not topple over."
Not only doesn’t this camera hold my phone because it’s an iPhone 16 and to heavy but it’s a lot smaller in person and won’t wrap around anything sturdy . Plus the remote doesn’t work and customer service blames Amazon
"This was amazing for about a 6 months of use. But the legs eventually started coming out of the sockets.If you use it on flat surfaces, I would guess it last longer. But if you use it to bend the legs around tree branches or railings, they come off eventually."
"I ended up returning this. I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and I put my phone in it and it tipped over it like, doesn’t stand up straight in it so what’s the point? There needs to be weights on the bottom or something"
"I bought this tripod on Aug 27, 2024. Today, October 21, 2024 a leg broke off. The metal at the top of the leg snapped. I moved the tripod from one spot to another and the leg fell off. I have never wrapped the legs around anything to hold it, it was just used for traditional tripod standing."
"This product is not very stable, the ""legs"" of the stand are not very sturdy and move around a lot. It tends to fall over and it moves easily, i was let down even though my ecxpectations were low from the start. If you're thinking of buying this I'd recommend looking for a product with better ""legs"" that are sturdier :)"
"This works pretty well, but its difficult to angle the phone to take a photo at a downward angle because it will be too top heavy and will fall over. Also i had problems with the range on the bluetooth remote. Seemed to only work reliably within 5-7 feet away"
"The tripod seemed to be ok, but the remote would not sync to my phone. Returning."
Light legs and feet make it so that a large phone like an iPhone pro max can’t easily be situated looking up without the entire apparatus falling over backwards.
Camera won’t stand up on tripod either. What a joke. Returning. Typical Amazon anymore. Junk!
I have a Google Pixel 7 Pro and this stand cannot hold the weight of my phone upright. An upgrade would be locking legs as the legs don't stay in place with my phone attached. The swivel head also didn't lock in place when fully screwed down. It was really cheap when I purchased so I got what I paid for in this case. Live and learn.  I'll be returning it.
"I love everything about it except for the tightening mechanism on the back that keeps the phone in place.  It feels like it would break if you tighten it enough to where it wouldn't move.  My phone is a iPhone 13 pro and is held off center and it does not hold it in place but slowly moves downward.  If I had to buy another one, I'd keep looking."
I have a iPhone 14 (not a pro or max) my phone constantly falls off and the tripod can't seem to hold the wait. I would return the product if I didn't already throw everything away. I would look at something else.
"Cheap materials, broke apart after a few months"
eh it’s ok but not recommended
The product's ball socket can't be tightened enough to hold my smart phone upright.
"When we were taking it out of the packaging, one of the legs broke so now there is a piece of metal hanging out of the tripod. It works never the less, just have to be careful with it so we don't get cut. Works well for strapping on the stroller to get family photos that aren't selfies on vacation!"
"I purchased this so my family and I could get some family photos on our first actual vacation together. It doesn't work the way it is supposed to and can only hold the phone directly in front of it. The screw mechanism that is supposed to allow you to place the phone in different positions and angles does not hold it in place. Unfortunately I waited to open it until I was packing for my trip, which was a big mistake. Not only does it not work as it's supposed to, I can't return it."
"I wanted to love this but with the new iphone models, the camera is too top heavy and the tripod isnt strong enought to hold up the phone without the screen getting covered by the crossbar."
"I got this tripod for backpacking (where weight matters) specifically because it listed a very light weight (87g). This is a complete fabrication. Even just the tripod alone, with no attachments, is 144g. With the phone grip and remote (which is how I, and I suspect most, people intend to use it) the weight is over 205g - nearly half a pound - vs. the 3 oz. that was advertised. There is literally no component of this unit that weighs 87 grams; they seem to have just made that number up out of thin air. Might not matter to some, but I consider this false advertising of the worst order.Seems like a fine tripod otherwise, and if weight doesn't matter to you, you'll probably be satisfied. But if you're an ultralight backpacker expecting a 3 oz. tripod, you're going to be sorely disappointed in this thing.I almost never write reviews, but the blatant misrepresentation of this item really ticked me off."
The direction we're hard to understand.  They worried about putting information on a little piece of paper.  Instead of giving good direction to its customers.
"This tripod does not support itself when you try to use a phone “vertically”. The tripod is not sturdy or well balanced enough. Horizontal use is fine, but for some reason this tripod falls flat when you try to shoot vertically. Unfortunately this was a waste of money for me."
Faulty product
Leg snapped off after very little use. Would not recommend. Poor quality.
I can’t get my iPhone to stay in this for the life of me!! If you have a heavy phone just don’t recommend this at all!Edit: changing this from a 1 to a 2 star because I do like the remote!
Is NOT STURDY having the phone vertically makes it tilt because there’s more weight on one side so IT DOES NOT STAND.
"I have the iPhone 15 and it seems to be too heavy for this tripod, it is hard to get it in the right position without the tripod falling over or the tripod leg showing in my video."
"This looked like a nice idea, but once it got here the remote was inoperative- wrote to company as requested, 2 days later I got a rehash of the instructions as screen shots. Wow!I re installed the app, went through the whole procedure . I replied, and said it's still NG, They say it will take 30 days to send new one. They are out of stock...., I'll bet if I wanted to buy a new one, I'd be at the top of the list, ship same day...Disappointed"
The media could not be loaded.
It was hard to get my camera to be vertical when putting my phone on the tripod but it did work horizontal.
The joint that holds the camera angle is loose and unable to hold its position
"It's great when it's new.  However, the foam starts to smell horrible over time.  I bought it a year ago and it was stored in my desk drawer most of that time.  I pulled it out the other day and the foam wreaked of skunk and waste.  It was horrid.  I had to cut off the foam entirely.  It's probably cheap, low-quality Chinese material."
I got 3 of these for work and one didn't come with the phone mount. Anyway I could get one of those?
"It’s really great only thing is the sturdiness, hair to get the back legs to be sturdy enough to handle the weight of my phone!"
"The legs are so weak, it falls with my phone attached. It loses balance. Took it to Europe and it was a waste of space in my luggage."
It serves its purpose but it isn’t very stable and I can’t get all the angles I want. There’s better options out there
"This tripod is not a great design. Anytime I put my phone in the holder, the tripod tips. It is the most frustrating piece of equipment I have ever attempted to use. It is awful and not user friendly. Adjustments are difficult and cumbersome. I had to attach weights to the legs to offset the weight of my phone. Forget attaching a light because there is no way to do it easily. I despise this tripod and it is not a good design."
Worked relatively well before too part broke off from the bottom :(
"This is from the standpoint of a professional wedding photographer.There's a lot left to be desired with this lens. I love the compact size, but it works against itself. The EF version felt a lot smoother to zoom, and the material felt much better. There's no way I'd give up my EF Version for this. The zooming tube effect seems to be a nightmare in sandy situations, and sadly, this feels just as heavy, if not oddly heavier than the ef version in a real life application. The lack of weight causes some balance issues, and a Canon R6 attached to this lens cannot stand on its own on the lens stand. It will tilt back towards the R6. This tells me that Canon didn't consider the center of mass of this lens, and when wielding it, it shows. It's awkward and things are placed in strange places for hands of all sizes.The AF seemed to be on par with other RF lenses, though It did miss focus more than I expected (albeit in a somewhat dark test environment. and the picture quality seemed comparable to the EF Version, though perhaps slightly softer.For Professional wedding work, in my opinion: Skip this one until Canon makes some major design changes. There are certainly other applications where this lens will bee great, but none for my use case, sadly."
"I was so ready to be in love with this lens. My EF 70-200 2.8 III is my favorite lens for amazing compression and is a workhorse.  I switched to mirrorless last year and have been using my EF with an adapter, and decided this spring I'd transition to RF to make life just a little easier.  While this lens is fast, with great focus, and worked well in low light, the images were FLAT. I had to spend way more time adding vibrance and saturation to the images to make them match the images that were taken with my 28-70 2.0.  It's almost heartbreaking to drop nearly $3,000 for meh photos.  I fully expected this to do better, not worse than my EF lens.  I'll be returning it and continuing to use my adapter wit my EF -heavier, longer and beast of a lens."
"First and foremost, this lens is noticeably soft at f2.8, right where I want to use it 90% of the time.2nd big negative is the > 90 degrees of ring rotation required to go from 70 to 200 mm. The diameter of the ring and that additional rotation really hurt in fast paced shooting.3 - For now, I have the Control Ring on the lens set for exposure compensation. I'm run and gunning and changed from 24-70 to 70-200, which means I have to remember and contradict muscle memory because on the 24-70 (as with most) the Control ring place at the end of the lens away from the body, but the 70-200 it is tight up against the body. Just plain poor design!4 - The tripod collar is a piece of junk. Stiff. Under engineered. No removable foot.I would MUCH rather use the internal zoom EF, but alas, adapted, it becomes something of an AF snail.I'm hoping for much better in the future, Canon, but for now, RF gear is all going back."
"I wanted to love this lens, it’s definitely nice to handle when compared to the EF version. The picture quality doesn’t seem to be there for me though. The images are harder to edit to match my other lenses. They are more flat, coloring is off, and yes same settings! I use it only when needed for events like weddings. I don’t hate it but I don’t love it."
What happened with the lens case ?  I only got a simple bag with no support at allFor a big lens like this one and for the price I was expecting a good case for the lens for protection
This product is great the only downside is the material is not so great
"I have a Canon RP, and I was super excited to use this lens. But the quality did not live up to the hype. Manual focusing had a very tiny threshold of clear but it still didn’t seem very sharp. And auto focus would catch the eye, but when you zoom in, it’s just blurry and not sharp at all. Going to return it and stick with my 85mm, I mostly do portraits and car photos. Pretty disappointed in the quality, from the videos I’ve seen online, must just be advertising.."
"Going over 6800 images from Kenya.  SOFT SOFT SOFT. My copy at is soft regardless of shutter speed, tripod and IS. This is my 3rd 70-200MM 2.8 I've had in the past 18 years (EFII and III) They where great at 2.8 at center of frame. this one is not....Grrrrr!"
This delivery was OTP bypassed and instructions of delivery wasn’t followed. Please avoid buying expensive stuff through Amazon.
Zoom ring is incredibly stiff. I have to use my whole hand and twist it against the camera putting a lot of pressure on the mount. It's difficult to keep level when doing handheld video zooms. the ef version can be zoomed in easily with finger tip pressure. Is my rf version defective?
I was shipped a used lens. Returned it as soon as I opened it.
Box arrived without “Canon US/Canada Warranty Card”. Not dropping $3K for Lens without Warranty!!
"I received a loaner from CPS. I was excited and expected to make this my first RF glass. Unfortunately, it was completely unusable for sports photography. The EF version allows you to adjust the focal length with the flick of your thumb on the zoom ring. For some unknown reason, not only did Canon swap the ring with the focus ring like a Tamron lens, but they made it impossible to turn with one finger. The travel distance from 70 to 200mm is much further than before, but the worst part is the stiffness. I needed to completely wrap my left hand around the zoom ring for it to move, and it moved much more slowly than my EF version. It's just not usable at the speed I need when shooting sports. I missed dozens of shots before putting it back in the bag. Much of this stems from Canon's poor choice to make this an externally zooming lens - I'm sure we're fighting a weather seal as the extension tube moves in and out of the barrel.Overall, the worst Canon product in years. I sent it back and spent my money on EF glass. Hopefully they'll go back to the tried and true with the MkII in a couple years."
"The image Quality is great as I thought But in my white photos, there was a gray spot . I can Edit it in Photoshop But if it has a problem I don’t want it anymore."
Just got my package today . It didn’t come with the lens cover . And I also noticed it came scratched up .
"Looked up Canon M50 Lens, this is the first listing that comes up. Doesn't fit a m50, at all. Needs an adapter to work. This one falls on Amazons inability to list stuff correctly."
"I bought this lens a number of months ago as my first lens purchase. Keep in mind that if you use a copy sensor body, this lens is more like a short telephoto (80mm or so depending on the system you use). It's absolutely great for the money! Here's my feedback from using it so far.BuildIt's cheap, lightweight, and plastic, but what do you expect at this price point? Don't be banging it around. It is nice and compact though.AutofocusQuick enough for most. Not the quietest, but the older lenses are noisier. Not particularly accurate in low light scenarios, but if given OK lighting it usually does fine.Image QualityIt is actually quite sharp at certain apertures. My copy of the lens consistently back focused and required a -11 AFMA on my Canon 70D to get the sharpest results. That being said, the lens is quite soft wide open and has plenty of chromatic aberration, but gets pretty sharp and the CA goes away when you stop down. For me, it's not very good wide open and I have to stop down to 2.8 in order to get better results. It's even sharper at f5.6. Sharp enough is subjective so it still may work for you at 1.8, but now that I have the Sigma 17-50 f2.8 lens (which I have found to be a pretty decent lens, fairly sharp wide open), there's very little point for me to use the 50mm 1.8 (apart from compact size) because I have to stop down to 2.8 anyways to achieve quality results. I did buy it for its wide aperture but for me just barely usable at 1.8, and only when the shots are taken in very low light where the pictures quality is softer anyways due to noise.So in conclusion, this is a great lens if you are just starting out and want to try a prime, or need something to shoot in low light and you aren't the most critical pixel peeper. This is the best lens you will probably find anywhere near this price point."
"I tested this at a camera rental shop and loved the Bokeh and price!  Clean clear images and the focus was fast enough for what I use it for.  I finally received my item via Amazon and inspected the glass elements and saw dust.  Ok used an hand pump air blower....nope its not on the surface, ITS INSIDE THE LENS!!! What is going on here? Brand new lens with dust specs (naked eye noticeable).  Some will argue the dust will eventually get in and not compromise the photo...but a new lens I expect to be pristine. I disappointingly had to return the item via amazon and wait for another to arrive, hopefully in time for the holidays.  This item is NOT MADE IN JAPAN. But shoulda guessed it from the price.  Oh...and the metal mount is a bit snug vs the other canons...but dunno about people saying ""grinding"".*****UPDATE*****1-10-2016Got my replacement lens in at it looks great with no signs of dust inside the lens.  This lens was made in Malaysia , so I am not expecting the same quality assurance as made in Japan (this is my own opinion, not facts or research on this)  So the lens is still a bit tight upon turning it, no real ""grinding"" like I mentioned some people stated in other reviews.  Photos look great! I replaced my 50mm 1.4 with this one. As far as focusing, I feel the ultrasonic motor on the 1.4 was a bit quicker, but for the price you cant beat this one.  Photos are sharp as to be expected with a Canon lens and I can't be happier with this purchase.  I unfortunately had an issue with my first one, but with Amazon customer care, the exchange went well and I am back to snapping portraits again."
"Lense is great, undamaged, only issue I have is apparently the lense is already registered on canon site, which is really weird considering I got it 'new'..."
I have had the product for over a year and its quality is not that good and decreases over time
"I've owned many ""fifties"" over the years, by many makers, for film & digital cameras. This is my first for a Canon EOS. After reading the gushing reviews throughout the www, I thought I'd give it a try. Sorry to say but this is the worst 50mm I've owned. I'm not going to knock the cheap plastic feel, that was expected for the price. Construction & function is about what you would expect on the front of a Powershot point & shoot camera, not on an EOS body. Performance is very soft, even with microadjustment I could never get a true sharp focus at any aperture regardless of lighting. The unit I received had inconsistent autofocus performance, hunts around a lot and sometimes fails to lock. Light falloff in the corners when shooting 1.8 - 2.8 is pretty dark (though can be used to kind of nice effect). The much praised ""bokeh"" from the 7 curved blade iris underwhelms and still produces distracting polygon shapes that flatten toward the outer edges of the frame to produce a distracting tunnel shaped blur (at least in my lens). A creative experienced photographer can have fun with this, sometimes all of these faults add up to a great ""character"" lens - but not this time. Other ""fifties"" I've owned over the years have been crisp, tack-sharp, contrasty & saturated, consistently allowing me to produce images full of character that the focal length is known for.  This Canon 50mm f/1.8 STM however, produces output that just look junky and cheap as if through dull plastic optics. I'm the first to admit that maybe I got a bad one but it's not worth anymore of my time. it's been returned.(note, I also owned the 40mmSTM, which is still basically a Powershot lens with an EF mount, but it's fun, sharper, and I'd highly recommend over this lens - however it's still cheap and the images look like they're through plastic optics, I ultimately ended up selling it)"
"I am debating myself whether I will return it and get a 40mm instead. I have a crop frame camera, so I need a len 40mm or 50mm. The 50mm has better rating but mine performance is not consistent, sometimes good, specially in day time, but in evening at home, even with good enough lighting, it does hunt for focus a lot, sometime a few seconds on a wall full of frames and I end up having to use point focus and manually choosing a focus. It also allow me do a very micro focusing manually, which I like it. I also invest hood and filter already, it make returning this and the rest a hassle.  A few days to go before I can return it, will do more testing.Well, finally, I have to let go this len. For the case I need to compensate for my existing 17-50 f2.8, it just did not help. I need a fast len as well as fast auto focus. The situation presented to me does not allow a few seconds of wait time. If this isn't what one's constraint, it is wonderful little len one can carry it everywhere."
"So the lens is sharp.But I find this to be a downgrade in some aspects from the previous version.It does not have a distance scale on the lens - meaning that if you are trying to do low light photography, or night skies with this, unless you have a bright object you can focus on, you cannot. With the old version I was able to focus manually and get it right. It was all the way to the right and two clicks to the left and I knew I was in focus at infinity.That is one. Second: Your manual focus is only manual if your camera is on. Why would you keep your camera off? Well maybe you are like me and have other camera bodies that use adapters without contacts... and manual focus.But in this case, the focus ring is electronic meaning that when you move to the right, it acts as a switch that activates a motor to zoom in. left activates the motor to zoom out.As a consequence to the two points above: Since the focus is electronic, even if in MF, you can hear the motors zooming when you manual focus. No way to do a silent video with this thing. Yes, in MF the previous iteration of this lens, you could get silent focusing.I assume this is Canon preparing to switch gears and dumb down their gear. Because anything analog sucks and costs more to produce.Considering sending back this lens."
"The lens arrived with a crack in the inner frame of the lens, The lens works well but this condition can cause fungus to grow on the lens.Applied for a refund and ordered another one!Update:I bought the product again while waiting for the previous lens to be refunded, Incredibly, the new lens arrived with the same cracks in its internal frame... very disappointed with Amazon."
"My first one had a noticeable squeaking sound when using the focus ring manually. It was so loud that it picked up while shooting video footage. With Auto focusing I could hear a audible sound that could be picked up during video footage. I sent it back and got a replacement. The sound is less but still there. I've used the 18-135mm STM lens from Canon before and it was really ""STM"" silent. I guess the ""delivers near silent"" in the description is there for a reason. Well this one is about $125 and the 135mm STM is close to $600 by itself. I guess you get what you pay for. Auto focus isn't as fast as I would have hoped. I do like the aperture that can go to 1.8, good for night time video footage. Bokeh looks nice. For $125 I would say this is a pretty good buy but if you plan to manual focus when shooting video and want to use the on board audio, I would suggest turning the focus ring slow so you don't hear that noise that much. Ah and remember if you don't have a FULL FRAME camera you will not be seeing 50mm, but 80mm so everything will be zoomed in to 80mm if you don't have a full frame camera. I give it 3 stars because of the noticeable noise when manual focusing, which is almost a deal breaker if you want to use your camera for video footage."
It’s good but for I am a beginner so I don’t have much info
"Very poor clarity. The manual focus wouldn't work unless you initiated the AF first, then only worked intermittently having  to re-initiate with AF all over again. Save your money and get a good prime lens."
The lens was great the quality was amazing the only thing was this lens actually isn’t compatible with the canons rebel brand. I have a t4i and my boyfriend have a t6i and the lens on our cameras act as a 80mm lens so it’s wayyyy to zoomed in to use as a vlog lens. I returned it and unfortunately i haven gotten a refund or any updates just yet
"I'm hesitant on the star rating, because, assuming the product you get is functional,  this is technically a great lens. It takes excellent photos with shocking vibrancy & integrity. However, I've purchased this lens twice to date and neither worked well or for longer than approx. a month. The first arrived with a defective autofocus, the second began making harsh grinding and clicking noises then reporting an error to the camera. This lack of reliability could put you in a real bind if this is the one lens you've chosen to travel with on a quick shoot - or to keep your baggage to a minimum. So long as it works, it's great, but don't count on it's longevity and make sure to always pack a second lens, just in case this one suddenly fails (as mine did, the night before a trip overseas).Also,  take note that there are at least two variations on this lens - one of which has a 49mm thread, the other has a 52mm. This particular version takes 49mm filters."
"Honestly my favorite lens I've owned while it worked, but i was in the middle of hiking and went to put it in manual focus to fine tune a shot, and as I went to focus the entire front just popped off. It does still work, but I can't use my lens hood anymore, and the manual focus ring falls off."
"I wanted to love it but the auto focus is slow , I think the lens has messed up my camera & the zoom ring is not Functional.. I would love to get a new one and see if it’s any better"
"I will first qualify this review by stating that I purchased this lens for video based on the description and several reviews that the STM autofocus was ""near silent"". However it's about as near silent as LA is near Tulsa. It's not even as quiet as the kit lens. Moreover when switched to manual focus this lens is just as loud, if not louder. You can hear, and feel, the servo grinding away with every turn of the focus ring.This is unfortunate and odd. Out of all the lenses I've used over the years I've never known one to leave the motor engaged when in manual focus—especially since when powered off the ring spins freely. It's loud enough that even a mic on an isolating hotshoe mount pics it up and an off-camera audio recorder picks it up in a quiet room.It's still a really good lens for the price as far as image quality. I could even live with the autofocus noise, but that manual focus noise kills it for video."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This lens is a really good deal for the price. It's decently built, with a metal mount, and doesn't feel too cheap. It's small and light and is a very useful lens for a variety of subjects. I got it because I wanted something that would give me a narrow depth of field for artistic video recording. It works well for that, but it makes a fair amount of noise when focusing, which I don't like. The manual focus is especially noisy - the focus ring is electronic and tells the motor to focus, and it makes a squeeking sort of sound. I made a video that shows the sound it makes when focusing.I'd recommend it for still photography, though it doesn't focus super fast. I still gave it 3 stars because I don't know if there's anything quieter out there for the price."
"The lens I received in the mail looks used for sure. It has scratches all around it appearing to have been dropped. For the most part it seems like it works and functions ok of course I really don’t know bcuz I’ve never used a lens like this nor am I camera savvy. I don’t like that it seems like the focus is slow and should get a lot closer, from my research on this lens the focus is suppose to be quit swift and close. I hope that it will continue to work, I would have sent it back but I have a tone of projects to do and could not afford the wait time for a new one. Anyway all in all it works ok although I have nothing else to compare it to."
"Great lens and works fine on my camera. My only beef is that Amazon shipped it in a poly mailer with zero insulation. After reading reviews looks like they do this often. So if you order lenses off Amazon, know that they don’t send them in special packaging. Just drop them in a poly mailer and toss them on the truck. If this were a $1k lens or above I’d be really miffed."
Normally when I buy cannon products the box has a seal tape on it and this one didn't. It looks like some small crack lines are on the side of the lense! I tried it and it came out okay but not sure if I want to chance keeping this one and having issues soon.
"From a monster company like canon, I gotta say Im disappointed, this lens takes great stills yes, no doubt, I mean the amount of light they let in in every picture and the bokeh is terrific, BUT.... As far as video goes, unless you edit your sound, this lens is as silent as a b52 bomber, the grinding noise it makes as it autofocuses its just horrible, on the previous version if you set it on MF the focus ring was silent, so there was NO noise, but on this ""improved version"" if I set it on MF, it will still make that grinding sound, also its power dependant to retract the lens due to the stepping motor, you have to retract it before turning off your dslr, if you don't you might end up damaging the lens inside your camera bag.I feel that canon could've done a better job with their most famous and practical lens, I do a lot of video with my family and I was really expecting this lens was silent as they claim, but it is not, my other stm lenses are very quiet, this one is not, keep that in mind if your planning to shoot video.The build it's better though, metallic mount and the overall plastic feels tougher, same great bokeh and nice light in the shots."
"I loved the old, cheap plastic version of this ""nifty fifty.""  So when it got stolen, I was quick to buy the updated version. This one is more sturdy however, the focus ring makes a subtle wining noise when set to manual when in use for video.  This is a bit of a problem if you're a film maker or amateur video maker using the cameras audio in your project (sans external mic)...you'll hear the focus ring making a light squeaking sound throughout your footage, depending on how much you're focusing - which if you're using this lens right - is gonna' be a lot!  Canon serviced it once but it continued to make the noise.  Not a deal breaker, but definitely missing the old plastic version.  Just a heads up!"
"I bought this to use with video. I thought the STM motor meant it would be quiet like my older 18-135mm STM, but it makes a lot of noise when focusing. I found another review where the buyer showed this with video. If it were not for seeing that I would have thought mine came defective. It is just so loud. I almost sounds like the parts need some form of lubricant. It also takes a long time to auto focus."
"I brought this lens under the pretense that it was new, so why did my lens arrive opened unwrapped from all the bubble wrap and messily placed in the canon box. I didn’t buy used lens I brought a new one so I expect the lens to be in mint condition.Very disappointed."
I ordered this lens and it came in great packaging 📦  the down side of this was that the lens that was sent to me wasn't working properly. It took great portrait photos/ close up photos but it would not shoot anything landscape related. Looked like the zoom rings weren't working at all I could not zoom the lend out or in no matter which way I turn the zoom ring. Also i purchased it as new and the lens itself had a couple of scratches like its been used before. I did return the lens and just ordered a new one hoping 🙏🏻  that I won't have the same problem. I then looked on the comments and seen that  another person had the same exact problem it looked like they may have just continue to sent out the same damage lens so be careful when purchasing.
Takes good pictures but now my other lens will not work with my camera . Camera says there’s an error with the lens contact
"Hi, when we got the 50 mm lens, we realized that the indoor lighting was very poor. For a 1.8 lens, we were stunned. Room was so dark at a 1.8 aperture setting. We figured maybe it's because this lens is being used in a full frame camera (our first). However, we finally realized that the lens is a faulty one because we got a 24 mm 2.8 lens that has BETTER indoor lightning with a 2.8 aperture than the 1.8 lens we have! We tried to return the 50 mm 1.8 but could not because we missed the deadline of the return policy by just two weeks! We would appreciate an exchange. :-( disappointment customers."
"So I just got this delivered and was super excited to use so I opened as soon as I realized it had been delivered unfortunately they sent me one that didn’t work! The focus ring does not work and the aperture is also not adjustable, very disappointed."
The lens does its job well and works great in low light. Where it doesn't work well is on occasion when shooting with manual focus the focus adjust sometimes does not respond and you either have to turn the camera on and off or switch the lens from manual focus to auto and then back to manual focus. If you are just shooting auto focus it isn't that bad but when you are shooting manual for video or shoot a wedding or an important occasion it is to high of a problem with a chance to miss the shot because you were out of focus. If you are shooting a important event I would recommend shooting auto until they make a fix to the lens so the manual focus is reliable.
"From the photos used to describe this lens, I was expecting a flatter, pancake design like Canon's 24mm STM lens.  Unfortunately, this one isn't much different in size from my older Canon EF f/1.8 prime lens.  It does focus quieter and it's a little sharper than the old lens but you have to look hard to see it.If you don't have one of these lenses, then absolutely buy it.  If you are considering upgrading from the old model, I wouldn't do it unless you are going to shoot video and need quieter focusing."
"I bought this to be used on my Canon 70D. The lower rating is because I'm surprised how loud and slow it focuses being a STM lens. I bought this camera specifically to use its fast and quite video auto focusing. I can say I'm VERY impressed with the 18-135 STM & 55-250 STM in this regard, but was kind of let down when I opened the 50 STM box, slapped it on, and started focusing around the room. I haven't uploaded any pictures to my computer yet, but thought since I got the lens on day one, I would let others know about the video features that I am interested in."
"The fifty nifty did nothing for me.  Maybe I didn't give it a fair chance, but ya not my thing.  Raves reviews though."
"I wanted to like this lens but didn't. I got it as a replacement for 50mm 1.8 ii, hoping it would perform better on my 80D. Well it was not much better. Optically it is about the same (I actually felt that the previous version was even a bit sharper!), bokeh is rather harsh, and autofocus is not very reliable. I returned it. The 50 mm range on my 17-55 does a better job (and it is image-stabilized). For walkabout purposes, I just got the new 35mm 2.8 Macro, and I really like that lens (and the field of view is better on a crop sensor camera)! If you need something for portraits, get 85mm 1.8 - it's really good! You will not be disappointed with your bokeh with that one, and the colors on people's faces are very pleasing."
This is an inexpensive lens.  I believe you get what you pay for.  If you are looking for high quality photo you may want to invest in a better lens
Couldn't believe how noisy and slow the autofocus on this lens is. I thought the STM motors were made specifically for use with video autofocus but this lens is not great for that. The STM motors on my kit 18-135mm and my 10-18mm are whisper quiet. I thought this would be the same... it's not!
"I really, really wanted to love this lens- I'd read the reviews, and was excited to have a great portrait lens. It's relatively cheap, small and light, and does a great bokeh effect. Unfortunately, I have not been able to get the dang thing to stay in focus! It blows my mind- I'm using it with a Canon EOS 30D, and every single picture I've taken with the lens has been out of focus. Even with a tripod, trying all of the autofocus settings on the camera, it refuses to take a properly-focused photo when using autofocus.I can manual-focus it to be in focus, but to not have functional autofocus seems like a dealbreaker to me. I'm past the return period, but I'm going to have to look elsewhere for a lens that I can use with autofocus."
"I'm not sure if I received a defective lens, but many of my portrait shots are coming out completely blurry. I am an experienced photographer, and have been greatly disappointed in the performance of this lens. Although, when it does work, it works beautifully. I will show examples of good focus and bad focus."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I spent over 30 minutes attempting to attach this 50 MM lense to my T7 camera to have not a single bit of success. After waiting and paying $11 extra shipping to get it as soon as possible because I have a event this week. I have gone back to it 4 times tonight each time ending with the same result. Thus to record the process on the 4th time separately.
Not as impressed as I thought I would be. I much prefer a lens that I can control the zoom. I am fairly new to the photography world and read many reviews that people use this lens for everyday use. Unless you're using it for close ups you have to back far away from the subject.
"manual focus was broken when it arrived, couldn’t get a refund for it. the lenses still works good, just wish it wasn’t broken."
This lens is nothing special and was not packed very well. The auto focus doesn't seem to function and I'm wondering if it came broken which I was afraid of ordering it. Will need to experiment more but was expecting better.
"This was a tight fit on my Canon Rebel T5i, so I'm not really confident it's supposed to fit my camera.  The technology is definitely a step up from the 50mm II version, but overall I'm not sure it was worth the investment.  I upgraded based on rave reviews from everyone on Amazon, but I'm not blown away and am not pleased it's not a smooth fit for my camera body."
"Beautiful picture. Bokeh is flawless. I absolutely love the picture quality, I feel like the focus on mine is very slow. I’ve used this lens on my camera before and the auto focus was a lot quicker. I’m wonder if this one is defective. Over all I love the picture that it produces."
Looking forward to using product but did not fit EOS R50 product
"I love this lens for a lot of reasons but I have been struggling with the focus, I'm not sure if it is just me or the lens but I cant get it focused right on an eye, this is a widely known and loved lens though so it is probably just me, honestly I think I'm preferring my old 70-200"
"This does okay in low-light situations, but is awful for concert photography. I photograph at smaller venues and that was the main reason I purchased this lens. There is one distance you can shoot at, which is very limiting, and the lens barely fits on the body of my camera. I almost kept it for shooting portraits because everyone said it was perfect for that, but had issues with that too. When shooting in normal daylight, everything had a weird red tint to it even after I tried to adjust all of the camera settings. I tried to save some money and saw great reviews, but was disappointed."
"My rating is only for the metal mount itself.  Had to return twice due to poor machinery of metal lens mount - extremely difficult to put on my camera. I have several metal mount lenses, including a Canon 70-200 F4 L, and none of them are as difficult to put on as this model. I felt like I was going to shave metal every time I tried to mount the lens.  I really haven't seen this issue in any of the reviews, but the fact that I experienced this problem with two lenses, I feel there are some quality control issues.  Have had my T3i for several years and own three other lenses that mount smoothly.  I was really looking forward to updating my 50MM 1.8II, but will have to buy at a regular store so I can try it out in person before buying."
"For the price it is a great lens. As a professional photographer, it lacks the crisp and sharp images I prefer to capture. You get what you pay for with this lens. After using this lens about three times, I decided to gift this lens to me sister and her husband. As they have a prosumer canon camera (T5i) that the lens will work on."
"I've only had it a few weeks, so far I'm not impressed as the other reviewers are. The auto-focus seems to have issues sometimes, contrast and sharpness with outdoors shots appears to be horrible, even stopped down. I've taken a few portrait shots, those do look great. Maybe I'm spoiled on the L on outdoor use. For indoor use and people/portrait, def better than the kit lens. Outdoors, look for something else IMO."
"Image wise, this is a great deal. It'll be hard to find a lens at this price that delivers the way it does. But -- it is cheap, plastic, and not durable. The lens contacts stopped working after a year and my 5DM3 wouldn't recognize it. I sent it to Canon and the repair was going to be $75.  If you're just starting out, go ahead and get the lens, but don't expect it to last long."
"When I bought a pair of these lenses, I hadn't even heard of lenses for SLR cameras that do not have a distance / DOF scale somewhere on the barrel (showing you the distance the lens focus is set to).  I guess I'm too old fashioned!  Then I received these lenses, and learned something new.  I cannot use lenses that do not have the distance / DOF scale.  There are too many situations where I might need to set focus using the scale.  I suppose for snapshooters this lens would be fine, but why would a person use an SLR for snapshooting these days (when a smartphone will be more than sufficient)?Thankfully Amazon took these back and refunded me.(I found the lenses I needed on eBay.  For a little less than the cost of this lens, you can find an older but very good Canon EF 50mm f 1.8 Metal Mount Mark 1)"
"The review is bad because of 2 reasons:1. The lens is not very smooth when I mount it on my Canon 6D2. When I put it on manual focus then if I focus on a product and take a picture, then I have to put it on automatic again and click a dummy photo to be able to focus using manual focusing again.Don't know if its just my lens that has the issue or all of them have the same problem. I did see other submitting reviews with metal grinding issues while mounting. That's exactly my second issue as mentioned above."
"After reading all the glowing reviews, I couldn't wait to get this lens. I'm not a "" pro"" but certainly not an amateur, and I find this len's performance beyond poor when it comes to producing crisp, sharp images. So far, I've had to toss 9 out of 10 images because they were so soft. Even stopping up, the shots are almost always out of focus whether using manual or automatic focus. I bought the lens so that I could shoot with it wide open to achieve all of the wonderful effects that produces. So far, at any aperture, the results are disappointing. I guess you get what you pay for."
Got this lens 2 weeks ago and use it once and I saw a spot in a picture when I checked the lens a saw tiny spots all over the lens. Tried to clean it but nothing worked. Ordered a replacement and to my surprise I got a bar of soap.. just check the lens to make sure you’re getting a brand new one
Let me say... all points lost are from the focal ring placement at the end of the lens. I cannot use a hood because it covers the ring. The focal ring is also small and I find myself searching for it in the dark every shot.
I've had this lens for a couple of months and it was working great. Only recently has it stopped working. For some reason it has trouble focusing. I always have it on af but it's been taking blurry photos for a while now so sometimes I have to switch to manual. Anyone else have this problem? How can it be fixed?
"Let me say this first, the image quality is excellent and the f-1.8 aperture makes beautiful bokeh effects. Here's the problem: This lens is insanely loud. Whenever the lens adjusts it's focus you can hear the motor straining. Unfortunately for me, I bought this lens to shoot video for my vlog, and it is completely unusable for that. I have to sit extremely still and nothing can be moving nearby or else you hear the motor go off. I literally came back to the order page after the first time I used it to make sure it was a STM lens, which it is! Unbelievable. It is louder than all of USM lens.In a nutshell: Great for photos, horribly unusable for video due to how loud it is while autofocusing."
There is a mark on my lenses that won’t come off it’s been that way since I first open the box. I’m very upset because this is my first 50mm and i can’t even take clear photos. I hope no one else’s lenses have this problem.
I love the lens for beginning my career in photography. It captures superb portraits and landscape.I find the autofocus is very poor. It is slow and takes lots of adjustment to get the focus correct.
I use this lens for video shooting and while I love that it gives a beautiful blurry background I find it a little frustrating that it makes a TON of noise when focusing. The content I create has me moving around a lot and holding up products so the sounds of autofocus in the middle of the video are not terribly fun to have to work around...
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I'm not saying that the Lens isnt not good or anything.. just make sure to check it first before use because apparently mine came with a non functionning focus ring also I couldnt adjust the aperture manually it was 000 and I couldnt adjust it.. I'm really disappointed !
I’m a beginner photographer I think this lens is just amazing . Works great for my canon m50.
"Does not work with Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLRIf you have the Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR, do not buy this. It is listed as ""buy with this camera"" but it does not work. The lens I was shipped was an RF not an EF, and therefore useless to me"
"I use to have this lens before in the non automatic focus version. After I lost it I replaced it with this one and, Im not sure why, but there's a huge difference in the quality. I dont think is the material, due my previous one was also a 'plastic fantastic' but in low light conditions it doesnt work as well as the other one, the focus is not neat and it gives my pictures a 'pasty' look which I have and didnt happen with my previous one."
"kind of pitched as a nice prime video lens. but it is NOISY. Even with hot shoe mic installed is nothing but focus whirring. id skip for video use. but portraits turned out very nice...color, bokeh and sharpness are very nice."
"The lens itself works fine and is good for portraits. However the outer rim came with a weird sticky residue. For a new lens, that's unacceptable. Did I pay full price for a refurbished lens???"
Was not made aware that this len was only good for EF (not RF).  Beware and do additional research just because you put the exact camera type in the search the Amazon search results where wrong.  Now out over $100 due to past return date.
"I haven't tested this lens thoroughly yet, but generally I haven't been too impressed. I have a 18-135USM which came in a bundle and I've found it to work much better than the 50mm in almost every situation."
"It seems to be a good lens for the price. However, I purchased “new” from Amazon and this product was not in the original packaging from canon."
"Package arrived on time and lense seems to be as advertised, however there was not a scan disk in the package."
I want my money back
I really want to love this lens. It is great if all you do is manual focus it. The autofocus is not only loud but doesn’t work! The focus ring is really scratchy and makes horrible noises. When I shake it something inside it rattles. I’m not sure if mine came broken or what. Seems like it did. Very disappointed.
Autofocus and manual focus were not working.
Great buy for beginner! When shooting with 4k it shoots about 85mm so just be mindful of wind angle
I put my t3i on my smooth as silk camera dolly slider and the jiggle was horrible.  For photos it's great.  For video it needs Image stabilization.  I went back to my kit IS lens.
I read a lot of posative reviews for this lens....i hated it personally...very narrow field of view and image quality was/is not very sharp..its ok but there are much better options.You often get what you pay for.
"This lens must be defective. The images are not sharp and crisp. I DO NOT like it and would not recommend it. I'm about 30 days out of the Amazon Return or I would return it. I haven't been able to use it much since I got it the first week in December, but for the amount of photos I shot when I did use the lens, only a very small percentage were clear. I would love to return it and get my money back and buy a different lens, but I doubt that they will stand behind the product."
"Very Amateur Photographer here, but to me, this lens is very difficult to put on and remove. I have the 18-135 STM and it's buttery smooth to put on and remove, but this lens feels like metal grinding on metal. Should I return? Please help Canon. I'm worried it might get stuck or ruin my camera.PSThe picture quality is outstanding once it's on/"
Received my 50mm f/1.8 lens today.  It does not go to an aperture of f/1.8 on my Canon 5D Mark iv.  It goes to f/2.8.  On my 5D Mark iii and on my 50D it will go to 1.8.  Is this a function of my new 5D Mark iv or is my lens defective?  Anyone know?
"Looks good but doesnt sound well built, woth a loud motor it almost sounds like it wont last long or it wasnt greased well internally"
"The manual focus ring was not working ... i am not using lens , another amazon product goes into broken items package..."
Photos up close on auto focus are still a bit blurry.  Not my favorite.
the stm motor was annoying as you are unable to retract the focus ring when power off. also the focus speed is slower than normal lens.
You get what you pay for. My recommendation is this lense is not worth the money you pay for it
"Not sure what happened, but I just received this product in the mail and the box was completely empty… Extremely disappointed since I was going to use this lens for a photoshoot in a couple days. I’m sure the lens will be great, but not thrilled about receiving an empty box in the mail…"
"It provides beutiful photo but it is difficult to zoom in and out, the lens seems to set fixed distance."
"Not if you like manual focus - no distance meter.  Auto focus is OK, but not always on the money."
"The 50mm is my favorite lens. When my first one broke I was devastated but had comfort that it could be replaced. This lens was ""different"" than the first one I owned. It focuses differently and I feel the images are never as sharp. I don't know if it's a lemon or if it was made differently. Not satisfied."
Zoom doesn't always work well but it is a good piece of glass for the price. I don't know if I would buy it again...
"Received the lens today, opened the box to see there is NO lens caps. Don't think this lens is even new, looking at it out of the box. Super inconvenient now to have to return it....."
Update: I’ve had this lens for only two weeks and the auto focus is not working anymore. And the manual focus doesn’t work correctly so basically it’s a useless lens.I am very pleased with this lens. I’ve used it a few times and it is exactly what I expected! This lens is a must for portrait photography!
"Good for stills but don't buy for video. Although this is an STM lens, it makes a good amount of noise."
For some reason it really doesn't fit right on my camera. It seems a bit tight or small or something.
"I don't like to say I hate it. Perhaps I hated the way it didn't work. I put it on a brand new camera & it kept clicking & not focusing.  Took it to my local, dependable camera shop & they confirmed something didn't sound right & that it wasn't working. While I was there, I ended up picking up two other fabulous lenses.Maybe I'll try it again down the road."
I keep getting a error on a brand new camera other lens I purchased are working perfectly. Makes weird noises when shooting before getting a connection error. It looks brand new but functions otherwise.
Has difficulty focusing.  Slow to focus.
It’s fake
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I feel extremely disappointed and scammed with my recent purchase. I ordered a product from the official Canon website, fully trusting their reputation, and what I received was a lens-shaped thermos instead of what I had ordered. Furthermore, I paid extra for faster delivery, and to my surprise, the result was even more frustrating. The order arrived on Friday, and despite the entire weekend passing, I am still waiting for them to contact me to collect the incorrect product. This situation is completely disrespectful and dishonest. I did not expect this from an official website, and I feel deeply defrauded."
"I hate it when people leave reviews for defective products, but in this case I think it's actually important for people to know because this is such an EXPENSIVE product and, a full month after ordering this lens, I still don't have a working one and had to request a refund.As you can see from the images, it doesn't matter where I focused, the lens looked like it was moving (despite being on a tripod) and looks awful!  Also there was a grinding noise when it attempted to auto focus.  But I've NEVER seen a defective Canon product...like, it never happens to me (the box wasn't damaged at all or anything.)  So I assumed it was something I was doing wrong...but it wasn't.I will say that Amazon was really great about taking back the defective lens and offering to get me a replacement.  Where they dropped the ball was that UPS (according to tracking) has been stuck at ""Label Created"" for the past week and have never received the lens.  Now the only option I have is to wait for a refund and order it from a camera specialty store, which I'll be doing from now on for mission-critical purchases for my photography business."
"I paid more than $2500 for the brand new lens and they didn’t even bother packaging it properly (see photos). The lens came with the Canon box directly exposed (which was also badly damaged). The bottom and top of the box appear to have been previously opened and re-sealed (see photos). When I took the lens out of the box, the “brand new” lens had a lot of dust and water stains on the side and front element. Keep in mind that the front element was protected by the lens cap in the box, therefore the only way to have dust on it was for someone to use it previously."
"Canon products are great and I have no issues with the lens itself, other than it seems to have a faulty sensor, but I blame that on Amazon and how they handle items like this. I have to return it and I'm sure they will just ship it right out to the next person who orders one. I've had enough issue now with Amazon and their Canon products to have finally learned my lesson."
"Hi I’ve returned this lens shortly after I had it due to finding something better for myself. Anyways, it’s been a few months and I haven’t received my refund."
"I tested this lens for a week with my EF version and optically it is much inferior to my venerable EF Mark II lens. The only advantage of the RF version is the optical stabilization, which don't use as a videographer as I am shooting interviews from a tripod. The cost of the RF version is just orbital, I don't know what Canon was thinking."
Canon just increase the price today without warning people.There is no good reason for that and it is in back ordered for month.I would like to add that Canon Europe gave some discount if you buy expensive lens like this throughout the year while Canon US never did anything.
"Had to return like 3 of these - terrible quality control - dust inside, jerking when zooming in/out. Finally got a well made one, but picture is too soft/blurry. Yes, it’s cheap, but i would buy more expensive and better one."
"I purchased the Tamron 18-300 in the summer of 2023 for a trip to Maui.  While on the trip, I did use it however I gravitated to my Sony 11mm and Sigma 18-50 for a few key reasons.  Portability (size & weight) and overall picture quality.  One gripe I have with the lens is that the bokeh (out of focus background portion of a photo) is unpleasant.  Also, do not think this is a good lens for moving subjects (at least in my experience).  I ended up selling the lens and purchasing a Tamron 70-180 f2.8 as that has a more clear purpose with fewer compromises for what it is meant to do.  The Tamron 18-300 is meant to be a jack of all trades (in my view it is not) and is clearly a master of none.  I do not miss the lens and will not be buying it again in the future."
"The lens struggles with focus speed. It also struggles with sharpness and detail. I purchased this lens because of its large zoom range, so I don’t have to swap lenses. However, after testing this lens, I noticed it was significantly more blurry and slower to focus on objects than lenses with a smaller zoom range. If you want a lens that you can leave on your camera to capture any moment and don’t care about quality, then this is decent. However, if you care about quality and wanting to capture a good picture, then I recommend buying two separate lenses, one wide angle and one zoom."
"The lens works just fine. The wrong UV filter was sent. Case says 67mm, but filter says 72mm."
"I think my product is broken due to failed packing of product into shipping box. The image it produces is very soft and has trouble focusing. Also when shaken it makes clacking noises, though I am unsure if it is the ""vc"" parts not engaged.. I don't know. It is alot worse than what I spent way to much time researching and looking at from sample galleries and reviews. I have the a6400 so the autofocus should be good in ideal lighting... it isn't.  I think it has to do with the poor and soft images it produces..  like one of the elements being knocked out if place maybe? It also has very heavy purple fringing especially at 300mm. Again I think I have a damaged lens. Shame that I can have a cheap unbreakable object overpackaged with padding but a fairly expensive product thrown into a large box with no padding at all to flop around in a box on trips known to be rough... ships and sold by Amazon... come on guys... I know not everyone knows about lenses but isn't it common knowledge to secure a product in a shipping box?.."
The zoom is very jerky. Meaning it doesn't zoom smoothly which makes for unpleasant use for video.
It is a nice lens. It could be a little more crisp but it has a good reach.
"Lens has a great range: 18-300 is unbelievable range and sharp for the most part, but i had to downgrade rating because if the flareimages are sharp and autofocus is good.However there is a  horrible magenta lens flare/ghosting that is very annoying and is seen in the videos, even with the sunlight to your back. It's worse when you are shooting against the light making this lens unusable between 18mm and almost 60-70m.My first and last Tamron lens"
Terrible product and Tamron has even worse customer service
Distorts about 25% of all photos making them unusable.
for the warrenty  if not sales from Tamron  humm you have to deal with Amazon  not Tamron.
"It is a good lens. Its compact, great quality, and affordable price. But auto focus isn’t that fast. Thats the only con for this."
It doesn’t really focus as fast in af mode
Bought this lens to have a knock around daily carry for my A7IV. I was expecting a bit better quality from all the reviews. The focus ring is suuuuper plastic and not very smooth and the lens hood is comically bad. But the image is pretty solid for what it is with good bokeh. In sun you have to keep the hood on or it flares and looses contrast quick.If this thing had a better build it would be a home run!
"Was doing a great job until I tried to edite raw pictures in Lightroom. All the pictures turned out to have a lot of noise and grain that made them look vintage. Which was not something I was looking for. If you don’t Edit your photos, may be it could work for you but didn’t for me. I sent it back."
"Great compact lens for street photography  and probably the best budget full-frame 35mm for Sony and the AF system is fairly tight.  But it has its drawbacks.  Very bad distortion with no correction support from Adobe,  so be prepared if you’re OCD about straight lines, because you’re going to put in some work getting them.As with most Rokinon glass you’re going to have a significant amount of chromatic aberration, not a deal breaker if you’re used to shooting budget glass."
"The Autofocus is inconsistent. I had the latest lens firmware and the A7c. The AF is sluggish or inaccurate. On two copies of this lens. I thought it was soft, but after troubleshooting heavily it just frequently slightly mis-focuses.The AF, while quiet, is also audible, and would be picked up by the internal camera mic. Definitely not silent.If you want top notch AF that’s completely silent, and you don’t want to worry about nailing focus: get the Sony 35."
"Unacceptable level of noise as camera focus. Drowns out all other sounds in your videos. This noise gets worst as the len ages. Besides the noise, len Produces great pictures/videos that are sharp and clean. Pretty  good bang for the buck. I noticed rokinon made a series 2 version which are twice the price and vertually noise free. Apparently they know they went cheap on this version and had fix the noise issues."
The description of this lens says that it is silent I will tell you right now that it is far from Silent in fact it is actually very noisy when it is trying to focus even in manual focus not just somewhat noisy it is very noisy almost to the fact where I might have to return it and see if I just have a broken version
Not only is there strong red chromatic aberration in trees/leaves against the sky (it looks like a child outlined the leaves in a magenta crayola marker) there is a slight red tint to the sky itself. This is something that just can’t be fixed. This lens is really poor value for the money. But it sure is light!
had high hopes but cheap can never look good in my opinion
"Paid for new Rokinon 35mm lens, but received a lens that was a return/used. See pic - as received - lens was loose in the packaging. No clamshell case. Top shipping styrofoam missing, while bottom was there. No plastic shipping wrapper covering lens. I immediately returned."
Not working straight out of the box.  Where can I get help? I have a Sony A7iii.
"I returned this lens because the adjustment ring was faulty.  On the manual focus function, it did not work at all.  On the aperture function, it allowed stopping down, but not opening the aperture.Too bad because the sharpness of the lens was excellent.After returning it, I took another chance on Samyang and bought their 24mm f/1.8.  The build quality is much better, it works flawlessly, and I love it.  Too bad the 35 mm is not the same quality."
"I’m not impressed. I’ve purchased a new lenses but I’ve received a used lenses. The lenses case was missing, the lenses was scuffed up. Just to top things off, the lenses failed to auto focus properly."
Custom button faulty. It cannot be assigned. I am about to return it. Focus ring only assigned for aperture control. Influencer are hypping up this product. I cannot say I am happy with this Rokinon.
"Seeing alot of 5 star reviews, and ok pics, I thought this would be a good buy for My Sony E mount camera. Truth is this is not worth $423 after tax. 200 mabey. But definitely not double that.The image is not that great until you edit it. See the before and after pic. I'm a professional photographer, and the base image is pretty bad. There is ALOT OF GRAIN at f1.4, with a very muddy look. It also has terrible bokeh for a prime lens. It acts more like an f2.8 lens, you see plenty of detail in the background, where you should have an ultra blurry background. Fine for a beginner but not a pro.Other lenses like the canon EF F1.8 50mm, completely blur tbe background, and cost $100 and can be adapted to Sony E mount! I use Fotodoix adapters, and honestly My results are significantly better.This lens truly doesn't feel like an F1.4, until you are taking night photos. Only then you can get tons of details, that is f1.4 quality. Loads of light comes in, which is great for night shooters. It even shoots great night video, but does tend to overexpose a bit, without extra accessories.For everyone else, go for better glass. This is going to overexpose images of a few occasions, cause extra grain, offer no stabilization,  and produce awful bokeh..all for a brisk 400+ dollars. This is a solid night photography lens, but that's it. Unless you like editing out plenty of imperfections.Btw, this also isn't great for youtube videos. The manual focus ring is too big. You can't hold this lens and stay in focus 100% of the time. This lens messed up plenty of My shots, because a focus locking feature wasn't added.It's an average starter f1.4, and not Sony G glass or Zeiss material. So if you're looking for that just buy the better glass.Goodluck and don't fall for the glowing reviews like I did. Most people reviewing are clearly new to photography.Note: Top pic edited, bottom pick not."
It’s a used product but in good condition. Missing the lens hood though so I had to order one separately.
"I was excited to try this lens because of al the positive reviews, and it seems like such a good deal for an f1.4 autofocus prime at 16mm. The first lens I got was completely dead!  It would not focus at all!  I tried it on another Sony camera body.  Manual or autofocus did not work. I’m a professional and have owned over 20 lenses since I had started photography and videography, and this was the first time I ever encountered a dead lens.  I got worried after I turned off the camera and inserted my other lens because it made a really strange noise in my other lens when I turned on my camera. That lens had silent autofocus, so it shouldn’t make any noise!  I was afraid the defective lens damaged the electronics of my a6400. After running some tests it seemed ok.Thank god for Amazon’s excellent return policy. I got a replacement 2 days later, and it works fantastic! It’s on par with all the fantastic reviews I read. Autofocus works very well on the a6400. I bought this for video and at f1.4 it is sharp enough for video. It is a very cinematic lens with shallow depth of field, and at a 24mm equivalent full frame focal length, It’s the perfect gimbal prime lens for the a6400. I give 1 star for the defective first lens and 5 stars for the replacement.  I just worry about the longevity of this lens. Make sure you buy it from an authorized Sigma reseller.  Not all sellers on Amazon are."
"Got this to shoot youtube (music) videos and cinematic music videos.I don't love the way this lens receives light and perceives facial features. It's just TOO sharp and harsh, even in natural light. Could buy a soft focus filter to compensate-but for 400$ I want the lens to just work- u know?So far anything focusing on beauty or cinematic portraiture it's a no... Wrinkles, dark circles, etc- all exaggerated. The autofocus works ok. So that's nice. It's also a very loud lens so you got to get it away from your mic if you have audio. I don't know if I will be able to keep it cause it doesn't fit my needs. People rave about this lens for cinematic video/vlogging etc, but I am not very impressed. My 50 dollar film lens converted to digital does better work. If you aren't trying to do anything particularly beautiful or are shooting scenery you could be okay. If you want to make art- this probably isn't the one for you."
I received the lens in a little cardboard holder that was open inside of a box with all of the other items from the combo. It says it comes in original sigma packaging but that is not what I received. I am not 100% sure if this is a brand new lens.The lens does work and looks good. It did come with smudges on the lens (which also makes me wonder if this is not a new lens. That is the only reason I gave this 3 stars. I paid $400 dollars for this and they shipped this expensive item very carelessly.
I hate when I buy something brand new and am not sure if it really is brand new. The box was open and the tulip lens hood was absent.The lens was shipped with another order and the main box was sealed so clearly this happened before my item was shipped. The lens looks otherwise ok and I don’t want to go through the hassle of sending back and waiting.The lens works great and I believe it will be a great addition to my camera ZV E10.The low score is due to amazons poor handling of this order including a little petty theft at their distribution center. I ordered a lens hood to replace the missing one.
"The item came a day later than scheduled which is not a problem. The lens came in a beat up box and I paid for a ""new one"". The lens also had a few scratches on it as it if had been used. Fingers crossed on the performance of the lens."
"Recieved Sigma lens and right away I see that Amazon chose to send a nearly $500 lens in an envelope (see pics). Pretty bad. When I open the envelope I see the box containing the lens. On the outside of the box I notice that there is a label covering another label. The bottom label says new. And the the label? Yes a label Amazon places when an item has been returned. Yes that means that I was sold a used lens when it was clearly not a new one. I open the box and I see the lens but I notice the documentation is crinkled and the lens hood doesnt come wraped in platic. Ok now its definately a used lens I say to myself. Then I put the lens on my camera and I test the lens and I notice the autofocus motor sounds unusual. It sounds like its making a louder sound than it should. So I compare it with another copy I have which I have that I bought new and sure enough I confirm that the used lens had a problem as I cannot hear the unusual sound coming from my other copy. Very bad. How does a seller (curcuit city) selling a lens that has been returned and used by someone else and sell it as new? And for the full purchase price? How does Amazon allow this? By the way, I thought circuit city disapeared. They dont even have an online presence and I hope they dont do business again if they are going to be cheating people like this. Watch out you dont get a used Sigma lens!"
"Size, price, construction and the very fast aperture are all great. However this lens is for cropped sensors. I use a full frame and the max wide angle of this lens is about 24mm. There is no manual focus toggle on the barrel so you have to switch to manual focus in the camera menu. Finally the images came through in a very high contrast particularly outside with vibrant colors. Skin tones were just not very good. Adjusting them in post was not very effective. I think this works pretty well for landscape but definitely not people."
The lens itself is great but it did not come with a lens hood as stated. I'm shooting in a controlled environment so I'm not too worried about it but be aware if you absolutely need the hood.
If my title didn’t say enough. This lens is a huge disappointment. Bought because of the amazing feedback from the sigma 35mm lens for full frame camera so I was hoping this 16mm for crop would be just as great. Not at all! This lens Front Focuses so bad! And then the focus beyond that is subpar. I used this on my Sony a6000 and at first was thinking it was just my camera or a firmware update problem but after doing that and seeing perfect focus from my tamron 27mm-70mm I Knew it wasn’t my camera! Again so disappointed I was looking forward to this lens so bad. Now it’s just a waste of $400 just sitting in my camera bin. And Everytime I think I’ll use it. I’m left with pictures out of focus and just unusable.Just don’t buy.
"First, I am a professional photographer who always looks at images full size. I was hoping for a light and fast lens I could use for street and landscape photography when I didn't want to carry the weight of a G master or Sigma Art.  I am not too proud to admit that I fell for the allure of the great reviews on the Sigma 16MM. I am not suggesting that you would not be happy with this product, but for me it was a non starter. I tested the lens against the Sigma Art 20MM and the Sony GM 24-70. I know the focal lengths are different, but I was looking for shadow detail, color rendition, vignetting and chromatic aberration. In short when I brought the images shot with a Sony A7RIII set to APS-C I actually thought I was having issues with my eyes. When I brought the other lens' images in, I could see that my eyes were fine.  In short, sharpness, color rendition and shadow detail were all about 20% of the higher priced lenses. Chromatic aberration control was OK, but not great. It's on it's way back"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I dont usually do this but as soon as I opened it I saw there was something inside the glass, really hope its not used. Hopefully I can give it a better rating once I get the replacement."
"The lens works fine with my A6400, good photo quality and fair size.HOWEVER, the shipping is a big problem. The outer box is sealed and fine, but the box of the lens itself is wide opened, literally wide opened, when I received it. Luckily the lens is inside the box and seems no damage."
I received the item in terrible condition. The box was completely damaged and it was obvious the lens had seen better days. I have bought used items before and understand that these items are not in perfect condition. The worst part is that the lens would not connect to my camera. I own a SONY ZV-E10 which is compatible with this lens. At the moment you could buy a brand new lens for about 20-30 dollars more and it is honestly worth it. Do not waste your time buying it used just!
"This was out of the question the most inconvenient and out-of-nowhere lens failure I've had. It had been a while since I needed a wide angle lens. When I finally did need it for a photoshoot, I slapped it on and the lens made loud noises while auto-focusing, violently shook while attempting to auto-focus, and left a very distorted, unusable image. When I got home, I did more of an inspection, tried sensor cleaning, tried checking for any blotches or stains on the lens, checked the mounting area for any stains or dust. I've tried using it in different settings just to see what was going on but nothing fixed it. I would not recommend this as a reliable lens especially if you are a professional photographer.SO SAD :("
"When I say it broke, I literally picked it up out of its case and it split in two.  I have used it maybe four times and it always is handled with care.  I contacted the email I was provided via my order to ask for assistance and all I was told was that I had the wrong email as they didn’t have my order number.  I copied it directly from when I ordered off of here.  Maybe there is A way to fix it but none of my lenses ever had this happen…"
"I think that could be a mistake while the product being shipped out. I was expecting to receive the boxed package, but instead there was a small thin envelop which contained a piece of unknown metal with the correct description and barcode...I called the customer service immediately and she was nice enough to send me a replacement. (that's why I gave a 2 stars for the service)Fingers crossed to receive the right lens..."
"I bought this product off Amazon (brand new), it was shipped from Berlin, took 5 days to get here and arrived in this condition, contacted Amazon to show the pictures and they don't have a way to receive archives, thankfully the lens works and the quality is insane, the 2 stars is because this could have arrived damaged, amazon should start looking into their ways to ship products."
"very angry.  I bought an expensive lens.  but Âmzon sent me the goods in a lousy way.No wrapping, no carton  box, no shockproof.only 1 thin poly bag (no shockproof) .If unfortunately it will break , damaged ?.I am so disappointed with this package of seller"
The problem damaged and the warranty was not work. I did call Sigma they we’re not accepting the warranty.
"The seller circuit city isn’t a quality seller after 3 months of light use the lens does not work anymore I contacted the seller for a refun and circuit city did not want to refund me , I know there’s a manufacturer warranty but I do not want a refurbished lens when shopping with amazon I want to be able to trust there 3rd party sellers to sell quality products and amazon also lied to me about refunding me and denied it many time and waisted my time , amazon customer service used to be so good now there very shitty and liars beware... I have screen shots of promised refund and was denied"
I could not get this lens to connect to my Cannon M50 camera. I do not think it is compatible.
"The lens did not even connect to my camera body in the sense of being able to focus. I had the right mount to attach the lens but once on the camera it wouldn’t even auto focus. Returned it, got my refund and got a different lens that has worked fine since. Feel like this would be a really nice lens but I’ve heard other people having issues with these lenses too"
After reading the reviews I thought that this would be a great lense and maybe it is. Can anyone help explain to me on why the pictures aren't sharp at all. It doesn't matter if I use auto focus or manual focus they always come out blurry. I'm using this with a sony a6600. I'm not sure if I got a faulty one or if there is some settings that need to be changed
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was so excited for this lens!Sadly to say that this lens came broken. When I opened the box it didn’t really look secure. I  inspected the lens and  I notice the inside is broken, I was highly disappointed. I decided to return the lens & get a exchange. I have been waiting for a Response and no one has reached back to me."
didn't fit my sony a6100. Disappointed about that. It did fit my a5000  just not my a6100.
I ordered this and it was supposed toCome with a memory card but it did not. I was pretty upset since now I had to spend more money to get a memory card.
My package include nothing but a memory card. It even says 1.9lbs on the package but it was missing everything— NO LENS in the package and no accessories other than the memory card. This order was time-sensitive and I will now have to cancel a professional obligation because the items weren’t *actually* delivered. I won’t order from this seller again.
"The Sigma 16mm that I received looked used, or maybe it was the fact that they shipped the lens in an envelope? The image was blurry and wouldn’t focus properly. I sent it back.I did, however, purchase a Sigma 16mm from another source and it’s AWESOME. I would highly recommend the lens. Just give it a once over after receiving it to verify. I gave it a 5 Star on my other review."
"My lens arrived broken, literally split in 2 parts, I bought it used like new, not happy with this"
"I have had the lens for about a month and out of all the lenses I have for the Sony A6500, this is the worst. Plan on returning it"
"Lens works fine electronically but the body, hood, and cap came covered in white paint that someone tried to cover up with blue sharpie. Quality product from Sigma but the seller should be banned from Amazon."
Product didn’t fit my camera so returned next day checked tracking and it was delivered on 9/28/22 @ 2:59 pm and still no refundNot happy
This lens is truly terrible. Soft focus roughy out of the box. Had it professionally calibrated and even they said it was crap. It will not take a sharp image. Do not buy!
received in a paper bag with no padding. its a great lens and fortunately no damage
"Description from seller, BuzzPhoto, stated item was new......it definitely isn't! Won't ever purchase anything from them again. Lens has a large spot on it and was disgustingly filthy."
This is how I recieved my new sigma lens. It looked used with large cracks. Completely destroyed lens.
The lens is defective what is my next move ?
Gray market lens from Pro-Distributing.
Awful lens for real estate. Image shutter lag. Distortion and incredibly high noise. Actually unusable.
The lense has a crack inside. I didn't look at the details of the lense until a few weeks after I received.  Really disappointed!
ordered this lens does not work and they won't exchange it
Worse customer service
"I do find the lens hunting for a subject a lot. Not a lot of room for creativity imo. Very wide angle... Best for cityscapes, in my opinion. Though I haven't used it or been to the city yet. Hoping to do more with this lens in the future, maybe concerts! Will update my review later on."
"I couldn't wait to try this lens out n I was so disappointed in the quality of the photos taken with it.  I adjusted the settings on P, A, S, and still the worst quality of photos I've ever seen. The Photos came out very dull, cloudy, not vivid , n well light as the reviewers photos posted. I'm returning this is not worth the price, will cause alot of work to adjust the photos during editing."
"All the accessories seemed fine, but the lens seemed to be used. There was no plastic covering on it, the hood was already attached, there was some dust on the lens too, and worst of all – there were fingerprints on the front and back glass. Returned."
Using it on Sony A 7 Iv .this lens is not a Full fram meaning that when you use it on a full frame. it ends up like a crop lense.AKA 'zoomed'in paper it's a 16mm with a D1.4 which is nice for night photo BUT . for landsape nop..it is equivalent to a 24mm...i didn'T really pay attention at first but it was strange in my eyes that the lense was not that wild.when i compare it to my tamron  after few weeks and yep it is trully not a wild anglewas only slightly wwilder than my 28-200mm tamron 2.8-5.6dabsolutly useless for me. sorry
"I’m still figuring out my camera setting for this len, but soo far, i got it for its aperture and its not disappointing"
Item arrived and was clearly not a brand new item. Seal on box was broken and lens was dirty. I paid full price and so I expect a brand new sealed item. Returned for a full refund.
"5 star to sigma lens and Amazon.1 star to seller - been trying to reach the seller shetala camera agency since a couple of months to register for warranty but no luck. Avoid this seller if possible. So only 3 star until am completely satisfied with Amazon and seller's service.About the lens:1. No major issues except being a bit bigger in hand if you are coming from a kit lens.2. Brilliantly sharp but misses autofocus probably due to my old sony nex 6 crop sensor camera.3. Bought this specifically for milky way astrophotography and believe me this lens rock. Low iso due to wide aperture helps taking clear noise free pictures.4. Can hear autofocus motor noise when shooting in quite surroundings, not that bad though.5. Manual focus ring is quite sensitive to touch and can easily alter it accidently by touching.6. Do not expect great bokeh unless shooting closeups.7. Rather than what you are this lens depicts where you are. Picture from lens tells a story rather than focusing someone for a Potrait.8. Overall an awesome lens.. Go for it for landscape, street and night photography."
The box with the item clearly was opened before and not too sure if the product hasn't been used prior either just a returned parcel.
"When I attempted to register this on the Sigma website I wasn't able to. This was the response I got. Unfortunately this serial number is not on our system as an official UK import. Please re-check the serial number (which should be 7 or 8 digits) and the product you selected. If the serial number has been entered incorrectly please re-register on our website with the correct details.If the above serial number and product you have provided are correct, the lens has not been imported by Sigma Imaging (UK) Ltd and therefore we cannot offer this complimentary extended warranty.In the case of legitimate imports into the EU but outside of the UK, a chargeable 2 year extended warranty service is available.I have to say I feel conned here Amazon as I don't believe this was stated in the advert. I'm left unsure whether I have a genuine Sigma lens or not. Hopefully someone will write to me to re assure me on this matter."
"I ordered this lens for an urgent video shoot job and it arrived with an Amazon Warehouse sticker on it.I absolutely did not order a second hand item and especially not a lens!The lens was covered in dust, with a very dirty lens that needed extensive cleaning. To top it off the lens does NOT work and is faulty!!Amazon this is the 3rd time you have done this by sending a secondhand Amazon Warehouse item to me without making this clear at purchase. The last time was a monitor that still had the previous customer’s address on it and had been sent back as it was faulty!I will be sending this item back and raising a formal complaint with you. I will also take the matter to the Which consumer group to alert its 10,000’s of members.This is a disgusting practice that you are operating Amazon."
"I tried really hard to like this lens, but... The sharpness is quite low, the quality of the image details is poor, and the fact that I'm stuck with only 16 mm made this lens absolutely useless for me. My 50 mm Sony prime lens costs half the price and provides a much more superior quality, so I ended up using it all the time and playing around with the physical distance just to avoid using this Sigma wide angle lens. In the end, I returned this Sigma one and bought the Sony 18-105 mm power zoom lens, and am so happy about it!"
"After receiving my lens (which is a good quality lens, by the way!), I registered it with Sigma right away but around a week later, they sent me an email saying:""Unfortunately this serial number is not on our system as an official UK import. Please re-check the serial number (which should be 7 or 8 digits) and the product you selected. If the serial number has been entered incorrectly please re-register on our website with the correct details.If the above serial number and product you have provided are correct, the lens has not been imported by Sigma Imaging (UK) Ltd and therefore we cannot offer this complimentary extended warranty.""I double checked everything was correct and Sigma came back to me saying:""I have double checked our database, and this lens is not one that has been imported into the UK by ourselves, therefore it’s a grey import.We do not have any record of where or how this lens entered the UK.We would advise that you contact Amazon and request that they replace the lens with an official Sigma UK import, as the lens you currently have is not.  They should not have supplied a Grey import.""This is pretty disappointing, and I'll now be buying this lens elsewhere."
"I am very surprised on the hype for this lens. In my tests the pictures were not as sharp as even the 60mm f2.8 lens from Sigma under the same conditions. Yes it does provide more light and hence background contrast in indoor conditions but the sharpness and most importantly the details were not even close to what the 60mm f2.8 lens provides. Huuhhh, I was so eager to have this lens in my set of lenses for A6000 but now :-("
"I’ve bought 2 months ago and just noticed that it produces weird bokeh balls. There is probably a defect in some elements of the lens. And now, I need to pay out of pocket because it is considered a grey lens from the Sigma Canada’s point of view."
"It would be great if the lens hood may be replaced, because I have received it in broken condition. The Lens itself is in good condition. I cannot mount the lens hood to the lens in this broken condition."
"Heaving read and watched several reviews, I had great hopes with the lens. Firstly, the item I received did not appear to be a brand new one. The packing and condition indicated that it was used/returned item or at least it had been opened. Secondly, with my Sony a5100, the autofocus on face tracking was very sluggish, generating seconds of out of focus video of normally moving face. Considering other reviews, the focusing issue could possibly be only because the lens I received was faulty. Anyway, returning it after having disappointment in my great hopes."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Experience with a usually excellent lens (per gloabal reviews) marred by being sent a used piece by Amazon.As can be seen in the attached pictures and a screen record, 3-4 dots appear in most of the pictures.Now photos with too bright upper half have no issues as these spots are not visible (they are still there though).Also attaching the condition in which the box arrived. It will be in part 2 of this review as only 1 video attachement is allowed per video."
"I ordered the sigma 16mm e-mount for my Sony A6400 yesterday (12th January 2021) and it arrived the next day. However, I am very disappointed with the product, evidence that the lens has been definitely used previously and amazon has just sent me an returned product.The box that lens came in was not sealed at all (not even with a sticker) and when checking the lens, dirt (mud mark) and finger prints was noted(please see picture).Extremely disappointed, will be returning the product."
Despite reading another 1 star review on this issue I thought I'd go ahead and hope that this was a UK supplied lens.Unfortunately Sigma rejected my warranty on the basis that this is a grey import lens. Grey imports are generally cheaper because you have to pay for the UK warranty. Amazon please sort this out.Returned the lens and will re-buy from a reputable supplier.
"I kept on hearing amazing stuff about this lens, however,  when I received my lens and tried it out I could hear a strange noise coming from the lens whenever it would try to focus. If you move the lens gently to your ear, you can hear a rattling noise. I am disappointed with the condition I got the product in."
The lens does not focus properly at f2.8 and 5.6. Still 3 stars as the optics is great and its the best for sony apsc
"Where is the quality control ? Probably not at SIGMA. This +500$ lens came with a big scratch INSIDE the glass RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. So quality control is nonexistent. Like always is this situation, lost of time, money... Very Very disappointing !"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                As can be seen in the attached video, the lens had some stains on the inside of the glass, which cannot be removed. The lens itself looked like a used/refurbished piece. You're paying 30 grand for a product and receive a refurbished piece, wow."
I don't need this product I want my refund. I am not satisfied or got the quality of autofocus. It's picture quality is not worthy for professional work. So I don't need this lens.
Received damaged lens. It was cracked from rear end.
Not at all weather resistant
Noise and abnormal vibration. And black spot emerging
"Got an old used item, returned it."
"This is the most cumbersome lens I've ever used and I cannot believe the reviews weren't filled with complaints about it. You have to ""open"" the lens every single time you turn your camera on and want to take a picture and then you have to adjust it to the focal length you want by moving it right to left/left to right. You cannot just quickly turn on your camera and take a quick photo. The ez lens 14-42 is the way to go."
"The lens is really light weight. It is not a pro lens, but it works. What I did not like about the lens is that it must be unlocked and extended to use. The extension is not about zooming it. The viewfinder of the camera will not turn on unless the lens is extended as shown in the product image. One of the benefits of a wide-angle lens is its smaller size. This allows the photographer to blend in and to draw less attention to themselves when taking photos so that others are natural and will drop their guard. The ""mandatory"" extension doubles the size of the lens and calls attention to its presence, which is not aesthetically pleasing. Worse, it defeats the objective of trying to remain unobtrusive. The fact of its lightness might offset this concern for some people. The choice is all about what one's goal is.The images were shot as close as I could get to the subject. The headphones and lens images were shot at 14mm; the shot of the monitor was at 42mm. They are not great images, but show an average shot with the lens."
"I needed to replace the original kit lens I got with my Olympus Pen E-P3 with this one -- I accidentally dropped the lens and it no longer works past 27mm.Amazon's selling it for a great price & despite my father telling me to never buy lens from Amazon based on advise from photography forums, I went on ahead.Interestingly, the 14-42mm lens I bought last week arrived with a missing silver ring. So I returned it & paid $5.75 for postage to ship it back. Amazon states ""since it's their error, they will reimburse up to $5.05"" after the return is delivered. I'm out $0.70 for their error.I immediately reordered another on Amazon. Just got it now... Again, the lens is missing the silver outer ring. Either, Olympus is messing up with their packaging, or it got stolen by a previous customer who ordered the same lens & returned it.Either way, it's upsetting & annoying enough for me to spend time writing this. I should really be showering after my gym work-out & cooking dinner. *sigh*Amazon really needs to check their items before shipping them. This is time-consuming. Not only do I need to drive to the post office, pay extra for postage I won't be credited back, now I need to wait for Amazon to but the refunds back into my credit card. All the while, not getting the intended item. And to top it off, this is not an isolated incident.I hope you all have better luck."
"Lens was good up until the time I could no longer return it.  Now when you try to extend the lens any further than 25mm you get a message saying ""Please check the status of your lens. So at this point I can use it as long as I stay at 25mm or less.  This is undoubtedly a manufacturing flaw and not the fault of the seller.  It's just too bad it didn't last any longer than four months.  You'd think it would have a warranty on it good for a year or more.10/24/20 Update:  It no longer works at all."
"I bought it one month ago. I tested it with a few shots. It worked fine. I then put on my backpack for a long flight to a foreign country. When I used the lens again in the foreign country, I just saw a black screen on my camera body and the lens did not work at all. I could not believe it because I carefully handled the lens along the travel, and  It worked before. I later figured out that some components inside the lens was not tightly screwed, so after some turbulences on the flight, the lens failed to work. Unfortunately I could not returned it cause I was away from the USA. I should buy a new one instead of this kind of used lens. You don't know if it has some inherent problems or not."
"This lens arrived thrown into a shipping box with no Olympus box, no warranty, no instructions. I kept it several days as it was actually a gift to me from my husband. We ordered the lens attachments that are made to attach to this lens. (Olympus has come out with a wide angle and a fish eye lens attachment for this lens.)  That's when we found out the lens is defective. The attachment lenses just fall right off of it.  As does the metal ring which came on it. I am waiting to see if this company will accept a return/refund. They do not post their return policy and there were no automatic return responses. Based on the shoddy shipping and lack of original box or any paperwork I would not recommend this company ."
An attique lens that will get the job done. It doesn't have an optical image stabilizer. I use my GH4 for movies and stabilization is key. Other than that: beautiful build quality and a picture that is just fine.
I bought this lens to use with a micro four thirds panasonic camera.Works perfectly and i take some videos and photos in a event in my country to test the camera.Good lens.
"Micro-4/3rds is a great system, but with my large hands I am finding that the gear is too small for me to feel comfortable with."
"Bought this for an EP-L1 converted to infrared. This lens is okay, nothing exciting. Will probably sell this item as micro 4/3rds format is not for me."
"This is a fine little kit zoom, but it is NOT the lens pictured here. The lens pictured is the Oly 14-42mm II R lens (newer and much faster at focusing). The lens being sold is the 14-42mm II. Again, a fine lens, but beware of the image."
"it worked well, and honestly was perfect for my uses, but an internal wire, or potentiometer, (could be either) was broken, and now the lens, though it should be working fine mechanically cannot properly communicate with the camera, and as an electronic only focus lens, it becomes a fancy paperweight. if only it was actually heavy enough for that."
Good lens for this price point
"It's OK. Not worth more than 75.00,"
i bought this lens for bmpcc and the lens had shutter problems.  shot some indoor footage with regular lights and it was almost dark and couldnt see the video.  sent it back and had to pay the shipping
"I got the Olympus Pen EPM2 kit and it came with this lens.PROS:1. A big positive for this lens, is the small size. This lens is tiny, the pictures do not let you understand how small this lens is.2. It covers a very useful range, 14MM (28MM on 35mm film) is, too me, very wide, if you like wide photography you can get started here. Then when you move into 17MM that is about 35MM in 35mm film, this is one of the most popular fields of view. Try the lens at 17MM and see if you are a 35MM fov person. Next we jump to 25MM, which is akin to 50MM, the other most popular lens field of view. Using this lens I found that I like the 50MM perspective. Finally you can jump to 42MM which is about 85MM on 35mm film. 85MM fov is very good for portraits of people.3. The lens starts up immediately with the camera, and focuses instantly. Speed is not an issue here.4. Sharpness is pretty good. It is a kit lens but you will get good pictures with it.There are no cons with this lens, only people must understand the limitations of this lens. It has a normal kit lens aperture, it is a slow lens, not fast, but in bright days you want to use f5.6 to f8 anyway so you will have no issues.If you are in museum or your house with low lights, this lens will not be very good. The aperture cannot open enough to let in light in these low light situations.Finally on a personal note, I do not like zoom lenses, I do not like having to twist the lens and zoom in and out, I like Prime lenses, I like on fov and working within the limitation. Having said that though, the lens is smooth to operate and has a good feel when zooming, unlike the Olympus 40-150MM which has a very tight feel, and can be hard to zoom with.If you are getting a new Olympus camera, and you can get this lens. get it, if you do not have this lens but already have an Olympus camera, I would just look at getting good primes, or one of the two (Olympus and Panasonic) kit electric zooms. The electric zooms are optically the same, yet are even more compact.*Extra Review. I feel I was too hard on this lens when I wrote this review. I shot with lens today, generally at aperture 5.6 to 8. I got some good pictures. I would say that at f8, it is surprising how many lenses look very similar. Or should I say, that with modern camera lenses, at f8 there are not many bad lenses. This is nice lens, it covers a good range, I found myself going from 14 to 17 to 25 and and finally 42. And I find that I like pictures best at 25MM, or 50MM fov when talking about 35MM film. This is a good lens to understand how to take pictures with different focal lengths. This lens is one of the best lenses for use to understand what lenses to buy next. So I would actaully give the lens  rating of 4 stars, for value and for usefulness."
"This lens is somewhat difficult to review, because for the price it's great!  It definitely out performs it's price point. Seriously for $100.00 it's an outstanding lens, but as you add more lenses it will probably send more and more time at the bottom of your camera bag.  I also like to take my bike out for a spin on the weekends.  I'll put this lens on my E-PL5 and it fits nicely in my small Lowepro camera bag; actually, I have room for an extra battery as well.  In sunlight this lens produces decent quality photos, with good saturation, and contrast.  Focusing is fast and the zoom range from 14mm to 42mm is a very serviceable.  In lower light situations this lens will frustrate you, and maybe even cost you some great shots.  I used this lens at a family gathering and captured some amazing shots, but I lost about 20% due to slow focusing or botched focusing, and because of that mishap I went and bought the Panasonic Lumix 20mm and Olympus M.Zuiko 45mm.  My 14-42mm is getting a little hard to find at the bottom of my camera bag these days, but still weekend bike rides it's a trusted companion."
"Pretty frustrated with this lens.  I bought this as the kit lens with and OM-D body (not on Amazon) and thought it took decent pictures at first, though the plastic mount did not inspire confidence.  Several months later when I was on a trip in another country I got the message ""please check the status of a lens"" on my camera body every time I went above 30mm or so.  Turned out that this is a common issue.  The flex cables wear out quickly, creating a inconsistent connection.  I took the lens apart and it is completely unrepairable even though parts are available.  Avoid this lens, especially at this price."
"Yes, I've owned this lens for awhile and it's well out of warranty. Never-the-less I hardly expected that a plastic ring would come oozing out from between the lens body cylinders and jamming the lens up. I've got to think long and hard about rewarding Olympus with the $299.00 purchase of a replacement."
"The great advantage of this lens is that it is sufficient to get you photographing adequately in a range of circumstances. But if you expect it to be great, you will be greatly disappointed.You don't buy a Micro 4/3 camera to take merely ""OK"" photos, but if you stick with this lens you will be working with a handicap. I would definitely pick up a couple of primes to give you higher quality options."
"OK, when I bought my EPL2 back in 2011, it came with a 14-42mm II.  It went dead one and half year later with the problem of “please check the status of a lens” prompted once trying to  zoom pass 30mm (approx) with long motor noises within the lens.  I accepted the fact that I may be unlucky and got the ""bad"" one.  Thus, I have it replaced with a 14-42mm II R in 2013 and nothing wrong with it until 2 days ago when I tried the shoot some casual shots, the same old ""please check the status of a lens” appeared with the ""EXACT"" symptoms when trying zoom pass 30mm.....  Am I really that lucky or this is actually a product design defect?  I have no answer, but, I am sure I won't buy this again."
"This is the 2nd 14-43 lens that I have purchased for my EPL-2. Both lenses functioned almost exactly until the warranty expired and then started the ""check the status of a lens"" message. This is Zuikoese for ""Buy a new lens."" I have tried all the ""fixes on the internet with no success. Worst performance I have ever seen in a photo product! Don't buy this piece (or pieces) of junk! I would rate this ZERO stars if I could!!!Paul Heimnick"
"DO.NOT.EVER.BUY.THIS.LENS. Two of this lens I bought one after the other developed the dreaded lens failure. The longest to survive was for 3 months, then it went kaput. Instead, buy Panasonic LUMIX G VARIO 14-45mm/F3.5-5.6 ASPH./MEGA O.I.S. Lens."
"for taking photos,14-42 mm kit lens by olympus for pm2 is one of the worst out there...NOT SHARP at allbe ready for massive photoshopping of ALL your﻿ photosmight as well get a tiny compact camera at half price, it is much sharper.thanksjapan amazon sells this pc of nonsense for about usd 120  btwand uk amazon wants  usd 400 for same pc of wreck"
"Camera Lens are very expensive, so I was so excited to find one for cheap. BUT this camera lens is sooo cheap its really upsetting because of how much I was looking forward to it, on top of it running late getting to me"
"The lens is fully capable of some nice and very easy bocah, however simply packing it in my bag, flying to another state, and simply turning the FN ring, I hear a slight plastic snap noise, and suddenly the lense is barely hanging on together.... focuses when pushed together, but FN ring is shot.Advice when buying this budget lens, get as much as you can out of it before it cracks."
"Nice lens, took a minute to figure out why I couldn’t take photos with it, scared it might break quicker than expected."
"It takes great photos if u can hold the camera steady, hand held, any micro movement will mess up all the photos, but for the price it's good"
"All around it was a good lens, the issue I had was a piece of silicone was clearly seen in the optics. Must have come loose and floated over. If it weren't for that I might add another star. Don't be cheap, buy a good lens. I had to waste time returning this just to spend twice as much like I should have to begin with."
Lens worked well. It was a bit more difficult to focus on my subject due to the lens focusing on the background.
"I had high hopes, but I took it out this am and shot about 100 images, a variety of subjects and going through each aperture setting to see where the sharpest f-stop was.  There was none.  Maybe it’s good as a portrait lens to remove wrinkles etc, but it’s not for my style of photography.I boxed it back up and returned it."
"Gives a great look, shot on a APS-C lens so it really shot more around 135mm. Lens really struggled to get sharp images at 1.8. Pretty disappointed"
"It might be an excellent Len but not a good fit for a Canon Camera.I’ll spend 4 time the amount, ($) on a Canon Len, then I know it will be an excellent FIT."
They claim it works for r100 it did not work for me
Lens arrived in a beat up box.  It would not work with my R7.  Returned.
Received this product in the mail today and unfortunately there was already a scratch on it upon opening!
It said in the description that it would fit my specific camera but it does not… very upsetting
My camera kept saying lens not attached and I realized that it’s missing the little gold plates to connect to my camera gold buttons 🤦🏽‍♀️. I was really looking forward towards this lens!! If there’s a way to fix this please let me know!!
"I was really excited to buy this lens; however, it’s not compatible for a Canon R8. Not sure if I need an attachment or something but the camera does not recognize the lens and it doesn’t want to work even when I put the camera on manual mode. Very disappointing. :("
"item is not compatible with the Canon Rebel T6 like advertised. Also, packaging was not appropriate. Camera lens came in bag and there no was protective measures. Also there was a scratch upon arrival."
"Lens is only for canon, if purchased for Sony or Nikon it will come with the lens for a Canon instead."
After sitting manual focus it seems looks okay when we look through the camera but after taking the picture it looks very blurry. I tried n number of times and I couldn't get a clear picture. Also the picture quality ignoring the blur. Also quality of the picture is not good. Using it with Sony camera is of no use is my feeling.
"Good for the price, considering! Don’t us it often as it take a bit to get the photos right and sometimes can be annoying trying to focus when in a hurry"
The lens fit the camera mount but would not lock so was able to be used. The item was returned
"This product is something found on TEMU/AliExpress rebranded for double the price. Quality is not great, the paint smudges"
I purchased the lens to photograph C/2023 A3 with my canon 80d. This lens doesn't produce sharp stars until it is stopped down to at least F/3.5. At this price point that is to be expected.
Description is wrong and is too small to be a ef mount.
Very poor quality product. It was necessary to return it immediately as the base separated when attaching to the camera.
Item not compatible with Canon EOs 90D as described by seller.
This lens is not compatible with the Canon Rebel T7i
This product does not focus well at all.
"This is a very interesting lens to me, on one hand it's cheap and it's not great, but if I keep taking enough photos, I am going to get one that I can work on post and be usable. So, I have been using this lens for about a month now and I can safely say that it's not the best lens in the world. Though it’s ok, it really is.Basically, no matter the picture I take with this, I will need to do a lot of post work on them. Definitely have to denoise, sharpen, and fix the chromatic aberrations which are everywhere and those things are after we get it in focus. I have taken pictures of the moon that I was sure was in focus but they came out, completely out of focus, that is something that happens easily as even the slightest movement shakes the image too much. Given that there is no image stabilization that is to be expected. Ideally, you want this to be on a tripod, get your focus and then use a release trigger for the picture.I enjoy walking around and taking my pictures so I took it out a couple of times on a very sunny evening, that is the ideal scenario. On a cloudy day, with the aperture as it is, the ISO would need to be on extremely high to end up with a usable photo, so the sunnier the better. Because I am walking around, I increase my shutter speed to as high as I can go, minimum 1/2000 or higher, and then continuously take pictures, there's going to be at least one I will be able to use. Using a mirrorless camera also helps, focus peaking is a godsend for this lens.On a tripod, there's a little less issues, don't have to worry about it shaking, but issues will be there nonetheless. The main work is always in post, as I had to denoise every usable photo, and fix the aberrations. This is not for everyone. It is good for practice though or if you are on a budget, and just want that one photo. You will get that photo, it's just that you will have to really work for it. Personally, I feel that mastering a lens of this type will make me a better photographer, as I will have to come up with ways to make things work.The reason why I docked the two stars is not because of the quality of the lens or the photos, but because when I received the lens cover, it was stuck in the lens, really badly. It definitely fell and bumped and got stuck, which means the packing is not good. I had to use a screwdriver to pry it open. The cover was still usable afterwards, but the work I had to do to make the lens usable is unacceptable."
"Manual focus for a cheap lens makes sense. No auto focus is a hassle though. Honestly this thing is so skinny, I thought it would be bigger in diameter. I use this with an adapter for my sony camera since this is a canon mount, so maybe that also contributes, but the photo quality is not the best. Take it or leave it. Feels like the clarity of looking through binoculars or a monocular"
let me start with this. I knew what to expect. This is a ridiculous value for a lens. I am aware of that. Good lens this size would run you easily 1k and up.I am aware that it is manual focus only and has no image stabilization (my camera does have IBIS built in though)Unfortunately looks like my lens completely skipped QC process.There is a big mark (fingerprint possibly) in the inside of the last lens. And I do mean inside. It had to be done during assembly because it is impossible otherwise to even touch that part when assembled.This resulted in completely pictures that are 30% clear and 70% blurry and smeared
"I should have expected this, Though i still had high hopes.EF line up has been around for a long time, so there is tons of time for development of a good product.I would not say this is one of them.Essentially this is a metal tube (props for being metal atleast) that has some glass on each end.It is manual focus, thats fine for the price point, but the f stop is super high. AKA it lets virtually no light in.There is a reason you see these telephoto lenses with HUGE pieces of glass. This thing feels like a pringles can.You literally need a TON of light to even get the grainiest picture. I would say to get a decent picture you would need to be on the sun. Or pointed directly at the sun. Outside of that everything looks like it came out of a 80s polaroid.I wouldn't recommend this. Would be cool as a self defense mechanism, or a place to hold chips."
"I took a punt of this being compatible with my Canon SX50 and unfortunately it is not as there is no mounting rack on the front of the lens. As such I am unable to review the performance of this lens, but I can attest to to it being well made, seemingly easy to attach with a twist function and it comes very well packaged. A shame, but I should have double checked compatibility before ordering."
Dont know why this happends. Overall the performance is great but dont use portrait orientation
The box with the lens was not sealed. The lens mount is dirty and covered in dust. It looks terrible.
"I Just took delivery of this lens and threw it straight on my Panasonic S-1, the live view popped up on my monitor, but when I pushed the button to take the first image .. nothing, and then a few seconds later the error message appeared ""Lens attachment failed. Please make sure the lens is attached correctly"" stopped, started, removed, reseated, cleaned the contacts, I placed other lenses on there which work BUT every time I attach this lens I get the same error ""Lens attachment failed. Please make sure the lens is attached correctly""Really hoping I can get some support on this $1000 purchase."
Lens was shipped without cap and unpadded with rigging items in a box. Something must've bangwd out of whack because nothing I've shot with this lens was sharp. I've had great luck with sigma art glass but this was a huge disappointment and probably a dud or defect so now I'm waiting on my refund for returning and will be turning to Leica instead
This lens is a great starter lens if you're getting into full frame auto focus and is very fast with the new Panasonic S5II. The image quality is clinically sharp and has little to no character vs using cinema lenses which tend to have softer highlights and warmer skin tones. This lens is just as good as the more expensive sony and lumix versions for a fraction of the price. Build quality is also great and the mount has zero play on L mount cameras. Would recommend for the price and focal length options.
The lens is fine.But I wished I knew before hand that Sigma's 7 year warranty is not included for any Sigma lens purchased on Amazon.The great benefit of Sigma lenses besides the affordable price and quality is the 7 year warranty...which is not included with Amazon orders.Amazon should clearly state they are not an Authorized Canadian SIGMA dealer.
"Although my lens were ok when I received it, there was no bubbles in the box to protect it during handling and shipping. Considering what I paid for and the fragility of the lenses it should have been better packaging."
"From the reviews, it seems I’m the only one with this problem, but I’ve experienced pretty annoying levels of chromatic aberration with this lens, and I don’t want to have to edit it out of every photo in post."
Good value for money. I was disappointed not to receive the lens in its box but in bubble wrap that was torn. It certainly took a long time to arrive.
"Good all around  lens for just about anything, you can get pretty creative around the yard with this lens, you can zoom in pretty close to birds in your trees or it’s great for street portraits where you can be fare enough away people don’t know you have a camera and act different."
"I was looking for a mid-level zoom lens that was not really heavy so took a chance on this one. It’s ok for still shots but with moving subjects like birds or bees, the auto focus is too slow and I missed several shots. Difficult for the lens to maintain focus on moving objects especially if there’s something else in view. Using on a full frame camera."
The auto focus stopped working after only 7 months.
The motor for the Auto focus is super loud. You can hear the motor moving your videos. Also the lens feels cheap
Deep scratch in lens after 1st day! About 2mm long on a 58mm lens!  Made of plastic not glass??  MADE in Malaysia.  No lens hood with lens as comes from factory (like Nikon provides on their lenses).  Terribly disappointed in quality.  Expensive lesson in poor quality.
Lens was not factory new. The seal on the box was broken and the bottom of the box was not in new condition. Looks like the lens was purchased and returned by someone else.
Lens looked banged up. Scratches and dents all over.
Came with a chip in the lense
The lens are messed up. When I add this lens to my camera it clicks and tells me to clear the lens. I sent this back to the owner and still have not got my return money.
"Really disappointed! This came broken, the lense is scratched, and the cover doesn’t even fit. Waste of money!"
"Disappointed, I used it for about a week and then I have to take it to technical support due to moss inside the lens. I am not sure if it is brand new or it was in a good location."
I can't find any reason I would recommend this lens other than it's cheap.
"ME MOLESTA QUE APARARECE UN TAPA SOL Y NO LO INCLUYEN, FALSA PUBLICIDAD, DEBERIAN SER MAS CORRECTOS"
"Design is great! The lens itself, is terrible!"
"It's a useful lens in the sense that it does a good job of zooming in on objects that are far away and showing you things you can't see from a distance. If you're trying to see what's going on waaaaay over there, this lens will be effective in finding out.However, if you're going for shots that you'll want to show off to others or possibly sell, you'll notice that it has some issues. The major one is chromatic aberration - a color distortion that shows up around the edges of things in your photos, especially when you have a white or bright background. You'll start noticing purple edges around things in many of your photos. It's visible in some of the photos that have been posted by others, and in the one I'm posting - the white birdhouse appears to have a purple edge along the front of the roof. Also, the wire holding it up looks purple, and there's a general purple hue to most of the dark lines in the birdhouse. Once you notice it, you'll see it in many of the photos you take with this lens. In some cases it can be fixed if you're good with photoshop or other such photo editor, but not always, and it's a pain to have to do those repairs often.Other issues are the lack of image stabilization, but at this price, that's to be expected, and isn't that big of a deal, especially if you have a tripod. But for a novice who is on a tight budget, this is generally a good tool to have in your photographic tool kit."
"Horrible green and purple fringing, mediocre sharpness, slow and loud auto focus.If you’re on a crop sensor buy the 55-250. It costs a little more but has stabilization and is a lot sharper. I’ve owned both.If you’re on a full frame camera, don’t expect miracles. It’s a budget lens that will get you to 300mm and that’s it.Buy nice or buy twice."
"This is one of Canon's worst lenses. It is not worth spending money on, especially not on a brand new one. While the large zoom range is nice, this lens is not sharp at all. There are much better lenses out there used that are significantly sharper and within similar price range used. Even a cheap vintage 300mm Pentax is noticeably sharper for moon photos."
"If you saying this is a great lens then you haven’t figured out what resolution is yet. This lens is able to capture about as much detail as a cell phone camera. In reality this is about a $20 lens. It is literally Canon’s worst lens, period."
Product box is damage and lens can be removed from backside of the box. Product not looking original. And Canon says dont accept of box is damage or seal is broken
"This lens was not very smooth to open and close.  Other lenses have a very smooth motion but this was not smooth, there is no way you would have been able to take nice videos or multiple pictures with it."
Worst product in this range.... It's to costly and quality of image very poor!!!Not getting happy
"WARNING!  THIS LENS WILL NOT WORK WITH THE T5i!This lens comes with instructions stating the firmware for the T5i MUST BE UPGRADED for this lens to work.The Canon site does NOT have the upgrades on its Canon USA site.  After calling Canon I was told to go to the CanonEOS site.  As I have Windows 10 the upgrade will not work.  You must pick Windows 8.1 for the new firmware to show up.  After that the instructions for the download are contained on a PDF.  This is where the Canon rep left me on my own, unfortunate because I had waited some time on the phone to get the rep and he did not understand my problem at first.  Then, he left me at this point to download the new firmware.  It didn't work.  After going through the download procedure many times it failed to download the firmware.  And, the download requires many steps to complete.Now I have a 300 dollar lens that my camera will not work with.The lens warning on the instruction sheet for the lens applies to the T5i only.  If you have another Canon camera it may work.  Of course, it may not work.The Canon support was awful.  The Canon USA site was useless for accomplishing anything.  That site told me there were no downloads for the T5i. The instruction sheet does not direct a person to the CanonEOS site, and I did not know such a site even existed.  The fact that the download is so difficult even after the hidden site is reached makes the entire process even more frustrating.  Firmware updates should be very quick and easy, not an outright nightmare, and the Canon USA site should direct a person to the EOS site for firmware updates it doesn't have.  In addition, when it detects Windows 10 the site should not announce to the user that there are NO UPGRADES for Windows to OS and abandon you.  It should state that upgrades are available for 8.1 that will (or should) work on Windows 10 to upgrade the T5i.  That a company as large and sophisticated as Canon could miss this is beyond belief.I do not find a warning anywhere on the Amazon site.  Canon is under an ethical obligation to post this information concerning the lens and its adaptability for the T5i.  This failure to act is incompetent.  Too bad, because I have used Canon products for years and generally enjoyed them.  Putting a customer through this kind of ordeal isn't going to gain them more business.  Trust, a major component for sales success, is damaged greatly by these actions.AD2"
"This looks like a great little vlogging lens for medium sensor cameras like the 80D. In theory. Because 10-18mm is 16-29mm equivalent, which is wide enough. And it is light weight, has stabilization and a silent step motor, all desirable features for any video work.But in practice I found this lens just too slow (in terms of aperture) for general vlogging purposes. Unless you want your face very deformed, you end up using it in the 14mm and above range, where the aperture drops to f/5.6. Meaning all indoor footage turns out either extremely grainy or under exposed. Even at 10mm and f/4.5 it's still quite dark. So unless you are planning to vlog in full daylight only, I can not recommend this lens.For photography it's not even worth considering, it is not a particularly sharp lens and the step motor offers no benefit in photography. In the same price range you can get an older model lens, with USM motor (or no motorized AF at all), but sharper glass and/or more aperture instead.For a really cheap vlogging solution on Canon APS-C cameras, get the Canon 24mm f/2.8 pancake lens and screw a $15 wide angle converter lens on it. You will get a wide enough angle (just about), with blurry edges but good enough center focus. Enough to keep you going until you can afford the holy grail of APS-C vlogging, the weather sealed Rokinon 14mm f/2.8 AF."
"This is a great lens for webcam use, etc, but not great for any moving targets on the Canon T7–autofocus does not operate even with the stm features."
"Before this lens I had never purchased or even used a Canon product that I hated. Unfortunately, I truly hated this lens. While I bought it understanding it wouldn't be as good as an L series lens, I still expected this to be useable. The lens wasn't sharp at all. I wasn't able to get a single picture to be anywhere near as sharp as any other lens I own. I took many photos, handheld and with a tripod, and the images were truly horrible. I've been able to get amazing photos from even a 18-55 kit lens, but not this one. Out of the few hundred photos I took, ranging from indoors to outdoors landscape in full sun, I didn't get a single photo that was useable.I own both L lenses and regular Canon lenses. I always get amazing photos from my L series lenses and also get amazing shots from my non L series lenses (although my keep rate for non-L is about 1 out of 10). While the F/4.5-5.6 may not seem that outlandish for a lens this inexpensive, it just didn't perform well even in full sun. Indoor was a no, but that was to be expected.The build of this lens however was nothing short of what Canon makes for every non-L lens. It seemed sturdy, didn't feel cheap at all and wasn't heavy or overly light. The downfall was the image quality. I may have received a bad copy (which is entirely possible) as I have seen some beautiful pictures from others who have used this lens. But for me, this wasn't a lens I wanted to keep as it was likely defective."
"I have been a professional photographer for many years.  I have tested this lens and so far I'm not impressed.  My copy is full of distortion.  The lens either needs to be re-calibrated or replaced.  I have the 10-22 and this 10-18 is not even close in image quality.  I will be sending it back and will update this review when I've tested the new copy.  I'm not saying this is a bad lens.  I am saying that the copy I have now is not clear in any way..  We'll see.Update:  I have had the second copy of this lens a while now and as much as I was hoping this lens would live up to all the reviews I have seen here...""it simply doesn't""...If you cannot afford the canon 10-22, get the 10-18.  The 10-18 will give u average image quality.  I simply cannot stand distortion in my images.  I have been doing this for a long time, and yes, more often than not it is the shooter rather than the lens that produces good or bad image quality with camera shake and other ways.  I have tested this lens against the 10-22 on a tripod and there is NO comparison.  The 10-22 beats the 10-18 hands down....good luck."
"This is an okay lens. I had used it fairly regularly for a couple months a while back and just recently decided to purchase it for myself. Unfortunately I have decided to return in and simply save this money for a nicer lens, the quality in both the build of the actual lens and of the photographs is takes is ""okay"". Nothing about this is bad but I feel like $300 is better spent towards a nicer lens. If you are looking for a wide angle lens with decent quality for absolutely no more than $300 then this would work pretty well for you. I hope that this helps someone with their decision. Again, for $300 it's not terrible, but then again it is a $300 lens so you can't ask for too much."
"I am a real estate photographer, and I had 2 big problems with this lens. Gave it 3 stars because it was nice and sharp especially outdoors, but I had too much ghosting on interior photos, and distortion along the right side. Always on a tripod, and always f9-f10. See the photos below. I had to return it. Going to try a 10-22mm for the second time. The first time I got a used one and it was soft on the right side. I know they are fantastic, I edit photos everyday taken from an 8 year old 10-22mm. Maybe I'll have better luck next time.*Photo 1- green ghosting in mirror*Photo 2- distortion on lower right side"
"I have owned it for a few months now. While I haven't used it every day, I have taken several shots to feel comfortable with it.PROS:-  It produces sharp images. That is what I was looking for in a wide angle zoom.- Light weight, good size.- Very quiet/quick focus.CONS:- Plastic mount. Seriously Canon? Even Nikon's inexpensive primes have metal mounts.- 5.6 is slow no matter how much image stabilization it boasts having.- No lens hood.- All plastic construction.Overall it's an ok lens. I would have been happier with a couple of wide angle primes, but this alternative was cheaper."
"I love the photos the lens takes when I do not use my flash, they are incredible for my real estate business BUT when I use the flash I get a dark shadow circle at the bottom of every photo unless I zoom in further, which really defeats the purpose.  I am wondering if using an detachable flash would help with this but really don't want to buy a flash just to figure it out.  This is its only downfall, but a big one since I take photos inside and need a flash."
"Didn’t have the opportunity to try it out, but don’t make the same mistake as I did. Did I miss something in the description? Should have done better research. Luckily I am able to return."
"I was excited to receive my new lens, but as soon as I opened the shipping envelope, i knew something was wrong. I could hear my lens rattling in its box. The lens was just sitting in the box. It was covered in dust like it's been sitting on someone's shelf. And the leads are slightly worn, suggesting it's been used. I've purchased several other lenses for my camera in the past, none have arrived like this. I'm not at all happy with its condition. If I wanted a used lens, there were cheaper refurbished lenses on Canon's site."
"Well, it is really wide and really cheap. Thus ends the good news on this lens. The bad news is ... everything else. It blows my mind to see this lens rated so high. The only explanation I can get my head around is that fact that it's dirt cheap. You can't go this wide with any other Canon lens at anywhere near this price point. I also owned the 10-22, and this lens doesn't even compare. The images lack sharpness and contrast, build quality is as flimsy as it gets -- it's embarrassing actually. Of about 20 Canon lenses I have owned or rented, this is at the very bottom. Buy this lens only if you want to go really wide and image quality doesn't matter."
"Inexpensive is the best thing about this lens. I got it to try and use my cheaper 70d for real estate shoots, but this thing flares off of even bedroom ceiling lights. Not fun trying to remove green blobs cast by anything with a glow. It's just fine outdoors away from the sun, the STM and the IS are nice and again, for the price it's tough to beat. It all depends on what you want to use it for..."
"I usually love Canon lenses and, for the price, this seemed like a great bargain. However, I found the auto-focus (which was incredibly quiet) to be unreliable. I just wasn't able to consistently produce photos with the clarity others have described when using his lens. I found MF a challenge because the focal length is so wide -- especially when trying to ensure distant mountains or landscapes are in focus."
"This is a good lens for the trips you really don’t want to abuse your high dollar lenses. The zoom isn’t smooth, it is pretty plasticy, and it’s not very bright."
I bought this for my vacation trip to Yellowstone. It performed wee for my lanscape shots and inside the room shots at the Old Faithful Inn. It has some flaws that cause spots to show up sometimes but overall I was very pleased that I bought it.
"I have used this for wide angle family shots at weddings...  it has some distortion in the corners becuase of how wide it is, so just be aware that it can get a little fish eye on you if you dont use it correctly."
"The only plus is the speed and quietness of its auto focus. Image quality is the worst I've experienced. Thankfully I did a side by side comparison with my EFS 17-55mm on my older camera using the same settings. Other than the wider angle (which is why I bought this), having my larger lens was the only reason I didn't waste a weekend. I wasn't expecting it to beat the more expensive lens, just to compliment it at times. I could have done a side by side using the camera on my phone and still not been impressed. Sending back today."
"First one I received malfunctioned right out of the box.  Good news is that Amazon, cross shipped a replacement in a few easy clicks.  A++ Amazon!  Canon... not so much on this low price, low quality lens."
"Great wide angle, gets fish eyed indoors. Not an L lens quality of course but a lens that turns ur dslr into a regular wide angle camera"
"Its a good wide angled lens, nice autofocusing, even though I use manual. Quiet auto focus, bright image in daylight, BUT chromatic aberration is awful and low light performance is not good!!! Was taking images for coworkers, but it was so lame to share it with them, they immediately zoomed image and you could see outlines of green on some sides, red and yellow on another. Honestly I regret that I bought it."
"I had the lens less than one month and the focusing went out. Will not be buying any camera equipment from Amazon again.For the professional photographer, we are better off buying from reputable photography stores than 3rd party sellers."
"This lens did not meet my expectation things look more fisheye, very far away. than wide. I purchased lens hood and b&w filter to ensure that my nature shots would be crystal , and also that my group shots would look great. Instead everything looks way smaller and distant . Don't know if I got a defective wide angle."
"Quality seems OK. But I bought it for night photography, and lack of focus marks renders it impossible to focus at night short of focusing it in broad daylight and then carefully taping the focus ring to be immobile."
"This lens is a joke...and I'm shock someone can write a good revue...after shooting test photos I was stand .... I was unable to find on entire frame  point in focus...and that is what it is at F16 and wide shoot manual focus at 25 ft  on Canon 7D, nothing was in focus. Who in strait mind can write ""very sharp"" ?shoot additional tests since results of the first one was beyond imagination.... and conclusion is  zero stars...this junk should not be sold.Question to a Canon  what happen ?"
"Solid lens, and undeniably a great value, but imperfect. Very noticeable darkness in the corners at 10mm. Going back to the 10-22mm."
its perfect wide lens for the width but is not sharp unless you turn on the flash or stay in very bright time.
You get what you pay for.Slow auto focus and less than great image
"I purchased this to replace my broken Canon 10-22 which I'm finding it hard to live without.  The 10-18 has VERY blurry corners and a very slow auto-focus.  In addition, I'm really missing the infinity setting that was on my 10-22.  The 10-18 is a total waste of cash.  Save up and purchase the 10-22 instead."
"It's okay, some vignetting and the outside is a little soft. I  can't really complain because it was $250. I love h the wide angle though."
"a little bit light for me also it has a plastic mount, I am a full time shooter,  otherwise color rendition is right on....C"
"Good lens, just wish it wasn't focus by wire."
beginner ultra wide for aps-c
"The lens auto focus failed just after one year.  If you buy this, be sure to get a multi-year  protection plan."
Picks up glare in sunlight.
I thought it will work with a Canon T3 but you definately need a full frame camera for it. I already sold it!
RETURNED IT ALREADY.  LOW PRICED AND QUALITY LENS FOR CASUAL USER.
F stop is too high
"Im not sure if it was just my copy, but my lens was not sharp at all with my 70D. Not impressed. As of right now I wish I had gotten a different lens. I may try to return to get another copy. I just dont want to deal with shipping."
"Lens and the picture it produces is what I was looking for. However, it came with a few, dry water like spots on the lens that I cannot remove, even with cleaner. They faintly show up in photographs. Will be contacting for an exchange."
I just opened this lens and there's a little blue dot on the lens. It's not something on the lens but I'm wondering if there's a fix or if I can send it back and get a replacement.
"Use the lens 3 months and then this failed, took four months waiting for a spare in my country (Chile ) and does not apply the guarantee of Canon or Amazon . I am extremely disappointed."
Defect on the lens
Only works with cropped sensor!!!!  It says it works with all Canons
Probably the worst lens I have ever owned from Canon.  Sharpness is terrible and even a trip to Canon's repair facility didn't fix it.
The lens came with a broken focusing ring and did not focus on auto or manual mode. Returned it with a full refund.
I got used lens!
Not impressed. Performs like a cheap lens. You get what you pay for I suppose.
The auto focus did not work. Lenses was defective.
Not clear and sharp images.
"I normally shoot Fuji but I was in a pinch and on a budget for a wider angle lens for real estate photography, so I bought a lens for my Canon backup body.Out of box thoughts: it feels cheap, like a kit lens. Housing is plastic. This does mean it is light weight if that is your preference however I tend to like a bit of weight.Shooting thoughts: if you're in a low light situations, you will have a ton of grain and auto-focusing issues. It'll look great while shooting and in back of camera but when you upload them you will most likely be disappointed. Another complication is barrel distortion. Not a hard fix if you can run lightroom and enable profile corrections but when you're editing hundreds of images, it'll slow down processing time.Overall, I wouldn't recommend to a friend. I should have splurged and went with Fuji glass."
"Pros:Cheap! (cost)Takes great shotsLight and compact:Cons:Cheap! plasticRelatively high apertureLimited zoom rangeIt's fine, great for the money but I've since replaced it with a Tokina 12-28 F4I don't miss the 2 mm on the wide end and the extra 10 mm makes a huge difference.In my opinion spend the extra, you won't be disappointed but if you simply can't, you'll be happy the Canon"
I didn’t receive a lens hood :(
"I tried very hard to like this lens. It was the exact focal length I was looking for and had other benefits too - auto focus, image stabilization and the right price. I knew up front that this would not be a low light lens but I could live with that. Unfortunately, mated to my SL1, I found pictures very soft. Only wide open, if an object was a short distance away - say 5-15ft, parts of the object would be sharp. All else would be soft. Aperture closed - nothing was sharp, all soft. Also pics were all darker than real life even in bright light. I was using evaluative metering which works fine on other lenses with the camera. I had to exposure comp most pics with this lens to correct. In the end I had to return it and it's possible that this was just a bad copy of the lens. I will try another brand now that costs more and with manual focus but a larger aperture. With that Canon 10-18, it was literally possible to match (or best) the image quality with my Nikon P340 point-and-shoot which has a similar wide angle. Not exactly what I had in mind when I bought the SLR."
"Like others, I am returning this lens within 1 day. I attempted to use it with a new T6i and sharpness is a bad joke. Even the kit 18-55 beats the pants off this horrible lens. I have a Sony a6000 with the Sony e 10-18mm and used under the same conditions there is just no comparison. Shame on Canon."
"I have been buying Canon for the past 16 years, but this Lens by far falls short of what they are known for. A complete disappointment. I add pictures from the len with a canon 7D and some with my iPhone 11 Pro. The iPhone 11 Pro pictures look better than the canon, and this was the best I got out of the Len. I hope this can help some of you."
"It looks great, but too much noise when using in low light or at high ISO situations."
"You cant use it without a good lighting source. Everything else is fantastic. The Stm motor, the auto focus, dual pixel focus, subject tracking, everything as you expect from a canon lens. But its too slow or dark at max aperture of 4.5. if you have adequate lighting, this is perfect for video as well as wide angle photography."
"Have just used the lens once, but images came out sharp. Lens can close focus and is incredibly compact and light. Small maximum aperture which means that the lens may not be suitable for use in dim lighting conditions, although the image stabilization helps. The maximum aperture and wide angle view means that the depth of field is huge. I knew all of this before purchasing the lens, so there are no surprises in these respects. Packaging and lack of a Canadian warranty card would indicate that the lens was produced for a different market and therefore will not be under warranty in Canada. Suspected this in advance due to the low price and the fact that the seller did not answer my question about the warranty."
"Any other lens I have, like the 2 other Canon lens, Sigma, they are all 58mm of diameter. So I bought 2 protective lens ( UV and polarized) for the wide lens here. Because, the diameter it is not wrote anywhere in the description and it is not showed in the images. So, I have to send back the protected lens I bought to buy new one. It is just lost of time and frustrating for that kind of missing important informations."
"I bought this lens for my t7i that I use for shooting video content and this is not a good lens for lower light conditions like indoors or low light outside.  Very grainy footage compared to even the basic kit lens.  It's GREAT for outdoor daylight shooting, but if you use it for video indoors, you'll need some very bright lights."
Not a great quality product  but will do the job for occasional photography requiring wide angle lens at a reasonable price.
"Shipping was fast however the lens has stopped working now. Its giving some kind of connection error. Canon service center is asking me for an invoice to get it fixed under warranty, which i dont have pleas help if you can"
"I'm sure it's a good lens, but I sent it back as I needed one for Astrophotography."
"Bought this lens as i was going to Hillstations for family vacation. But this lens kinda ruined my experience.Even though 10mm is charmingly wide, i was often unable to click photo, as the exposure meter keeps blinking. Wonder if its original lense or some chinese knock-off.Very bad experience."
Good lens. Works nicelyI am not able to register it with canon india. That's a big issue as the lens has two year warranty
"When I opened the box, my I was amazed to see the quality in the lense. I t was shattered from the start. It came so broken that I've completely lost faith in your company and will again buy Canon products. I request a full refund to solve my distress."
"Photo quality was poor, much worse then expected. Pentamax product performed much better, at half the price."
"There was no seal on the box, just the amazon plastic packaging."
This is a open box product if you buy as on Sep 15 2017. This does not come with genuine canon factory packaging.
Very poor quality
"I am not a photographer, I am not even a very good at taking pictures with my iphone.  My assessment is from a very novice nontechnical perspective.It did not look like a lens that I see in the stores, it looked more like a toy, it did fit on my rebel 5 canon very nicely without any problems.  The instructions were minimal but to put it on ""manual mode"" was helpful.There is no stabilization, so a tripod or flat top is important.  The focus tubes does tell you which way to turn for focusing, but it seem to stick a little when turning to focus, which knocks the tripod around a little, so you have to refocus again, not as easy as I needed.I had a very hard time focusing the lens, through the view finder it looked clear, but when I went to look  at my pictures none of them are in focus.  To frame a picture, I could get a small area focused but not the branches next to each other were not in focus. The colors did come out nicely in pictures.If you know how to use the camera with all the settings and the lens, you might have better results."
Very cheap made
"You get what you pay for.. okay. My writing is simply based on the fact that this required more manual use, than I was willing to give.Unless you're going to set this on a tripod, and you're gonna take a picture. It's not in motion, and it's at the same distance that you've already preset. The manual focus for I would not suggest this product."
"Been trying this out on a few different cameras. I was hoping i could use it for astrophotos or maybe super telephoto nature stuff. But it's just not that great.Optics aside, just trying to use the lens is very frustrating. I am used to all manual lenses as i am a photographer, but this is the worst ive used.Manual focusing is a nightmare, the focus ring is very stiff and moves the whole lens when i try to focus.You have to unlock a lock ring to be able to zoom in and out.Not great"
"This lens is not in the top contenders for image quality, but where it lacks in that department it makes up in affordability. The lens is easy to use if you are familiar with manual focusing. Though this lens does not have the best image quality, it is still usable for amateur photography and social media."
"This Canon EF-mount lens is a simple lens and as a result, the images are nice and clear.  The controls are clearly marked and feel smooth.  This 420-800mm lens is an inexpensive way to get into wildlife or astrophotograly."
"Considering I didn't have to spend $2000, I at least can experiment with long distance photography."
"I was very excited when this lens was announced. Small, lightweight, and great in low light. For the price I was expecting a very solid fixed focal length lens with great image quality that would blow away my Olympus 9-18mm lens, which many users have a love/hate relationship with. It was not meant to be. There is maybe a slight improvement over the 9-18mm in the corners, but in general the image quality did not meet my expectations. I took the lens on an extended hiking trip to South America and was so glad I did not use it more than I did.  The results were mediocre at best compared to other lenses in my kit. And, for astrophotography this lens failed miserably. There was significant chromatic aberration in the upper left quadrant of the lens.Maybe I wound up with a bad copy, but this lens has been returned and I will not be trying another."
"I purchased this lense because my 15mm F1.7 also from Pan/Leica has been the best lense in my kit, and I wanted to try other lenses in the ""leica"" family. This is not even remotely on that lens' level. Another reviewer mentioned that the build quality was sub par, but I was not expecting plastic light weight. For the money, I really dont know if this is worth keeping around when my 12-60mm also from Leica is just so nice by comparison. I was also hoping for both a focus ring and an aperture ring, but this only has a focus ring.PROs: You can absolutely shoot in low light with this, but I wouldn't try to shoot anything fast moving (Kids/pets). There is very very minimal distortion for such a wide angle, much better than another 9mm that I have which is a true fisheye. It's definitely light weight and perfect for travel / daytime street photography. For myself however, I just dont think this lens is worth the $450 now missing from my pocket.Will be returning."
"I agree with others, this IS a great lens, plenty sharp, quick auto focus, fast and reliable. But.. it is cheap plastic. I know that if I drop a TTArtisan 10mm, nothing is going to happen to it, this feels like it would split, and glass go everywhere. So is it worth the LEICA name, and 1 more mm over a TTA 10mm...no."
Panasonic/Leica makes some good quality lenses. I was a bit surprised at how this 5 bill lens was delivered. So if you care about getting an intake item note my experience as I have heard this was going on by other reviewers.
"The hype on this lens at introduction 2 years ago made me want to buy it. I don't know what I got but it wasn't anywhere near as good as the original reviews. Tremendous amounts of purple and green fringing ( chromatic aberration )  in transition areas between highlights and midtones. Sure, it's wide and has an amazingly close focus. But processing RAW images in Capture 1, I have to go over all areas and correct the colours. And it's everywhere, not limited to the far corners of the image. It really does make the images look old school digital. My conclusion is that there has been a change in glass and coatings from the original production of this lens to now.  I have an older 4/3 mount Olympus 9-18, with a 4/3 to m4/3 adapter, that in direct comparison ( up-shot photos of downtown Toronto buildings ) produces a better image. So, minus video, I'll be using that. Returning now."
"I loved this backpack when I got it. It’s super cute, has lots of storage space and is very sturdy. Unfortunately, only a month or so after getting it, the top strap that you use to hang the bag on ripped (while my camera was in it). The pockets have also started to rip so I won’t be able to use it much longer since I need the side pockets. Ive had it for 6 months. I LOVE the bag in every other way, but I’m unfortunately going to have to go another way for my next bag. So sad :("
I've been using this bag for a few months now and I've thoroughly enjoyed using it but my one issue is that the side pocket ripped the first time I put my tripod in. Over all very good product just be careful with the side pocket.Edit: the people over at caden have sent me a new bag without the problem with the side pocket but I would still be careful with it if you are considering buying this bag.
"Do not trust that note they give you with product! They have no customer support! They don't even tell you how to contact them on that note! And when you go to order details to find contact, the website and phone number is nonexistent.Now on to the bag themselves.I had bought the small one but it was too small for my needs. So I returned it and bought 3.0 Large. It was good. Just that I thought the side zipper was a zipper for another pocket. It actually leads to the interior of the bag! I don't understand why you'd need this zipper. Boasts anti theft properties and yet failed to consider someone might steal from this side zipper.I then saw the bags go on sale for Prime Day. 3.0 Large bag was $10 cheaper on Prime Day. 4.0 Large bag was also $10 cheaper on Prime Day. So I got the 4.0 Large bage because it's basically the same price as the other size I bought but looks like slight upgrade. Turns out I was wrong. This was no upgrade. It did not have the back pocket like the 3.0. The bag has a back zipper to expand the width of the bag, but I'd feel like camera equipment would bounce around in the bag since it's fabric bag and they only give you 2 velcro straps. Why is this even listed as more expensive than the 3.0 in the first place?I should have not been blinded by how many reviews this bag got and looked into a different camera bag company for my needs on Prime Day."
"The product is somewhat okay, but it could be a little better. The inside strips leaves a lot of dust/cloth particles."
The description made it seem bigger than it is. It wouldn't work for my needs.
"I like the price, but you definitely get what you pay for.  It’s hard to use on the go since you have to be careful unzipping it so your cameras don’t fall out. The Velcro inserts are pretty mid. Cheap material but the zipper quality seems pretty good. Not super versatile. Not the greatest protection.That being said, it’s not totally horrible. It’s able to separate my cameras decently and pretty safely. Definitely a beginner camera bag though."
"So I had ordered this specifically for the waterproof aspect because I’d like to take my canon rebel t3 on my kayak with me. As soon as I got it I arranged it as I wanted and it was super simple and fit everything perfectly snug. After I did that I took the bag and instantly threw water over it in the bath tub. The majority of the case is water proof (the shell and the straps.) However, the only part of the car that isn’t is the zippers. Every single zipper because soaked through from a single glass’ worth of water. Other wise very comfortable and well designed."
"This bag was great for a month or so, but then the seam ripped by the zipper. I took it as my sign to invest in a big girl camera bag.Great bag if you’re just getting started and don’t have much to carry. I might have tried maxing this poor guy out too far."
"I bought this camera bag specifically because it had roller wheels because I travel quite a bit - but the wheels  are big and clunky and made it difficult to store in an overhead bin on an airplane.  That being said, without the wheels, the bag is roomy and fits all the gear I need to take with me.  I can carry it as a backpack which is nice, except that I already travel with a backpack and was hoping this could act as my second carry-on."
"So the ""Stool"" is completely worthless.  My wife is 5' 1"" and 91lbs.  She is too big for it.  Its a nice backpack, but its not really worth $80.00."
"Purchased this bag because it said in the title of the item it was waterproof but when I received packaging clearly states the bag is not waterproof and not to use in heavy rain. It look like a great bag but if you are buying it because it’s waterproof, you may want to rethink your purchase."
"The bag was nice but I needed to upgrade To a bigger bag, to small"
"After 1.5 year , I saw the quality of the bag. I think the quality of the camera bag should be very high quality- you keep there cameras/lenses that costs a lot ot thousands of dollars- and this one is just waste of money. Don’r recommend!"
"I took this bag to San Francisco and hiked up Battery Spencer to get a good shot of the Golden Gate Bridge, but it was a very cold, windy, and rainy December 26th. There was some heavy drizzle, but not full on rain. I didn't think much of it, because I was on the go the entire day. It wasn't until I got home and started unpacking my gear that I realized the bag was considerably moist on the inside. My extra camera body, lenses, and batteries looked like they were heavily misted with a spray bottle. Thankfully, I was able to wipe off all the water without damage to my gear, but I was disappointed to find out that this bag is in no way waterproof or water-resistant. It couldn't even withstand drizzle, what more if it actually rained?It does get points for being a decent sized bag, which is able to carry 2 camera bodies, 4 lenses, a tripod, extra batteries, and small accessories. I wouldn't bring this out with me near water, though."
"This bag has it's pros and its big cons!One of the pros is that it's cheap, and it kinda works. I have had it for a couple weeks now and been already traveling with it almost everyday.But this bag has it's cons for sure!! First time packing the bag the zipper popped open by it self because I put in a laptop. The laptop expanded the bag too much. After that I learned my lesson I will not put in a laptop.My solution to this problem in case my zipper will pop open again is a belt that I have put around the bag. I have read multipe reviews where the bag just breaks and everything falls out, so the belt will save the equipment from falling out. The second thing is also as I just said, I don't put in a laptop in it.All in all I can't really say I'm disappointed of the bag just because of the cost of the bag. It works pretty well with my bmpcc 6k pro and my Sigma 18-35 1.8. At least so far."
"I purchased this traveler's bag for a biz trip. The bag looks but the detachable wheel stroller was constantly off-balance, failed over, causing the camera bag to crash. This made it extremely difficult to carry during the move. The product design needs improvement in balancing the load. The detachable stroller did not function as intended—to hold the bag securely and lead to broken lenses."
This backpack is well built.  Currently I have a Nikon P-1000 and a Sony A6000 inside.  In the area for a tripod I have a GoPro Hero 9 mounted on a battery/tripod mount.  It fits just to the right height so I can use the adjustable strap to cinch it down.  This company includes a hand written guarantee that is signed by all its employees.  It’s the best warranty I have ever seen guaranteeing you will be satisfied.  UPDATE:  Less than 1 year and the main compartment zipper broke on one side.  Good thing cameras did not fall out.  I have to use the one working zipper and go all the way around to close the camera compartment.  I open this bag probably once a week or less so it should not be considered over used.  Bummer I really had high hopes it was built good.
One of the seams is already starting to split after just a couple months. Their ad says they offer a one year warranty but I’ve been trying to submit a contact form through their website. But the submit button doesn’t work. I’ve tried various browsers as well. So effectively the 1 year warranty was just a ploy. Edit 7.11.23 - They saw my review and reached out to me via amazon and offered a full refund. I commend them on that part and upped it to 3 stars.
"So I read a few reviews from other buyers about how this bag had a bad smell. I still decided to buy it thinking ""well...mine won't stink like that. It was just a few isolated incidents"". Let me tell you.....I was WRONG!!! DEAD Wrong!!!! Have you ever put a bag of garbage in your trunk to take to the dumpster and accidentally leave it in there in the heat for a day or 2? Yeah...this bag smelled 2x as bad. All of the ""dead fish"" and ""chemical"" comments are 10000% correct! I literally had to spray a whole bottle of concentrated oil air freshener (blunt effects), AND leave it outside to ventilate just to get the smell out. And even then, there's still a slight hint of the rotten eggs/dead fish there.But, with that being said...smell aside, it's a well made bag, and seems to be pretty sturdy. Im going to see if the smell will leave with few more sprays and another day of airing out (because I hate returning stuff). But if it doesn't get better....Then back to the warehouse its going!Buy this bag at your own risk. If you get one without the bad smell, you're a lucky one!"
"The bag itself is sturdy enough, however the zipper has broken and it's been less than 1 year.In the listing, the company says""1-year quality issues replacement, any quality problem within 1 year, we will offer a new bag for you; satisfactory service.""But they do not honour it. My attempts at contacting the supplier has been in vain and I have not even received a message back. Disappointing."
"This certainly seems like a fairly decent camera bag for the price, but there are some things to be aware of.  I ordered the small because on the product page it said it can hold 2 cameras and 4 lenses.  Well those must be some small cameras and lenses!  I was barely able to fit my Sigma 150-600 (without carrying case), a Rebel T6s with attached battery grip, and a 24-70mm lens.  I was also able to fit in mid-sized binoculars.  I was also disappointed that there are no interior storage pockets, the only storage is the laptop sleeve and the zippered section on the front of the bag.  I would have ordered the large if the info on the product page was more accurate.  I'll make it work for now, time will tell how it holds up."
"Bag does the job and is big enough for my 70-200 zoom, camera, 50 mm, speed light and a few other smaller items. Well made…only complaint is it doesn’t have enough small zipper compartments for small stuff. Anything small like sd cards or batteries are hard to find in the single massive zipper compartment on front . There’s a Velcro compartment inside the bag but it doesn’t securely stay shut with the small Velcro holding it closed. I have to use my own little bags to throw in there. Major drawback for me."
"Ii couldn't believe how much stuff I was able to squeeze into this camera bag. Also the tripod holder is a game changer for me. Now I don't forget it!. This bag is clean usable and just sturdy as you need it to be. I went hiking in Wyoming with it and the straps felt fine, not digging in or loosening up like previous bags I've had. If I get another DLSR, I'm getting one of these at the same time. I haven't used it in the rain and snow yet. When I do I'll update my review.Update. Ok well I'm having issues. The hard material at the bottom of the bag is wearing out the corners and sticking out. So to be fair I use the bag quite a bit, but I haven't had it very long"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            First look, looks like a good, small camera backpack that can hold 1-2 cameras depending on how you position the Velcro inserts. I liked that it was compact but could still hold two of my cameras, several lens, cleaning tools, and a tripod in the side pocket.After pulling it out of the bag I noticed two flaws.1. There is a small fray on the fabric of the front of the backpack pictured in the shared images. This backpack has been under my desk since I got it-haven’t taken it anywhere and I’m already seeing signs of wear and tear, without actual wear and tear.2. There is a design flaw with the zipper tassel. The part of the zipper that holds the tassel isn’t tight enough, so one of the zippers constantly falls off. I have wood floors and every time I pick up this bag, the summer tassel falls off and hits the ground. I always put it back on there, but it never stays on. I’ve even tried tightening the loop where the zipper tassel goes into, but it does not tighten at all, even after gently using pliers.It hasn’t rained so I can’t speak to the waterproof capability and the review asked me about warmth...I’m not sure I would describe a backpack as giving warmth, but overall it serves its purpose with the exception of the frayed fabric and faulty zipper."
"Pros: The bag seems durable. It's a lightweight backpack, a nice change from the traditional square camera bags. The extra space is nice. There's one large zippered pouch in front, one large velcro closure pouch inside, and internal storage space with movable velcro pads that allow you to create varying lengths for lens storage.Cons: It had/has a horrible smell that is still going away, able to resist a generous dousing of Febreze.  It would have been nice to have the internal pouch have a zipper, or even one large pouch and a few smaller pouches, instead of one the large pouch as, on mine, a remote shutter control disappeared from inside the large pouch; so a few smaller pouches would make sense. I would have given this bag a 5 except for the pouch issue and that gross smell, but the smell alone warrants the docking of 2 points."
I tried to email the company with the provided email address about an issue. Week later and still no response.
"Zipper broke and would not close. It says 3 years warranty for the bag, but there is no contact information for warranty service."
"I bought this bag specifically for a trip to Norway to hold my new camera, lens, adapters and power cords in the main compartment and my tablet and Kindle in the rear compartment.  As you can see from the first picture of the bag open, it's not overstuffed.  Two or three days out the outer covering began tearing.  I certainly didn't expect that and I'm very disappointed.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Won't order from them again.Update to my review:  Caden contacted me regarding my experience with the backpack bag for my camera, asking for pictures, which I sent them.  They then offered to either replace the bag or give me a full refund.  They were very prompt and gracious, and I was very impressed with their customer service.  They've said they're going to revisit the issue and make some modification to the bag so that this doesn't happen.  Can't fault that!  I'm satisfied."
"Much too small for modern lens - they show (2) telephotos and a prime, but must be old lenses and no hoods..."
"The Camera Backpack Bag itself is good, love the expandable part.  But that being said, it does not work well with the detachable stand, it slips to the side and will not roll correctly, the shoulder straps kept getting under the wheels (even with tucking in to the strap, they work loose).  And the you have to detach the wheels to fit into the overhead compartment on planes (A320 plane and the smaller 737) its very annoying and time consuming when you hold up the plane exiting line."
"Worked well for a year, then the zipper started falling apart. This was my second purchase, but this one definitely didn't pass the 2 year guarantee."
For someone who is new to cameras or camera accessories the description for this bag is very misleading as I thought the tripod would be included with the book bag it sadly wasn’t of course but I feel as though the description needs to be clear that the tripod is not included. Other than that the bag seems decent but expensive as well.
"Nice quality and the Velcro is strong but don’t expect to set it up like the pictures because it won’t work. The dividers are bigger then the bag, therefor it makes it so you have a super skinny section or you’re over stretching the bag. That part was disappointing. Also I have a really hard time getting it to stay sitting up it always falls forwards."
"We ordered gray, but received black. Black will work but was hoping for the gray as another bag used is black and wanted to easily be able to differentiate from one another quickly. Can't wait to give it as a gift to person as a camera was received as a gift by them for Christmas. Price seems fitting for what you get compared to my online shopping."
"This bag seemed like a great buy for the price. It holds my full frame body + two lens, flash, and chargers just fine. The side pockets for the tripod were a little misleading but may end up working okay. It seems like the pockets are two small and my standard tripod will easily fall out without extra attachments being made to hold it in place.The biggest concern I have with this bag is the smell. It smells awful. My husband came home the day it arrived and asked why our house smelled so bad. So just a warning but for the price it does the job."
I originally purchased this to carry TCGs.  But when it arrived I realized it was a little small for my needs.  I went to swap it with my current Photography backpack but it was too small for my tripod and all my lenses.  If you need a small bag this one is great but you should seriously consider getting the larger version.
"UPDATE #2 (March 2022): The second replacement bag now has a fully broken zipper - same issue as our first bag. As stated previously, this bag gets used semi-regularly, maybe 1 -2x a week. With two bags with the same issue, I can't recommend this bag for use. I will have to purchase a different brand bag.UPDATE (Aug 2021): the seller has reached out and is sending us a new bag. I will update the review fully upon receiving it - happy with the customer service though!Initially we loved this bag - we are amateur photographers for a non profit. The bag doesn’t get much use - maybe 2x a week. We’ve had this bag for a month and the zipper has already broken. I liked all the different pocket options and set up but the zipper is broken which negates the use of the bag."
"This bag always tips over towards the front, even with a laptop in the bag. Very Annoying."
"I bought this bag thinking the space would be enough for the equipment I use and it was! As I was riding my motorcycle, I noticed something weird about the bag. I pulled over on the highway to check what was going on. Turns out the zipper was unzipping itself and my $4000 camera was hanging on by a thread. Not only that but my lens (worth $2000) almost fell out. If I had kept going, all my equipment would’ve fell out. I tried to zip the bag again but kept on getting loose. I had to hug this bag in front of me and kept having to zip the bag over and over. Its my fault for trusting a cheap bag could do enough but that almost cost me a lot of money. Also to clarify what the bag was doing, the zipper holder thing wasnt getting loose, it was the zipper thread itself getting loose. I would invest in another decent bag, it will save your equipment"
"I recommend this for amateur photographers. Lots of room to hold chargers, batteries, spare lenses, cables and even cleaning supplies."
"The backpack seems to be high quality and highly configurable; however, it is oddly deep, resulting in no way to keep lenses from rolling around from front to back."
It holds my camera gear which is nice bc that’s why I bought it. But when I’m about to carry it out the door I’m stopping and considering what else I need to bring with me I always need to grab ANOTHER bag to put THAT stuff in bc it won’t fit in the camera bag and then I have to carry TWO bags on my small body. It’s a small camera bag.
I purchased this bag 7 months ago and this letter of a 3 year guarantee was included.  I now need to make a claim and I am have not been able to find their contact informationCan anyone help? Or is this letter pointless
"Bag was wonderful when it arrived- small, compact and functional. Maybe a month after receiving it, the zipper would not stay closed. I didn’t mind as it still stayed closed sometimes but this past weekend, during a wedding, I opened the bag, switched lenses and closed my bag. As soon as I put it back on my shoulders, the bag zipper split open, causing my 85 lens fo fall out and hit the pavement. Luckily, the lens still functions but the rings in front of it fell off and are now damaged. I tried contacting the company via their form but the website does not let me submit it. If they see this. I would prefer a refund if at all possible, vs a replacement as I’m not sure I can trust the quality. I know you “get what you pay for”, I was willing to take the risk but the simple function of the zipper was not the quality I thought would have been compromised when choosing this affordable bag."
"Decent bag overall. Very usable space inside and well paded. However it did have a horrible smell to it for the first 3 weeks I owned it, no big deal. My complaint is with the durability. The stitching on my right shoulder strap is already ripped. I'm carrying a D850, D7500, 70-200 2.8 and a 24-70 2.8 in the bag....I dont ever want to have to worry about its durability, but unfortunately I do."
This is missing pockets inside for small items - I use for camera equipment and small items like card holders and batteries need a small zipper area inside the main compartment to keep them handy.  This does have a zipper pouch on the outside but it is still hard to grab quickly when you are super busy and need one of those small items.
"I bought the previous D6 generation, a day after I bought it I realized that they released an upgraded version ""CADeN D6 Generation 3"" this one has a cable that you can connect to a power bank and have and outside USB supply. It also came with a rain cover, which is nice, and has an anti-theft design. Seems it was a better option in every way, so I decided it was better to return the previous one, and buy the new. It didn't have reviews at the moment.The bad: The new version is more narrow than the previous one. The pads are also wider, so the combination results in less space. I can fit a mavic air 2 with 3 batteries, my Nikon and a total of 4 lenses. In the other hand, the new version cant even take the camera, I didn't even try the rest of the gear.I will keep the previous generation, and return the one, contrary to my original plan."
"This bag smells terrible when it arrives. It took almost 3 months for the smell to go away.The functionality works as expected, but the stench is too much. I’d rate this product higher if it wasn’t for the smell; you shouldn’t have to air a product out for a few months before using it."
"Nice concept of having moveable panels to create a unique compartmentalized gadget bag.  Unfortunately, the flexible panels have been difficult for me to arrange because the Velcro sticks to everything at the wrong time.  Plan on taking a fair amount of time to arrange your own unique layout."
"I recently purchased this bag for a trip to Maui and while it served its purpose, the durability is simply poor.  The mesh on the side where you put the tripod ripped very easily and now has big holes in it.  Based on the great reviews I ready before purchasing, I was very surprised with the lack of durability.  If you are going to have a tripod attached, be aware that the mesh is not durable and now I have a bag that is likely limited in use at best and will likely end up being thrown out."
Bag is high quality and seems to work well. Missing the long inner dividers unfortunately. Tried contacting via support page and email but their website is unresponsive and they haven’t replied to my email. Hopefully the issue is resolved*will update once they answer
It has a nice outside and pocket. The inside is soft. The inside needs improvement because they are all Velcro and not in the right places.
"The water resistant fabric will allow moisture to get in the backpack, so I would be very careful if out in the rain. I was out in the rain under an umbrella with the backpack for about 2 to 3 hours it was raining fairly constant for that time, rain drops and wind blowing the rain at times on the backpack, its not like it was sitting out in the pouring rain I was under the umbrella, when I got home and opened the bag there was a lot of wetness/moisture inside the backpack, I had napkins in the outer zippered compartment that got very damp I would not recommend this backpack if your looking for it to be waterproof."
"It came with two dividers, not what was advertised or shown in the pictures. I will try to get it rectified and follow up here later. If not, I'll send it back and follow up that the results were bulls#it. My guess is that this was already returned once. The bag it came in was a higher quality than the normal cellophane most packaging is made of, and there was a piece of very high quality shipping tape wrapped around the entire outside of the bag including over the ziplock type of zipper. It was very difficult to remove and ended up pulling the ziplock seal apart to do so. everything else seems to be in order, but unless you want your lenses and camera bodies being banged around in a padded sack, you'll want the dividers. Very disappointed at this moment, I'll see what can be done and report back. Until then, I suggest looking at a different bag."
Got a huge tear literally the first time I zipped up all my gear.
"This is a great bag. It holds everything I need. The only problem is it stunk when I first got it. 2 cans of febreze and letting sit outside for a day helped immensely. If you can get smell out the bag, its great buy. Otherwise steer clear."
"Got mine today , feels good just need to setup the inserts, wasn’t aware they were removable . On the smells part that I kept seeing popped up, slight small smell but that goes away"
"Sturdy bag, well insulated, only complaint is I have a small tripod and a large tripod and neither will fit into side pockets as pictured even after taking them apart"
This bag ripped open 4-5 inches near a seam next to a zipper after less than two weeks of very light use. I rarely wore the back pack and when i saw the tear it sickened me that i paid almost 30$ for something to poorly made.  Look elsewhere for a more heavy duty well made bag. The rip created an easy way to lose items in the inside ipad pocket. I was out of town and did not get to use this right away so Its past the return period; with any luck hopefully the seller will return or replace it. Better luck next time!
"Love the bag and the compartments are nice and soft; like how they are easily removed to adjust to lenses and your camera. After several uses, the zipper broke and I can only zip halfway. Otherwise, not too shabby."
"This bag is exactly what I was looking for, however it smells so bad! It’s got a very fishy smell to it. My camera strap now smells like fish... which is so embarrassing to have right on your neck while working with clients.Why does it smell so bad?"
"Bought this and one of the 2 zippers didn't work.  I alerted the seller (3 times) since there was a card instructing me to do so.  Never heard from them.  So, don't waste your time or money on shoddy workmanship"
"I purchased this about a month ago for an upcoming trip . This was to house a full frame EOS R camera with battery grip.Having packed everything inside , I noticed the front perimeter stitching coming loose.This is very disconcerting. There is no weather proof flap, and loose stitching is a recipe for a damp disaster .With the 30 day exchange just up, I am now stuck with this useless bag.Hopefully this review will be read by the supplier and they will make good on the product exchange . I’ll update this review accordingly."
It's very soft and flemsy. No real protection from any drops. Not great for the outdoors. It's like a cheaply made backpack. It looked like it had been stored for a bit and all sides were crushed in when I opened it. Maybe it was in a vacuum sealed bag before they sent it to me. I have an expensive camera and in no way will I ever use this for my camera. Good for my dogs items on the go. I don't recommend this for any camera!!
This is a great bag and even has a spot to slip an iPad or smaller laptop in! Unfortunately doesn’t have as many zippered pockets as I’d like. Smaller pockets would’ve made this perfect!!!
I did not like the lack of pockets and places to put mem cards and other small items it lacks those other than that it is pretty good
I bought this to hold my backup canon camera and lenses. I thought it would be sturdier. Not the same quality as a canon bag. But I will give it a try. It's light weight and versatile.
"The bag is roomy for a camera and 4 lenses. But after using it for 4 months, stitches in the middle of the shoulder strap started coming off. I sent a picture of the issue to the seller since the bag was still under warranty. But they offered to give me a 20% refund since the bag was used. I don't understand how I can have the bag unused for the warranty period. If they cannot honor their own warranty, they should not offer it, and also remove it from their product description. Totally disappointed. I am not giving them my money again."
the zipper brought within 5 months.  Contacted the shipper according to thier letter/note if a customer experience any issue they would refund or replace the product.  Sent two email and no one responsed.  This is a series issue especially when someone is carrying high value equipment.
Wayyyy smaller than expected. That’s on me for not looking more carefully at the measurements. But there NO WAY my Mac will fit in the sleeve.
"The bag I received was missing one of the zipper pulls, and had a 7"" slash on the outer pocket zipper cover. With that said, it packs my Canon M50, 5 lenses, including a large EF 28-135mm and a long EF 70-300mm, my DJI Mavic Air 2 and 3 drone batteries. I do wish they'd included one or two additional internal dividers, but it'll work for my needs. I wish it wasn't missing the zipper pull and didn't have the cut outer fabric, but these problems aren't a big enough deal to warrant returning it."
"EDIT: The seller was gracious enough to refund quickly and send a replacement unit. However, the second bag still smells very much like the first one. Great seller, but I wish the bags weren't smelling so bad!The bag looks old and smells like seafood. First, I thought it was just me, but apparently other reviewers have experienced the same thing. The bag smells as if the retailer must have kept the bag inventory in a fridge at a seafood restaurant. Have never experienced anything like this!"
I was very excited to receive this camera backpack because of it having spots for all my gear as well as laptop holder. I open it up and there is no usb charging ports as it describes in the listing. Also there is no straps to clasp down your camera stand. If I didn’t absolutely need this for this weekend I would return it right now.
"I loved the backpack at first, until it started coming unstitched. I used it twice, because of covid. Tried to contact the manufacturer, but they would not let me submit my problem. Sorry to say Amazon could not help either so I’m stuck"
I like it but  my tripod does not fit how it shows in the picture  but rather then that I like it I did 3 stars because for me it was important that my tripod fits
The belt is designed in an old way.Makes me feel tired after bearing it 2 hours.
The bag itself is a nice bag and serves its purpose.  There is no way you can fit a tripod in the side pocket.  A monopod fits but that is about it.
"It’s okay, nothing crazy. Small rip from nail within a week. Not crazy durable. Does the job."
For the price its not too bad! But It has kind of a cheap feeling to it. I can’t really trust it with my heavy camera and lenses.
"My backpack's straps have frayed badly after about six months of use. I leave the house with it once or twice a week, but the straps are about halfway worn through on the point of connection with the top of the backpack. I've never seen a backpack do this before, including some that I've had for actual decades, which suggests this particular one is poorly made and I regret purchasing it."
Overall a decent bag.  The stitching at the top is loose and over time it's going to become defective.  The company included a paper stating they would make any issues right.  Stating to Email company and within  24 hours I would have a response from a team member.Its been almost 3 weeks and still havent heard a peep.
"For the price, not bad."
Love the color of this backpack; however it only has one pocket that does not fit a lot of camera accessories.
So I got this bag right before a trip so I wouldn’t have to have a single strap bag pulling on my shoulder. After a day or two the bag was starting to fall apart. Zipper would no longer stay shut and the bag would swing open. (Using a DSLR Canon Rebel 7ti and 3 lenses). If it wasn’t for me strapping down my gear tightly inside the bag I would have had my gear falling out constantly. Maybe it’ll be fine with light weight gear but does not hold as much as the pictures show. Look somewhere else
"I liked this bag before the zippers started fraying and ripping off within a year. The product description says they have a 1 year warranty, but they never replied to my emails. Doesn't seem like ""Perfect Service"" to me."
Tripod doesn’t fit in side pocket not even close.
"The zipper separated after the second use.  The interior size is great, but the zipper was cheap!!"
"Unfortunately, after only using the one zipper a handful of times it no longer zips. Fortunately there are two on the same line so I’m able to use it still. Would have returned it for a replacement but as I was in the midst of moving, it wasn’t possible."
Backpack is pretty good but the trolley is fairly wobbly.
"I'm not sure why some buyers get ones that have a terrible smell and some don't. I opened the box and it smelled like there were dead fish for days in it. I put it in the washer and it smelled up my whole laundry room! It finished the cycle and I immediately had to put it in the garage to dry and get it out of my house, I can't even stomach it to put it in a box to return it. How could someone send this to a customer? It's not a smell that can get past you. Its like death warmed over. You're taken a 50/50 chance buying this product."
"Two of the dividers are missing. Also, the zips have gone bad! Wish I could return it."
"If you have a normal sized tripod, don't bother. This won't fit it. Also, there aren't nearly enough of the velcro pieces to make a decent number of pockets. So if you have a travel tripod, and only a few pieces of camera equipment, you're fine. The pack is good. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
"I used this bag for the first time last weekend.  Put some of my favorite camera 📸 equipment in the bag, grabbed the handle and threw it over my shoulder only to hear the heart stopping sound of my equipment falling onto the floor.  My first thought was I forgot to zip it closed but upon further investigation, I did close it properly, it was the zipper that failed and split open dropping my $3,000 camera onto the hard floor.  So unless you don't care about your camera, look for something other than this one."
"Love the durability and my equipment feels secure.  No enough secure and separate storage for extras. Batteries, and cards, misc things.Also, only one secure pocket- and the zipper was tough from day 1... now, with minimal use it’s no longer working. Trying to get in touch with shipper for warranty or help.  Form not going through. Will try again"
I was reading reviews before I got it and many people said it smelt like fish but i wanted to see if it was true for myself and it did. It smelt a lot like fish. Either way I but fabreeze and it took off but then I used it once and the zipper ripped and didn’t want to close or open. So weird.
I ordered this bad because I love the number of compartments and ability to customize the inside.As soon as I opened the package I immediately boxed it back up for a return. It had the worse smell! It was like chemicals mixed with fish. The tag is all in Chinese or something so I wasnt sure if it was machine washable to attempt to remove the smell. So I tried to get a replacement.The replacement came right away but unfortunately it had the same smell to it. Now I have to wait up to 7 days after they receive my return to get my money back.
It is difficult to put the sections in place
Loved the bag but it came stink as if a skunk died and fossilized its self only to be reincarnated as the smell of death.
"Don't know what kind of tripod they show in the pic, but I can only get one foot of mine into the little pocket.  And, there's no snap buckle on the strap; it's threaded through a buckle that only loosens so far.  The case itself is fairly good, but only hard on the front and back, not the sides.  Somewhat disappointed."
"I recently purchased the MOSISO Camera Backpack. While I liked it, I can't say I loved it. The design and layout of the compartments are quite practical and fit my gear well. However, the overall build quality leaves something to be desired. The material doesn't feel very durable, and after just a few uses, the zipper is already starting to malfunction. For a bag meant to protect expensive equipment, it doesn't instill a lot of confidence in its longevity. It's a decent bag for light use, but if you need something more robust and reliable, you might want to consider other options."
"It has a good size and protection, but the internal dividers just have velcro on the tips and internal sides of the backpack, making all to be loose."
"So far I used this backpack to carry my photo gear on a two week tour of Scotland. We encountered a wide variety of weather, and I took over a 1,000 pictures. Inside the pack I carried a full-frame SLR, extra lens, flash, many small photo accessories, a raincoat, and miscellaneous small items. The pack works well as a day pack for street scene photography, visiting museums, and outdoors events. Light rain was not a problem. The pocket for a water bottle is appreciated. The security pocket and solid rear cover seem very secure from theft, and physical bumping around. I carried the pack on planes, and stowed it in the overhead bin. The photo compartment zipper accommodates TIAA locks, but I don't think this pack could endure the way checked luggage is handled.The pack did a good job of the basics, but I will probably replace it. Two things fell short:1) The backpack was described on Amazon as able to accommodate a 15"" laptop. When I insert my 15"" laptop (HP Envy 360) then the zipper won't close.  The laptop pocket tapers and the corners of my laptop stick out. See side view pictures. Also the sleeve is too tight horizontally(top view picture).2) The backpack's insides handle a big SLR camera but the backpack cannot handle a large tripod that goes with a large camera.  I can only get one leg of my tripod in the little foot holder, and the strap with buckle is cumbersome to use."
"I'm professional social photographer, I use it for photo sessions and weddings, so I have to access fast to  camera, lenses and accessoriesCons---Colors please! I can understand some difference of the reality with pictures, but the bag is very different. Hardshell is different to the rest of the bag, but the worst part is it do not combine.-I expected another softer interior quality-Separators are so tiny, hard and not sufficiently padded, difficult to accommodate. I'm comparing quality and handle with my other three different SLR Camera Bags.-No cover rain-I could value symmetrical bottle pockets in both sidesPros++ In the other hand, I'm happy with backpack closures and pockets, there are extra pockets than other Camera Bags+ The structure of the backpack allows it to stand on its own in vertical, I don't care if there is something to support the bag in vertical position."
"It looks nice, sad that the zipper didn't last more than a year, and it was barely used, looks like new literally."
"I recently acquired a camera backpack, and I have to say, it's been nothing short of a photographer's worst nightmare. 📷😡First and foremost, this backpack's design is a catastrophe. It's like it was created by someone who has never seen a camera in their life. There's no organization, no compartments, and no protection for your expensive gear. It's like tossing your camera equipment into a chaotic black hole. 🕳️💸The quality of the materials is abysmal. It's like they used the flimsiest, cheapest fabric they could find. I wouldn't trust this backpack to protect my gear from a light drizzle, let alone serious weather conditions. It's like offering your camera a one-way ticket to the repair shop. ☔🛠️Comfort? Forget about it. This backpack's shoulder straps are about as comfortable as wearing a cactus suit. They dig into your shoulders and make you feel like you're carrying a load of bricks, not a camera. It's like getting a daily dose of pain with your photography adventure. 🌵😣The zippers are just waiting to fail. They're like a ticking time bomb of frustration. It's only a matter of time before they get stuck, jammed, or worse, come completely off. It's like playing Russian roulette with your camera's safety. 🔫🔒In conclusion, this camera backpack is more of a threat to your gear and your photography passion than a reliable companion. If you value your equipment and want a comfortable, organized, and protective solution for carrying your camera, I'd strongly advise looking elsewhere. This backpack is a regrettable investment that's bound to leave you with shattered gear and shattered dreams. 📷🙅‍♂️🚫"
I like this bag a lot for the price and some of the features. It has a bit of an odd layout with how the Velcro lines up and how you can arrange the inside of the bag but overall the storage and pockets are really good quality and the weight even fully filled it still light. The only improvement I would want in the future is the customizable pockets to have a bit more choice.
"I was caught off guard by how cherry red the color was, and it’s only hard shell on the front. The sides are soft. The inner foam pieces move around a LOT, and aren’t as secure as I was hoping they would be. Overall I don’t feel like it’s protective really at all if it were to drop with my camera inside."
Bag looks impressive online and when you first get it out of the box but attempting to use it things begin to fall apart.Front hard material seems nice but it scratches extremely easily. I doubt it would hold up over time. It also does effectively nothing in terms of protection.Build quality overall is mediocre.Interior dividers are far too flimsy and there simply isn't enough velcro to configure it the way you would like nor to provide secure enough attachment. Loading it up and walking around with it for a few hours had all my gear in a pile at the bottom because the velcro is too weak.Came from an Amazon Basics bag that is nearly 10 years old. That bag is still perfect and was significantly more sturdy at half the price.
"I had great hopes for this bag, but instead discovered two major flaws.  (1) Someone put a leaky water bottle into the aircraft's overhead storage bin. My new camera bag soaked up this water like a sponge and transferred that water to my gear. (2) The interior Velcro compartment divider tabs are, in my opinion, much too flimsy to adequately protect the gear."
The pictures of the dusty rose color was much darker than what I received. This is basically pink. The hard shell statement is a joke. It’s rubber. Ain’t nothing hard about it. Pictures show a potential drop of the case and claim its shock proof. I wouldn’t want to drop it with my camera and accessories inside. It’s a bit smaller than anticipated. There should be more dividers inside.  Is this thing worth $70? Absolutely not. I feel ripped off.
"I had really high expectations for this item. I thought it would be really great based on reviews but it came with a scratch on the front of it. It also shows fingerprints super easily which I don’t like, and it’s a bit cumbersome. Yes it has all the pockets but they’re very hard to reach. I also don’t like the way it zips considering the flap just falls down and your camera could potentially just fall out if you don’t take it out while your bags on the ground. The Velcro compartments on the inside didn’t stick as good as I thought and the felt sticks to my camera strap making it frayed. Some of the things I liked were the laptop sleeve and the water bottle holder but I wouldn’t buy it again."
I had a Tamrac bag which was ok but I needed a larger one and this guy fits the bill. It's pretty solid but maybe not quite as solid as my Tamrac and not as well thought out.It's not designed for a mirrorless camera but obviously a DSLR that is bigger and bulkier.  The Velcro strips sewn into the inside of bag need to come all the way around so you can arrange the internal padding properly.
It was a good bag until the zipper broke after about a year.
I really love the way the backpack looked. Once I opened it up and saw the dividers I was disappointed. My Canon R5C will not fit in this bag at all. Not without rendering the dividers completely useless and sliding all around the backpack. Maybe for a micro four-thirds camera in a drone this backpack would be useful. For me not so much. I still think the dividers are too cheap feeling. The outside of the backpack is made very well.
The zippers and stitching are super low quality on this bag. If you don’t have them completely zipped to the edge and open the bag just a tiny bit they will get damaged. I have three lenses in this bag and am already starting to see bulging and stitching being stressed. Probably worth it to spend the extra $30-50 and get a higher quality bag. I don’t see this bag lasting longer than a year or two with any sort of regular use.
"I've had this ""drone/camera"" backpack for 6 months now, and I would recommend getting a higher end bag for your expensive stuff.  Here's why:* it's ""ok"" as a camera bag, but just ""ok"". The sides are an ""ok"" thickness, but the lid? No. It's molded, but has only two zipper pockets in the lid with NO PADDING.  So it's prone to being crushed from the top.  Now, if you're super careful with your stuff...then the bag is ""OK""* THe side of the bag does not hold it's shape when loaded up, putting stress on the zipper.* speaking of ""zipper""... this one is already hanging up.Seriously, if you're going to be a couple grand worth of Cameras/drones in a bag... get a higher quality bag.  For toting around basic camera gear, and a small drone. It will do."
Inside spacing is great.  Flexible options.  Overall size is perfect to carry everything you would need.The exterior material is horrible. I would not order again.  I have had it just a couple weeks. It rubbed against an interior door which is smooth and painted and it ripped a spot off the surface.  It's so delicate this isn't a great option for in and out of a vehicle. Traveling etc.  for sedentary storage great. But exterior is least durable I have experienced and unfortunately I spent 60 bucks on it.  My canvas one I have had for years is what I am reverting back to. It is far more durable. This thing is sadly already being relegated to closet storage of various components I don't often use.  Not pleased with the quality of this product.
Great photo backpack for the money.  But bein a pro I couldn’t fit Z9 D5 even D850 was very tight.  Z7  with no batter grip would be find but I use that more of a carry around camera. The depth was about 2 inches to shallow for my use and I know I am in the minority.That being said I WOULD BUY THIS BACKPACK IF I WAS USING IT FOR RECREATION PURPOSES
"Backpack overall is okay. I would rate 2.5, i wouldn’t suggest doing traveling or any rugged activities with it given it gets damaged and scratched quite easily. Personally, I just didn’t love it. I think it could use more internal padding, especially if you use more high end camera equipment like we do."
Love the idea and design but quality is crap. Velcro for interior panels have a very weak grip and the plastic zipper for the main compartment as very cheap and started sticking right away and the broke after 2 months.
"Just fair, the spacer come out very quickly."
"I took this on one car trip, and somehow the front of the bag got scratched from something in the car and the blue color came off. The interior of the bag was great, there's a lot of storage, but for real-life use it's not  practical unless you're very careful. I'll try to cover the scratch and keep using it, and be very careful where I put the backpack in the future."
"There a couple of things wrong with this bag.  Yes it is a very simple camera storage bag and I wasn't expecting something that was out of this world.  For what the bag was intended to do, it falls short.  First is the zippers.  On the corners after light use the teeth are starting to fall apart in the corners(see attached photo).  This bag is only used to store my gear when not in use.  Second, the deviders are only Velcro'd on the sides.  Meaning if you don't have the space filled with something, when you set the bag upright everything shifts to the bottom.  It's petty, but something I didn't think about when buying the bag.  For what it is, I guess it don't the job.  The one zipper is now stuck in the corner and won't work.  The bag is not useless and only stores gear I'm not using.  Buy at your own risk."
"While it seems nice and sturdy, it should be noted that the backpack is narrower than most. It is not wide enough to hold two cameras side by side; a 70-200 takes up the entire width with no room for more. If you prefer to carry two cameras with lenses attached rather than all items loose, this is not a great choice. In addition, for some reason they did not put the velcro around all four sides of the interior. The top has none and so you cannot place a divider down the middle lengthwise. Not sure why they didn't have it all the way around."
"I bought this case may 9, 2022. The Zippers no longer work for about a week now. while looking for a new less expensive case I saw this bag has a one year warranty. I'm not sure how to contact the seller. I pray they honor the return policy. If so...definately a 5 star bag! Holds everything you may need. Love the little zipper area to hold a card reader or SD cards... No use if zippers don't work though"
"The bag has issues and is poorly made. In less than a year, some areas, such as broken zips, split open around the zipper areas. I genuinely regret buying this product."
I was expecting the sides of the bag to be more Sturdy. If you keep large lenses the side of the bag opens up. You need to push it together to zip it. Also the compartments I expected to be more sturdy. Overall don’t expect too much - you’ll be happy.
Both of the zippers broke. One of the zippers broke and split while my camera was in it. My camera fell out and my lens shattered. DO NOT BUY.
"Bought this back pack for a trip. Used it once and the zipper seem came apart so worthless to use for anything now. And when i tried to get refund, its non-refundable. Sucks! Dont' buy this one."
This doesn’t comfortably fit the Sony 200-600mm. Look for better and bigger backpacks. Lowerpro i found a couple. But this is not It. Will be returning :)
They layout and size of the bag is perfect for day hikes with my camera gear BUT I have had two of these bags now and both of them had the chest strap rip off the moment I tried to tighten it.  Amazon replaced the first one and now I am reaching out to them to replace the second.  If you carry a light load and don't need the chest strap it is a great bag but if like me you have a bag full of camera gear I would look elsewhere.
Zipper didnt last 3 weeks before it started hanging up.
"I love the design and I love the space.I’m super disappointed about its water resistance. It was raining here in NYC and i was walking to work with my gear in the bag. When I got to work and opened it, the inside was completely wet. I think the issue may be the zippers but also the back panel that is against my back was also soaked, not just the sides. Thank god my camera is weather sealed but my speedlite did not survive. Imagine if I had my 3,000 laptop in this bag, that would have been bad!I was going to buy the bag in another color but now i wont be. Such a shame because i do love the product. I hope to find a bag that is more water resistant and follows the same shell design. Also the bag is not hard shell it is a soft shell that feels like foam.Be aware of this when buying! You honestly should look for a waterproof bag. You are carrying electrical components."
"I have been through so many camera bags. I like the hardshell on this but I don't know what those lenses are in the picture but it's a lie. I got one camera, a 200, a 24-70, and an 85 and it's so fully jammed in there it's hard to close. Why does every seller lie about the size of their bags? It shows two long lenses, !two cameras, three! short lenses and a flash! Sell me that bag why don't ya??"
"So close to being great, but for the price vs the competition it’s better than what I expected. Just wish the interior panels were thicker or there were more Velcro strips on the top of the inside not just the sides"
"Nice medium size camera bag. Held camera body, 3 lenses, and the flash easily…however zipper ripped out on second use."
I have a dell laptop 15 inches and it didn't fit inside the bag because of the round shape on the top of the bag. I had to purchase another bag that my laptop could actually fit on it. the shell is not as sturdy as it was advertised. it is a cool bag but not for hiking or beach outdoor.if my laptop could fit into it I would took it to use as a causal bag for my camera but it didn't.
"Love this bag, it's super cute!  I'm worried the material that buckles to the zipper near the tripod holder won't last very long.  It's already pulling and when I zip up the bag you can tell the mini-tripod is too heavy for the material.  I might have to return this bag."
"I just received this new camera bag yesterday, used it while photographing a rehearsal dinner last night and it already has a scratch.  It’s a great looking bag but that’s it.  It’s not going to hold up with wear and tear and for this much, it should.  Also, it’s not a hard shell…it has a hard underlay but the coating is soft."
"I love this backpack but hate the inserts. They are too floppy to stay in place leaving my gear scattered everywhere inside. I’ve just taken the inserts out completely and now just use it as a small carry on suitcase. The semi hard shell is great, the quality of the bag is great and the color is really cool."
When I first got this bag I was super excited because I wanted to make sure my drone was safe. Not the case. The compartments move around all the time in things fall in between the liners so you lose any kind of things that you might have in there. The zippers are very hard to maneuver. There is a lot of things this backpack needs. Unfortunately it only worked for me for about a month. Maybe it’s better for cameras but it was advertised also to hold Drones which is not the case.
Flimsy. The hard shell meant to protect a laptop is inadequate. I regret purchasing this product.
"The items move all over the place when traveling with the backpack on my shoulders. It has lots of space, but it is not really usable since things don't need to stay in space. There are other better options out there that allow quicker access while also having things stay in space."
This is ok for the price...but do not expect any real heavy duty use as it is ergonomically bad for long hikes and lacks a waist strap/belt.  Otherwise pretty ok for casual use.
"Three months into using this camera bag, I can confidently say that I regret the purchase. The design is great in theory, awful in practice. No quick-to-access pockets, pouches, or loops. I have to take the bag off even to access the side pouch, which is intensely annoying when wearing and using camera gear. The main zipper is already starting to fail because it’s poor quality. Do not recommend."
It looks nice but it's construction is a bit cheap. The inner dividers are not so great. I returned it because it seemed too poorly made for the long haul.
The bag itself looks awesome and it is very sturdy. It could have used some more pockets outside for quick access. The main problem is the foam dividers inside are very very flimsy and does not hold shape at all. They are always sagging and it gets very annoying when all your gear are everywhere when you open the bag.
Everything is great but the bottle holder is trash and my hydro flask and nalgene keep falling out
This bag would be much better if they didn't cheap-out on the interior velcro. Instead of a full wall of velcro this has strips so the dividers don't stay in place very well. This is a good bag for lighter stuff but heavier lenses and cameras move around too much in my opinion.
"I've had this bag for just over 6 months now. And up until recently, I LOVED it. It fits everything I need it to fit, is easy to carry, has handy pockets inside and out, looks good and the price was right. Then the zipper failed. The first time, I was lucky -- it happened while I was at the beach, so when I put it on my back and a lens fell out, it hit soft sand. After that, I was always extra careful to make sure it was zipped properly. Then it happened again, even after I had checked the zipper. It still came open. And this time I wasn't as lucky. So what I thought was a great bargain has now cost me $1,000 to replace a broken lens. Lesson learned. You get what you pay for."
"I've been using this bag mostly for outdoor activities. The camera with the lens becomes quite heavy for the bag so the camera keeps dropping inside the bag. We are talking sony a73 + tamron 24-75mm (not a huge lens). The accessibility is very poor as well. If you want to take the camera out, you need to open the entire bag to do it in a clean way. If not, you're just pulling things out of a rabbit hole."
I bought this one because I outgrew another one that I had bought in this one was more sturdy look to be a great buy supposed to be water resistant however everything that could go wrong went wrong with this bag I was doing a photo shoot it happen to start raining I put my stuff in the bag had an umbrella so nothing was to get wet as I was getting in the car I closed my umbrella my bag got wet and when looking in the bag I realize that some of my equipment was wet this is not water resistant. After using for about two months the backpack arm ripped and this was something that I had to deal with while doing a wedding it was not a great experience
"This backpack actually sucks. I’ve had a lot of camera bags in my time and I’ve never complained about them as often as this one.CONSToo small. Not enough pockets for chargers, cords, nd filters etcThe sectional material and velcro in the bag is so flimsy and weak that every time I open my bag the equipment looks like it has been thrown aroundThe color on the front hard case material began to scratch off literally a day or two after putting it to use. (And it wasn’t much use) I just kept it in my wagon while shooting.PROI don’t like this bag at all but the only things I can give it probs for is the the water resistance is legit. There’s been multiple raining days and my equipment never got even slightly wet on the inside."
"The seller claims this backpack is ""waterproof."" It's not.I bought this for a rainy jungle trip I was going on, and I wanted to test it's effectiveness beforehand to ensure the safety of my camera equipment. I threw it in the shower and as soon as the water starting coming down I knew it was going to get inside the backpack (see pictures). I would have been better off storing my camera in the cardboard box the backpack was shipped in.If you want waterproof, keep looking. This ain't it."
Great price and look. Used the inside pocket once and zipper failed.
"I really loved this bag and would have kept if, if it wasn’t for the overwhelming smell of detergent from it. Even the box it was in, and the bag it was wrapped in wreaked of it. It seemed to be coming from the material lining used inside the bag. It was either actual detergent smell or just that that material resembles detergent, but it was bad. I have a feeling it’s just that type of material that smells strong, because I remember lining from various camera bags having a similar smell 20 years ago. I loved the hard shell feel to it though, so I wish it could have worked out. Everything was awesome about it, except for the smell."
Purchased 6 months ago and the straps now smell horrible. I hardly sweat while wearing it but they’ve begun to stink badly like body odor. The inside dividers are also very flimsy. Can’t recommend
"This bag has some really nice features like well thought out space allocation, and additional pockets included in clever places.  Unfortunately the straps are very poorly constructed and the chest strap broke off the side the first time I attempted to tighten it.  It was just clinging to the seam with this plactic hinge.  The side strap is very flimsy and can't accommodate my professional carbon fiber tripod very well either.  Felt very unbalanced.  Returned it immediately."
"Literally just took it out of the box, unzipped and zipped it up again and the zipper is popping open. Nothing is in the bag stretching it out. This backpack is extremely too expensive to be having an issue like this."
"This product, like all Mosiso products, is great! Worst thing is I’m returning it because the “Deep Teal” pictured in the photos is not as “deep” in real life.... COLOR IS DIFFERENT THAN PICTURED."
This product not even worth $5.Uncomfortable to open and close not waterproof and two bulky while carrying around
"The backpack is durable, but the zippers are cheap. There are two zippers on the main compartment of the backpack where you put your camera and or lens. One broke off within a month the other broke off a month later so it's very difficult to unzip and zip back up the most used compartment of the backpack without the zipper pulls."
For short people only.
I bought this pack to carry my photography gear around an Alaska cruise with port excursions. The most important characteristics were durability and water resistance. The pack failed miserably at keeping my gear dry. It only took a light rain to soak it.
I Like The Bag Buf the Zipper Started Shredding. 😢
"I think this would be a good backpack for smaller, less expensive gear.  It's small interior would not accept my camera body and three primary lenses.  Even though the designers thought to semi-tuck the zipper pulls  in the top portion of the case, I don't want to risk $14,000 of equipment to potential damage.  Returned for refund."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I received my Mosiso backpack and was excited to use it but upon unboxing there is NO PADDING INSIDE. It was crucial that I get this bag in time for a shoot coming up soon and there is no padding to section off my different pieces of equipment. I paid too much to not get what I paid for… Disappointed.
"I use this to carry thousands of dollars worth of camera equipment. I went to pick up the backpack today and as I was putting it on, the zipper failed causing my camera and a two of my lenses to drop onto the floor. Not sure if this is a common issue or a defect, but I wouldn't trust this company to keep my equipment safe again."
"This could be good for an individual with one camera and two lens. When I opened the box and saw the bag it was obvious this wasn’t going to work. None of my lens fit, there is no way a drone could get in it and after realizing just how small it was, I went back to the photos on Amazon and looking closer this time, the products displayed in the bag were photoshopped in. I will return this one.*It does appear to be a decently constructed product, just not for a photographer."
This is not a true hard case or sturdy case. Could have done better with the sides.
Didn't get a chance to use it as it was too small for my needs.
"I wanted to really like this camera bag. However, just taking it out of the delivery box, there were several defects not only to the “hard shell” but to the fabric itself. Even though it’s a good looking backpack, it’s doesn’t have a true hard shell the quality is lacking."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Product is damaged and had a human hair inside the backpack…… yup.
I've barely used this bag and the zipper isn't working anymore.
Being a professional photographer for many years I’ve had some very long lasting backpacks. I’m disappointed in the quality of this backpack and it only lasted a few months. Definitely not purchasing one of these again.
The backpack straps for this bag are too small. I wear XL shirts and this bag is way too small to wear comfortably. It does not fit like a normal back pack.  Additionally this store has only a 1 month return policy. By the time I had a chance to actually wear this bag and use it I found it to be useless and not able to be returned. Look elsewhere. Poor product.
"Looks fine, but zipper broke immediately.  Small velcro pieces may be attached anywhere, but everything slides under them so all camera equipment migrates all over the place. I would not recommend.  Might as well throw everything in a bag for all the protection this gives."
"After three uses, two of zippers started tearing apart in the corners."
"They put a sticker right on the front of this, not a sticker that’s easily removed either. Extremely annoying. It seems like it’s damaging the material trying to peel it off. There are also scratches all along the “hard cover” which is not hard at all. It’s a flimsy foam top. Extremely disappointed with this purchase. Will be returning."
this is not waterproof bag unfortunally!
"only buy, if you fill the bag conpletely with camera gear. When you carry the bag and walk, the camera and lenses moves all around and the velcro seperators are not stable and firm to hold the lens/camera properly in position."
Doesnt hold alot and its heavy.
It was not waterproof at all.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Cheap quality , really thin pad protector,"
"Unfortunately,that’s not what you expect when you order a new backpack. It was definitely used,damaged  and returned before .I like a bag itself ,but definitely I’m upset about the condition."
"Not for me, I wish I could still return it.Super bulky & couldn’t fit under an airplane seat as a carry-on.…. Disappointed."
Did a ton of research for this purchase. I liked the bag until the zipper broke after 5 weeks. I would appreciate a replacement.
The top layer of the bag got damaged. Very bad quality.
We all have pet peeves. Mine is trying removing these stickers and them not coming off.
"Overall it's a good little pack for the price. I used it on a recent trip to Alaska and it held up well and I had plenty of room for my camera, 3 lenses and a drone & controller. However, it's NOT waterproof as stated. I did a short one hour nature trail in steady, but not heavy rain, and was in and out of different shops throughout the day. After returning to our cruise ship I noticed it was wet inside down the entire pack. Luckily nothing was soaked, just some minor moisture on some lenses and my drone. It's my fault for using something that claims to be waterproof without testing it, but don't make the mistake I did. I'd highly suggest using a rain cover with this pack for any sensitive electronics. Other than that it's great but I definitely won't be using it in the rain without a cover, and will probably even treat it with silicone spray as well. I only gave it 3 stars because of the waterproof claim which is a big deal if you're using it for camera gear."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this camera bag to haul my gear back and fourth to weddings and sessions. I loved it! Up until 3 weeks into owning it the zipper started getting stuck. Now I can barely even open the bag without ripping the side fabric more and more. Disappointed that it has fallen apart so quickly. See pics attached for reference.I do not stuff this bag full so I know it’s a manufacturing error.
"This could have been an exceptional bag with some minor cheap additions to the design and it’s frustrating that the designer didn’t implement on this bag because I bought a second smaller sling bag from them and it doesn’t have these issues!1- The soft Velcro strips are only on the sides and bottoms of the bag and not on the top or corners. The smaller bag I got from this company has 100% of the inside made of a soft but durable material that grips Velcro so you can stick anywhere you want and get full use of your Velcro strip. The two strips on this bag mean limited surface contact for the Velcro and the dividers aren’t as secure as they could be.2- The smaller cheaper bag I got from this company had Velcro flaps along the back of the dividers as well so compartments are super sturdy. This bag doesn’t have any way to Velcro to the back so you’re really limited in configurations and weight bearing capabilities for the dividers3- The long dividers have a VERY rigid middle that is impossible to bend even if you apply strong pressure. So if you have a fat lens or want to curve around something, forget about it. The dimension on these long dividers isn’t flexible to attach them horizontally. Not well at least. If you’re like me and have wide lenses and can’t fit them in the general compartments that this bag was made to have, it’s really frustrating to try to fit your gear. All they had to do was add some flex to these dividers or and an extra couple bends to the middle piece and it would be so much more versatile! These long dividers are also the only ones to have the fuzzy Velcro on them so this really limits how you can arrange these or use the stretchy strips that come with the bag.4- Not really a flaw but just worth noting:  The hard shell isn’t exactly a hard shell. It’s a hard flexible foam that’s easily damaged if scraped by something hard. It’s ok if you get to touch and feel what your buying but I’m just mentioning this in case you thought you were buying a true hard shell like I thought. You can’t lay this face down on asphalt or have anything sharp scrape it because the foam is very supple.5- This brings me to my final point. The easily damaged front makes the need for a rigid durable bottom even more important. I like that this bag is rigid enough to stay standing up on it own if placed upright on a flat surface, but the bottom of the bag is the same fabric as the sides! I would think a hard shell bag would be made to be more “rugged” so some rubber on the bottom to keep it from being damaged by rough surfaces would have been nice.Just a few changes and this would be a 5 star bag. I’ll be keeping it because I love the color, size, and overall appearance, but I’ll be spending another $20 on extra Velcro and rubber feet and an hour cutting and sewing Velcro to make it work for me."
Looked light from the pictures but not really
"Half the cost of most bags and fits my 150-600 lens in it plus two others and accessories. Love it. Only grip is the chest buckle comes off super easy and is hard to clip on the rail stitched on the strap. :( overall a great bag though!Update: bought in March 2022. December 2022, Tripod strap ripping away from bag. Will need to sew up or find new bag with a more durable tripod strap."
Good bag but not fully waterproof
"I like the bag and the space it gives, however the dividers are a bit flimsy and i did not expect the bag to be as small as it is."
I liked the bag and has the best layout but it’s not even water resistant! The cover is a hassle to put on and comes off since it has no Velcro strap like literally all other bags and it doesn’t cover even half the bag leaving it wide open to soak up ALL the water! Even a light mist/drizzle will destroy this bag and everything in it. It also rips at the top near the zipper like it can’t handle a real camera and lenses?! What was it made to hold then?? Company was awesome and made it right though but now I know it’ll still eventually rip in the same spot and can’t even take this outside if there’s even high humidity or worse.
Great bag only problem was looked the the delivery driver sat on it the whole way to my house it was completely smashed. It's coming back to life but difficult to foam dividers in correct position
"Even though this has a very nice accessible pocket for a camera, I wouldn’t say that it is the easiest functioning. The inside is somewhat a mess because the dividers are not very sturdy. The other issue is that it doesn’t fit my tripod, even though I have a very small size one. It barely fits, but I love to keep it inside my bag, I do like all of the different pockets that it has. I just wish that they had more points than inside of the bag."
Product definitely doesn’t qualify as medium. This is definitely a small… not satisfied at all.
"Too small, the quality is ok but it is sort of thin."
I can't get the dividers to stick and the sides of the pack are caved in making it even more difficult to try to fix different spaces.  I gave up twice and just stuck the dividers between things without attaching them to the sides.
Smaller than I expected. Other than that I am happy with quality of product.
This bag does not fit the laptop as advertised. Way smaller in capacity than pictured. This bag will barely hold a child's lunch let alone a DSLR and and three lenses. Better off spending a bit more and getting something useful.
Very average camera bag. Poor pockets and design. Thin protection. Works though for no more than I will use it.
"This is not thick enough for a camera such as Nikon Z9 that has the larger body. Can't put this can IPad, but not my lap top."
"works fine, reasonable price, but for me personally prefer a sturdier bag for protecting the equipment."
I do not like the straps that come with the bag. Its a little difficult to shape the straps to fit the equipment.
"Great bag at first...rec'd 05/13/24. Used 2x/week as hobby, now Oct 10th & zipper totally not functional! Can't find link to return or replacement,  $59.99 a lot for this to be thrown out."
"Update one month in: the inside dividers have a hard time holding my 35 mm lens without mushing. Will be sending back. The buyer offered a full refund and never reached back out. The bag itself isn't small, just thought there would be more storage for other items and there is not much space for that at all. Just camera/laptop necessities.. kind of overpriced in my opinion..  it also is not as padded as it says it is, these pads arent holding no 10lbs haha. if I had a couple weeks to wait for a new bag I'd likely send this back and get something more cost efficient."
I love the bag as a starter but the dividers weren’t included. I would love to change my rating if I can get in contact with customer support to get just the dividers.
Would not trust this bag with my camera gear in the slightest. It past the return window and I am so sad I cant get a refund.
"Not worth money, can not be trusted"
It is regular back up sent with separators that you need to play with it . I spent good 15 mins but cannot figure out the way to put these separations . Furniture assembly is easier than this .
"I'm sure I'm not alone here, but as a photographer, I'm constantly on the lookout for new and improved camera bags for my equipment. I picked up the SDYSM Camera Bag in the hopes it might be one of those bags.Pros: a decent amount of space for camera equipment, a good amount of pockets for accessories, laptop carrier, small & light, large pouch for tripod or large water bottle, straps on the bottom for a tripod, side pocket for easy camera access, luggage strap, hidden pocket that hugs the backCons: there are really 2 bad things about this bag; first, access to the rest of your equipment requires you to open the backpack through one zipper and then unzip another zipper to gain access to the rest of your equipment - too much work for a simple thing - and depending on the weather if you're outside then everything is wet or full of dirt or dust, etc. The second negative is how flimsy the padded foam separates are - they're pretty terrible and it wouldn't take too much more to have made them better.Overall, I like the bag I just wish those two things were solved - maybe in an updated form of this bag they can add a second zipper access that gives you direct access to your equipment and add reinforced foam separators - if that were done, this bag would be a 5 STAR bag for sure, until then, 3 stars from me."
"I've been a photographer for a long time, and I've had a lot of bags similar to this. I'm always on the lookout for new ones, because for whatever reason there are very few companies that make good ones.This bag is generally well made, and feels pretty solid. In general, it's a good bag, just not a good bag for the main purpose it's (ostensibly) designed for.Maybe it's trying to do too much. It has a number of pockets, a laptop sleeve, etc. Sure, sometimes when shooting I do want to have a laptop (though honestly not really in modern times when memory storage is cheap, huge, and doesn't require a computer), but having that pocket means that part of this bag sort of just feels like a backpack.Beyond this, it's the type of bag where you basically have to sit down to open up to get anything more than maybe just the camera out. I will give some credit here for the side pocket, which *does* allow you to pull just your camera (and lens) out, or put it back in, which is something many weaker bags don't do.At the same time, to get anything else out, you have to fully unzip 3/4 of the circumference of the bag back by the straps, then unzip another panel to get to the gear. Forget to zip that inner panel? Your stuff is all over. Even with it zipped, stuff still moves around because of the general form of things.It sort of feels like a camera bag that I'd use to take a camera from one place to another, as long as the place I was going was a place where I was going to take all my camera gear out to use at one spot. Going to a studio or something, for instance. It's a hassle to take things in and out, but if you're only doing it once then it wouldn't be horrible.If you're someone who wanted to use this bag out in the field, say hiking or doing any landscape stuff, or even portraiture stuff outside of a studio, you're going to be taking this bag on and off over and over every time you want to do something like change lenses. It's just not a good bag for those types of situations.One other thing that is just a small sticking point - these bags all have the same sort of soft fabric panels that are attached to the bag with velcro. Many bags will ship with those panels in some sort of arrangement that is likely to be the most common one a photographer would use (e.g. body with lens, 2-3 spare lenses, flash). This bag just comes untouched, with all those panels in a separate bag that you have to assemble yourself.It's nice when you get a bag like this with those panels in it because then you don't have to remember how much of a pain it is to get these into a good arrangement. They're just finicky, and want to stick before you've got them in place, and it also takes some planning to figure out what the order is that you need to put them in. Even then, unless you are meticulous in your work, some of these are going to be off. Then, you have to stand and look at your own failures, and wonder if you care enough to try to fix it, knowing that you might make things worse if you try. So, you know, this bag potentially comes with some existential dread."
"The rain cover was not included. The dividers fir the camera gear was also not included. It's worthless to me so I have to return it. Oh, and also it had hair in it human and animal like cat hair."
"Don't know what kind of tripod they show in the pic, but I can only get one foot of mine into the little pocket.  And, there's no snap buckle on the strap; it's threaded through a buckle that only loosens so far.  The case itself is fairly good, but only hard on the front and back, not the sides.  Somewhat disappointed."
"I recently purchased the MOSISO Camera Backpack. While I liked it, I can't say I loved it. The design and layout of the compartments are quite practical and fit my gear well. However, the overall build quality leaves something to be desired. The material doesn't feel very durable, and after just a few uses, the zipper is already starting to malfunction. For a bag meant to protect expensive equipment, it doesn't instill a lot of confidence in its longevity. It's a decent bag for light use, but if you need something more robust and reliable, you might want to consider other options."
"It has a good size and protection, but the internal dividers just have velcro on the tips and internal sides of the backpack, making all to be loose."
"So far I used this backpack to carry my photo gear on a two week tour of Scotland. We encountered a wide variety of weather, and I took over a 1,000 pictures. Inside the pack I carried a full-frame SLR, extra lens, flash, many small photo accessories, a raincoat, and miscellaneous small items. The pack works well as a day pack for street scene photography, visiting museums, and outdoors events. Light rain was not a problem. The pocket for a water bottle is appreciated. The security pocket and solid rear cover seem very secure from theft, and physical bumping around. I carried the pack on planes, and stowed it in the overhead bin. The photo compartment zipper accommodates TIAA locks, but I don't think this pack could endure the way checked luggage is handled.The pack did a good job of the basics, but I will probably replace it. Two things fell short:1) The backpack was described on Amazon as able to accommodate a 15"" laptop. When I insert my 15"" laptop (HP Envy 360) then the zipper won't close.  The laptop pocket tapers and the corners of my laptop stick out. See side view pictures. Also the sleeve is too tight horizontally(top view picture).2) The backpack's insides handle a big SLR camera but the backpack cannot handle a large tripod that goes with a large camera.  I can only get one leg of my tripod in the little foot holder, and the strap with buckle is cumbersome to use."
"I'm professional social photographer, I use it for photo sessions and weddings, so I have to access fast to  camera, lenses and accessoriesCons---Colors please! I can understand some difference of the reality with pictures, but the bag is very different. Hardshell is different to the rest of the bag, but the worst part is it do not combine.-I expected another softer interior quality-Separators are so tiny, hard and not sufficiently padded, difficult to accommodate. I'm comparing quality and handle with my other three different SLR Camera Bags.-No cover rain-I could value symmetrical bottle pockets in both sidesPros++ In the other hand, I'm happy with backpack closures and pockets, there are extra pockets than other Camera Bags+ The structure of the backpack allows it to stand on its own in vertical, I don't care if there is something to support the bag in vertical position."
"It looks nice, sad that the zipper didn't last more than a year, and it was barely used, looks like new literally."
"I recently acquired a camera backpack, and I have to say, it's been nothing short of a photographer's worst nightmare. 📷😡First and foremost, this backpack's design is a catastrophe. It's like it was created by someone who has never seen a camera in their life. There's no organization, no compartments, and no protection for your expensive gear. It's like tossing your camera equipment into a chaotic black hole. 🕳️💸The quality of the materials is abysmal. It's like they used the flimsiest, cheapest fabric they could find. I wouldn't trust this backpack to protect my gear from a light drizzle, let alone serious weather conditions. It's like offering your camera a one-way ticket to the repair shop. ☔🛠️Comfort? Forget about it. This backpack's shoulder straps are about as comfortable as wearing a cactus suit. They dig into your shoulders and make you feel like you're carrying a load of bricks, not a camera. It's like getting a daily dose of pain with your photography adventure. 🌵😣The zippers are just waiting to fail. They're like a ticking time bomb of frustration. It's only a matter of time before they get stuck, jammed, or worse, come completely off. It's like playing Russian roulette with your camera's safety. 🔫🔒In conclusion, this camera backpack is more of a threat to your gear and your photography passion than a reliable companion. If you value your equipment and want a comfortable, organized, and protective solution for carrying your camera, I'd strongly advise looking elsewhere. This backpack is a regrettable investment that's bound to leave you with shattered gear and shattered dreams. 📷🙅‍♂️🚫"
I like this bag a lot for the price and some of the features. It has a bit of an odd layout with how the Velcro lines up and how you can arrange the inside of the bag but overall the storage and pockets are really good quality and the weight even fully filled it still light. The only improvement I would want in the future is the customizable pockets to have a bit more choice.
"I was caught off guard by how cherry red the color was, and it’s only hard shell on the front. The sides are soft. The inner foam pieces move around a LOT, and aren’t as secure as I was hoping they would be. Overall I don’t feel like it’s protective really at all if it were to drop with my camera inside."
Bag looks impressive online and when you first get it out of the box but attempting to use it things begin to fall apart.Front hard material seems nice but it scratches extremely easily. I doubt it would hold up over time. It also does effectively nothing in terms of protection.Build quality overall is mediocre.Interior dividers are far too flimsy and there simply isn't enough velcro to configure it the way you would like nor to provide secure enough attachment. Loading it up and walking around with it for a few hours had all my gear in a pile at the bottom because the velcro is too weak.Came from an Amazon Basics bag that is nearly 10 years old. That bag is still perfect and was significantly more sturdy at half the price.
"I had great hopes for this bag, but instead discovered two major flaws.  (1) Someone put a leaky water bottle into the aircraft's overhead storage bin. My new camera bag soaked up this water like a sponge and transferred that water to my gear. (2) The interior Velcro compartment divider tabs are, in my opinion, much too flimsy to adequately protect the gear."
The pictures of the dusty rose color was much darker than what I received. This is basically pink. The hard shell statement is a joke. It’s rubber. Ain’t nothing hard about it. Pictures show a potential drop of the case and claim its shock proof. I wouldn’t want to drop it with my camera and accessories inside. It’s a bit smaller than anticipated. There should be more dividers inside.  Is this thing worth $70? Absolutely not. I feel ripped off.
"I had really high expectations for this item. I thought it would be really great based on reviews but it came with a scratch on the front of it. It also shows fingerprints super easily which I don’t like, and it’s a bit cumbersome. Yes it has all the pockets but they’re very hard to reach. I also don’t like the way it zips considering the flap just falls down and your camera could potentially just fall out if you don’t take it out while your bags on the ground. The Velcro compartments on the inside didn’t stick as good as I thought and the felt sticks to my camera strap making it frayed. Some of the things I liked were the laptop sleeve and the water bottle holder but I wouldn’t buy it again."
I had a Tamrac bag which was ok but I needed a larger one and this guy fits the bill. It's pretty solid but maybe not quite as solid as my Tamrac and not as well thought out.It's not designed for a mirrorless camera but obviously a DSLR that is bigger and bulkier.  The Velcro strips sewn into the inside of bag need to come all the way around so you can arrange the internal padding properly.
It was a good bag until the zipper broke after about a year.
I really love the way the backpack looked. Once I opened it up and saw the dividers I was disappointed. My Canon R5C will not fit in this bag at all. Not without rendering the dividers completely useless and sliding all around the backpack. Maybe for a micro four-thirds camera in a drone this backpack would be useful. For me not so much. I still think the dividers are too cheap feeling. The outside of the backpack is made very well.
The zippers and stitching are super low quality on this bag. If you don’t have them completely zipped to the edge and open the bag just a tiny bit they will get damaged. I have three lenses in this bag and am already starting to see bulging and stitching being stressed. Probably worth it to spend the extra $30-50 and get a higher quality bag. I don’t see this bag lasting longer than a year or two with any sort of regular use.
"I've had this ""drone/camera"" backpack for 6 months now, and I would recommend getting a higher end bag for your expensive stuff.  Here's why:* it's ""ok"" as a camera bag, but just ""ok"". The sides are an ""ok"" thickness, but the lid? No. It's molded, but has only two zipper pockets in the lid with NO PADDING.  So it's prone to being crushed from the top.  Now, if you're super careful with your stuff...then the bag is ""OK""* THe side of the bag does not hold it's shape when loaded up, putting stress on the zipper.* speaking of ""zipper""... this one is already hanging up.Seriously, if you're going to be a couple grand worth of Cameras/drones in a bag... get a higher quality bag.  For toting around basic camera gear, and a small drone. It will do."
Inside spacing is great.  Flexible options.  Overall size is perfect to carry everything you would need.The exterior material is horrible. I would not order again.  I have had it just a couple weeks. It rubbed against an interior door which is smooth and painted and it ripped a spot off the surface.  It's so delicate this isn't a great option for in and out of a vehicle. Traveling etc.  for sedentary storage great. But exterior is least durable I have experienced and unfortunately I spent 60 bucks on it.  My canvas one I have had for years is what I am reverting back to. It is far more durable. This thing is sadly already being relegated to closet storage of various components I don't often use.  Not pleased with the quality of this product.
Great photo backpack for the money.  But bein a pro I couldn’t fit Z9 D5 even D850 was very tight.  Z7  with no batter grip would be find but I use that more of a carry around camera. The depth was about 2 inches to shallow for my use and I know I am in the minority.That being said I WOULD BUY THIS BACKPACK IF I WAS USING IT FOR RECREATION PURPOSES
"Backpack overall is okay. I would rate 2.5, i wouldn’t suggest doing traveling or any rugged activities with it given it gets damaged and scratched quite easily. Personally, I just didn’t love it. I think it could use more internal padding, especially if you use more high end camera equipment like we do."
Love the idea and design but quality is crap. Velcro for interior panels have a very weak grip and the plastic zipper for the main compartment as very cheap and started sticking right away and the broke after 2 months.
"Just fair, the spacer come out very quickly."
"I took this on one car trip, and somehow the front of the bag got scratched from something in the car and the blue color came off. The interior of the bag was great, there's a lot of storage, but for real-life use it's not  practical unless you're very careful. I'll try to cover the scratch and keep using it, and be very careful where I put the backpack in the future."
"There a couple of things wrong with this bag.  Yes it is a very simple camera storage bag and I wasn't expecting something that was out of this world.  For what the bag was intended to do, it falls short.  First is the zippers.  On the corners after light use the teeth are starting to fall apart in the corners(see attached photo).  This bag is only used to store my gear when not in use.  Second, the deviders are only Velcro'd on the sides.  Meaning if you don't have the space filled with something, when you set the bag upright everything shifts to the bottom.  It's petty, but something I didn't think about when buying the bag.  For what it is, I guess it don't the job.  The one zipper is now stuck in the corner and won't work.  The bag is not useless and only stores gear I'm not using.  Buy at your own risk."
"While it seems nice and sturdy, it should be noted that the backpack is narrower than most. It is not wide enough to hold two cameras side by side; a 70-200 takes up the entire width with no room for more. If you prefer to carry two cameras with lenses attached rather than all items loose, this is not a great choice. In addition, for some reason they did not put the velcro around all four sides of the interior. The top has none and so you cannot place a divider down the middle lengthwise. Not sure why they didn't have it all the way around."
"I bought this case may 9, 2022. The Zippers no longer work for about a week now. while looking for a new less expensive case I saw this bag has a one year warranty. I'm not sure how to contact the seller. I pray they honor the return policy. If so...definately a 5 star bag! Holds everything you may need. Love the little zipper area to hold a card reader or SD cards... No use if zippers don't work though"
"The bag has issues and is poorly made. In less than a year, some areas, such as broken zips, split open around the zipper areas. I genuinely regret buying this product."
I was expecting the sides of the bag to be more Sturdy. If you keep large lenses the side of the bag opens up. You need to push it together to zip it. Also the compartments I expected to be more sturdy. Overall don’t expect too much - you’ll be happy.
Both of the zippers broke. One of the zippers broke and split while my camera was in it. My camera fell out and my lens shattered. DO NOT BUY.
"Bought this back pack for a trip. Used it once and the zipper seem came apart so worthless to use for anything now. And when i tried to get refund, its non-refundable. Sucks! Dont' buy this one."
This doesn’t comfortably fit the Sony 200-600mm. Look for better and bigger backpacks. Lowerpro i found a couple. But this is not It. Will be returning :)
They layout and size of the bag is perfect for day hikes with my camera gear BUT I have had two of these bags now and both of them had the chest strap rip off the moment I tried to tighten it.  Amazon replaced the first one and now I am reaching out to them to replace the second.  If you carry a light load and don't need the chest strap it is a great bag but if like me you have a bag full of camera gear I would look elsewhere.
Zipper didnt last 3 weeks before it started hanging up.
"I love the design and I love the space.I’m super disappointed about its water resistance. It was raining here in NYC and i was walking to work with my gear in the bag. When I got to work and opened it, the inside was completely wet. I think the issue may be the zippers but also the back panel that is against my back was also soaked, not just the sides. Thank god my camera is weather sealed but my speedlite did not survive. Imagine if I had my 3,000 laptop in this bag, that would have been bad!I was going to buy the bag in another color but now i wont be. Such a shame because i do love the product. I hope to find a bag that is more water resistant and follows the same shell design. Also the bag is not hard shell it is a soft shell that feels like foam.Be aware of this when buying! You honestly should look for a waterproof bag. You are carrying electrical components."
"I have been through so many camera bags. I like the hardshell on this but I don't know what those lenses are in the picture but it's a lie. I got one camera, a 200, a 24-70, and an 85 and it's so fully jammed in there it's hard to close. Why does every seller lie about the size of their bags? It shows two long lenses, !two cameras, three! short lenses and a flash! Sell me that bag why don't ya??"
"So close to being great, but for the price vs the competition it’s better than what I expected. Just wish the interior panels were thicker or there were more Velcro strips on the top of the inside not just the sides"
"Nice medium size camera bag. Held camera body, 3 lenses, and the flash easily…however zipper ripped out on second use."
I have a dell laptop 15 inches and it didn't fit inside the bag because of the round shape on the top of the bag. I had to purchase another bag that my laptop could actually fit on it. the shell is not as sturdy as it was advertised. it is a cool bag but not for hiking or beach outdoor.if my laptop could fit into it I would took it to use as a causal bag for my camera but it didn't.
"Love this bag, it's super cute!  I'm worried the material that buckles to the zipper near the tripod holder won't last very long.  It's already pulling and when I zip up the bag you can tell the mini-tripod is too heavy for the material.  I might have to return this bag."
"I just received this new camera bag yesterday, used it while photographing a rehearsal dinner last night and it already has a scratch.  It’s a great looking bag but that’s it.  It’s not going to hold up with wear and tear and for this much, it should.  Also, it’s not a hard shell…it has a hard underlay but the coating is soft."
"I love this backpack but hate the inserts. They are too floppy to stay in place leaving my gear scattered everywhere inside. I’ve just taken the inserts out completely and now just use it as a small carry on suitcase. The semi hard shell is great, the quality of the bag is great and the color is really cool."
When I first got this bag I was super excited because I wanted to make sure my drone was safe. Not the case. The compartments move around all the time in things fall in between the liners so you lose any kind of things that you might have in there. The zippers are very hard to maneuver. There is a lot of things this backpack needs. Unfortunately it only worked for me for about a month. Maybe it’s better for cameras but it was advertised also to hold Drones which is not the case.
Flimsy. The hard shell meant to protect a laptop is inadequate. I regret purchasing this product.
"The items move all over the place when traveling with the backpack on my shoulders. It has lots of space, but it is not really usable since things don't need to stay in space. There are other better options out there that allow quicker access while also having things stay in space."
This is ok for the price...but do not expect any real heavy duty use as it is ergonomically bad for long hikes and lacks a waist strap/belt.  Otherwise pretty ok for casual use.
"Three months into using this camera bag, I can confidently say that I regret the purchase. The design is great in theory, awful in practice. No quick-to-access pockets, pouches, or loops. I have to take the bag off even to access the side pouch, which is intensely annoying when wearing and using camera gear. The main zipper is already starting to fail because it’s poor quality. Do not recommend."
It looks nice but it's construction is a bit cheap. The inner dividers are not so great. I returned it because it seemed too poorly made for the long haul.
The bag itself looks awesome and it is very sturdy. It could have used some more pockets outside for quick access. The main problem is the foam dividers inside are very very flimsy and does not hold shape at all. They are always sagging and it gets very annoying when all your gear are everywhere when you open the bag.
Everything is great but the bottle holder is trash and my hydro flask and nalgene keep falling out
This bag would be much better if they didn't cheap-out on the interior velcro. Instead of a full wall of velcro this has strips so the dividers don't stay in place very well. This is a good bag for lighter stuff but heavier lenses and cameras move around too much in my opinion.
"I've had this bag for just over 6 months now. And up until recently, I LOVED it. It fits everything I need it to fit, is easy to carry, has handy pockets inside and out, looks good and the price was right. Then the zipper failed. The first time, I was lucky -- it happened while I was at the beach, so when I put it on my back and a lens fell out, it hit soft sand. After that, I was always extra careful to make sure it was zipped properly. Then it happened again, even after I had checked the zipper. It still came open. And this time I wasn't as lucky. So what I thought was a great bargain has now cost me $1,000 to replace a broken lens. Lesson learned. You get what you pay for."
"I've been using this bag mostly for outdoor activities. The camera with the lens becomes quite heavy for the bag so the camera keeps dropping inside the bag. We are talking sony a73 + tamron 24-75mm (not a huge lens). The accessibility is very poor as well. If you want to take the camera out, you need to open the entire bag to do it in a clean way. If not, you're just pulling things out of a rabbit hole."
I bought this one because I outgrew another one that I had bought in this one was more sturdy look to be a great buy supposed to be water resistant however everything that could go wrong went wrong with this bag I was doing a photo shoot it happen to start raining I put my stuff in the bag had an umbrella so nothing was to get wet as I was getting in the car I closed my umbrella my bag got wet and when looking in the bag I realize that some of my equipment was wet this is not water resistant. After using for about two months the backpack arm ripped and this was something that I had to deal with while doing a wedding it was not a great experience
"This backpack actually sucks. I’ve had a lot of camera bags in my time and I’ve never complained about them as often as this one.CONSToo small. Not enough pockets for chargers, cords, nd filters etcThe sectional material and velcro in the bag is so flimsy and weak that every time I open my bag the equipment looks like it has been thrown aroundThe color on the front hard case material began to scratch off literally a day or two after putting it to use. (And it wasn’t much use) I just kept it in my wagon while shooting.PROI don’t like this bag at all but the only things I can give it probs for is the the water resistance is legit. There’s been multiple raining days and my equipment never got even slightly wet on the inside."
"The seller claims this backpack is ""waterproof."" It's not.I bought this for a rainy jungle trip I was going on, and I wanted to test it's effectiveness beforehand to ensure the safety of my camera equipment. I threw it in the shower and as soon as the water starting coming down I knew it was going to get inside the backpack (see pictures). I would have been better off storing my camera in the cardboard box the backpack was shipped in.If you want waterproof, keep looking. This ain't it."
Great price and look. Used the inside pocket once and zipper failed.
"I really loved this bag and would have kept if, if it wasn’t for the overwhelming smell of detergent from it. Even the box it was in, and the bag it was wrapped in wreaked of it. It seemed to be coming from the material lining used inside the bag. It was either actual detergent smell or just that that material resembles detergent, but it was bad. I have a feeling it’s just that type of material that smells strong, because I remember lining from various camera bags having a similar smell 20 years ago. I loved the hard shell feel to it though, so I wish it could have worked out. Everything was awesome about it, except for the smell."
Purchased 6 months ago and the straps now smell horrible. I hardly sweat while wearing it but they’ve begun to stink badly like body odor. The inside dividers are also very flimsy. Can’t recommend
"This bag has some really nice features like well thought out space allocation, and additional pockets included in clever places.  Unfortunately the straps are very poorly constructed and the chest strap broke off the side the first time I attempted to tighten it.  It was just clinging to the seam with this plactic hinge.  The side strap is very flimsy and can't accommodate my professional carbon fiber tripod very well either.  Felt very unbalanced.  Returned it immediately."
"Literally just took it out of the box, unzipped and zipped it up again and the zipper is popping open. Nothing is in the bag stretching it out. This backpack is extremely too expensive to be having an issue like this."
"This product, like all Mosiso products, is great! Worst thing is I’m returning it because the “Deep Teal” pictured in the photos is not as “deep” in real life.... COLOR IS DIFFERENT THAN PICTURED."
This product not even worth $5.Uncomfortable to open and close not waterproof and two bulky while carrying around
"The backpack is durable, but the zippers are cheap. There are two zippers on the main compartment of the backpack where you put your camera and or lens. One broke off within a month the other broke off a month later so it's very difficult to unzip and zip back up the most used compartment of the backpack without the zipper pulls."
For short people only.
I bought this pack to carry my photography gear around an Alaska cruise with port excursions. The most important characteristics were durability and water resistance. The pack failed miserably at keeping my gear dry. It only took a light rain to soak it.
I Like The Bag Buf the Zipper Started Shredding. 😢
"I think this would be a good backpack for smaller, less expensive gear.  It's small interior would not accept my camera body and three primary lenses.  Even though the designers thought to semi-tuck the zipper pulls  in the top portion of the case, I don't want to risk $14,000 of equipment to potential damage.  Returned for refund."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I received my Mosiso backpack and was excited to use it but upon unboxing there is NO PADDING INSIDE. It was crucial that I get this bag in time for a shoot coming up soon and there is no padding to section off my different pieces of equipment. I paid too much to not get what I paid for… Disappointed.
"I use this to carry thousands of dollars worth of camera equipment. I went to pick up the backpack today and as I was putting it on, the zipper failed causing my camera and a two of my lenses to drop onto the floor. Not sure if this is a common issue or a defect, but I wouldn't trust this company to keep my equipment safe again."
"This could be good for an individual with one camera and two lens. When I opened the box and saw the bag it was obvious this wasn’t going to work. None of my lens fit, there is no way a drone could get in it and after realizing just how small it was, I went back to the photos on Amazon and looking closer this time, the products displayed in the bag were photoshopped in. I will return this one.*It does appear to be a decently constructed product, just not for a photographer."
This is not a true hard case or sturdy case. Could have done better with the sides.
Didn't get a chance to use it as it was too small for my needs.
"I wanted to really like this camera bag. However, just taking it out of the delivery box, there were several defects not only to the “hard shell” but to the fabric itself. Even though it’s a good looking backpack, it’s doesn’t have a true hard shell the quality is lacking."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Product is damaged and had a human hair inside the backpack…… yup.
I've barely used this bag and the zipper isn't working anymore.
Being a professional photographer for many years I’ve had some very long lasting backpacks. I’m disappointed in the quality of this backpack and it only lasted a few months. Definitely not purchasing one of these again.
The backpack straps for this bag are too small. I wear XL shirts and this bag is way too small to wear comfortably. It does not fit like a normal back pack.  Additionally this store has only a 1 month return policy. By the time I had a chance to actually wear this bag and use it I found it to be useless and not able to be returned. Look elsewhere. Poor product.
"Looks fine, but zipper broke immediately.  Small velcro pieces may be attached anywhere, but everything slides under them so all camera equipment migrates all over the place. I would not recommend.  Might as well throw everything in a bag for all the protection this gives."
"After three uses, two of zippers started tearing apart in the corners."
"They put a sticker right on the front of this, not a sticker that’s easily removed either. Extremely annoying. It seems like it’s damaging the material trying to peel it off. There are also scratches all along the “hard cover” which is not hard at all. It’s a flimsy foam top. Extremely disappointed with this purchase. Will be returning."
this is not waterproof bag unfortunally!
"only buy, if you fill the bag conpletely with camera gear. When you carry the bag and walk, the camera and lenses moves all around and the velcro seperators are not stable and firm to hold the lens/camera properly in position."
Doesnt hold alot and its heavy.
It was not waterproof at all.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Cheap quality , really thin pad protector,"
"Unfortunately,that’s not what you expect when you order a new backpack. It was definitely used,damaged  and returned before .I like a bag itself ,but definitely I’m upset about the condition."
"Not for me, I wish I could still return it.Super bulky & couldn’t fit under an airplane seat as a carry-on.…. Disappointed."
Did a ton of research for this purchase. I liked the bag until the zipper broke after 5 weeks. I would appreciate a replacement.
The top layer of the bag got damaged. Very bad quality.
We all have pet peeves. Mine is trying removing these stickers and them not coming off.
"Overall it's a good little pack for the price. I used it on a recent trip to Alaska and it held up well and I had plenty of room for my camera, 3 lenses and a drone & controller. However, it's NOT waterproof as stated. I did a short one hour nature trail in steady, but not heavy rain, and was in and out of different shops throughout the day. After returning to our cruise ship I noticed it was wet inside down the entire pack. Luckily nothing was soaked, just some minor moisture on some lenses and my drone. It's my fault for using something that claims to be waterproof without testing it, but don't make the mistake I did. I'd highly suggest using a rain cover with this pack for any sensitive electronics. Other than that it's great but I definitely won't be using it in the rain without a cover, and will probably even treat it with silicone spray as well. I only gave it 3 stars because of the waterproof claim which is a big deal if you're using it for camera gear."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this camera bag to haul my gear back and fourth to weddings and sessions. I loved it! Up until 3 weeks into owning it the zipper started getting stuck. Now I can barely even open the bag without ripping the side fabric more and more. Disappointed that it has fallen apart so quickly. See pics attached for reference.I do not stuff this bag full so I know it’s a manufacturing error.
"This could have been an exceptional bag with some minor cheap additions to the design and it’s frustrating that the designer didn’t implement on this bag because I bought a second smaller sling bag from them and it doesn’t have these issues!1- The soft Velcro strips are only on the sides and bottoms of the bag and not on the top or corners. The smaller bag I got from this company has 100% of the inside made of a soft but durable material that grips Velcro so you can stick anywhere you want and get full use of your Velcro strip. The two strips on this bag mean limited surface contact for the Velcro and the dividers aren’t as secure as they could be.2- The smaller cheaper bag I got from this company had Velcro flaps along the back of the dividers as well so compartments are super sturdy. This bag doesn’t have any way to Velcro to the back so you’re really limited in configurations and weight bearing capabilities for the dividers3- The long dividers have a VERY rigid middle that is impossible to bend even if you apply strong pressure. So if you have a fat lens or want to curve around something, forget about it. The dimension on these long dividers isn’t flexible to attach them horizontally. Not well at least. If you’re like me and have wide lenses and can’t fit them in the general compartments that this bag was made to have, it’s really frustrating to try to fit your gear. All they had to do was add some flex to these dividers or and an extra couple bends to the middle piece and it would be so much more versatile! These long dividers are also the only ones to have the fuzzy Velcro on them so this really limits how you can arrange these or use the stretchy strips that come with the bag.4- Not really a flaw but just worth noting:  The hard shell isn’t exactly a hard shell. It’s a hard flexible foam that’s easily damaged if scraped by something hard. It’s ok if you get to touch and feel what your buying but I’m just mentioning this in case you thought you were buying a true hard shell like I thought. You can’t lay this face down on asphalt or have anything sharp scrape it because the foam is very supple.5- This brings me to my final point. The easily damaged front makes the need for a rigid durable bottom even more important. I like that this bag is rigid enough to stay standing up on it own if placed upright on a flat surface, but the bottom of the bag is the same fabric as the sides! I would think a hard shell bag would be made to be more “rugged” so some rubber on the bottom to keep it from being damaged by rough surfaces would have been nice.Just a few changes and this would be a 5 star bag. I’ll be keeping it because I love the color, size, and overall appearance, but I’ll be spending another $20 on extra Velcro and rubber feet and an hour cutting and sewing Velcro to make it work for me."
Looked light from the pictures but not really
"Half the cost of most bags and fits my 150-600 lens in it plus two others and accessories. Love it. Only grip is the chest buckle comes off super easy and is hard to clip on the rail stitched on the strap. :( overall a great bag though!Update: bought in March 2022. December 2022, Tripod strap ripping away from bag. Will need to sew up or find new bag with a more durable tripod strap."
Good bag but not fully waterproof
"I did quite like this bag initially, but after using it for nearly a year now, some issues about the design have become apparent. I am new to photography within the last year or two, so these were things that I didn't think of when purchasing the bag. There are some good things about it as well, so I will list both below.Pros:-It claims to be waterproof (I say claims because I have not yet tested this)-There are multiple zipper pockets that are secure, and they are different sizes to accommodate different needs-The tripod holder is nice, but it would need to be quite a small one to fit-The dividers within the large compartment are nice to be able to separate lenses and whatnot-The removable dividers in the large compartment are secured with velcro, but you are stuck with their choice of hook or loop side of the velcroCons:-The large main zipper compartment is not well designed. Wherever the zipper has to turn a corner, i frequently have issues with it getting hung up and not zipping or unzipping smoothly. Also, if you are wearing the bag when you want to try to get into that compartment, you either have to be very careful in getting the contents out, or you have to only unzip partially and reach into the compartment.-The messenger bag style strap is uni-directional because of the way it is sewn and the shape of the strap. This bag would have benefited greatly from a regular straight strap that was able to buckle to either side of the bottom of the bag so it could be put over either shoulder.-If you aren't using the additional securement strap, where is nowhere to connect it, so it just hangs there. I keep having to loop it around something else to keep it from hanging down at my hip."
"When I pulled it out of the box I thought this is perfect. A small pack to carry my camera and a few things.After putting my stuff in it, I think it’s a touch too small. Once your camera in there all other pockets are tiny and in some cases the pockets are pushing on others. Fit is a bit tight when on with the cross strap. I am not a big man either. 5’ 10” 155lb.On the plus I love the color. It is well padded and the camera is snug. Didn’t feel super cheap, but we will see after some use."
"This is a nice camera bag. But it is really very awkward to wear and use. It's meant to be slung over one shoulder, and allow for access to the camera from one side, but it's really awkward. Also, if you're left handed, this isn't for you as it can't be used on either shoulder."
"Like this bag overall, but after a few months of light use (not a professional photographer, only use my camera occasionally) some of the stitching for the top carrying strap is coming undone. I weighed the bag with all of my gear and it weights a bit over 7 pounds. This is carrying a DSLR, 3 lens, and a small tripod. The bag seems to be well built, and I hardly use the top carrying strap so I'm not sure why it's starting to come undone. If this were a regular backpack I would not be a concerned, but given the value of the equipment I'm carrying it is of major concern.The padding seems good and decently protective against accidental bumps. What would really help is if there were straps on the bottom of the bag to hold a larger tripod. I've tried storing a standard sized metal tripod on the side of the bag, but it does not work well for a couple of reasons. The strap is not long enough to go all the way around the tripod, so you have to weave it in part of the tripod (assuming the tripod is not in a protective bag). The pouch for storing the base of the tripod is barely big enough to store the tripod in it. And if you do manage to get a standard sized tripod in there, you'll find that the bag is very off balance. Two long straps on the bottom would really help so a standard sized tripod could be lashed to the bottom of the bag for even balance."
"If you are overweight or chesty, this is not the bag for you. I extended the straps as far as they can go and it fits like a tactile harness.I love the color. It is super durable and the zippers are strong. It is easy to open and close. It is very lightweight and I love all the extra pocket space. It fits my camera very nicely. I just can't wear it as it is designed to be worn, and that's the whole point of my buying it so I'm disappointed. I will not be posting photos as that's a sight no one wants to see."
"Placement of the zipper would make accessing your camera on the go a bit precarious to any additional lenses you are carrying. My Nikon d7000 with attached Tamron 18-400 lens did not fit. This is my main shooting lens, needs to fit assembled for me to keep, item was returned."
The top compartment is open with no dividers so all of the small things for the camera will be jumbled up. I wouldn’t recommend this for a camera case.
"Not to comfortable,  no extra space to put two camera"
"It's nice and made well, but tiny, uncomfortable, and good luck with bigger lenses. My 70-300 Tamron has to go in the top part because it will not fit in the main part with camera."
"I shoot a lot of conventions and was looking to downsize from a large backpack to a sling bag with the hope of easy gear accessibility and comfortability. I had to reorganize the inner dividers to accommodate my Canon EOS Rebel T6s with a 17-55mm lens and battery grip. It was a tight fit, but it fit - sideways, and wasn't easy to take out on a whim.The bag does not sling around as easy as the description implies, and (as a female), I find it to be incredibly tight around my chest area, even with the strap loosened all the way. It's also not very comfortable on my shoulder, riding up near my neck rather than staying put. If you carry a weighted body or multiple lenses, you will most likely experience this as well. I did notice some abnormal stretching in the bag, and while I didn't find any tearing, I'm not confident it would hold up with further use.I had difficulty fitting my memory card and battery holders in the bag -- if you carry them loose, you probably won't have much of an issue with this. Don't bother trying to fit your wallet in the ""hidden pouch"" because I wasn't able to zip it up with a standard-sized wallet. My iPhone 8+ also didn't fit in this pocket, and while I could have stored both in the front pocket, I wasn't comfortable doing so, given how easy it is to access.The bag was cumbersome when experiencing a manual security check, as even with all the zippers opened, security personnel had issues with exploring each compartment thoroughly.The bag is probably best suited for a point-and-shoot camera or smaller mirrorless or DSLR system, wallet, phone, and various incidentals - cleaning gear, tissue, etc. As I mentioned earlier, I'm not confident it will be able to meet my needs during future photography outings and am in the process of returning it in favor of my backpack."
The buckles on the straps to adjust the straps to an individual body.  Especially for some one who has arthritis in their hands.
"It’s a bit too small for a large adult.  Also, there aren’t enough dividers to accurately spread out my camera equipment.  Overall it worked for my needs, but I had to add an extra divider to it so that my expensive camera equipment wouldn’t fall out when it was opened.  (Sadly, this actually happened).  If you are a small framed body, then it will likely meet your needs fine (my teen aged son has the same bag & it works perfect for his thin frame).  The quality of the bag itself is good.  The zippers and the connections snap together nicely and I like the color.  For me, its just a little snug around my middle, so for any serious traveling it wouldn’t work.  I did like all the pockets and once I put in an extra divider it works.  But, it needs a little more engineering to make it my perfect bag."
Item is smaller then I expected. I'm a big guy and it looks like I'm wearing a dolls backpack and the strap are very tight around me even though they are fully stretched out. Everything else wasn't to bad. I may be returning it.
"While the camera storage seemed great, the second I put it on, I knew it was getting returned. There is an awkward 2nd strap that you have to hunt to see anywhere before you purchase - and it creates a pretty undesirable look and feel on woman. If you choose not to buckle it, then you just have a random strap hanging.  Too bad - I had it all packed with my gear and was excited to use it!"
"Surprisingly you can really get good camera bags for about $40.  This is not one of them.  It feels extremely cheap.  But I will say that it did hold my Sony with a small zoom lens in the main section and a regular prime in the upper area.I immediately tossed it aside, will donate to goodwill.  Update, I did actually use it for a trip with a standard and zoom lens.  It served the purpose, but the bag hangs awkwardly over the shoulder."
"Ok *LEFT* SHOULDER sling pack with Velcro dividers for SMALL dSLR cameras. Mediocre to medium quality throughout. Room for three tiny lenses or one small to medium dSLR camera, and two small lenses.It accommodates a Sony a7 - but the Canon 5D is a squeeze.Additional pocket for a rain poncho or a big wallet. It has a handy belly strap too - but not big enough for anything more than a 34” waist (my size; fully expanded, wearing only a shirt).The snap clips are poor quality (and hard to open). Nor do the ones on the side of the bag appear to serve any purpose.So I’ve used it a few times now and even managed to get an iPad in with the Sony a7. Snug but not shoe-horned in.Overall I’m not happy with it and I’m already looking for a replacement. It doesn’t sit comfortably on the shoulder without being “braced” with a hand, and is inclined to slip off. (I’m 5’8” and have reasonable shoulders!)Honestly - if I’d taken enough care to notice that it was a left-shoulder item, I wouldn’t have bought it.Silly me."
"Speaking as a shorter female who has had other sling bags, this is very uncomfortable. It's also very long and hits below my back. The extra-wide strap in the exact middle pulls at my chest in a way that a man would probably not notice. And the strap is so wide that it puts too much pressure at my neck and out on my arm socket. I started to feel nauseous. The pockets are great, in fact, they are extremely useful. the pocket for a tripod is awesome. It's just so amazingly uncomfortable."
"First, I have a small-ish camera, a Canon R10, which is about the same size as a Rebel T7.  My complaints about this bag will apply less the larger your camera body is.The root of all problems with this bag is that the velcro fuzz isn't all over the inside, and in fact only reaches about 25% of the available surface.  So no matter how you arrange the dividers, the area for your camera body is, in my case, HUGE.  So large that my camera isn't even secure when I open the bag.Related to the first point is that even if you buy extra elastic straps to retain your gear, there's no place to attach them that helps.Finally, even where there's velcro fuzz, they opted for strips instead of full surface, which greatly reduces the holding strength of the dividers.  Just strapping a tripod to the side causes the dividers to come apart.It's just so much stupid lazy design, I feel crapped on for trying it out."
"When we were unloading at a train station from a cab, this camera bag fell out of the trunk from the low deck of a hatchback to the asphalt below. Even though our lenses were packed exactly as shown in the photos, one of our lens filters shattered and left bits of broken glass throughout the bag, rendering unusable until we could properly clean it out.This is not “shockproof” as advertised."
"I like having a messenger style camera bag with a side opening panel. Makes accessing my camera easy while wearing the bag.  If your considering this one because of the low price (like me) - here are the shortcomings that I have found.- It’s small enough it works for my Sony APSC camera and 18-105mm lens, but it would be too short if i had a longer lens (w/hood)- The internal Velcro dividers are awkward to configure.- the external zipper support buckles are unadjustable and because they are lose, really serve little purpose.- bottom padding is thinner than I’d like and corners have no padding.But I do like that is has a water bottle pocket, a side strap for a travel tripod and a couple other pockets for miscellaneous stuff.  Not bad for the price, but not ideal."
"I initially thought I like this bag because of the padding and protection, however it doesn’t fit my lens well. Lower compartment doesn’t allow quick access and shoulder strap not comfortable. It’s a good bag for small lens and smaller cameras."
"Really nice quality bag, materials well made, pretty red color, interior sections are well padded. My biggest complaint is shown in the photo, that there is a huge wasted space in the biggest compartment. There is no padding or even a mesh net to prevent things from slipping out when you open the compartment, so I’m afraid to put anything there. It’s a shame, because I have a long lens that I thought would fit perfectly there, and it does fit - but I’m not risking putting my expensive lens in an unprotected area!Otherwise I like the style and feel of the bag. If I weren’t outside my return window I’d try to return it and get something else. But now I’m going to have to see if I can rig up something to put there to prevent my equipment from sliding out so I can use that compartment. It’s a huge disappointment to me."
I guess it’s my fault for buying a returned item. Components missing from bag and stuffed with a hat. Would’ve been great if inspection was done before being sent
"Great camera bag. I use this to carry my Nikon D5600 and two lenses, plus all batteries and chargers, SD cards; etc. This bag really fits a lot of stuff and has a place for it all rather than just shoving it all in a generic bag your camera came with. The crossbody is the best kind of camera bag in my opinion, it makes it much easier to sling around and not be in the way when you are trying to take pictures. This bag has a clip to strap it across your chest. When this strap is clipped no matter how loose or tight the back strap is it rides up. Being a woman it is uncomfortable around my breast when it rides up. So in turn I cut this strap off the bag"
"I was so excited when I bought myself a really good digital camera to replace my old 35mm camera. I really liked the feature of being able to wear this bag (cross-body...unlike as it is shown in the pictures) and then slide the bag around to the front to extract the camera out of the side pocket without having to take off the pack. When I loaded my camera and accesories into the bag, everything seemed to fit just fine. However, when I strapped my tripod onto the bag, then the bag did not work at all for me anymore. If I had the strap loose enough to swing around to my front, then the tripod kept bumping into my right arm. If I tightened the strap so that it wouldn't hit my arm, the end of the tripod hit the back of my head. So with regrets, I am returning this."
"Very nice pack, too bad they didn't make the straps long enough for normal sized people. A snug fit with a light shirt on, with a jacket forget it.Sorry to have to return this pack. Do better next time."
"This bag slings only on your left shoulder. If you carry a bag on your right shoulder, mainly most right handed people do, this bag will not work. The strap is curved to fit only left sided only and doesn’t have ability to swap sides for carrying. Not a good design. Also camera location runs small for lens area. Anything bigger then a 105mm F4 lens, won’t fit."
"Sling bag, yes. Only hangs on the left side, Which I guess I'm being picky but I really don't like. Plus there's an extra long strap that clips into the main strap essentially creating a backpack not and easy cross body or sling camera bag to take on or off. Would've been nice of the pictures we're more accurate. Small space inside; have to store camera and lens separate, which means you’ll have to put the camera together every time you take it out of the bag. Too much work for an poorly described  backpack."
"This camera bag is quite versatile and has adequate  space for a hobbyist photographer.  With over four pockets, you have ample pockets for storage of extra battery, battery charger, lens filters, lens wipes, SD cards, 2 lens , 1 flash attachment, mini-tripod, and camera body.The sling strap does not support wearing the bag and utilizing it while shooting.However if you are moving into the prosumer photographer level, this bag is inadequate.  If you need to carry more than two lenses and a battery holder, this is not your product."
"I really liked it at first until my daughter accidentally connected the waist clip upside down (why this is even able to happen is beyond me, should make one way grooves...) and I tried for a good hour with a screw driver to get it unstuck.  In the end I had to break the clip...Aside from that it is a nice bag with many pockets.  Could fit a full size camera and 3 lenses no problem."
I have tried to get used to this bag for more than a month. It is so awkward to use. You can't just swing it over your shoulder and go. The straps are located in weird places. I thought it was more of a backpack. I fo not recommend it.
"If you have a small aps-c mirrorless camera, (like my Sony A6400) it's gonna move around quite a bit. I needed something slightly bigger than what I have to carry some of my gear. This kinda fits the bill but also doesn't feel great. The dividers kind of suck. They can only be placed in specific locations where there IS velcro attachment points, and they don't feel as if they attach securely. Not to mention there is no real sense of rigidity, and things feel like they move around quite a bit when walking around. My biggest complaint about this bag would be the dividers to be honest. The rest of the bag feels good but the dividers are where they really cut cost it seems. I do love that the top compartment is completely seperate from the bottom."
"I have ordered this bag in Deep Teal (teal outside with blue interior) twice and each time they've sent me Storm Green (dark green outside with orange interior). It's incredibly frustrating because it seems like a well made bag and looks like it would suit my equipment well. But I hate the color and for $40 I don't want to be carrying around an ugly camera bag, even if it is well made."
The quality seemed  good. Just made to strap around a more petite or small waist or chest area.
"This sling bag use left shoulder only. If you used to use the right side or both shoulders, it may be very uncomfortable. Returning it."
Got this bag for my husband's birthday and he finds it a bit confusing all the compartments other than that it gets the job done.
"Bag arrived a couple days ago. Just got around to taking it out of the packaging. Looks like it could be a nice bag but the stitching is bad in a couple of spots. Since other reviews showing faulting stitching and tearing on a few uses, I'm going to send this back. Never got to use it and won't trust it to hold thousands of dollars worth of equipment.Two of the photos are very minor but the worse is the one that holds the straps. It's worse in person than what the pic shows."
Not the best looking. One of the longer straps broke. Good storage though lots of pockets. Can fit a big body full frame. Hard to fit a zoom lens in the other compartment. Does the job for me
"I love the size bag and all the compartments, but the color is not wine red like the photo portrays. It is more like a red in general, unless they shipped me the wrong one, but this is not the color I ordered or the photo communicated."
"Sling bags are great, but this one isn't. It's not sturdy and has very minimal places to put dividers. Additionally, the Lowerpro 250 sling has more space for gear, while remaining the same relative size.This bag is fine for like 2-3 months, and then it starts to fall apart."
I purchased this bag in hopes of having an easy way to hold my camera and lens while on a trip.  The bag looked descent but had issues most notably that the clasp broke on the main component. This made it near impossible to remove anything.  The only other issue I had was that the bag kept wanting to slide off.  Maybe it was just how I was holding it.Proper construction in other areas and may be good for the amateur photographer.
"The bag is ok. Pretty good, actually. But the strap.. it's too stiff, and padded. And all the mini straps. And it's right shoulder specific. I mean, what the heck! When I think of 'sling', I think of EASE OF USE. Grab it and throw it over a shoulder, EITHER SHOULDER. This is like a backpack with one strap."
Took awhile to figure out how to use the design of pulling it around front to remove camera. Like that feature. Is great to be able to access the camera or lenes without having to take bag off and set it down. Nice bag over all. Only complaint is that the camera compartment is really deep so is too big for the camera and detachable separators don’t attach in a way to fix this issue.
Wish I could return it. I am 5’6 female and it’s way too big and Awkward. Probably ok for a taller person. The bag is too big and the straps are not comfortable and don’t sit right
Great product bit the stitching for the zipper came out after two days causing the zipper to get stuck.
"Now I understand why they just showed the pic of woman with her backside showing.  The buckle placement isn't flattering or comfortable for me, it's in the front and under/ over the breast area."
I'm right handed and this bag is hard to handle. Wish it was strapped on the other side...
"I was super hopeful that this would be the camera bag I was searching for. I loved the color, size and spacing for multiple camera lenses, etc. However, the shoulder strap was just not comfortable at all and rubbed against my neck. After wearing it around the house with my gear for a just a couple minutes, I could tell it wasn't balanced right, but the way the strap is positioned I couldn't change it. I can't imagine wearing it for a long session or wedding. Returned it and still looking for the perfect bag!"
I love that this fits all of my lenses and accessories. I cannot figure out the belt wrap around and how it's supposed to fit. When I do put it on its super awkward!
Small. I have a black magic 6k and it hardly fits. Not enough pocket space. Has interchangeable dividers but it is velcro and dose not hold. It also is only one way to create dividers.  You can't customize pockets to really fit personal needs. The sling on it is uncomfortable. Makes it feel as if you are carrying extra luggage rather then an accessory.
"Nice backpack for minimal carry. Body, 3 lens and assorted items.Left sholder carry only. I didn't consider this qhen I bought.  Left handed and always carry on right sholder. So awkward for me"
"I am sorry I really can't give a true review of this product.  I was looking for a back to fulfill a certain need.  Sorry to say this did not do it, so I returned it."
"Not sure why I bought this bag.  Simply horrible design.  Be careful when using this bag.  It just feels like your camera is going to fall out.  Only remove your camera when you place it on a flat surface and away from the edge.  Still feels like my camera is going to fall out even on the table. You can’t take out your camera on the move.  It good for storing your camera, meaning you put it in the bag and not move it.  Just get a normal top loading camera bag.  I’m pissed off that I’m out of my return window.  I would return it twice if I could."
"I purchased this camera bag for carrying my camera and one lens while traveling. The return window closed before my first usage. The handle ripped on the FIRST use. Fortunately I noticed it before the bag fell and broke my camera. I’ve submitted a claim to Mosiso but have not heard back from them. Even with a replacement, I will not feel comfortable that the bag is secure enough to protect my camera. I would strongly recommend against purchasing this bag."
I have only used this a few times outside of my house.  the seam around where the camera is stored ripped the first time I used it.
