These have so little actual bass that I am shocked. The Evos were way better because they had actual bass with the haptic vibration. The ANC 2's have the vibration without the bass. It makes the listening experience so empty. The actual music note of the bass is lost. Go with the Sony Ult 2.
After the return policy ended the left headphone started rattling because the shaker is coming loose. Very annoying. When that wasn‚Äôt happening they were awesome and I never went above wit the shaker normally at 20%. I can‚Äôt imagine how bad it would be if I did them at 80%
Pretty good very loud and pretty good sound quality  and they feel very good and look very clean
"I'm a bass head, but there's too many compromises with this one.Cons: very heavy, bass response is slow snd muddy, not very comfortable.Pros: it has a lot of bass.."
"I have two different models of Skullcandy headphones that I like so I was confident buying these but I was so wrong. These are literally the worst headphones I've ever purchased. What was Skullcandy thinking?If you listen to anything with even moderate bass these headphones, even at moderate volumes, completely break up and distort the bass in ways that's beyond unpleasant. I get they wanted to provide a deep bass enhancement but it's a total fail 98% of the time. Even the other Skullcandy models are WAY better than these headphones. So it's not like I'm bashing the company just their poor choice to make these horrible headphones I doubt anyone will ever like beyond sponsored reviews."
I had the original crushers and they were great for the gym. These‚Ä¶ not so much. Bass is great obviously but any slight sweat and this things will slide right off your head. Even something as simple as looking down or laying down on a bench and they slide right off. Kinda useless unfortunately. First gen held on great.
"For the price you would expect more these are the lowest end claiming to be high end‚Ä¶ the ‚Äúbass‚Äù they make is crude quality even with equalizer is poor, they are weighted weird and fall of your head all the time and are uncomfortable‚Ä¶ I have an old pair of Bose quiet comfort and will be sticking with those‚Ä¶ save the time and forget this brand entirely"
Bass stopped working after a week the regular sound isnt bad but thats not what i bought them for......
I am a new user to noise canceling and am in desperate need of blocking out as much noise as possible. This was one of the brands recommended to me. The result? I still hear everything. The sounds are lower but I still hear everything. There is a subtle different between simply wearing them and wearing them with ANC on.  The noises I am trying to block out? My Humidifier running. My heater running. Lawn mowers down the street. The dishwasher. And I can't even get that much.Disappointed.
I‚Äôm writing this review because I ordered ANC 2 but got Crusher Evos. I got this during the prime day deals at a good price so I figured why not!? I tried the ANC 2‚Äôs on in Bestbuy and they sounded absolutely amazing! I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about them because the Bass was great. I‚Äôm very sad I didn‚Äôt get what I ordered and now have to do extra driving around to return the wrong product. I hope I don‚Äôt get the wrong product again. If the right product comes the 2nd time around I will change my review. Please don‚Äôt let this happen again.
"The main and only reason I chose to go with the Crusher Anc2s when I was just replacing ny Hesh Ancs that I lost is bc these had a hard case included, but to my surprise when I got them there was no hard case included!!!I got them for travel purposes so the travel bag, as nice as it is was not at all what I wanted or expected, even the photos in the reviews include the hard case, so idk what‚Äôs wrong with my order but I did not like it one bit, now idk what to do bc I don‚Äôt want to have to return them and wait for them to get here again and see if they now include the hard case or not, I just want my hard case!"
The one star has to do with the delays on shipping by Skullcandy and the horrible communication from both Skullcandy and UPS.
"Did not like them at all, don't waste your money"
What a disappointment - NOT AS GOOD AS THE CRUSHER EVO.  voice control only working when phone is on.  Lots of trouble with bluetooth connections - have to keep resetting to factory settings.  bass control is very poor max - 80%.  No way to advance from one song to next on device...Buy the older model instead.  Sending mine back...
They are too heavy and my neck gets sore wearing them
"They worked well for about 2 days and then randomly broke and wouldn‚Äôt turn on or charge.  When I returned them they are only giving me a credit for $220, but I paid $246.09 (this is before shipping).  When I questioned them about it they did not respond.  In addition, they will not give me a refund but are only offering a credit.  This is ridiculous, do not purchase."
Returning item has lots of static in the background returning It.
"Found a good startup for the kids. Quality was good , but it didn't have those Mids and highs like I wanted. Definitely doesn't have no bass. Good starter for the kids.That's what I said."
These are awful... the original Crusher Wireless Headphones are the best in my personal opinion.The wheel SUCKS over the original slider and the AI lady is ALWAYS talking whenever you do ANYTHING.WHY?!
"coming from sony wh1000 xm 5, the noise cancelling on these headphones is non existence.  bass vibration is good on bass heavy music. but, sometimes haptics bass will ruin the music listening experience"
"I did really love these headphones when I first got them, but it becomes more clear to me over time how the bass over compensates for the audio quality. The bass is great, makes ur ears tingle and honestly can be too much some times. Great for the gym. But if you‚Äôre using these headphones for anything more than to feel hype to lift or run, I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily recommend these. I prefer the ‚Äúcrispness‚Äù of my AirPods compared to these, but these do beat out AirPods on bass by 1000%."
"Coming from the crusher Evo's after 4 years of use. I'm not sure if I've just gotten used to it, but they are just alright headphones, nothing to write home about. The sound quality is what you'd expect from Skullcandy the ANC is subpar for the price, and every. Single. Time. You turn it on you hear ""battery percentage, connected and voice controls off"" a good 10 to 20 seconds before you can actually use it. They fit alright. 3 starts cuz it's just not worth the price, one star has been removed due to inconvenience when trying to connect it to something and another star has been removed because of the lack of comfort."
I took very good care of these and were broken quickly.  Need to find another more sturdy version.
"For the most part..the noise canceling is solid..clarity solid..the issue here is the bass.. it sounds as if the speakers can't handle the thump.. so it's sounds distorted or like it's in the trunk of a car..if u don't use the bass or if u have it around 75%..then you are fine..also why not add replacement ear muff covers..imagine what these will look like in 3yrs..5yrs..7yrs...oh wait..u don't want them to have longevity? That's my struggle..the original pair..outstanding..but the ear muffs are torn..ripped & messy..üíØ battery life great,voice control kinda choppy..& I have to scream or talk loud to use it..not necessary for these..as far as forward/replaying songs..head phones don't have that capability..so the device needs to be nearby..now they can pause a song..or pickup/hangup a call.. but difficult if your hand are full or wet..or u can get to your device to replay or fast forward a song..imo..too pricey..doesn't meet the minimum needs..should just get original version...sounds way better..more head phone commands..& minimum device commands..should be 100$.. with no ear muff replacement..these will last 3yrs before the cushions ripped or sagg.."
Lasted 8 months. Never dropped once.
"These may not make it half-way through the warranty period...  Amazon may accept your return and replace them (if the product still exists or isn't sold out), but if you try to get Skull Candy to provide warranty service (or repair them) be ready to be disappointed. Customer support has been trained to be rude, cite the warranty return agreement - which does NOT protect the consumer - and generally prevent you from getting a supported product (you might get half of the purchase price back in a credit code to buy MORE skull candy). They will not repair them.  The warranty agreement says if you send them in, they're not yours anymore, and you'll get what skull candy thinks you deserve, which won't be what you actually do and or expect.  Buy JBL, Beats, Bose, Sennheiser or anything else.  Stay away from skull candy."
"The Amazon app says the item was delivered, but that is a total lie. I was forced to drive to 3 different United States Post Office facilities, including a warehouse, to get the package. The product itself is OK, but not worth the price."
Anc is very bad bass is just 2 much not natural Again pass on this 1 Just evo
"Please buy the skullcandy crusher evo‚Äôs instead of this one! The noise canceling is terrible and with the bass of the evo‚Äôs I hear just as little. The bass is also way worse, I almost can‚Äôt feel it and the maximum bass on this one is like 20% of the evo‚Äôs. The stay aware mode doesn‚Äôt do much either. Not to mention the evo‚Äôs are also way cheaper, especially second-hand.If you really want the noise canceling and stay aware mode I recommend the AirPods Max. I haven‚Äôt had many headphones but the noise canceling and stay aware mode on them is a 10/10 for me."
I love these. Definitely got me dancing. The bass is off the charts. My only problem is i dont think i‚Äôd be able to use it in public as others can hear whatever you‚Äôre listening to and i think people wouldn‚Äôt like that. Its not a quiet headphone. Might have to return it.I need something i can use on the bus without disturbing others
The noise cancelling don't work properly I can still hear my surroundings and it doesn't seem real like the sound quality is okay but ANC is TerribleEverything else works
"Great Bass, however I found the noise-cancelling to be sub-par at best, much worse than the Sony and JBL"
"I am no proffessional audiophile, however i have had my fair share within the audio community. I write this review whilst also owning a pair of Crusher Evos, in terms of the headset speakers, i have to say the ANC 2s are very loud but however they lack in the sound quality, the treble is too high which causes a canstant high pitched wining when no music is played and an enhancement of any music being played to emaphasise the pitch, making the music sound sqeaky as if you had a pair of tweeters being overpowered causing them to produce a high pitch distortion sound, this sound is unpleasant and causes my ears to hurt as i really did expect allot from these headphones. Next is the vibrating speakers, also known as the sensory bass woofers whithin the headphone. The woofers are good and loud, however they lack defition and fullness, by this i mean they are tuned to only output a certain low pass frequency which is just about 30hz but under 60hz, this means any other frequency of the music that is being played cannot be felt or heard through the woofer this makes it so the high bass and mid bass notes cannot be hit, which is what you want when listening to different types of genres. For examples the mid bass in a drum cannot be felt or heard well, the only music that is good for this headphone is the type of music that has a digital bass note created. In general only buy these if you want crazy loud music with an unbalanced sound and a very high pitched tone that makes any female singers nearly sound like the chipmunks. But please do read other reviews, i am just a fussy person when it comes to music, and you may love these headphones, i do have to say they are quite comfortable. If comparing to the sound in a car these headphones are like the ported subs you get from Halfords with stock speakers, whereas you would want an upgraded speaker set and a deep playing sealed sub that hits all notes. This is all personal preference and my experience. Another problem i would like to add is the constant high pitch scratching sound in ANC mode and Awareness mode when no music is played, in these 2 modes the sound and the sonsory bass becomes way more distorted as if someone is scraping the headphones when its on full volume. I am leaving a 1 star review as i had really really had high hopes for this headphones after owning the evos i expected allot, but it turned out to be the total opposite and made me dislike the sound of the music i so passionate love to hear, due to its unblanced levels and uncontrollable sensory bass seetting for the low pass frequency."
"Firstly, getting the headphones connected was a hassle, had to try multiple times to get it to pair correctly, I just want to quickly go over all the good and bad, the good: Insane bass you _feel_, it doesn't sound good you just feel it, that's pretty much for the good. The bad, poor build quality, bad app, bad connectivity, noisy anc, bad transparency mode, bad microphone quality, AWFUL sound quality for the price. Pretty much sums it up."
"This product is good, but not great. I‚Äôve used these headphones for extremely heavy gaming and music listening use for about 4 months now so for someone who‚Äôs more casual at gaming it would be equivalent to more like 8-12 months use. I‚Äôve had a mixed experience with it. Out of the box the audio is extremely dull and pretty bad for the types of games I play which is a majority Apex Legends, Overwatch 2, other shooters and story games. If you want to be able to detect where people are solely based on audio these SUCK without configuration. Because of the horrible audio quality, I was forced to use razors programs like THX spatial and 7.1 surround sound which still suck and are locked behind a paywall although I‚Äôve already paid for the headphones (???). Anyways, with the free trial period code I was able to access these programs and use the pre made audio EQ settings for the games I played and honestly it still sucked but was much better than what was out of the box. Things were decent for about a month, I found decent EQ settings and managed but time for my trial ran out and I went back to having sucky headphone quality. Now, performance and immersion in games is very important to me and i decided to go out of my way and just use a separate equalizer which was EqualizerAPO with Peace. Luckily I was able to come across good premade settings based on this headset from autoeq.com with these settings the headphones were able to go from a 5 out of the box to a 8.9 which is pretty darn good! The audio quality is great with these EQ settings and I‚Äôm able to nearly perfectly detect where people are in games. It‚Äôs also really immersive for story games too!Now when it comes to build quality the headphones are pretty decent in that regard. When buying this I knew the headphone adjustment part would start to lose its hold after a while and they did however it‚Äôs really not that bad. I can still wear the headphones comfortably and the slip is not very noticeable but it is something I‚Äôve noticed. I‚Äôm pretty careful with my headset but these are pretty sturdy still. As long as you‚Äôre not slamming your headset around, dropping it constantly or trying to damage it purposely these hold up pretty well especially under heavy use.Overall, their headset IS GOOD but it takes customization to get it where you want. Don‚Äôt bother using razors programs because they suck and are locked behind a paywall. Simply install the equalizer which is pretty easy and use the pre made EQ settings from auto EQ.com and boom. Great quality experience for low price.Although these headphones aren‚Äôt good out the box it‚Äôs important to keep in mind most headphones under 100$ are not good out the box. Don‚Äôt let that deter you from buying this headset. It‚Äôs still a good headset and if I was on a budget and wanted something decent still, I‚Äôd still consider theseü´°"
"I had really high hopes for this headset due to reviews. But this set unfortunately lasted even less time than the super cheap ones I was replacing them with. I bought this set in mid July 2024. And they started crapping out just before December 2024. I can only hear out of one ear. I am not hard on my accessories, and treat them nicely. So I cannot see why this would happen, other than faulty wiring. When I first got them, they were pretty decent. The ears were a bit uncomfortable for me, compared to other headsets. But I cannot afford to keep replacing headsets every couple months. So I will be looking for a new brand."
"So first off the sound quality is excellent, however i was told that my actual mic quality was fine, sounded the same if not slightly worse than my cheap amazon headset i got for 18$, so keep that in mind. But i was surprised after a casual gaming session of like 2.5 - 3 hours, my ears were sore. I was honestly shocked at how much it was hurting after my first session with them on.Im gonna give it a couple more session to see if i can get used to it, but so far, not super impressed."
"They sound good and worked right out of the box on my Xbox series s but these are not noise cancelling at all, I can hear everything going on around me. The fit is ok, but they make an annoying creaking sound from the materials shifting around when I move my head. I haven't had them long enough to really test the mic, but it seems to work fine for voice activated gaming. I'm not sure if I will keep them or look for another headset with better noise cancelling and doesn't creak when I move."
These headphones are very comfortable and very light weight to the point where you forget that you have them on. They have a very clean sleek design but has some issues with the cables. After like 5-6 months the left side went dead outta nowhere but only works when I wrap something around that top to keep the wire tight. Other than that issue these headphones are amazing but the durability is pretty iffy. Hope this helps!
"These headphones are average in every way. The sound quality is OK, nothing special. They are fairly sturdy but feel like cheap plastic otherwise. They fit OK but do not feel like a top of the line product. I think they are overpriced. Packaging and shipping was well done and fast. Downloading the software was easy enough. Setup was OK also. I wish these were plug and play."
"I don‚Äôt know if I received a ‚Äúdefective‚Äù set or what, but for my Xbox - even with the headset volume turned all the way up, Xbox audio settings at max, and in-game audio maxed in Options, it‚Äôs still very quiet. Disappointing - but everything else is great. Fit, noise cancelling, mic quality. Probably would‚Äôve been a 5/5 otherwise."
"EDIT: Customer Service contacted me and they are sending us a replacement!!!! Hopefully this one will have better quality. ü§ûüèªBought this headset for a birthday gift. After just 4 weeks of use, the wires started coming out of the cord. Since it was outside of the return policy for Amazon, we contacted Razer for support as there is a 2 year limited warranty on the headset. To our surprise, they are NOT repairing or replacing them! They are stating that it is not covered by the limited warranty beacuse it falls under an exclusion. Per their website this is what it says, ""Exclusions and Limitations: This Limited Warranty does not cover cosmetic damage, minor cosmetic abnormalities and normal wear and tear, including without limitation scratches, dents, discoloration and tears in the head pillow, seat cushion, PU leather, Armrest and stiches of the upholstery."" The wires coming out of the cord should not be ""normal"" wear and tear for a product that has only been used for a month, and it is definitely not just cosmetic damage. We are extremely disappointed with their customer service and have a very disappointed teenager. üòí"
I have a fan and a laptop cooling pad in my room - this headset picks up every little bit of it. My friends complain all the time. It's really annoying.Fairly comfortable though and otherwise works fine...
"good headset for its price, after 1 week (and 5 days) the mic arm got weak and lose. its an okay mic for beginners, but you can diffenetly find better for the same price or less"
"I'm not an audiophile and don't need perfect headphones but I am a gamer who also works from home and likes to listen to music. I don't really care about quality being exemplary as long as I can hear what I need to hear. I previously had a cheap pair of $20 headphones that lasted years; the build quality wasn't that good and my previous headphones' strap started to break around my huge head but they continued to work fantastically long past falling apart and being duct taped together, which probably shows how easily satisfied I am and how I'll put up with whateverUpon buying these I immediately had the problem where it picks up an echo of my computer's volume in voice calls. I couldn't figure out why for the life of me and most solutions I looked for just pointed to my computer being the issue, but my last headphones didn't have this problem. I have to keep myself muted except when speaking in voice calls or I echo everything.That was at least tolerable but now after only 5 months they're starting to give out. Certain kinds of audio in music I listen to causes obnoxious buzzing or static sounds and there are certain songs I cannot listen to with these headphones. Listening to them from my phone set on my desk has better audio quality.I'm an adult who works from home. The headphones stay in my workspace and are set on my desk when I'm not there. They're not roughly handled at all and there's no excuse for them to be failing so soon."
"Good quality sound, good material, comfortable. Thats being said, the maximum volume is way too silent. Completely ruins it. Not to mention virtually no noise cancellation."
Overall the quality and build feels sorta cheap but the price you pay is what you get I guess. Unfortunately I do have an issue with the built in microphone picking up my game audio which is pretty annoying since I don't really play with a high volume. Other than that the sound quality is alright and the cushioning is pretty comfy.
"Sound quality itself is pretty decent, mic quality is okay. Not really any gripes with those aspects. Main issue I have is the manufacturing material/quality. I've only had the headset for six months and the cord has already built up so much tension that the wire ripped through the cord material in multiple areas. I have to unplug the headset and untwist about once a week to get the tension out of the cord and prevent further damage. The cord material just feels really cheap. On top of that, my mute button has already started to not work on occasion. The headset has a whole just feels cheaply made, which I suppose is to be expected for the price. If you're looking for good sound for cheap this is an option but be aware that you will need to take extra precautions to not damage this very fragile product."
"Pros: established gaming company. Solid overall sound. Has an attached mic. Comfortable on head for long play sessions. Secondary wire offers both increased length as well as separate mic/audio plugs when using with a pc rather than a console controller.Cons: the mic is average at best, but because the headphones bleed a lot of noise the mic will constantly pick up those sounds. Maybe I listen to my FPS game volume too loud but that‚Äôs my preference to hear footsteps and enemy movement. But it‚Äôs difficult to do that when even with my my mic sensitivity turned way way way down my teammates constantly hear game noise through my mic or echoes of their own voices when they‚Äôre trying to communicate. I‚Äôve used better headphones in this price point and am really overall let down by the mic performance.That all being said IF you are going to use these on PC and you have a stand alone mic that may do a better job of noise cancellation of be further away from you than this one then you may really enjoy the overall sound profile here."
"The headphones were okay and the surround sound application worked alright enough, but it was definitely a lot worse than I thought it would be.The audio quality, compared to other headsets of a similar price, is garbage. Even with their surround sound software, it wasn't even giving proper surround sound feedback.The fact that you need to register your headphones with a legitimate Razer account was the biggest nail in the coffin for me. All of this just for a crappy set of headphones that I replaced within a month. The replacement pair cost me a few dollars less than this one and yet works far better in terms of actual quality.All in all, decent quality and feels good. But compared to other headsets you can buy for a similar or cheaper price, it falls short, which is amplified by the use of its third party surround sound software."
"The primary issue I had was that the microphone (or the adapter for USB to my computer) never allowed for clear audio. To get any semblance of usable audio, I had to ""eat"" the microphone, which (while a nuisance all its own) was near impossible because the microphone did not stretch close enough and I had to disposition the headset over my left year. Then, of course, terrible 'Splosives and distortions would arise as my voice ranged causing further issues with audio.Then, the download process to register and get the software that coincides with the product was overly complex. By the end of it, I felt that my ""account"" with this company was more secure than my banking credentials simply because of the several, back-and forth, steps required just to download and link their software. All in all, that part of the process felt like a huge ""give us all your data"" business initiative that did little to serve me, the customer.Otherwise, fit and feel seemed decent and had the microphone worked for what I would have needed, I suspect I would have used these for a long time, learning along the way more what I did and did not like to make my next purchase.Overall, would not recommend, but your mileage will likely vary. This whole review is likely the result of a single defect in what is an otherwise acceptable product. Had I spent more or the company not been efficient in accepting my return, I would be far more disappointed than a simple: ""buyer beware"" and a ""Company, use this as a learning experience.""I haven't written them off completely, but would likely go with another brand in the future."
"When this headset is actually working, it sounds great. Unfortunately, the audio cuts out constantly if the jack gets turned even just slightly. I tested it on multiple Xbox controllers and had issues on each one, so I called their customer support line (because the chat feature on the website is a button that doesn't do anything), and they claimed they would be sending me an email so I could upload video proof and escalate the claim. They never sent the email, then closed my case. I had to call back and open a new case and give them all of my information again, and at this point it's been too long to just return it through Amazon and forget the whole thing.I highly recommend buying a different headset, not from Razer."
Normally Razer is a high quality brand but this product fell short of my expectations. It arrived in the right package and looks fine the only problem is that the mic is quiet and sometimes turns off completely. I have tried everything possible but it still won't work. My son asked his friends and and they said that it was quiet and sometimes stops working. But when it works it works fine if you are lucky it is a good budget headset. I will also mention that it is pretty bulky and does not look that good. But it also has a VERY long cable and I mean VERY LONG it is like 9ft or 3meters with the extension cord and about 3 ft without the cord.
"I like these headphones except for the fact that less than 9 months after buying them one of the ear pads has already fallen off.But for the <9 months I've had them, I've appreciated the comfort, performance, mic, and even the length of the cord.However, since comfort was a huge selling point for me (and they really are comfortable for me - I've experienced no headphone-induced ear fatigue), and the ear pad has already completely detatched after a relatively short period being used as desk headphones, I can't justify more than 3 stars."
"The headset is very small. Painfully tight on the sides of the head and causing jaw aches for a slightly large head. Non rotating ear cups and dull sound on the 3.5mm style. Using a USB DAC from a competitor made them sound far better and fixed the following problems.The headphones fed back into the microphone feed, which could be a computer problem on my part. The microphone also only output on the right channel.This is an acceptable starter headset for a younger or smaller person, and the USB version is likely much superior, unless you have a USB to 3.5mm adapter from another product."
"Edited : see bottom for explanation. Well typically i chalk up headsets to one of those things that will usually last a while but unfortunately these broke just after the customary return time allowed by amazon. No option for product replacement at this point as far as i can tell. The mic stopped working and no matter what I did I could not get it to work. I tried several different options on connection and after flipping to my cheap work headset realized that its just flat broken.Side note, they are comfortable.Also side note, they suck at noise cancellation and the overall sound is pathetic and garbled. Lesson learned - spend more and give something other than razer a shot.Edited as of 6-24-24Gambled talking to Razer, got the warranty through them working. That was a headache, shipped them back to razer, new headsets work so much better."
"I use it for casual gaming. The sound via USB is  inferior to 3.5mm in terms of depth, quality and detail of sound in the game."
"I ordered this February 5, 2024. This headset worked great for a while, was shipped and delivered fast, no complaints there.  It is now November and the left ear piece intermittently cuts out, you have to wiggle the wire to get it to work quite often.  I haven't had this product a year.  2 stars, 1 because it has quit working like it is supposed too in less than a year, and  at least1 for the shipping which I had no complaints about."
"For the money, there are more comparable and better looking pairs available. I wouldn‚Äôt buy these again"
"The audio is good. Nothing to write home about, however the mic does not really really work. I recommend going with one that connects to USB. A lot of people seem to have written complaints about the mic not connecting online. As someone who just needs to listen to audio, it's good. As a person who wishes to use it in games and to talk to people, it's pretty bad."
"The audio is great, the mic quality isn't to great, I'd say use the headset for audio and get a usb mic for talking, and idk why I see everyone saying the microphone stops working, I had this same headset for like 5 years and never had a issue, then I got a new one two months and still no issue, and tbh people are also complaining about it not fitting properly, it's probably just them not the headset, also I recommend using this for console not pc"
This material didn't suit my taste. It hurt my ears.
"Sound was way too low until I activated the 7.1 Surround Sound, which was a pain in the ass cause I kept getting errors trying to retrieve my Razer Account. It's Stupid you need an account and login to even do this and a registration code to use the surround sound.  I bought the Headphones, I shouldn't need to sign into your stupid apps to get what I paid for so you can data mine me. Sound quality is just okay. I expected it to be better than my logitech 20-30 set but I think its worse. I don't use the MIC so can't say anything about that. They are definitely comfortable so far and lightweight. They seem to be too bassy, and not enough clarity, but I'm not an audiophile. The Price was reasonable at 50."
"I bought it on sale after my Corsairs broke after around 2 years of daily work use for $45, overall the mic quality, general construction and sound was pretty decent considering that price so I would give it a 8/10, there wasn't any peeling or degradation like most headsets after a few months but the reason this headset gets such a low score from me is the cord, specifically the cord sleeve..First off I want to mention this seems to be only an issue with the model I got, the one that comes with the green polymer cords sleeve. I've owned several wired headsets in the past from Razer and other brands and none of them have been like this they are normally braided metal or rubber this cord sleeve was textured rubber I haven't seen on any other Razer model.Out of the box the cord wanted to tangle and collapse in on itself no matter how many times I would try to untangle it it kept wrapping back up on itself even before wearing it.Then once I started wearing it the tangling got even worse, daily I would untangle it but the cord sleeve  was twisting not the ""cable"" itself meaning no matter how I straightened /untangled the cord out the sleeve would make it twist back up on itself almost immediately.4 months later It has stopped working it its entirety, if this model was wireless at this price point I would genuinely give it 5 stars. But the daily fighting with the cord, having to stretch it back out and eventually it just stopping working completely due to that makes this a 1 star product."
"These sound great, fit great, and were great till the plug melted. Hoping to get a replacement at least."
"They are good, really comfortable, the mic is good, the only thing is that the volume is not high enough, you can hear perfectly but is not that loud."
"First off, these are NOT noise cancelling headphones, so there's nothing to discuss in that regard. But they are not sold as such, and I wouldn't every expect to get noise cancellation at this price point. However, having said that, these do a solid job of insulating against external noise. Much more than I thought they would.Sound quality is OK. I find these headphones do a good job when gaming on my xbox. People I play with say my voice sounds good, so I have to rate the microphone as good. However, since there is no signal from the mic sent back to the ear pieces, I'm always worried about how they sound. I would not purchase another pair of headphones without having mic mixed back into what I hear.Listening to music is another thing... these headphones sound too muddy for my tastes when listening to music. They lack definition in the upper mid range, and I wouldn't rate the base response better than just OK.But they do fit well, and are comfortable to wear. One rather stupid design choice is that the volume control knob on the left ear cover adjusts backwards to convention. You have to turn it counter-clockwise to increase the volume. Everything else I've ever used whether home stereos, car steroes, recording decks, professional mixing consoles, my previous headphones... they all follow the convention of clockwise to increase volume, counter-clockwise to decrease volume. Go figure.However, the sound is rather muddy for listening to music."
"When I bought this headset, I was looking for:- Comfortable fit over the ears for extended playing sessions- Decent audio quality- A way to talk without other people getting echo from my micI got the first 2 but not the third. Somehow the mic on the headset is picking up sounds that the headset itself produces. Like the sound isn't contained within the ear covers/pads; it's leaking out and the mic picks it up. People I game with complain about hearing echo from my mic because of this. I'm forced to turn down the volume to the point that I can barely hear them so that they don't get echo. Normally voice chat applications (like Discord) will remove echo like this for you, but if you're playing a game with in-game audio (such as Lethal Company or Content Warning), you can't rely on that.If anyone knows a solution to this, I'd love to hear it. Otherwise, I'm probably going to buy a different headset."
"Does this headset cancel out noise? yes. Is it good for gaming? yes. Does the quality of sound suck? Yes. The headset is comfortable, but the sound quality is not good. Plus, the 7.1 surround sound? You have to pay for the subscription to make the quality of sound much better and even then it still isn't the best. Not super impressed with this headset, but when I connect it to my xbox is sounds fire. So there is that I suppose. This will just be a temporary headset now."
"I don't even know where to start, so I just made a list:- The default audio is incredibly tinny, and everything sounds far away- Want to switch to 7.1 to see if it solves this? Cool, register your device, Google around for the 7.1 app, install that app, create an account, log in, set up 2FA, and turn on 7.1- 7.1 does not solve either issue- Spend an hour looking on Google and Reddit to see how others have fixed this- Find out that Razer wants you to spend $19.99 for the THX Spatial Audio - Surround Sound Application software, which is literally just a diver and a simple EQ dashboard to edit the sound- Don't want to pay that? Don't worry, you will get constant Razer notifications in Windows asking you to buy it anyway- After you get enough pop-up notifications, you will eventually get one offering the software for 50% off! The value!- Did you get suckered into buying this software? Congratulations, it's trash. Three knobs that don't fix the problem- Want to download the Synapse 3 or Beta EQ adjusters that Razer provides for free? Sorry, those only work with the Blackshark V2 or V2 PROs, not the V2 X model -- you're stuck buying extra software- But wait, there's more! The mic doesn't work! That's right, folks, go through all this and we will throw in a mic that is never recognized, a common issue reported on Razor's forums and is never responded to, and the only potential fix is to uninstall the pre-loaded mic driver and reinstall it (results may vary; some conditions may apply; please consult your manual for instructions on which sacrificial rituals to perform for the angry storm gods who decide if this fix works; repeating these steps numerous times may be required before results are effectively produced)Absolute joke. Do not buy. You would be better off buying a few thousand miles of copper wire, burying it encased in conduit under the contiguous United States, and attaching tin cans to each end to talk with your friends than you will be if you try to use these headphones."
"I have a cat, like most Americans. I bought this hoping it would be something different but like every product my cat wanted to bite it. She playfully bit it once and penetrated the cord, the lack of options left me with a broken wire which I can‚Äôt disconnect from the headset. I wish for $50 they would consider protecting the most vulnerable part of the headset!PS I understand it‚Äôs easy to think it‚Äôs my issue. But every cat owner knows how sneaky they are, and how they just pounce out of nowhere, I will be getting a pet protected cord cover next time thanks to this experience."
"I bought this back in May and it worked great...... for about 6 months.  For no apparent reason, my mic just stopped working.  I could still hear. I have paid less for headsets that have lasted longer than this one."
"You can't use the 7.1 features without ""activating"" it. You can't activate it without removing an ear cover to get to the serial #. You can't activate it without downloading their Adware that boots up every time you start your PC. You can't use the adware without signing up for an account on their website. The adware tries to upsell you the ""THX SPATIAL AUDIO"" without telling you what that is or how it differs from qh. I'm sick of buying hardware that doesn't just work by plugging it in. I specifically got the 3.5mm model so I didn't have to deal with stuff like this. I'm never buying a Razer product again."
"First off the heaphones work. The sound quality is good, and the design sleek. But i got some gripes that are keeping me from loving these. First off, these things need to be adjusted constantly. The side of the headphone with the wire attached constanly drags the headphone size adjustment down causing ur headphone slip and slide. Its very frustrating. Also with that side of the headphone slipping down,  the earpiece drags on my ear causing minor irritation. They are comfortable for awhile but really need more forgiving ear pieces. Another weird thing is you have to do multiple steps to have the headphones produce 7.1 surround....why is that not just apart of the the headphones already. Overall, I was expecting more quality and a better designed UX from a bigger pc gaming brand."
I purchased the usb 3.0 model and instead received 3.5mm jack model and on top of that the mic quality is absolutely terrible.The sound quality of the headset itself is extremely good but the mic quality sounds like an early 2000s T-pain song with the amount of robotic distortion it has.
"I had a HyperX Cloud Stinger before this, so my opinion is comparing this Razor headset to the Cloud Stinger. The Razor headset's sound quality is lower. The Sound cancellation is worse (I can hear my keyboard typing more loudly). The headset is not as adjustable. My ears hurt after wearing these for 20 minutes. The only plus seems to be that the microphone is more crisp (friend opinion). For the price in comparison, I would rather use the Cloud Stinger for sound quality as I am not talking to the people as often as I am using the headset for listening to music or watching Youtube."
"I had high expectations for the Razer BlackShark V2 X Gaming Headset due to its 7.1 Surround Sound and Razer's reputation for quality gaming gear. However, my experience with these headphones has been quite disappointing.First and foremost, the audio quality falls short of what I anticipated. The 7.1 Surround Sound feature is underwhelming and doesn't provide the immersive experience I was hoping for. The sound feels somewhat flat, lacking the depth and clarity I've come to expect from gaming headsets in this price range.The build quality is another area of concern. The headset feels flimsy and less durable than I'd expect from Razer. The materials used don't exude the premium feel that Razer is known for. Adjusting the headband and ear cups feels awkward, and the fit isn't as comfortable as I had hoped. After prolonged gaming sessions, I found myself needing to take breaks to alleviate discomfort.The microphone quality is passable, but it's not outstanding. While it picks up my voice adequately, the sound reproduction lacks the crispness and clarity I would have liked, making communication during online gaming less enjoyable.Additionally, the headset lacks the premium cushioning I've experienced with other Razer headsets. The ear cups feel somewhat rigid and don't provide the level of comfort needed for extended wear. This has become a significant drawback during longer gaming sessions.Setting up the headset was straightforward, but the overall experience didn't match the price point. It's clear that corners have been cut in terms of both audio and build quality. When comparing the BlackShark V2 X to other options on the market, I believe there are better alternatives available."
"Coming from a pair of $150 Sony headphones and a garbage desk mic, this pair of headphones is a mixed bag. The microphone works well enough, though it picks up my breathing and my voice, never just my voice. It is quite comfortable, being extremely lightweight, and having nice, large over-the-ear cushions. However, this headset suffers from poor sound quality. When I first got this, everything sounded hollow and/or tinny. I've gotten more used to the poorer speaker quality since, but I wouldn't use this outside of casual use. Anyone looking for something remotely professional or for a competitive headset needs to look elsewhere. And for $50, I feel a little ripped off. The packaging and quality of the materials is very nice, but I cant recommend this for the price. I haven't tried other headsets in the price range, so this could be better, but I have my doubts.Pros:Nice, lightweight designVery comfortable, even for someone with a large head like meVolume knob and mic mute buttons are on the left earpiece, not on the cord (my personal preference)It uses an analog 2.5mm headset jack, and comes with a splitter for separate mic and headphones jacks for your computer.Cons:Poor speaker quality7.1 Surround from downloaded Razer software doesn't really do anything when you've got speakers that can't do stereo well.Mic picks up breathing (though not so much on external sounds)The cord is the weirdest cord I've ever had. It tries to bunch itself up and tie itself in knots, and won't stay straight. It's not even a coil-style stretchy cord. This alone makes me not like it."
"First things first, the packaging is not too bad. It comes with the splitter for PC use, which is fairly important.  The headset also comes with a nice carrying case, but since the headphones do not fold, it is not very travel friendly.Upon opening the box, the first thing you'll notice is a ONE TIME USE CODE for the 7.1 surround sound software.  I read another review that said the software sucks, but I thought to myself, ""Who uses the software for a basic mic anyway?""  I went ahead to install the software and found out exactly what the other reviewer meant.  The sound stuttered no matter what I did, no matter what application I was using.  In fact, it rendered the sound useless as if I was lagging.  I'm on a Ryzen 3950x with a RTX 2080ti with 64GB RAM, and nothing ever lags on this system.  I tried to troubleshoot it a few times, but the only way to fix the sound was to uninstall the software.  Before uninstalling, I restarted the computer to see if it makes a difference - nope.  Restarted the computer, and found that I was no longer able to reinstall the software.So I went ahead and played Destiny 2 with this headset, and found that this headset literally has no bass.  It might be great for hearing footsteps at max volume, which surprisingly, was not very loud.  The mic sounds tinny and muffled, as per my game mates, and worst of all, these ear pads are EXTREMELY hot.  The way that the headphones seal to provide noise cancellation, which can't filter out the fans in my background, leaves your ears extremely hot after even just a few minutes of gaming.I have tested a bunch of $30-50 gaming headsets, and I'm honestly not sure if this would be a great purchase for real gamers."
"I purchased these headphones only after watching reviews from several well known audiophile youtubers. They've all stated these have amazing sound quality, mic quality, etc.When my headphones arrived, I was so excited to use them for the first time; and let me tell youThe microphone is absolutely HORRENDOUS. Using it over discord, garry's mod, any other multiplayer game with voice was awful. Either nobody could decipher what was being said or they'd mock the quality of the microphone. Sure, it sounds alright in audacity, but that doesn't mean it will sound good in games with poor VOIP coded in.Second, you REQUIRE other Razer apps such as Surround 7.1 for headphones (by Razer) just for an okay at best sound. Everything was muffled or low quality until I set up and installed the app. Even then, sound was very drowned out and bass was just off the levels.Honestly, if I could just return these I would, but I'm sure it's been too long since my purchase to do so.If you're looking for a nice headset, or even just headphones, I'd recommend spending the extra $50 and getting something higher end from Razer, or even just going with some nice SkullCandy headphones for a full sound with bass adjustment."
"I wish I loved these things. They‚Äôre nearly perfect aside from the biggest selling point, sound quality. More on this later.I love the aviator-like build and the functionality of going wired makes them super lightweight. The ear cups are spacious and the foam is thick and soft, much more so than my $230 Astro A30‚Äôs. If you find your ears cramped in smaller models, HyperX Cloud stinger core, Astro A10-30, these will be a comfortable option. Ease of use gets 5 stars for plug and play usability and from what I‚Äôve seen, universal compatibility between systems.For $50 these are incredibly comfortable and will accomplish everything you wish from a modestly priced, well built wired headset.Immersion is where these fall short. 3D surround is adequate for good peripherals but the bass and lows are nonexistent. I‚Äôm by no means an audiophile, but these just lacked the feedback I desire from a headset. I must also say I‚Äôm a bit biased as I picked up a pair of A30‚Äôs for half price today and the bass and immersion is next level, to be expected for over 4x the price. If you don‚Äôt need immersion and just want a super comfortable headset with great compatibility these most likely won‚Äôt disappoint!"
"Pros-Great sound when surround sound mode is on- Extremely comfortableCons- The mic quality is absolutely trash.  Its about 5% as loud as my other microphone.  Even when turned up to 200% on discord people cannot hear me.  I have to buy another mic.  This appears to be a common issue online- You need to register your product on the razer website to be able to use it properly - and they want you to pay additional fees for more settings- Activation is buggy and may require call to tech support-Razer software is cumbersome to work with, there is dozens of razer apps that you may need to download and itsOverall, this headset has really great sound the surround sound is truly impressive but the drawbacks of having a mic that barely functions.  As well as having to call into tech support to turn your headset on for the first time lower the overall score for me.  I will be ordering a different headset and using this one as an emergency backup."
They had good sound quality but lack the ability to hear yourself speak (side tone).  I returned them and bough Corsair HS80‚Äôs.
"UPDATE:  After 2 months I've replaced this headset because of how uncomfortable it is and knocked it down to 1-star.  The older model (std. V2), which I use for work, is more comfortable but still causes some paint and irritation after a few hours, but this headset is so uncomfortable I can't even use it.Many years ago I purchased the original Razer Blackshark.  It was heavy, it was clunky, it had no mute button....but it was amazing.  The top strap was metal and could lock via screws, the mic boom could also be locked down, it was comfortable and sat in the same place every single time, and it sounded great.  It was such a good headset that after mine eventually died from the cable coming loose I bought a second one and used that one until the same cable came loose.  I probably got 6 or 7 years out of the original Blackshark and I've been looking for the same quality ever since.When I picked up a work-from-home job in late 2020 I found the Blackshark V2 and ordered it on the spot.  I immediately saw some issues:  It shifts around on my head, the ear cups slide around on their adjustment device, it sits too close to my ears to be comfortable.  Eventually  became so worn out that it no longer had enough friction to hold the ear cups up and would just slide down the side of my head through the day.The V2 X has more of the same, but worse.  After three years with the first ""V2"" model, this ""X"" version is noticeably less comfortable.  After about 30 minutes ears start to hurt around the edges and I have to move the ear cups so they sit *on* my ears instead of around them.  After about 30 minutes of that I have to switch back because of the pressure on my ears, rinse and repeat until I leave the computer.  Sound is still good, the mic is clear, but it's extremely uncomfortable.  In fact, I prefer the older headset even if it's not comfortable in its own right."
"This headset is okay but has a lot of flaws. The mic quality is pretty low and there's no way to edit the gain or sound quality because these headphones don't work with Razer Synapse. The sound quality of the earcups as well is pretty poor, very tinny, and has almost no soundscape. They're a good backup pair to use when my wireless headset dies though, but I gotta speak up loud, or else no one can hear me during calls."
"The covering for the wires keep twisting into weird positions, and the internal wires got damaged. Mic doesn't work after a couples months of use."
The surround sound is good but the audio volume does not adjust to full volume on my PS5.
"I'm very mixed about this headset, and I've gone through about 3 of these headsets. The volume dial seems to get ""broken"" after barely any use, and this has happened every time. If you max the volume the left ear will cut out and it seems to randomly lower the max volume over time. I swear the headset sounds way quieter compared to when I first bought it. But I'm mixed because everything else about the headset seems great. The sound quality is amazing and so is the mic quality, but I cant get over how it seems purposefully designed to break after a while. But for the price it seems worth it? that's up to you."
"Foam pads fall off constantly. Decent headset, but a pain in the butt to put the foam cushions all of the time."
My boys are avid gamers. They have these headsets. They like the mute and volume controls on the earpiece. They said they are really comfortable compared to other brands they‚Äôve tried. The only thing w we‚Äôve noticed is that the mic always goes out at about the 6 month mark for us. But we continue to buy them.
When I opened the packaged  immediately saw damage to the box as shown in the photos. When I got the headset out of the box they looked fine. I went an plugged them in to my PC and immediately had issues with the mic. The headset comes with a regular jack and an jack adapter for two that let's you use the mic. Both did not work for the mic. I sounded staticy and not clear. I ended up having to use my old headset USB to jack adapter to make the mic work as intended. Overall I'd say these are very nice headphones but you need to buy the USB to Jack adapter for best results.
Read a ton of reviews and I‚Äôm pretty disappointed with this headset. I‚Äôve used turtle beaches and hyperx. The quality of the plastic feels pretty cheap and it smells like a pool liner. The sound quality is noticeably worse than my hyperx clouds. Submitting a return.
"Here is the deal, the sound quality is a total 5 out of 5...but our issue is it constantly disconnects from the controller that it is plugged into.  We have not that had that issue with any other headset. We have checked the connection to the controller and it is fine.  It is not even 3 months old.  It got pretty good reviews too, not sure if we just received a faulty one.  :-(  Bummer too, like I stated, the sound quality and head set are great."
Pro: the sound is decent quality especially for the budget and I love that it is available in pinkCons: I have tried adjusting and messing with the settings but the mic is just so low. All of my discord pals have trouble hearing me
Both of my sons received a pair for Christmas and both were very happy with the sound quality. The one set broke within a month which was disappointing.  The other set seems to be fine so it might be hit or miss.
"So as Headsets go in the price range, its not bad. I actually think its one of the better ones. The Noise Cancellation is good to. to the point I can barley hear myself talking into the mic. Now the mic is rather poor. It always reads as really quite in games, discord, or even in the Xbox app. It works, I just wish I knew of a way to turn up the mic outside of the standard in windows or in games themselves. It really does feel like there should be a dial somewhere for it.Now the customer support has been pretty bad. The 7.1 surround sound requires an app to use. now the app requires a code to log into. that code comes with your headphones but mine was missing it. I contacted support about a week ago and it has been difficult to move forward with the case at all. Now I don't blame the customer support staff because its obvious they are following a script. The problem comes from that script not being very effective. for example, I was asked for my razer ID and product number, so I game it to them. then 2 emails later, I was asked for them again by a different person. and so on and so forth. It has been this all week. I'm making progress but its slow and frustrating.Now this is just a side note and not really a point for the review. Making a core part of an item you are selling and advertising locked behind a code is pretty anti consumer. If I were to ever sell these headphones, even if they are 7.1 Surround Sound in the actual title, They would not be able to use the advertised feature. Like guys, its a software for your headphones, you dont need a code."
"After a 6-8 weeks, there was a problem with the USB receiver.  Would have to log out & restart everything I needed to use it.  Became more of a pain to make work, I just bought another headset.  Would be great to get help on this from the insurance I paid for."
"I ordered the green one for my son. Got the pink one. Tried to pair it to his Xbox, and it doesn't pair. It does however work when plugged into his remote control."
Poor connection. Sound kept breaking up. Cord length was okay. Lots of static.
"Soo if you want to just plug and use this device with 7.1 surround it's impossible to do it, first you have to find product id , code on device ""Took me  1 hour"" then need to create razer account with your personal info, upload invoice that you paid for , where you live and so on, after registration you get activation code on email , after that you need to download 7.1 software insert code but Guess what You need to pay More money for software to get controll over Surround control, Syas that i have 7.1 sound but it's not there after all those steps STILL NOTHING HOLY COW ,Update , 7.1 driver literally ruined windows , chrome and some game are not launching after installing that driver lovely ...."
prepare to spend 15-30 min putting on the ear muffs when they pop off the plastic over & over again. most annoying thing ever
"The box arrived damaged from shipping, which was interestingly foreboding of what was to come. The packaging itself was quite nice with a pull tab on the box's seal to allow you to easily open it as well as a ribbon to lift the lid. Having issues lifting lids carefully, I do appreciate the design that went into the box and the packaging itself. Everything inside the box had it's own nice padding, which I felt was a wonderful touch considering how roughly the box itself was handled, and there were no issues with the headset physically.After removing the packaging I put the headset on and wanted to adjust it to fit me. This is where the first major issue arose: the headset is not adjustable. Call me a bit naive to assume a gaming headset would be adjustable, but the fit was very tight and the ear-cups could barely make a seal around the bottoms of my ears. Prolonged gaming with this would have been quite uncomfortable with the pressure the headband was giving me trying to squeeze this thing on my head.So I shrugged and plugged the headset in and tuned into a livestream of one of my favorite streamers. This is not at all how they sound like. Just to be sure something wasn't wrong, I plugged in my cheap gas station earbuds, and the streamer sounded clear again. Just once more, I plugged the Razer BlackShark V2 X back into my computer and put on one of my favorite songs. This headset did not last more than 5 minutes out of the box before it was back in the box and my return initiated. I feel cheated by the positive reviews on this product, which convinced me to give Razer another chance, but I was proven once again that the quality of their products is only form over function."
"The headphone droops off the thin wire leaving you to constantly readjust it. The noise canceling is decent actually but you cant hear your own voice. The audio is decent, the bass is decent, i got these headphones for $40 and would never pay more. Should be sold for $30 tbh, oh it is comfortable by the way, very plush, light and soft"
Bought it ‚Äúnew‚Äù but it seems used
"The audio end of things works quite well, but microphone will not pick anything up.Skip it."
Got it for a PS5 but it wouldn't connect to controller and if it did it would only do so when connected in certain positions. I got it replaced and the new one has same problem. Works fine with PC and other devices. Very comfortable otherwise.
"This is meant purely for gaming, if you want to stream content and listen to deep good quality audio, this is not the device. But for the gaming and its mic quality, solid option and its price undersells it."
"The comfort level was way below previously owned Razer headsets. Very tight and led to heat buildup. Also, volume had to be all the way up to hear xbox game sound. The color was cool, though."
It was too much pressure for my head and the sound was really echoey and poor. The only good thing about this was that it was cute in my opinion.
"Headset requires driver downloads, firmware updates and product registration with the setup of a Razor account just to get the code to use on the app that you have to download... Not plug and play at all and Im having a problem with the mic working in game"
"Speakers sound quality - $10 maximum, bad. I really don't like it,But mic is pritty good.Took them for the good sound of the speakers... disappointment"
"The cord is permanently affixed to the headset itself, so should the wire ever die it's a cooked goose. Which is exactly what happened when I caught my cat gnawing on it. That's obviously not the fault of the manufacturer, of course. But I've had similarly cheap headsets with braided wire cords hold up for years of similar abuse.Also, the cheap wire must be totally unsheilded, as it picks up interference from my phone's ac adapter, a couple feet away."
Ive had this now for a year and its good. Sometimes ppl struggle to hear me. Thats the only bad thing about it.
"I looked at allot of reviews and videos for this headset before i bought it because i really wanted something to help locate where people where in game on my ps4. I am now convinced that all those videos were paid for because this is horrible. They all stresses that you can tell where people are based on sound and claimed it sounds soo good but i would not buy this again. The sound quality is not any better than an ordinary samsung headset that i GOT FREE when i bought my phone. I have to have the volume maxed out because i cant hear anything unless it is. The sound quality sucks. They boast about triforce 50mm drivers for spatial awarness but its basically non existent. I cant tell if there are people left or right or above or below, i can just tell that they are close, which defeats the entire purpose of getting this. The only good thing about this is the mic. I am honestly so upset i wasted my cash on this because its no better than an ordinary headset. I thought ""maybe its just on console"" so i downloaded the 7.1 soround sound crap with their code that i got with it and guess what, it makes absolutely 0 difference its just as much trash on pc. I dont know if i just got a bad item but this is honestly trash. Dont waste your money on this item. Save a little more and get something that actually works! I cant even express how angry i am thay i wasted soo much time and money on this!!!"
This headset is very heavy and the ear muff extenders are metal close hanger wire
That's it really. Works well with sound on user end. Mic input just isn't good.
"Software is basically made to track people and for marketing purposes, useless annoying bloatware."
"Bad mic, very poor recording quality.  Not good for voice chat or gaming."
Not sure if something was wrong with the product but the mic was not working. Does it need additional cord for the mic because it just has the jack? But I ordered another USB one. They feel great on my head
"There‚Äôs nothing about these that should be praised. Nothing of value is held in the headphones. Absolute horrible sound quality, sound reduction is equivalent to cardboard, and they‚Äôre quiet. They‚Äôre just NO. WHERE. NEAR. WORTH. FOURTY DOLLARS USD. I could‚Äôve spent an additional 20% of the cost into another pair that would give me 70% in additional all around quality. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing now. Do not buy this adolescent item for anybody over the age of 12. Bc it is not made for adults. (Edit ‚Äî>) just looked too and noticed I paid the ‚Äúlow low price of $40!!‚Äù for these as they have them posted original price as $60. I paid $40. $40. And I feel robbed. These are certainly a price hike scam deal. The original price is $40 in a sensible world and getting these for a deal WOULD be a purchase worth shrugging off a lot more than $60. I‚Äôd dare even say that $25 is appropriate for these at a discounted price (being generous) But yknow, they‚Äôre originally priced at $60. You‚Äôll neeever see it at $60. Not once will you catch it at that price. As it will forever be an eye-catching deal, with an amazing slashed price of 33% off. And the shipping was somewhere between 7-9 days. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs the cherry on top. Let me know they suck in two days man. Don‚Äôt drag me a week+. Thank you for reading my rant. Do not buy these. Have a great day."
"Let me start by saying I‚Äôve been a Razer Product user for years, I love them and I will keep buying them. I recently bought this headset for my girlfriend who showed an interest in gaming and being a decent priced headset I bought it for her. The setup took‚Ä¶ I am not joking almost 2 hours, from trying to find product codes, verification codes and proof of purchase all to get a code via email to enter again. Once this was all done I thought it was over, but then when getting to the last audio driver it won‚Äôt detect the headset. I‚Äôm kinda disappointed because now I‚Äôm having to spend a lot more time with this than I hoped. Razer let me down on this product and all the accounts you have to setup and applications to install just to get an audio driver. In the end be prepared to spend more time than necessary just to get audio from the headset."
"Wrong color received,  headset is decent."
This is my second of these headsets and the second to have the 3.5mm jack break. The headset can't be beat for $40 which is why I rolled the dice on another after my first jack broke after maybe 6 months. My second one made it a day and a half before I picked it up off my bed to see the jack bent at a 45* angle. Absolutely ridiculous that a headset can't last longer than that because the jack is apparently made of glass. These would be 5 star headphones for the price if they wouldn't break instantly.
"I do not like the noise cancelation on the mic. It prevents my sentences from being picked up in general so I have to speak louder. Just a nuisance. The earphones are comfy, but after a year of use, the foam is peeling away. I haven't done anything extreme to them, I have never experienced this before with a headset.For the price it's fine I guess? I am not sure about the sound quality, it sure canceled out my family in the background for me, which is a bonus. The headset isn't too heavy in my opinion and sits comfortably on my ears. Usually, they hurt but this one has a reasonable cushion to it. As someone with a massive noggin, I am pleased by this. Finally, I like the flexible mic, I have had headsets without, and it does make a difference."
Worked great for about 3 months but then it started not connecting or sounding so staticky that I couldn‚Äôt even hear my game.  I keep having to make sure it‚Äôs plugged in at just the right angle or I can‚Äôt hear anything either. Convenient that this didn‚Äôt happen until the 3 month return window closed.
"Overall sound quality is sub par for the price, surround sound is distant but tolerable. The worst issue would be the microphone quality.  If you were planning to use the microphone, which is almost necessary as it is non detachable i would recommend avoiding this headset and instead lightly microwaving a potato and hooking it up to an aux cord as this would result in better audio quality for any unfortunate listeners. The only practical purpose for this headset is if your a masochist that enjoys being bullied for having a bad microphone."
Max volume isn't that loud.
"Just a heads up to anyone considering buying the USB version of this headset. (Or this headset all together, the same issue may be present on the 3.5mm version), whenever there is input/output going through this headset, there is consistently a high pitched buzzing sound audible the entire time. It is VERY noticeable and VERY irritating. If you are gaming with this where there are constant sounds coming through, you may not notice it. But if you use this for work or something else where the volume is low, you ARE going to notice. It makes this product absolutely unusable for me.It's a shame too because you can tell the sound quality is very very solid for the price and this headset is pretty light and comfortable."
"The cord is silicone or something rubber-like and it clings to things, like fabric, or my arm. The cord is stiff and doesn't fall loosely and it holds the shape (all the bends and curves) of when it was wound up for shipping, despite having it for a couple weeks now. The rest is well enough, but the cord is distracting and interferes with focus. Due to the cord alone, as it is that much of an issue, I would not purchase this again."
"The headphones themselves are fine. very comfortable, fit over the ears well, very light, sound quality is good and probably as good as itll get for 60 ish dollars. Unsure about the microphone since I use a condenser anyways. They sounded a little quiet while i was using the splitter but fine when plugged into the jack directly.Razer's software is ass though. they give you a code to download their surround sound to ""unlock the full potential of the headphones."" 10 minutes after downloading the drivers my PC gave me a bluescreen error and force restarted itself on the bootup menu. I just force shut off my computer and then uninstalled the surround sound, its been fine since. Other people have said they've had issues with that so be careful if you're looking for some super fancy EQ software that comes with it. its $30 extra for any of the cool stuff anyways.the headphones themselves are good for the price as long as you just use them for what they are"
bought these back in 2021 and they are good but you get what you pay for like the mic for example its decent but i had to not only have it on 100% loudness in windows but boost it by 10db just for people to hear me also the cable is not only short but even after 2 years still wants to stay bent the way it was when i first got it lastly the volume slider on the headset broke instead of muting the sound when all the way down it will be down but still auditable but for $50 its still does well enough for me even after 2 years.
Lately I have noticed that the drivers for this device in the task manager consume almost 20% of the processor...
"Update 7/28/24 -- Everything below still applies and overall I still like them and use them every day. But, this has become pretty irritating: the ""connects to 2 devices simultaneously"" is only so-so. You don't have to unpair them from your computer to pair them to your phone- which is convenient. However, the headphones often ""forget"" what they were connected to, and you have to manually reconnect them (but not re-pair them) after powering them up. I also have noticed audio ""skipping"" sometimes if they're connected to my phone & Mac at the same time, so you ultimately have to disconnect the headphones from the second device anyway.These headphones have great sound quality: they aren't Bose quality- but I'd put them on par with some of Sony's mid-range products, which usually cost around 30-40% more. The bass is great, and they have a good overall range. The battery life is outstanding - I use these for appointments, committee meetings, phone calls, music, and podcasts. I'd say on average I use them about 2 hours per day, with noise-cancelling on that entire time, and I only charge them about every other week. They are also incredibly comfortable, with soft leather or leather-like ear pads and a padded band that goes over your head. Here are a few small complaints that keep it from being 5 stars: First, the time it takes to turn them on- it takes about 3s of holding the button to turn them on. Then, they make a ""whoosh"" sound effect, a sort of ""beep"" to let you know they are connected, and they announce the battery level. All of this takes about 8 seconds or so, which isn't long but enough to make you miss part of your podcast if you don't pause it before turning them on- not a big deal, but worth mentioning. Other reviews are correct about these not being for working out- the band and its padding are comfortable but slick. These would absolutely fall off during any exercise that involves bending forward or backward (e.g. sit-ups). They also get a little warm on your ears (not from the electronics, just the warmth of the padding/leather material), which also makes them less-ideal for working out. Lastly, I like that the voice says ""transparency,"" ""normal,"" or ""noise-cancelling"" when you change modes- but my GOD it's loud. A woman's voice will practically shout over your music or podcast to announce ""NOISE CANCELLING"" when you press the button. If the app let you adjust the voice volume, this would be a non-issue, so hopefully a future software update will fix this. These small complaints aside, I very much enjoy these and will one day upgrade to an Anker Soundcore set of water-resistant headphones."
Start up instructions were poor. Googled most things. It was hard to tell if the headphones were charged - these never did give a bright clear light showing they were charged or a green light when turned on. However they synched easily and provided good sound for the price.
"I was disappointed that the USB-C and AUX cable wasn't in the box, since it says on the box itself that they come with the headphones, but besides that the headphones work really well."
"Best aspect, they are comfortable. I've worn them for hours at a time working in the office and they don't irritate head/ears. The stock setting for sound is ""bass boost"". This is a poor setting. It makes music that has bass and lows already that are prominent, quite muddy. In the bass boost setting the driver(s) are pretty easily overdriven to give undesired distortion. If you download the app, you can turn this setting off, and it seems to clean things up pretty well.As for the noise canceling, which is the reason that I purchased these headphones (I have better headphones for enjoying music), I would say it seems to leave something to be desired. I work in a shared office space, and become easily distracted by chatter and office conversations by co-workers. A lot of the drowning or I would say average noises are quickly covered up, and minor conversations are as well. However, if someone is speaking loudly, this sound still cuts through pretty easily. Now I can turn up my white noise or music and cover up these louder noises, but this sometimes becomes a distraction within my own head when I am trying to do focused work. The noise canceling is better than the headphones I was using in the office, so I will give it that, and for the price I am still using them, which is why I would say that they ""do the job"", but there is some room for improvement.If I were to do it again, I would spend a bit more money to get some noise canceling that covered up more noise (which I have used in more expensive headphones previously)."
"Sound quality is okay, forget adjusting anything but transparency. You can hear the difference if you listen carefully.  Good for a couple hours comfort wise. It‚Äôs a decent low end can. Have heard better, but those were even less comfortable."
"I've had these for nine months, and for 8 1/2 of that they were exactly what I was looking for. The noise cancelling was excellent, occasionally I would have no sound or music playing at all and used them just as ear protection. The battery life on them blew me away, easily lasting me all day, about 8 hours to get to medium. I found the buttons to be simple and intuitive.Sadly, the honeymoon period has ended. The sound quality randomly distorts, which I fix by disconnecting and reconnecting. This only stops it from being a painful experience, as the sound is still inconsistent and not as clean as it was at the beginning. It disconnects from my devices on a whim. I don't know if I wore them out from using them for many hours everyday, which maybe accounts for the short lifespan. The battery life is still good, and they technically still function, if not at the peak it started at.Sound quality is crucial for me, so I will be replacing them soon. I think I will go with a more robust option next. That said, I don't regret this purchase, and for the price I bought them I feel like I got my money's worth."
I have both the 20 and 30 versions. I like the construction better on the 20 but the ear cups are smaller. My only dislike is that you get the hurting ear with the 20's. Sound and noising canceling are great on both. I have smaller ears too. YMMV.
"Simple review‚Ä¶sound quality is good, but they feel a little flimsy and the cushion that goes over the ear is thin compared to other headphones."
"I had bought these to replace an other budget brand that the mic had stopped working on and given the reviews and similar price point I thought I would give this brand a try. The do not work anywhere near as well as the other brand and do not have as many features. The noise canceling is not that great and when you connect the aux jack it shuts off. When I first got them I was annoyed by the quality but not enough to return them. It was a moth later on a long hall flight when I realized that the noise canceling shuts off when the aux jack is plugged in and had I known this earlier I would have returned them. During meetings, I have complaints from the mic picking up background noise that I did not have with the other brand. They are okay for the price, but there are better options out there for not much more."
"Solid construction, good battery life and noise canceling, adequate audio.Poor ergonomics: - The control buttons are tiny and very low profile, making it very hard for me to find them. I keep missing calls because I can't find the right button to push. - It's very hard to tell the left from right. I have to carefully feel around for the (tiny low profile) controls. Except in bright light, I cannot tell visually which way to wear it. - In the tiny instruction booklet the font is so small I need a magnifying glass to read anything. - An app is available, which supposedly allows some customization, but after requiring my email address and registration, I cannot find any useful function."
"Seems to lack mids and high frequencies, or bass is over done. If you like hip hop and rap these are for you.If you like jazz, country, etc. look elsewhere."
While listening to music it has amazing sound quality and while on the phone. Noise cancelling is not that good but it does block out a small amount of noise but not all noise
"Disappointed, these are not noise cancelling like advertised. You can hear everything just fine while its ""on"". These are comfortable but the music does not get very loud in them at all."
Bluetooth is awful. Turning it on and off it hard. They are decent with sound but definitely not what other people had reviews on.
Very comfortable and sound quality is ok. Battery Life is phenomenal.
"This is my second pair of Soundcore headphones that go over the ear. The AUX cord they sent in previous years was more substantial and sturdy than the new one. The new AUX cord is made of thin materials. When I replaced the AUX cord with one of my own, the cord has to be twisted into an optimal position to make the audio work.Yes, this is a bluetooth headset. But eventually, the battery will run out. The AUX system should be functional as a baseline.If you plan to take these on a long airplane flight, make sure you bring an extra AUX cord."
"This was a gift for a relative - they indicated the sound was good, but the ANC (automatic noice cancelation) allowed some ambient noise to penetrate the headphones, reducing the listening quality. Headphones were exchanged for a  different brand."
"The buttons on the side r difficult to manage without seeing them, takes some getting used to.Bluetooth setup wasn‚Äôt too difficult & once it‚Äôs done‚Ä¶connectivity is good. Haven‚Äôt had a real test of the Noise Cancelling & wi fi features, as I‚Äôve not taken this headphone on a plane yet. That will b the real test. Sound is decent‚Ä¶not as good as more expensive headphones of this type. However, I like how they fit all way over the ears & the headphone cups are deep. Yet they are rather lightweight. Batterry life on a charge is good, longer than most others & headphones fold well, pretty compact. Wish it came with a case though."
I like the sound and dislike the build quality. Have many Anker Products that I love. This product is just ok in my opinion!!!
Good overall headphones. I don't use the noise cancelling too often but on a plane they do a good job. My biggest gripe is that you cannot use them while charging. They just straight up turn off. If you turn them on they stop charging.
"I think the noise cancelling is pretty decent and the battery life seems good. I also like how you can control the EQ from an app, as well as how it has quiet beeps to tell you when it‚Äôs connected instead of a loud voice guide.However, the volume randomly becomes really low or it disconnects without me even pressing anything, and I can‚Äôt even be 10 feet away from the device it‚Äôs connected to without the audio glitching out and crackling. Disappointed. My $20 headphones from another brand have better connectivity and audio quality than these $80 ones.They‚Äôre also incredibly uncomfortable. I have a very small head and ears but they still barely fit over my ears and give me a headache as a result."
"I regularly used these headphones and loved the sound quality and noise cancellation. I would wear them on my weekly runs as well while training for a marathon. After only two months, the speaker in the left ear came loose and I could hear it bouncing around while I ran. The left ear stopped producing sound completely."
I really wanted to like these got them all set up and was super disappointed they sounded horrible. It's not the Bluetooth connection on my part I tried it on my phone and my msi laptop. I then tried plugging them in with the auxiliary cord and it was instantly better so that saved them. I wanted Bluetooth for convenience really but not a necessity so luckily I have some really long aux cords to use or I would have returned them. so if you need your headphones to have Bluetooth these are not for you
"The price is right. Comfortable enough. I bought these so I don‚Äôt feel so overwhelmed with noises, and these don‚Äôt really help there. I‚Äôve used them with NC on and off and they sound the same to me. Kinda disappointed."
After reading the reviews I was surprised that these actually don‚Äôt work all that great. Maybe I got a bad pair? I can‚Äôt really hear much out of them unless I turn it allllll the way up and one side is louder than the other. They also slip off my head easily.
"For the price (i got them on sale for $44) they are amazing honestly for all the features plus the app. The sound quality is a bit off though, it's not bad by any means but it isn't as sharp as some of the pricier ones.Would I pay the original $80 for these...no, but for $40, yea. Also great feature to connect to two devices at the same time, actually very helpful at airports when switching between iPad and phone.Also the look weird with the band, it sticks out quite far and looks kind of ridiculous. I will trying to update to a better pair soon."
"Got this with decent hopes. They sound okay...although no ""big bass"" like advertised. However, that wasn't what I was using them for. The first couple of days seemed fine, then all of a sudden the volume would change on its own. It would get louder and I would have to adjust it manually. Sending them back and looking for a better pair."
"The app makes the headphone versatile, and the multi device connection is very useful. But the headband seems to be tight & heavy even at its loosest setting."
"Thought they were gaming headphones. You can hear but can't talk, have to buy a different pair."
"Cups are rather small, maybe for small ears so these will rest on your ears rather around it."
"I really wanted to like these - the off-white color was nice, comfortable to wear, and lightweight though admittedly feel a little flimsy. The app is decent‚Ä¶when I could actually use it. Right out the gate I had connectivity problems with my phone. Half the time (tested later on multiple) devices couldn‚Äôt find it, would drop the connection if I stepped 3 feet away from my phone, and would cut the audio if I bent down. Then other times was perfect no issues. Tried every troubleshooting trick in the book, erased everything everywhere and did a factory reset‚Ä¶.same problems.It‚Äôs possible I just got a faulty pair, although more than a few reviews here seem have similar connectivity issues too, but with so many options other out there I‚Äôm just not interested in giving it another go with this product and will be returning."
"I bought them for the gym since my AirPods have started to hurt my ears (I have a lot of piercings lol)When I lay back, they slip off! They fit perfectly otherwise and I can‚Äôt tighten them. The noise canceling feature made me nauseous‚Ä¶turned it off (and the ambient setting too) and i still feel like my hearing is too muffled and making me nauseousUnfortunately will be returning, but i can see why it has so many great reviews, it‚Äôs amazing quality for the price!!"
they like to fall off my head easy
"I have been a fan since Soundcore released Q10, I really want to like this Q20i like my old Q20‚Ä¶. Unfortunately NO‚Ä¶.The recent product like q35, q45 just don‚Äôt have the original(2019 or so) sound signature profile anymore.¬†I remembered the wow factor from the Q10‚Äôs (but uncomfortable) sound quality, very heavy bass, clear mid and sharp high, and loud !!! Then Q20(very comfortable) but toned down than Q10, but still very competitive with heavy bass, clear mid and crisp high, not bose level but pretty nice for it's price range, weakness is volume, it's just not loud enough especially when ANC is on. Q20 has been my go to for the pass few yearsThe q35 have the worst ear cup, material is harder and have this liner touching your neck just NOT comfortable.Then now this new Q20i is a big let down comparing to original Q20. I was expecting the added EQ can make the sound more clean, may be bass down a bit and volume and be slightly louder.... However, sound is more muff in all ranges, low, mid and high, not as clean. Played a long time with EQ comparing to the original Q20, it's just bad.... what a disappointment. All soundcore have to do add max volume to Q20 and may be EQ on Q20i, why change something that worked well.Not Satisfied !"
"I liked the fit of this headset, and I liked the noise cancellation feature. But, the power button was not easy to find when on your head - not recessed enough to notice with your finger. This is also the button to answer a call if connected to your phone.The most significant issue - and the reason for the return - is the microphone has compatibility issues with Windows 10. I was using MS Teams for a video conference call and the mic would intermittently work and then stop working. I ran through all of the troubleshooting, but no solution. I also found some online forums that offered solutions to download a different driver instead of using the default Windows Bluetooth driver. It's not worth the effort, and there was no guarantee that would work. FWIW, my Bose headphones work fine with the default diver."
"Got these as a coping skill for a student - turns out the noise cancelling feature needs an app to function. For the price, that‚Äôs pretty disappointing."
These were a birthday present for a teen. One ear stopped working. Nothing we tried fixed it. Disappointed they only worked for 3-4 months.
"I own a lot of quality Anker products, so I assuming these headphones would be great.They are comfortable and function well.I just didn't like the sound. With the bass boost on, the sound seemed muffled. Without it on, the sound seemed tinny. You may like it. I just have never been a fan of deep bass.I went with the Edifier W820NB. To my ear, the sound was consistently better over high medium and low ranges.Hat tip to the guy who posted the vid about these two headphones."
Headphones do not allow for noise cancelling when plugged in - the noise cancelling turns off while plugged into TV units in headrest provided on airlines as well as other devices you may need to plug into. It does work correctly when using blue tooth connection. Blue tooth is the only way the noise cancelling works which is terrible not having the option to plug in.  This is a poor quality item - do not waste time - purchase a higher quality item from a more reputable brand.
"First off- the USB charging cord send with the headphones did not work--it wouldn't fit in the port far enough to charge. I had other cords here so was able to charge the device but wondered about quality issues right out of the box. The user manual is the worse I've seen--faint text, tiny diagrams and hard to read.  I was not able it to pair with either my iphone or ipad, though instructions said the blue tooth would connect automatically. No it didn't after several tries. But worse--the noise cancelling effect was minimal. There was absolutely no difference between ""normal"" and ""Noise cancelling."" I wanted head phones to mute airplane engine noise during 14 hour flights, but these headphones would be ineffective. I tested the noise cancelling ambient background noise first with a room air filter which is fairly noisy and then with a youtube video playing in the background on a computer that wasn't paired by blue tooth. It softened the noise but not significantly and there was no difference between the two settings:  normal or noise cancelling. Returned them for a refund."
"I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed with this purchase. I bought these headphones to replace my old pair, which had finally given out after years of use. I was excited to open the box and upgrade, but what I found was a major letdown. These headphones look worse than my old ones did after years of use. The ear pieces are stained, clearly showing signs of previous use, which I was not expecting. It‚Äôs frustrating to pay for what was supposed to be a new product only to receive something in worse condition than what I was replacing. I‚Äôm extremely dissatisfied with the quality and condition of these headphones."
The main reason I use noise cancelling headphones is so I can sleep. My husband does his bear imitation all night long right next to my ear. Noise canceling headphones have been the only (legal) solution. I decided to try this brand after reading the reviews. I haven‚Äôt had a good nights sleep since.The headphones actually reverberate with the vibrations from my husband‚Äôs snoring and it sounds like it‚Äôs coming from the headphones. Using the ANC mode did absolutely nothing.I‚Äôm writing this at 2am after angrily ordering a $200 pair of Beats headphones. Heaven help my husband if he complains about the price.
No volume control but ok for  podcasts or audiobooks. Pretty comfortable.
Sorry I have to returned. Don't buy.
"I already have the Q30 and I can undoubtedly say, the Q20i is the inferior (by a mile) product.  Turning to the left and the sound tends to cut out, Bluetooth range underwhelms, switching between two devices can be a pain and rarely does automatic pairing work.  Save your money get an upgrade because THIS ain't it.  Back to my Sony's & Q30."
"Comfortable, good feel, big enough to stay off my ears. Bluetooth worked really well. ANC worked ok with Bluetooth.However I need the ANC to work when wired. This is not the case. You have to turn the headphones on to use ANC, but as soon as I inserted the headphone wire it cut off, including ANC.I returned because of this. Customer service was great and I got a refund.If you don‚Äôt need to use ANC while wired these are good headphones to buy."
"I‚Äôve had this product for a week. The sound is good, connectivity/multi pairing is simple, light weight, good value, charges in a reasonable amount of time.  I do wish they had a tighter squeeze on my head, they want to slide of if I bend over, they are not the most sturdy feeling construction."
"I ordered these headphones 1 month ago as back up to keep in my car for my son who has autism. I charged them overnight and packed them up to use for the first time at a sporting event. They lasted maybe an hour. I took them home and charged them again. Second time, they wouldn‚Äôt even turn on. Charging seems to do nothing. The battery is dead on a brand new product.These are not worth the money."
I‚Äôd give these a 0 star if I could.These headphones randomly loose Bluetooth connection and power down even when fully charged. They also do not always connect with both speaker and microphone. Many times have to unpair device completely and repair for speaker functionality to work.I wish I wasn‚Äôt over the 30-day return policy on Amazon. I would return them.
"Seems like I am constantly having to recharge, usually same day. I do not use any extra features just straight using in meetings at work"
"Color: Really cuteSound: Not terrible, didn‚Äôt cancel any noice outNot worth the $70The cushion was soft though!"
Head set shuts off after 30 min. of use even though it's fully charged.
"Sound great, but plastic quality is not great on sliding parts."
"One of the most important functions of these headphones is noise cancelling... But, this one does not the cancel the noise well. My previous one from skullcandy worked perfectly well even in noisy places, but this one cannot..."
I‚Äôm very disappointed! These headphones are a dingy beige color and not the cute pearly white in the photo. Two different colored cords were in the box - one beige and one white.
"The right ear won‚Äôt connect to Bluetooth. If you reset it, it will work until you turn it off again and have to repeat the process. They sound very good but the connectivity is poor."
"The sound quality was good, the noise cancellation so-so. I would have kept them based on that. BUT the ears are so weird and small that they are the single most uncomfortable pair of over the ear headphones I have ever worn. I am touch sensitive and having to squash and fold my ears into these odd, tiny cups was an awful, wretched experience. I could not have kept these on for 5 minutes to save my won life. In the process of returning them."
the mic on this is terrible and makes everything sound muffled if you use it.
Red light would not stay on after 3 minutes. Tried different chargers...did not work

These worked for 2 months and 1 day. Then nothing!  Would not recommend.
after a 2 months of use stop working this is my 2nd unit with the same type of failure.
I returned it becasue the bass was overwhelming and the sound was muddy.  The Q35 was worth the extra $ to me.
"I bought these headphones in January 2024.  It's now October 2024.  Used the headphones on two (2) trips and they worked fine.  Now, after sitting in the closet since June 2024 the headset will not charge.  I've tried multiple USB connections and blocks.  Nothing.I sent this to the Seller.Seller was very fast to respond and sent me a replacement headphone, brand new.Same problem. Nothing charges these units.Props to the Seller but the product is just a paperweight. Actually, trash unless the Seller sends me a return shipping label."
I‚Äôve only had these for a few months and they‚Äôve already broken. I would like to think I‚Äôm not very rough at all with these headphones and I‚Äôve tried literally everything to get these to work. I would like to return them because they don‚Äôt work. They were nice while it lasted though
"I mean this isn‚Äôt really a sound issue so much as a build issue- I bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas on sale.WITHIN 24 HOURS, the fabric had ripped, and the left headphone stopped working entirely and eternally. I have seen similar fabric issues with other soundcore headphones but not until over a YEAR of long daily use. This was unbelievably bad. I don‚Äôt know what this ‚Äúq20i‚Äù series is, but avoid it.Obviously, my gf is quite disheartened her gift broke by the next day, leaving a bad taste in both of our mouths. Just stick with any of the other tried and true q20 or q30, these are just terrible."
"1. When connecting to my macbook, the audio is very choppy.2. When the audio jack is connected, the noise cancelling does not work."
"The audio is very low quality, I'm not able to use it for zoom meetings because nobody can hear me well."
"They connected fine to my phone.  But I really bought them for using on my pc.  The pc pairs with them but will not connect after a few seconds.  I reset, removed the phone pairing, changed drivers for bluetooth but I can get my Dell Inspiron to connect."
"I'm not a small person but have a narrow head. It slips when I bend forward or back. If I'm a littke sweaty at gym, it falls off.Some features deserve higher rating but since I can't use it, I have to give a 1. Sound, noise cancelling, and comfort are good. The mic is poor."
NC  not work properly
"I needed a new pair of over the ear headphones ‚Äî I‚Äôm replacing a pair of JBL over the ear headphones.I really like the sound of these, no complaints there ‚Äî but they sit on the ear. And they‚Äôre way too tall. I don‚Äôt have a small head and fully closed, they‚Äôre just not comfortable for long term wear. They pull my ears down and when I lift them up to where the ears feel comfortable, there‚Äôs about an inch of space between the top of my head and the headband.I just can‚Äôt see myself wearing these long term which is too bad because they really do produce nice sound ‚Äî especially for the price point."
will not charge out of box. are these a knock off or something. what a joke.
Pairing the headphones was a pain when using a long-range Bluetooth transmitter. The battery lasted only 13 months with daily use.
"Got these before a flight and didn't have time to look into the fine print.Noise cancelling doesn't work when you use the cable.. so like on a flight when you connect to the inflight entertainment. Very strange oversight. I don't get why they would do that.I've never been blown away by noise canceling technology. This is no exception. It doesn't take away the low rumble and it adds a bit of mid/high frequency noise that isn't there in the other two modes. Some noises come through.Pretty decent isolation though, so even without active noise cancelation they take down the ambient noise quiet a bit.I really hate these multi-purpose buttons. You have to remember what press, long press, double press, etc. all do for each of your devices. It's easy to forget or mix them up.They weren't expensive and the sound quality is decent. But they hurt my ears/head a little after wearing them for a bit, which doesn't happen with my ordinary headphones."
If you are traveling on an airline and you want to use the cabin's audio jack for airline provided entertainment you will not be able to activate this earphone's active noise cancelling feature.
I bought 2 pairs of these headphones on different occasions. BOTH pair of headphones stopped working less than 2 months in. Yes I bought a 2nd pair after the first one stopped working because so many people said they were quality. Amazon would not refund and when I contacted the company ‚Ä¶ no response. I don‚Äôt say this often ‚Ä¶ stay away.
Soundcore has numerous incidents of headbands breaking. It's just cheap and it's too bad cuz they sound great and have good features. But I am not buying soundcore anymore. If you can't make a quality product that won't break in the first 3 months I'm out.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            As I understand this is probably Soundcore's attempt to win the lower end of the market but... the problem is there's already very strong competition in there. Watch my review video to see the details.The most important feature of any headphone to me is the sound quality and... hence the ""Meh..."" in the title. It's just nothing to really write home about as far as this particular headphone goes. They sound ok. Just ok. Soundcore has a lot of fantastic products, this is just not one of those.Comfort is good, earcup pads are nice and soft, connectivity is great, app support is fantastic. Aesthetics and build quality are questionable, at best.IMHO there are better choices out there at this price point."
I bought these on sale and good thing I did. So I payed like 40 bucks and they feel great and they do cancel out noise ( granted I only used them at night in my room to watch shows ) BUT I only had them for 3 months Exactly and I used them last night and they‚Äôre starting to sound bad. Maybe I put the volume too loud but yea. Good but don‚Äôt last very long. Now I‚Äôm looking for more expensive headphones so they can last me longer then 3 months.. you get what you pay for
"not the best headphones, though they‚Äôre many, this is an overall okay headphone. sound quality is not the greatest. noise cancellation is not great but given that aspect it is comfortable to wear and affordable. rating - fair"
"Head is ok/good for listening songs watch videos but I got complaints from colleagues that I am not audible when I was using for teams call. Another drawback I found it will cause ear pain of used longer time as it covers ears. Bluetooth connectivity, weight all looks fine. Still feels it's not worth for the price point. This review is after one month usage."
"I really like Anker products and previously owned a pair of the Q30 headphones - which lasted a long time and were very good quality for the money. This time, I had a lower budget and decided to go with the model below. Unfortunately they're just not comparable. There are issues with the bluetooth randomly beeping and disconnecting mid-calls even when not triggered. Further, charging takes a lot longer (battery drains faster) and the quality of sound and feel of them is not as good (they feel weaker, cheaper and noise cancelling isn't very good - I often can't tell when it's on). I'm worried that as the return window has passed, the Bluetooth fault might continue to get worse and I won't be able to repair them and they'll simply have to be replaced. First Anker product I regret buying."
"I just got them today and they're really comfortable! But they do leak easily, I don't really listen to loud music, and even a calm song leaked at around 20% volume unfortunately. I got new ones because my old ones leaked really bad I had to use my tv in the background so my neighbours or family would hear my music from my headphones, but if I want my music any higher I think I'd have to do the same thing now."
"Great sound quality, good design overall. but loose on the head when working out - slide forward or backward when in the gym so I‚Äôve had to revert to my AirPods for gym use and keep these for desk use or transport only. Would like a IPX-65 rating for headphones in future - sweat and rainproof would be ideal would be happy paying more"
"Like: (i) Good sound quality. (ii) Audio of power level is voiced upon turning on the headset; ie power high, power medium, power low.Dislike: the power on/off button located between the volume rocker is awkward to find when wearing the headset, due to it being flat. It means removing the headset in order to turn on/off quickly."
"I bought these because I wanted a cheap option for drowning/tuning out my neighbours noisy B.S. and seem to work very well for me so far, not wanting to tempt fate, but I needed to really here from one of the noisy sods to test these headphones out, but not happened yet. ***UPDATE** I since had the opportunity to test from my noisy neighbour with the music blaring and once I put these Q20i's on, I was able to continue watching my TV in peace!Anyway, here's a review of my experience with these headphones so far, really loving the nice, punchy bass without drowning out the mids and treble sounds, really awesome in that department. Noise cancelling can reduce the bass, but negligible and sometimes depends on what you've linked them to. As I write this I'm using them with the ANC on and via my POCO phone with Dolby Atmos on and get awesome bass and sound levels on them. But bass reduction can be corrected setting yourself up a personalised EQ(s) settings in the app if needs be.The ANC works really well but can here noises, although more muffled and in the background, like the air fryer fan blowing from the kitchen (just watching a TV show tho wouldn't have heard owt with music on, but the headphones just switched on with no audio and traffic from the busy road out from my living room with windows open, just sounds like quiet, gentle waves lapping on the shore of a beach. But at least I only partially hear yapping dogs, chav-like neighbours and music other than my own now. Also, I can now watch a TV show or movie in peace now.The ANC seems to have deteriorated over the first few months, I have to close my windows during the summer whilst chavs are blowing there music out, so not so successful there. I suppose for the price you pay you get what you pay for. I guess I need to save up 2/300 quid to get total noise cancelling!!"
"Everything about the headphones is almost 10/10, from comfort to sound quality. Only issues I faced was the lack of built quality( a piece plastic broke tho it just fell from like 1.5-2 feet. And second the earcups- They lost its leather 80% in just under 10 months. Tho I use them like 12+ hours a day, i donnt if they should degrade this much, i take good care them as well like putting them in a headphone case as well."
These are a decent set of headphones for the price.. I do notice a plastic creaking sound when I'm walking.  And they feel a bit bulky.  I can't wear inner ear headphones due to small earlobes.These are ok until I can afford a decent pair
"Review After 3 Weeks Usage -Great sound - sound is perfectly balanced if you are a person who loves quality sound and not screamy high bass sound. I enjoy not so loud and clear sound. So, it's perfect from that perspective.Comfortable - ear cups are soft but the headset feels a bit heavy on head and you feel pressure on your ears as well head. So using more than 2 hours would make you uncomfortable."
"After using it for 3 weeks i wanted to review this product. If you want to buy a decent headset this would be okay but don't expect too much from this headset, connectivity is okay, music quality is fine but bass is not that much. Coming to calls, i hear lot of issues from other person telling the quality of call is not that much good and no noise cancellation."
"I had a couple of issues and the customer service was great. The cable was causing crackling in the left ear so they sent me a new one and there was an issue with the discount code where I was supposed to get a free charging cable that is micro USB and after contacting them they sent me one really quickly.The EQ is pretty good for listening to audible and changing the narrator a bit. It's not as detailed as you could get from VLC, but it still has a lot of options. The earphones are noise cancelling themselves by the fit.The noise cancelling button option also works with the app is not huge, I can still hear a bit people walking in the corridor through the wall and it won't completely block the dishwasher noises. As someone with certain frequencies that I'm hypersensitive to, the bass boosting option is pretty helpful, although it will not make the audio more monotone and the same pitch.The volume increasing suddenly in an audiobook I can't seem to do anything about.The starting lowest volume seems a bit too high for me and I can't seem to get that down or have a sort of middle value.overall they're pretty great not awesome but pretty great for my use.There is no way to monitor what the battery percentage is, which is a bit annoying.I haven't tested the microphone yet. For ¬£35 pretty good! No issues with Bluetooth on Linux laptop and Android phone."
Sound quality is loud and good but if you are bass lover like me don't buy it the bass is below average I return them on same day
Not satisfy boat is better than this
Sound is good but if you‚Äôre cycling it seems to catch the wind wrong and it‚Äôs all you can hearEdit - change the noise cancelling settings and they‚Äôre fine. User error
"Comfortable to wear, lasts a long while, but noise cancelling is not nearly as good as expected, does not do enough to help with sensory overload"
"I really liked these headphones! And they would've been perfect too if the sound quality was betterPros:These were my first anc headphones so i don't have much experience but it was solid in my opinion. It wasn't completely noise free but still did an okay job at blocking out noise.I loved the way the looked, the way they felt and the overall design! They were so comfortable, they weren't exaggeratedly bulky and they were pretty lightweight!Cons:The sound didn't feel deep or loud enough for me.At regular volume the headphones sounded like regular earphones. If the volume was increased then they started to feel like headphones but the sound wasn't crisp and the music would leak.They're plastic but its what I expected for the priceTo truly enjoy them as best as i could i had to mess with my EQ settings on spotify but even then it still it leaves a lot to be desired.They're pretty standard and solid headphones so I do recommend them! They get the job done"
"Build Quality fit and finish is A+ on these headphones. ANC is more than adequate and if this is your main reason for purchasing then by all means do get this. However, the sound quality is very underwhelming. Its very bland with hardly any highs, lows or mids to talk about. Its just bland which is dissapointing considering the build quality. The Beribes hybrid product is significantly better sounding with the same build quality in my opinion. However, if your sole reason for buying is the build quality, ANC and just okay sound then this is more than adequate"
Headphones not completely noise canceling - but ok for the price I bought . The sound isn‚Äôt the greatest but ok for the price
"Not very comfortable, at all."
"These headphones served as a quick, cheap replacement for a set I accidentally broke while between paychecks. They do have good sound and a long battery life but they also have a couple minor issues that make me want to get a better pair. Firstly, no bass boost. I enjoy heavy bass in the music I listen to and these don't really support that. Secondly, while the noise cancellation works it causes a wee bit of pressure when on and when I take the subway, it pops almost every time the train bumps (NYC, so the trains bump *a lot*). For me, the second issue is more annoying than the first. Can't complain too much cause this is kind of a 'get what you pay for' thing but I will be looking for something to replace these."
"Audio quality is great on its own, but when I went to mow lawn, the mower actually interfered with the headphones and i could hear the mower more than the music. Soundedike I was in a tunnel"
"It's a decent price so there's nothing to hate about headphones in this price range.Needed cheap headphones with decent audio for workouts as i sweat alot.Good noise canceling.Spatial separation is muddy on here.  General mushing of frequencies and no bass . But given it's price range,  it isn't that bad.I ordered the  Soundcore Anker Life Q20 Hybrid and got better sound quality for workout"
"Was so hyped to find these- the style is great and the sound is nice. They‚Äôre a lot bulkier and heavier than they look online, they feel sturdy and expensive. My biggest complaint is that they don‚Äôt seem great to go outside with. There‚Äôs some issue with the weight vs sound blocking because if it‚Äôs windy outside you‚Äôll hear more wind than music‚Ä¶ the wind hitting the headphones resembles being in a car with the window down. It‚Äôs so distracting I actually went home and left the headphones. So if you‚Äôre getting these for running outside, walking to work, etc. I‚Äôd reconsider. If they‚Äôre for walking around inside, they‚Äôre perfect. Good battery and sound, but the wind is really hard to get past."
"Tried these headphones because of their ANC function. Discovered that it's not good at all. It barely eliminates any noise except for on the low end. I can still hear people talking perfectly clearly at the same level whether the ANC is on or off. The sound quality is worse than headphones at the same price point so without the ANC function it really makes no sense to purchase these. Even though they were under $20, you can still find better value elsewhere."
"I took a risk to try this headphone based on at the time had very few reviews but had a great intro price, the sound quality is beautiful. However, wish it was a bit louder. I was using volume at the max, something you should be aware of. I‚Äôd give this a 2.5 star.It has great noise reduction I put that to the test. I‚Äôd give that a 4.5 star.Bass is decent about a 3.5 star.The comfort of the head phones it self I‚Äôd give a 4.5The fit of headphones I‚Äôd give a 4.0, however feels a bit losely built in quality a 3.0 starOverall a good product if you‚Äôre using laptop to listen to youtube etc or plane ride to drown out noise. I would have given it a 4 star but volume could of been a tad bit louder."
"Great noise canceling, but I bought two of these for my teens. The first one the cushion broke off the ear piece and I was able to stick it back on. The second one did the same thing only it wasn't fixable. I guess I got what I paid for. Now I have to find 2 others to try."
It linked easily with my laptop and did a very good job at noise cancellation but sound quality was poor.
"Cheap for the price, no so good isollation, but still a simple choise"
They're definitely great noise cancelling headphones but there's absolutely no bass in the headphones which kinda eliminated me buying them again and they do randomly disconnect too
"For the price:-the build quality is good-the controls are good-battery life is adequate-any ANC is a plusNeutral-the ear cups retain heat, which can make long listens uncomfortableCons include-ANC is very basic, and actually amplifies wind noise. That is my biggest complaint with these headphones"
Bought in March.  Heavy use from teenage son on PC gaming.  Ear cups have separated from the rest of the headphones.  Looks like they used cheap glue in only a few spots.  Probably going to re glue the plastic ring back on with super glue
"Can't clean or work out in these. They're comfortable but will not hold a charge. It's been charing for 1 hour now and will not get past 40%Connecting was not easy and I have connected hundreds of electronics on Bluetooth! Recently on a flight I was listening to someone's movie who somehow connected to my earphones!! Avoid these. Spend more get better. 2 star only for the noise cancelation, that was quality!!"
Not the best sound quality if you are into good sound. But for the price it‚Äôs fair
These are insanely pathetic. Crackling sound  week after I bought them in the left ear. Do not buy these ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
"Had them for 2 months, wont stay connected to my PC. My earbuds and my old Headphones did not have issues with disconnecting. Sound quality is good and battery life is ok, just won't stay connected."
"Noise cancelling function only works with bluetooth. With the 3.5mm directly plugged in to an mp3 player or other device the headphones revert to their ""off"" mode which is to say it becomes an inert set of headphones - no functions available.After pairing with bluetooth can push the ANC button and cycle thru the noise cancelling functions - on, off, pass thru mode. Then if you disconnect bluetooth can still cycle thru the noise cancelling functions by pushing the ANC button. Connect a 3.5mm jack and BOOM --> headphones are powered off. Only way to power them ""on"" is via bluetooth.Please note that this is not described anywhere that I can find in the functions description.Seems kinda silly to me to make headphones that work in this manner. Returning them.Sound was OK. Fit and comfort were OK, just can't use noise cancelling except with bluetooth."
"Full charge does not last long, good fit, good sound"
I ordered these headphones and the ear cushion fellOff. Very disappointing since the product return date has passed.
Not that great.
The headset was incomplete. Absolutely rubbish
Does not block out sound like I wanted. Music quality is nice and clear though.
randomly blasts my ears with high pitched white noise. very annoying and uncomfortable
"Constantly disconnected, doesn‚Äôt hold the charge, you have to keep pressing until eventually it turns back on or off. I want my money back."
"The audio quality is trash. When I make calls, no one can hear me. The charge lasts for only a few hours. And wow are they heavy! Save your coins and buy better headphones."
Return window closed a few days ago. Sad.
"continually disconnect unexpectedly from my phone, they go into transparency mode while on phone calls /while microphone is in use, and the last couple days they've started glitching where they show as connected but don't work, and when i try to turn them off, the red light comes on and just stays on.They're only about 6 weeks old."
"It lasted 2 months. Now it turns off when it wants to and makes weird pa interference sounds from time to time. Not sure what happened all of a sudden after a good run, but i wont buy this brand again. Also: the on/off needs a strangely long press & hold"
No matter how long or how many times I try to charge this it won‚Äôt turn on and connect to my phone. I‚Äôm returning this.
"As soon as I got the headphones out of the package, I instantly realized one ear cuff sounded different from the other. They did not have a complete seal, so I returned them immediately."
Broke after 4 months having it.
Item is very nice but does not work
Keeps disconnecting for no reason.This is the second pair I bought hoping it was only a problem with the 1st but it's aviously a problem with them all.Don't waste your money or your time.Just wow who makes this stuff and sells it knowing it doesn't work correctly.
bought this in april and before the end of july I am having reception issues. It is beyond the return date so i‚Äôm stuck. I won‚Äôt be buying this manufacturer again
Dead out of the box brand new. Nothing ever lit up & no sign of life
DONT INVEST! It ain‚Äôt no base in them. And the asc is just as trash these really like a 10$ product fr
Riding  in car with my daughter went over a bump  headphone cut off when they came back on the  sound was and is horrible waste of money
Not as loud as I thought they were.
I gave them a try. Sound wasn't good at all.  Oh well.
"Broke into pieces after one drop, just threw it away not worth it"
Usually when I start them they play an extremely high pitched ear piercing sound in the left side and I have to flick it a couple times and not move my head for a couple minutes. But hey that‚Äôs cheap headphones for you.
Couldn't get these to work.
I hate that its hard to turn it on or off.That usb port is not protected
"If you want a comfortable headset that's okay in gaming, by all means, get these. But I, like a majority of gamers, don't use my PC for just that, there's also movies, music, shows, all of which are heavily enhanced by good audio.I tried the Ngenuity software, maxed out the bass which was it's biggest weakness, and it was extremely underwhelming. I installed Equalizer APO on top of that, and pushed the bass as hard as I possibly could on top of Ngenuity already being maxed out, and it was still weaker than my previous headset was out of the box, the Logitech G Pro X.I was seeking a replacement for that, due to a plastic piece that broke on those, causing one of the ear cups to hang loose,  so I got the Cloud III's. I had a HyperX headset before, figured after all this time, anything at all from HyperX would be improved in general, but after seeing how underwhelming these were, I reassembled my previous headset as best I could, and held it together with duct tape. It sits on my head for now while I wait for the new Pro X's I bought instead to show up.I was against a direct replacement at first for those, but they sound better than any other I've tried. Shame since Logitechs software sucks, and Ngenuity is actually pretty alright, but HyperX hardware needs some serious work."
"The mic on these are prob. the best on the market, or one of the best on the market. However, the sound and volume leave much to be desired. My 10.00 headset is 2x as loud for example. If you want them louder you have to download and AMP and it then makes them sound very distorted. If you are looking for headset with a great mic, this is the one, but expect to struggle to hear whomever is on the others side."
"I really wanted this headset to be the one I chose. Its super comfortable and Im very picky about the comfort and fit, has a great wireless range, great battery life, connects just fine to the PS5 and has a removable mic. The one very important feature that prevents it from being perfect is the sound quality. It‚Äôs just not good enough. There‚Äôs basically zero bass, and the overall quality isn‚Äôt high enough, or clear enough. I hope this is changed in a future gen design, because then I will definitely buy and keep it. As of now, I had to unfortunately return it."
"Pros:-Amazing battery life (Can go up to a full week or more on a single charge with consistent daily gaming sessions)-Great controls, the buttons and scroll wheel on the earcups are very intuitive and easy to navigate without needing to look at them.-Detachable mic. For those who want a detachable mic, it's there and works well, but I wouldn't buy these just for that feature alone.-USB-C/A compatible dongle for near zero latency-Good build quality with decent clamping force-Acceptable mic quality-Device compatibilityCons:-Very shallow sound stage. While directionality is good for hearing footsteps, the general soundscape is very narrow and is very noticeable in large open areas that could benefit from a wide sound stage for immersion.- Tuning. The tuning is what you would expect from a gaming headphone, deep and punchy bass that comes at the cost of muddying the mids and loss of detail in the highs. This makes it difficult to work out dialogue in intense action scenes. If you want to use these headphones for anything other than gaming, I would not recommend you get them at all, as they wouldn't make for a pleasant music listening experience. Finally, there is custom software that has an EQ for altering the sound of the headphones, but the EQ itself is not very intuitive and lacks features.In general, if you're looking for wireless gaming headphone, this is a solid choice especially if you play a lot of shooter titles where you can really benefit from the punchy bass response. The great battery life is also a huge plus for those who want long uninterrupted gaming sessions without being tethered to a cord.For those who want a headphone that they use for both gaming and music listening, I would stray away from these. Their loss of detail in the mids and highs make for a restrictive listening experience."
"Background-I wear my headset for work and gaming. On average 12-16 hours a day. I'm careful with my headsets, no kids, and I typically lay them on my desk when not in use or hang from my chair arm by the headband. I like to remove the Mic when I'm not using it.Cons-Cheap plastic fiber braided cord. I purchased the Cloud III since the headset cord looked a little better in the images then what I have experienced with the Cloud II's. I struggled with the II's having horrible vibration noise from anything touching the headset cord anywhere above the control box. Anything touching the cord is easily heard in the left ear. The smallest contact with the cord is clearly heard. The connection to left ear looked sturdy in the photos. I was assuming the that meant it would help dampen the cord vibration HyperX decided was a good idea to introduce via the cheap plastic fiber braided cord which they started using with the II's and now III's. That annoyance is exactly the same with the III's.The audio with the Cloud III's is weirdly distant. I attempted every equalizer setting I could including custom settings, updated drivers, used audio boosters, and yet it sounded like the majority of audio was suppressed in some weird way, making most things sound quietly distant. The bass is subpar to the Cloud II's in a major way.There are no foam covers to swap out with the Cloud III headset. It's just the same ""leather"" they use on the headband. Which will last you maybe a year and a half at most before it breaks down and begins to peel. I often swapped the leather for foam with the I & II's depending on the seasons or how hot it was in my office.The metal connecting to the headband feels cheaper and looks like it was less thought of in the design compared to the Cloud I & II's. I would imagine they would break quite easily when decent force is applied to them like dropping them on the floor from sitting height. Maybe I'm wrong about this bit, but they just seems like a cheaper material overall.Inbetween-Having the mute and volume control directly on the headset is a interesting choice, but again the material is plastic. I don't think it would take much force to break wither the volume wheel or mute button. Which would require you to replace the entire headset, and not just the cable or control box on the cable.Pros-The Mic is good, no foam on the mic and the quality seems better than the Cloud I & II's per tests I came across.The headset is comfortable.Headset ear room is slightly larger than the Cloud II's.Conclusion-I will be refunding the Cloud III's.I came up with a workaround for the cord vibration issue by making a small half loop of the cable by where it connects to the headset, and using a twist tie or small rubber band to hold the cable together without pinching it. This removes the cord vibration noise you get when anything touches the cable. But I would much rather wear the Cloud II over the Cloud III headset due to the other cons I have listed above.The Cloud III should not be on the market for their current cost of $100. A reasonable price for the quality would be $50 at most. HyperX should have fixed the cord issue with a damper where it connects to the headset. Their Support team informed me the cord noise should not be present on these headsets at all and stated it was a manufacture defect. Yet it's what they are putting on the market.I won't be purchasing HyperX products in the future since there is a clear indication they don't care about making products like the used too in the past."
"Headset is great except when I use them with my windows device the audio bugs out all the time, I‚Äôve read online this is a reoccurring issue with the latest drivers which is a shame as I had always the best experience with hyperx brand. Will be returning these and opt for a wired again."
"The headset itself works fairly decently, although there is a bit more sound ""bleed"" than I would like, people from several feet away can hear what I'm listening to when I have these one. Main issue I have is that the plastic wrap around the mic just started peeling, and eventually I had to just peel the entire thing off because of the texture. This never really happened with the Cloud II, where the plastic did get scratched up after usage, but it never came off. Mic still works fine for now, but it just looks weird."
Loved it until I didn't. Started glitching out where people can't hear me and have to consistently turn it off and back on again. Would return if I still had the return window.
"Pros: very comfy on head, whole ear fits inside muffs, mic sounds good.Cons: everything is super quite when using 3.5mm headset jack. I bought these for the Xbox series x to use on FPS games after seeing all the good reviews and videos about these online. Unfortunately the Xbox can not use these to their full potential as the sound coming from the headphones when using the 3.5mm jack on controller is so low that I won't be able to use these at all. I will be returning for a more compatable pair for the Xbox system."
So I purchased these and the Cloud Alpha to compare as an upgrade to my 7 year old Cloud IIs. The Cloud III is advertised to be geared toward competitive fps gaming to amplify things like footsteps and audio cues without being drowned out by ambient sound effects and bass. This is likely effective however after comparing to the Alpha and even the old Cloud II the overall wound Cones out flat and very little bass. It was almost laughable swapping between these and the Cloud Alphas watching some movie trailers or music in testing. Any nuanced benefit the Cloud III may have with niche sound ranges is greatly outweighed by the superior range and particularly clear full bass of the Alpha. The microphone on the Alpha was also on par with these. Lastly the noise cancelation on the Alpha was superior and i immediately noticed the cord on the III rubbing on my shirt transmitted a very loud noise into the left ear.  Overall the very easy decision was the Cloud Alpha over the III.
"Very much an upgrade from the Cloud II's, in sound quality and comfort. However, the microphone is a big downgrade from the Cloud II.. the way it's placed infront of the headset makes it not optimal for catching your voice, of course if you force the microphone by hand to be infront of your mouth it'll sound good, but obviously it's not reasonable for someone to hold the microphone while playing games."
"I got this while it was on sale, and it's still overpriced. Cable is maybe 3 feet long, so that's a problem. Oh, but it comes with a USB extension cable that's about 4-5 feet long. Great, except that I get regular popping and crackling when using that extension cable, and it's much louder than whatever you're listening to. Audio quality is alright, not great but not poor. Anything touching the cable causes friction sounds to be heard in the left ear, mildly annoying.I have a larger head so I needed something that wouldn't apply much pressure, and these don't. In fact they apply just enough pressure to stay in place while feeling like they're going to slide off at any moment. The ear pieces easily slide in and out of the headband allowing for adjustments to be made without any difficulty. Since they slide so easily they don't want to stay in place. Just taking the headset off is enough pressure to change the adjustment length. Every time.The whole thing feels like it was made with two types of materials, durable metal frame with cheap plastic connections. This makes me think I could run it over with my car and it'll be fine while simultaneously having it snap if I so much as look at it funny. I've only been using it for a couple days now so I'm not sure which is the more accurate impression. The ear pads have that thin, cheap, plastic/leather type coating, that I fully expect to start peeling off after 3 months.Lastly I have not been able to get the microphone to work. Sometimes I can get the red light to turn on when I press the mute button, but not usually."
"TL;DR - big price, mediocre sound quality, questionable build, not really convenient. Your money is better spent somewhere else.I have a lot to say about this...Good things:* battery capacity. I didn't exactly time it, but they do hold charge for a looooooong time (been using them for two weeks now reached 50%)* range. Once again didn't exactly measure it, but they cover my whole apartment, and then some. yet to hear them stutterAnd a bunch of other things:* frame is metal, that's true, decently heavy feeling, but somehow they do give off a fragile vibe - there is a lot of give here and there* beware, ingenuity x (software) is available for windows only. That means you can't access equalizer on mac, linux or consoles* without fiddling with the equalizer the sound is pretty mediocre* mic is really crystal clear, but way too quiet* they are barely sitting on my head - shake the head, look at the ceiling or at the floor, tilt it to one side and they are sliding right off* astonishingly bad noise cancelation - do not block almost any sound* but despite that they are VERY hot. 40 minutes in these and I starting to sweat like I'm running* headphones doesn't sound for ""$100+"", equalizer helps, but not that muchTo add insult to the injury. I have a $15 lenovo over-the-ear Bluetooth headphones and they* sit better* provide *slightly* worse sound quality* provide better noise cancelation"
"I've used HyperX pretty consistently for about 5 years now. After using the Cloud II's for so long, I decided to go out on a limb and ""upgrade.""I've always used wired, so I wanted a wireless. The battery life of the Cloud III was surprisingly good. 30ish hours, don't have an exact number, but it was around there. That being said, that's about the only positive thing I have to say about these.The comfortability of the Cloud III paled in comparison to the Cloud II. The headband is entirely too stiff, the padding of the headset is terrible, and the shape of the earpad is shaped in a way that is angled forward in a possible attempt to fit your ear. That being said, I do have good sized gauges in my ears, but I never had any discomfort with the II's, which were the basic oval shape. I tried using these for over a month to see if my ears would adjust, and finally pulled the plug today.The overall sound quality was garbage compared to the II's. I'm an avid gamer, youtube, and netflix guy. I play anything from Valorant to Minecraft to Civ. All of the games sounded better on the II's. The bass is higher on them, and sounds were clear. The III's just felt... hollow. I didn't enjoy the overall sound that came out, gaming or watching shows.The mic quality is awful. My buddies and I use a lot of Outplayed to record our clips and share amongst ourselves. I could tell in every clip after purchasing the III's that the mic quality dropped substantially. My recorded voice sounded too fuzzy and unclear. I don't enjoy that quality from a headset at all.I'm giving it 2 starts due to the battery life. Other people might enjoy this headset, and I won't judge. I just did not. I threw myself against a brick wall for over a month and finally came back to ole reliable."
"After spending a couple days with the HyperX Cloud III and comparing my usage with x3 Cloud IIs, 1x Alpha over the past 6 years.Pros:- The microphone is a clear upgrade (not as compressed) which is exactly what I needed.- Just as lightweight as Cloud II / Alpha's (good)- Controlling audio on the headset is preferred, really didn't like the Alpha cable with the microphone adjustment hanging on me- Headband adjustment is closer to Cloud II than Alpha (On the Alpha's you would always be adjusting the headband when you take them on or off since it was so loose)Mixed:- The microphone length is smaller by design which means the big end part of the microphone is in my peripheral vision more. Cloud II or Alpha mic could be placed in front of my mouth and bent out of the way. I also feel like it's a little harder to insert the microphone- but time might make me more of a pro mic inserter.- Putting them on and taking them off is a bit more challenging for larger hands. Outer red frame is smaller / less to grip.Cons:- Default earpads are trapping an uncomfortable amount of heat on my ears / Cloud II you were provided a different type (spare) that was better / Alpha's had the best earpad attached. (Easy fix)- I'm not enjoying music or sounds as much (even with finetuned settings with FxSound or a Soundcard) | It's not a dealbreaker but somethings amiss [Less Bass, Mid?] (It's like going from a rating of 7.9 to 7.1) but the spatial awareness fear is overblown and I don't have an issue in games or anything.I would pay $60 again for another pair, but certainly not $90.Suggest free FxSound software to boost audio quality, in case you don't have a soundcard."
"headest was a good budget option, but the audio cable that plugs into the controller cannot be replaced if it starts to mess up, causing you to have to replace the entire headset. save your money and get a high quality headset and not this made to break brand."
"So here‚Äôs the deal‚Ä¶I bought an equally expensive Corsair headset that is also wireless. I bought the Corsair 7 months ago. I bought this HyperX because the ear piece of my Corsair has already fallen off‚Ä¶ The battery life on the Corsair is way worse than the HyperX and good lord is it way more uncomfortable. The range on the HyperX is great, the comfort is fantastic, and battery life is on point.However, since getting the headset I‚Äôve been told in discord that I sound like a robot (crackling and staticky) or I cut in and out when talking. The audio I get in games is also subpar for a headset at this price point. It doesn‚Äôt seem to have the same amazing audio sound that I had from previous hyperx headsets, or this Corsair headsets audio experience is just so much better that it really identifies the gap.Overall, I‚Äôm fine with this headset because of the comfort of wearing it for extended periods of time. I wish the audio was better and if it keeps giving me the robotic static noises that my friends keep telling me I have, then I‚Äôll be most likely be breaking out my QuadCast mic and putting it on my desk for mic.Edit: The robotic has gotten even worse, and it's ALL sound from the computer, not just VOIP. I regret having bought this. I only bought it because the Cloud II was such a wonderful headset."
"Software request firmware update leads headphone died completely.after upgrading firmware, headphone has no sound and mic now, even it can be detected by wireless connection but cable. Tried different type C cable, reinstall driver in device manager, re-pairing the wireless, reinstalled Ngenuity. Simply, the headphone is dead.Beside this, I believe the windows neguity app is piece of s**t, since it no permission to change window32 folder, auto update always failed, you have to manually do some tricks to update it.(search on youtube). or sudo add permission in windows(it's the huge pain in ass).Imaging, every firmware update you have to suffer the pains!  i started the warranty request, not sure if I will get replacement, but it still takes time to wait.tbh, i am starting to looking for to other headphones even though i really like the cloud3 design, performance in cs2. 120h battery and in-game performance seems unbeatable in this price.Hope their future engineer can provide better software. It ruins the headset firmware.  If there is no such issue, I definitely will recommend it to CS2 players."
"The sound quality is the worst part. I bought these as an ""upgrade"" to my HyperX Cloud Flight's and these sound much worse. Feels a bit heavy on the head too. Not horrible, but for the price you can get something better."
"The sound quality on this headset just might be the worst out of any pair I‚Äôve ever owned. That being said I‚Äôve tried a lot of good headsets in the past, but this one doesn‚Äôt stack up well AT ALL. The max volume isn‚Äôt loud enough for my taste. Directional sound wasn‚Äôt that impressive, I was struggling to figure out where sound was coming from. The microphone quality is great. comfort is amazing, one of the easiest headsets to where. I didn‚Äôt own these long enough to judge the battery life. I returned these pretty quickly just based off the sound quality"
When I first tried the headphone the sound quality was terrible then I downloaded the software and tweaked the sound settings and make it a bit better and louder but the headphone sounds like if it‚Äôs underwater. I don‚Äôt think these headphones are worth $71+. I‚Äôm going to wait and try them on game today and if it‚Äôs not good I will return them.
"I am just going to keep it simple, first the things which I thought were good, then the bad...GOOD  Comfort was nice  Weight nice not too heavy and not too light.  Software seems  to work properly, even thou  with checking reviews on just the HyperX software seems like lots of people had a problem, But not me .BAD  The mic recording volume is  about 1/4 lower then my currant headset. Have tried with OBS and about 3 other recording streaming programs. I had to raise my voice a bit more than I was used to for an hour video, and after 3 hours throat was a bit sore.  Old headset I have to reduce mic volume to 85% and it is perfect with a normal level speaking voice.  Also the headset play-back volume is a bit lower than currant headset I am using. As there is a train that goes by my house literally 15' away once every 2 hours. With this headset I can not hear a song on the PC, when it passes. Old headset can barely hear the train.The choice is yours but I think there are better choices.I might give these to a family member at Christmas or keep if my old one break, I will use these as a backup until I can get another pair of the old ones  (Which sell for just under $30.00 USD)"
"Bought in April, the mic is barely working now. I treat it gently. This is BS"
Good sound. Comfortable.  Noise canceling DOES NOT WORK!
"I have saw reviews on this headset saying how good it is, and it did not meet my expectations. Although it is very comfortable, the sound is not as loud as I thought it would be. I play with the mic volume all the way up, and still struggle to hear my friends. It is very light , and I have been told my my friends that they can hear me very well. It is easy to connect since it is wired, and I haven‚Äôt had any problems with its durability"
"If you read any review on here, make it this one. I have had every hyperx cloud headset they‚Äôve come out with, and I love them. Best headsets on the market for the price easily. But please don‚Äôt think that the Cloud 3 is the big brother to the Cloud II with the 7.1 Dolby. The cloud II is far superior in sound, fit and overall quality, and it‚Äôs only $2 more ($79 vs $77)"
"When it works this headset was great to use, but it would randomly disconnect a few times a day. In the middle of a video call or gaming match, then I'd have to wait 30 seconds for it to automaticity reconnect. I was in a meeting with my boss and it disconnected two times. This happened to me on PC, PS5 and android. Really disrupting and embarrassing. Need reliability. I also have the wired version and I'm sticking with those. I gave them two weeks, no improvement, can't risk the wireless instability, returning."
"Clarity and directional sound was there, but even with the volume dial turned all the way up and the PS4 headphone system setting at max, these were too quiet for me and I don't like my headphones loud. Tried both 3.5mm jack and supplied USB connect, same low output. Slightly better when connected to my Android phone for music, decent sound. No width adjustment for large heads like mine (7 3/4) , and the cheap non breathable leatherette made my ears extremely hot. Can't recommend these"
Nice and very comfortable but the sound meeeh. I have 50 bucks pair that sounds the same.
"Compared to the previous Cloud II headset, the Cloud III version is a letdown.Better:- Better microphone audio quality- More flexible headbandNeutral:- Microphone mute and volume slider on headsetWorse:- Audio quality is very tinny, lacks a lot of bass- Doesn't block outside sound nearly as well- Ear cups feel like regular foam, not memory foamIf these are your first set of gaming headphones then you'll probably like them just fine.  However, if you owned their previous HyperX Cloud II model, you will likely be disappointed.  The audio quality is noticeably worse and it really doesn't block outside noise at all.  I'm not sure if it's because of the ear cup foam being less squishy or if they took out insulation, but these headphones hardly block any outside noise.Bottom line: go buy the previous Cloud II version instead."
"The headphones work well, the major issue is the cord. It just starts to wrap and coil around itself, and its not easy to undo. You will lose over a foot in length from the curling unless you have a good setup for a cord. Other than that, works well."
"These are comfortable and have alright sound, but you should know before you buy that charging and connecting this thing is annoying and there's an issue with updating the firmware where it doesn't recognize the device when plugged in. You get one usb-c to usb-c cord, the dongle for the headphones that is also usb-c, and one usb converter oh and a black pouch to hold the headphones in.. that's it. Now if you're someone like me who doesn't have a charger that has a port for usb-c, it can get annoying to go back and forth with the converter from charger to pc every day. I've had this for about a week now and I'm already tired of doing this and worried I'm going to lose the small converter one of these days. If you have a pc that has a usb-c port in the front of your pc then maybe these are perfect for you, but for the price and the just alright sound quality I would pass and search for something more convenient and cheaper. One plus to these is the removable mic, but still not worth."
"Just for reference I returned these because as a customer if the unit has a service that is required for functionality. It must be able to accomplish it. Otherwise it is a defective product or just junk. When I got these they initially seemed to work. Then the software began updating the headset. That's where it ends. That's the story. No lie. I got to test the sound a little and honestly it felt a little flat. OK very flat. It's ranges didn't seem to really pop and everything felt one dimensional. Then the software update came, and that's it. It wouldn't update. It just continuously demanded an update be done... it just failed. I had essentially a pair of headsets without functionality. It was frustrating to see a new set of headphones be brought down by software updates. After reading the issue being very common on these I didn't want to torture myself and returned these and just ended up with the new ASTRO A50x. I had worked in the past with an older version of the A50 and thought they sounded darn good. But their price tag was always too dramatic. After testing out some headphones and giving these a try, I realized the high price was being put to good use. I know this is suppose to be a review of the HyperX, but the A50x really do sound rich and clean. They also feel very comfortable. I am aware of the claims of parts coming off but honestly the same claim was made of the older ones I worked with and, they never fell apart. Considering their work environment was rather brutal, it says a lot to me. Don't be mistaken though, these headsets and the A50x are not in the same league. The ASTRO are expensive, but to me worth the money. I had a while back a HyperX headset that I loved. But this was not even a shred of what my old ones were. I can not recommend these."
"They are not bad headphones, but they are supremely middling. The sound quality is just ok, but seemed poorer than my HyperX Cloud II. The microphone quality was ok, but the microphone volume was terrible. I had co-workers on zoom and Teams calls say they could hear me fine, but that it was rather quiet, that was my impression as well. With older versions of the product, I could make a video tutorial and have reasonable results from the sound recorded, these headphones were disappointing there."
"I recently bought these because I needed a headset that could connect to my GoXLR and while they do the job, they don't do it very well. Let me explain.The spatial audio in these are really good. I tested them out in Valorant and CoD and was able to hear footsteps from whatever direction they were coming from. The build quality is good, they are very comfortable and the controls on the side of the headset are very convenient.However, where it fails is in the audio quality. The audio overall is not very clear and crisp. Even when I increased the volume to 100, it still did not sound very clear. I can only describe it as the audio coming from a metal trashcan. The bass on them are not very good, even with music that has bass boost.-Speaking of bass, I understand that gaming headsets don't exactly focus too much on them and understandably so because you don't want your overall audio to be ruined by too much bass. However, this headset has what I can only describe as ""little to no"" bass! For example, when you hear an explosion, you expect that BOOM to come through with some bass to it (not too much but SOME). This headset does NOT give you that bass you would expect. Other headphones like the HyperX Cloud 2s, Cloud Alpha and even the Razer Blackshark V2 give you that bit of bass that makes it so good.Overall, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE! If you have any of the headphones I mentioned, I would stick to those!"
"Coming from someone who used the HyperX Cloud I and II, and adored them, I'm not buying a single HyperX product again after this abomination.Words cannot describe how disgustedly disappointed I am in this product. It's just genuinely horrible, and it's because of all the useless software bloat it now has. Enjoy fun new features, like a mic mute button you never wanted that triggers all the time, or poor headphone driver software that COMPLETELY BREAKS AUDIO IF YOU HAPPEN TO UNPLUG THE 9MM DRIVER FROM THE USB DONGLE and reattach it (you'll need to physically plug and unplug to fix that too!). Couple this with... degraded blown out sound quality and terrible mic gain! Another fun fact: if you don't have USB3 ports open, you can't use your headphones now... awesome. I'm really glad I have this in my WIRED HEADPHONES!!!!What more could you ask!?Oh, how about a real product. Don't waste your time or money on this, or any of HyperX's other, new garbage. I'd give anything for my Cloud II's to work.This sucks."
"Got it on may 2nd and probs around the 28th, everything started to go crappy. The mute button was weird and made me stay on mute IF I was muted for too long. Then the audio started to bug out around that time too, and sometimes made things staticky or nothing with align correctly. Now the mic has gone down the crap hole too, i‚Äôve been told I sounded like I was across the room or my voice suddenly got quiet. One other thing that I have noticed which is super annoying is that if i get up just to quickly go to another room, few steps outside my door I turn into a robot, A friend has this same headset and said that, that never happened to them before. So idk if I got a bad headset or not, but Hyper X has never once worked for me üòîü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Suuuuper comfortable, and high quality, love the packaging. Only problem I ran into was that the mic distorted my voice when I talked, which was a deal-breaker for me, since I use mine for communication. If the audio quality isn‚Äôt a huge deal for you, go for it! But if you‚Äôre a little picky, like me, I would look elsewhere."
Pros:Decent soundLightweightPretty sure the battery is witchcraft with how long it lasts.Cons:Sound can be a bit thinEars will get hotDTS is a headache.Had some major issues with this headset and DTS. If you don't open DTS at all then some games just have missing audio. Also on discord it will change the volume of others in the channel with no rhyme or reason. Overall a pretty big deal for anyone who spends a lot of time on discord with others while gaming.
"I generally love HyperX products and have owned multiple predecessor headsets, Cloud 1 & 2s and they both are exceptionally great gaming headsets.Out of the box, the HyperX Cloud 3 Wireless that i've purchased was missing bass entirely, gunshots are screeching loud but footsteps and voices are muffled and muddy.NGenuity (HyperX's Hub) doesn't seem to improve the sound in anyway and yes, I did update the audio drivers for both my PC and the headset itself ‚Äî this isn't caused by the battery either as it's currently sitting at 76% from full. I checked the sound quality with other headsets (Logitech G535, HyperX 1, HyperX 2) too in case it was an issue with my PC's audio-drivers, this was not the case.I made sure ONLY NGenuity's EQ was enabled and Nahimic was off. Nahimic seems to be able to adjust the EQ properly but the official hub itself wouldn't tune the sound at all.I tried both USB-C port and the USB-A adapter but they both sounded the same with the glaring issue of missing bass.If anyone can help me fix this it would be greatly appreciated!Aside from sound issues, the build quality is sturdy with high-quality foam/padding with a mostly metal frame."
"I bought these because they were on sale.  I'm very disappointed in the quality of the build and sound.The sound is weak with limited sound profile options.  There is very little you can do with the sound profiles or at least for me there is hardly anything to configure.  The software is so empty.  I kept asking myself ""Is there any more than this? Come on.""The metal band feels cheap and weak.The 3.5mm cable is too long, tangles up very easily, can quickly get nots in it if it gets twisted and tangled, and is undetachable.Overall, i would not recommend these HyperX Cloud 3 headphones to anyone.  I feel like they are a cheap quick cash grab.For wired gaming headphones, I would suggest Logitech G Pro X with DTS:X Headphone 2.0 and 7.1 Surround.  For me in this price range the Logitech G Pro X are the best.  But to each their own."
"Sound quality of both the microphone and speakers were adequate for the price, however, I‚Äôve read and head the mic quality was better on that of the previous version (2). Regardless of the live support provided by the manufacturer, the software driver from the usb dac/hardwire dongle did NOT play nice with my win 10 install at all! We had removed ALL my sound drivers which I was not using (including the onboard realtek) and found my system performance hiccups to not resolve. The resolve, in my case, was simply not to have the headset plugged in. We had even tried a firmware update; no dice.Please note my Win 10 install is 2.5 years old, your mileage may vary with a newer/fresh win10/11 install."
"I searched Amazon for ""Bluetooth Headset"" and this came up as one of the top results, so I bought them. These do not have any Bluetooth capabilities at all.The fit and function are fine, but havingvthem as a top pick when they do not meet the search requirement is deceptive."
"The total length of the boom on this mic is under 5"", and since you have to be speaking directly into this microphone for it to pick up your voice, that can be a pretty serious problem.It does not appear that HyperX sells a longer replacement mic. If you need one, you're going to be buying one from some no name Chinese company and it's a safe bet you're going to forfeit audio quality in that case, or at least you'll be gambling. For a headset this highly priced, you would expect an option like this, but one does not present on Amazon or on the manufacturer's website.Very disappointing."
If you are spending this much on a headset there are better options. For the amount I paid I could have spent an extra 20-30 bucks for a better sound quality headset. It was not very loud and felt cheap.
"I like how solid they feel and comfortable they are around my head. I feel like I can probably drop it by accident, and it won't snap so could survive a throw if you are mad for a bit. I think it sounds good and it isn't too noise suppressed so I can still hear around me.Update:These headphones randomly disconnect, and the audio becomes glitchy like I'm listening to static. I can't return these since it is past the return date."
"Bought and immediately returned, had a frequent static pop when plugged in.Ear cup + headband design puts a lot of pressure on my ears and makes them hurt. Specifically the angled drivers pinch the back edge of my ear. They have really thin pads that do nothing for comfort and aren't thick enough to space the headset, especially with glasses.The braided cord isn't good and passes a loud scratching noise up to my left ear with every movement, even just rubbing on my shirt when breathing. Super obnoxious when it drags on the edge of my desk or chair arm.Audio quality other than the popping is ok, but nothing special."
"The only thing bad i would have to say wrong with these headphones is mid game they turn off and microphone doesn't work, i have to disconnect and connect again."
"These aren‚Äôt the best, it would be 10x better if it had more bass to it, it sounds empty."
I got this to replace my aging Cloud 2 headset and was actually taken aback with the sound d quality compared to the older headset. The overall sound for the Cloud 3 is pretty tinny and lacking. I was switching back and forth and the difference is quite noticeable. Not sure if it‚Äôs a cheaper design or mine was faulty. Decided to return and stuck with the old Cloud 2.
It very faintly sounds like a cheap monitor speaker if the windows volume is low but the fast audio latency and headphone built-in volume makes up for it.There‚Äôs little sound bass without the application meant for it that has an equalizer.The headphones mostly sound as if they are more meant for FPS games.
"The audio is good, but the fact that there is a little scroll wheel that determines volume on the headset itself is stupid, I accidentally muted my audio a couple times and had no idea what the problem was.  The bigger issue with the headphones is the fact that the endcap plastic pieces that connect the top headrest to the metal spoons holding the cups has broken in half for me after only a few months. Hyperx has had this issue on all of the Cloud 2's I have ever owned."
"After 10 months of having this product the frame is falling apart, and the speaker is blown out on one side. I used to use hyperX for the last 5 years or so and these are the least durable headphones ive bought. Everything just started to fall apart all at once"
"I followed the instruction paper and downloaded the Hyperx NGETUITY. That app required the update of the firmware of the headset and adapter. I updated the firmware first by 10 minutes and it started to ask me to connect the wireless adapter(image one) then I tried many ways to do that, such as connecting it directly to USB, connecting the dongle through the adapter, and connecting the dongle directly to type-c. All the ways do not work. Then I reset the Hyperx NGETUITY. It asked me update the headset again. But when I connected the headset by USB cable, it didn‚Äôt work, just looks like the image two. If I choose to update later. It says that the headset cannot connect. Then I found out the headset connected to dongle either. Reconnect operation didn‚Äôt work either. i.e. inserting needle in the dongle and turn off and long pressing the power button on the headset. So now the headset can‚Äôt receive any information and play any sound except background noise."
"This headset started out with a few minor annoyances, such as the app to control it is only downloadable through the microsoft store (which turns out to be a dilemma in itself considering that you have to allow windows to collect optional data from you in order to download anything from their store). However, once I spent an hour figuring that out, the headset was finally working and had some pretty decent sound quality! The mic is very mid-tier though, all of my friends said my voice sounded pretty bad with the new headset. I decided to roll with it, and used it without any issues for a couple of months. Suddenly, I have no audio. The speakers work fine (I know because there is a voice that lets you know when you're connected, etc.) and the mic is working because my friends can hear me, yet i have no audio. After wasting 30+ minutes searching reddit posts (Because their website is absolutely useless when it comes to support), I tried 3 different fixes to no avail. A complete waste of time and money, you can get far better for this price range. Avoid this headset."
"Seems well built, sound is a bit dull (though you can hear more finer details compared to the cloud 2 wireless), microphone is decent, and battery life is excellent. I like the simplicity of hyperx ngenuity software. Only major issue for me is the headband has almost no clamping force. The headset slides off my head when looking up or down slightly, and the headband cushion material is very tacky and pulls on my hair when it slides. Very big difference in clamping force having owned the Cloud 2 wireless, those were perfect."
"I was incredibly happy with my HyperX Cloud II, so when it came time to purchase a new headphone I purchased the new model. Aside from showing no real improvement from the Cloud II, they also removed some useful features for no reason, such as microphone volume control and detachable microphone. The volume wheel was moved from the wire to the earpiece which feels uncomfortable to set, and I'm not sure if this is the manufacturer or distributors' fault but I keep hearing a really loud and distracting click while using them. Overall, it feels like a downgrade from the Cloud II. If I had the choice, I'd have just repurchased the Cloud II."
"I‚Äôm reviewing this unit as a professional gamer and streamer. I used this headset with an Elgato WaveXLR audio interface. Since I already have an interface I was forced to use the wired connection over USB. This setup is not optimal for this headset. For one, the audio cable is way too short, about 3 feet which gives me very little freedom of movement while streaming. Second, the audio drivers are muddy and weak compared to similarly priced headphones. You end up paying a lot extra for the detachable microphone, usb option, and style but end up sacrificing mobility and sound quality. I think these would be good for casual gamers who don‚Äôt already have an audio interface and microphone setup externally. Otherwise, this will feel like a downgrade overall."
the very tight ones are pressing on the head
"I didnt receive a code for dts x.  I tried using on phone and other than the spacial audio that comes stock with phone, I get nothing else.  Dts x site doesnt even have a dl button only learn more?!? AND it says for win 10 and pc or xbox... Nothing else  but when I hit it it brings up a read... Thats it!"
Mic Quality - Very GoodSound Quality - GoodLong Gaming - NopeShort Gaming - Yes
I don't think the sound is any different from Hyperx Cloud Alpha and the mic is unusable.  Terrible according to teammates.  Still a fan of Hyperx.
"sound ok on my laptop or my controller but for some reason its not compatible with phones, sounds like dog crap when i use it to listen to music on my phone, the max volume isn't great either."
"Once I found the cloud II's years back I was hooked, haven't used another headset until these. When I saw they had made cloud III's I was excited and got a pair. The sound quality seems slightly worse than the II's, still ahead of most of the competition TBH but yeah. Quieter and less of a punchy bass too. If you are in the market for a wired gaming headset honestly i'd just go with the tried and tested cloud II's. If you are set on having these ones for some reason, they aren't bad."
I got a headset from amazon warehouse and the headset is fine but I never got the usb C cable so I can't charge it and can't update the firmware for the headphones without the cable which is only a nuisance because I can get another usb C cable but would have been nice if amazon checked to make sure everything was in the box
"For gaming they are great, mic quality is also decent as well in game and in discord. But outside of gaming they start to fall off, the way they are tuned makes them very high end and treble tuned. So trying to watch videos with vocals or music makes them sound very tinny and flat."
These are good sounding headphones.  Only problem is it cuts out all the time.  It will disconnect and reconnect. Over and over.  Fully charged.  10 ft from dongle.  No reason for this to happen.  Would like to get another pair
"Thought these would be better than the Alpha cloud S but I was wrong, they have a decent sound but no really for me."
"Bought these just the other day as the crappy design of the cloud II made the pastic and metal extender break and fall put. Oh well had them for years and loved the loudness and 7.1 surround sound. I assumed these would be of the same sound quality but absolutely not. Playing bf2042 with war tapes  sound wuality it is nigh and day the difference between these ""new headphones"" and the old ones. Way more muffled and just quieter then the old ones. Especially in fps games. I am gonna have to return these before I get pissed off from getting killed on games just because of ear safety or some bs. Can't beleive another company copy and pasted their product. Also instead of adding something they just take away something and replace that feature. Like the 7.1 surround sound with their DTS sound. With everything done right and all the windows sound settings played with and tested, these headphones will still put you at a disadvantage in any competitive game that has any sort of sound design."
Headset sounded way quieter than my previous hyperx. It turns out it was just the adapter cable that comes with it.
"Sound is good for the price, however get very uncomfortable very quick."
"The worst bass I have ever heard in a headset or pair of headphones it's so muted and distant , even having the bass boost setting in the windows audio manager at max didn't help and somehow installing hyperx ngenuity to try and do it through their own program made it even worse sounding and deleted what little bass there was when it installed the drivers for them, would never recommend this headset to anyone that wants to listen to music a single time with their headphones. I've never felt compelled to actually return a product on amazon but for $80 this is an absolute scam , it's cheaper and better to just buy tascam headphones and a desk mic please do not buy these I had hyperX stingers for $40 for about a year and a half and the audio quality is miles better for a much cheaper budget headset, I thought by going newer and more expensive I'd get better sound but it's just entirely for show, whoever designed this headset should actually be fired."
"I have had good experiences with HyperX in the past, so when my Razor headset finally began to die I grabbed these as a replacement assuming they would be similarly high quality. Unfortunately, these have had a slew of problems and are generally of a lower quality than previous HyperX products I've purchased. The audio is decent, but not what I would expect from a headset of this price. Also, it has this weird problem where the audio becomes washed out and very base heavy at random, which requires the headset to be restarted.The only redeeming factor is the impressive battery life."
"For years they've been told that customers do not like forced noise.  HyperX Cloud Flight - people were telling them they hate the constant beeps on lower battery levels.  For HyperX Cloud III, I've had it for 2 days now and already hate the ""CONNECTED"" noise the second I turn it on let alone any other time the headset tells me something has changed.  I went to ngenuity and went through multiple updates to the headset only to find out that you cannot remove the annoying voice since it's built into the headsets firmware.  Either way, will be looking into different brands of headsets in the future since the forced loud-ass voice in your ears is insanely annoying and the adaptability of the headset around the ears hurts."
"This product feels very nice to wear and sounds great. The mic works well, and I really enjoy the battery life. The only thing I don't like about it is that there is no noise cancelation on the headphones, so I can most always hear what going on around me which really sucks"
"Came within a day, amazing sleek design.I‚Äôm upgrading (or so I thought) from my 7 year old HyperX Cloud 2 wired version, to these. I updated the drivers from the HyperX app and I turned on the 360 surround sound and even tried to customize my own preset on the equalizer, but it still lost to my old headphones in terms of sound quality.I really tried to love it and almost kept it because of the sleek design, but when I tested it on some FPS games the footsteps were so hard to track. I returned it the same day."
"cloud 3's are a complete downgrade compared to the cloud Alpha's in terms of quality. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:had a better microphoneHas inline vol/mute controls built into the headset.Cons:No longer has a removable cord so if your cord breaks you have to replace the entire headset.Audio drivers are placed further from the ear to accommodate in line controls, which worsens audio quality and position.Audio drivers are smaller which worsens audio qualityNo foam pop filter to keep dust or liquid from getting inside the microphone.Other than that every other feature from quality of material weight and size adjustment is identical. I don't understand why hyperx downgraded just to have inline controls and upgraded their mic just to not protect it. So I just recommend you buy cloud cloud Alpha's They'll sound better and last longer and they are the exact same price."
"This at max volume isn't enough. I'm trying to hear footsteps and this headset isn't performing. Thanks for babying us. It's technically a headset. When unsuppressed gunfire goes off, it should make me jump. This doesn't. My heavy metal music doesn't make my ears ring.Should be too loud and let us turn it down, not ""this should be fine"" and ""good luck hearing footsteps"""
"When muting the microphone, the headset beeps and normal audio stops.  When contacting support, they claimed this is an intended ""feature"".  This ""feature"" needs to be able to be disabled as the mute button is frequently used, but when I miss parts of conversations due to muting and unmuting, it makes the headset not usable.  Retrun requested."
"If you're a person who enjoys punchy bass and good surround sound, find a different product.If you have to choose between the Cloud II and the Cloud III, get the Cloud II.The Cloud II has 7.1 Surround Sound which this does NOT have.The Cloud III is a more expensive product that does a lot of things worse than its predecessor.The Cloud II came with extra suede ear pads. This doesn't.All in all, I regret my purchase."
"As someone who‚Äôs tried countless headsets, this is one of the worst.  The sound is very low and not very detailed.  I recommend the Sennheiser PC37x or the Astro A50X over this HyperX.  If you actually want to hear footsteps and crisp sound avoid these Cloud 3s at all costs."
"Audio quality was okay. Build quality was great. However, I am returning these because the microphone will not pick up your voice unless you are screaming, mic is also far too short."
"I find this headset to be extremely comfortable to wear and seems constructed well from high quality materials. The sound quality is about on par with other headsets like it - which is to say, a little too much bass and a lot boomier than my preferred studio monitors, but it absolutely meets expectations is a tradeoff I was prepared to make to go wireless. What I was not expecting was how tinny and muddy the microphone is. Whether it's the quality of the hardware itself or some issue with the wireless transmission, the sound is poor enough that I've been asked not to use it by friends and colleagues when on a skype or discord call. It was supposed to be an upgrade over the logitech WEBCAM I was using, but it seems I'm going back to that solution for now. I won't be trading them in because I'm happy enough with them as headphones but I'd suggest shopping around if you really need to use the built in mic.UPDATE after using for a few weeks - it briefly disconnects multiple times a day. Very annoying, I regret purchasing it at this point and will likely buy something else."
"The headset is great when it actually works, but it will always randomly disconnect whenever it wants, and there is no clear solution other than to pull out the USB adapter and plug it back in... it is incredibly frustrating. Save your money for a better headset"
"The cable that comes with the headset is incredibly short, you will have to buy a new one if you want to use it while you charge the headset.Audio quality is really bad, it's far worse than the HyperX Cloud IIThe noise cancelling is non-existent, might not be a big deal for some but you can hear everything.This is just a straight up downgrade from the HyperX Cloud II, just go with the II over the III."
Coming from razer - these headphones sound distant. It's like listening to a bootleg version of whatever you're watching. There are cheaper options that sound better
"The sound quality is worse then the previous generation. Mic is good. Feels somewhat less durable then cloud2, not as comfortable. The wire seems more durable. Overall it's 6.5 out of 10"
I was expecting a upgrade or at least same quality as the hyperx cloud 2. I was wrong. The cloud 2s are much better in my opinion. The sounds are not as good. The sounds direct for footsteps aren't as good. The mic quality isn't as good either. I did a test on a chat party asking which mic sounded the best without any bias and everyone chose the 2s. Disappointing to say the least.
"I really liked the HyperX Cloud II but these just do not hit the mark. I don't think the audio quality is as good and they constantly cause issues when trying to switch from my pc to my work laptop. I leave the USB connector plugged into my gaming pc and then pull out the headphone jack to plug into my laptop. Half the time I have to reconnect to my laptop because my coworkers can't hear me. And when I go from laptop to pc I can't hear my pc audio half the time, or it it's in a constant loop trying to ""reconnect"" and seemingly freezes the windows explorer? I don't even know what the issue is, it results in me not being able to interact with my taskbar to even change my sound output until I disconnect the usb from hypercloud. I never had this problem with the ""V2"" version, which I used for years doing the same exact things."
"Sounds tinny, would not recommend"
Had the Cloud 2s before these. These I had to get a volume adjuster to play fps games. Volume is way lower. They are comfortable but mine died after just 7 months.  Cloud 2s lasted me 2-3years. Will be looking for a new brand most likely
"I just purchased a new HyperX Cloud III headset after my old Cloud Revolver headset started to break and I've never been more disappointed with a purchase. It sounds like someone wrapped the speakers in a thick blanket. Everything is muddled, flat, and sounds absolutely nothing close to how things sounded on the Revolver. After some internet searching, I saw people talking about some random Microsoft app - which is wild that it's even necessary to get a half decent sound. So I get this random, separate, unaffiliated app in the hopes of closing the gap between the Revolver and III's sound quality. Unfortunately, this setting sound just as awful in a completely different yet parallel way. Never requested a return as fast as with these headphones - Stay away at all costs."
"The cable causes way too much noise when rubbing against things, I have been a long time hyper x buyer with my previous headset being the HyperX CloudX, the sound from that headset's cable rubbing against close was 50% quieter than with this headset.CABLE IS SO BAD YOU CAN HEAR MY DESKTOP's AUDIO EVEN WHEN THE MIC IS MUTED OR UNPLUGGED.0% PRIVACY RATING, DO NOT RELY ON FOR MUTING DURING MEETINGSWill not be buying this again."
"Horrible headset for the price unless you like ones that sound muffled and squeeze your head, just avoid. I wish i could get my money back"
After using the headset for less than 3 months the cushions started to peel off. This was not the expected quality I expected from this brand.
I just recently bought these cause of all the reviews talking how great they are. But they have HORRIBLE sound even with volume maxed out. Im already thinking of returning and ive hardly have had them a day. The connection still sucks. I thought turtle beaches were bad till i got these. I should have learn that when i bought hyper x for my pc and hated them
"Headset worked great... for about 3 months. Then every time I plugged in the wireless dongle (the one that is required to connect the headset, as you can't connect wirelessly via bluetooth, and you can directly connect via aux), windows throws a usb power surge error. I can disconnect all other usb devices, and still this usb dongle will always throw the error. Made this headset completely useless."
"I had hyperx headphones before, cheaper model, 30$, and they are wayyyyy better than this junk. Muffled junk and too tight."
"Fundamentally this headset is not fit for purpose; the microphone turns off automatically after a few seconds of inactivity so unless you're talking literally nonstop, the first couple of syllables of everything you say will be cut off."
"The main headphone I used before I bought this is a Sony MDR ZX110 that I've had for 4 years. After trying this and comparing it to my Sony, the cheap $20 Sony sounded better. The sound of this headphone by default is really bad, comparable to $5‚Äì10 headphones. I tried using an equalizer to see if it improved the sound, and it did really well surprisingly, my Sony with equalizer on didn't sound as good. Sound quality without equalizer is a 2/10 and with it is a 7.5/10. I still use the equalizer when I'm not listening to music like watching videos or playing games because the default sound is just so bad. Perhaps the sound just needed breaking in, but I don't know for sure. I bought this headphone with a Cyber Monday discount that lowered the price down to $46, which makes it a fair price. The full price of $70 isn't a great deal for what this headphone is in my opinion.I read the reviews about this headphone thoroughly before buying it. Most of the critical reviews mention the sound quality being bad and it turns out they were right. Most people who gave a good score for sound quality have very low standards. I still bought it because I thought it had to sound better than my cheap Sony headphone, but that's only true if I use an equalizer.I am not a true audiophile, but my standards are high when it comes to sound quality because I used to have a pair of unknown branded earbuds that sounded amazing and then broke. Ever since, I have been using cheap, crappy sounding earbuds and headphones and couldn't enjoy music like I used to. I really wanted to have a good sound experience again, but I have to pay a lot of money for it. I thought this product would be a great bargain because the brand is known for sound quality. Ironically, that is the worst thing about this product. Everything about it is great, the looks, feels, comfort, and noise cancelling. But the sound quality is what it's lacking, which is a huge letdown for me because that's the only thing I needed in a headphone, and I don't care about anything else.I thought about returning it, but I've returned many headphones/earbuds in the past thinking they would sound good but didn't, so I'm tired of doing it and just accept it for what it is. The equalizer improving the sound drastically also helps with my decision to keep it. I don't understand why companies are always lacking in sound quality in their headphones and excel at everything else. I really do not recommend you buy this if you're looking for good sound quality; like many other reviews mentioned, it really isn't great. An equalizer is needed if you want it to sound great. Definitely look elsewhere if you want a better purchasing experience."
Unknown why as they were taken care of very well but in less then a year the left side stopped working entirely
"I‚Äôve owned a not-insignificant number of Sennheiser products over the years. HD 201‚Äòs at $20, HD 600s at $300, and even an aviation headset of theirs. These are most comparable to the HD 201‚Äòs, both in configuration as well as price (sub-$50 closed-back)The materials and build quality are frankly excellent for the price point. They look good, they feel good in your hands. The air cups are slightly too small for me, so while they weren‚Äôt the most comfortable, I didn‚Äôt ever feel they were uncomfortable. The size of the ear pads can be a bit frustrating, because they sit at a very strange middle ground between a circum-aural headphone and a supra-aural headphone. I did get them around my ears, but I felt like they were always half an inch too far back on my head for optimal sound quality.And that is unfortunately where these completely fall apart. The treble is actually very well done. It‚Äôs extremely clear without becoming fatiguing. The bass is tipped up, which I don‚Äôt have any issue with, but there is a huge resonance at about 35 Hz, which would need an extremely granular equalizer to get rid of. So that‚Äôs a bad problem, but can potentially be taken care of depending on what equipment you have these hooked up to. The mid range however is also very veiled, which didn‚Äôt seem to be able to be corrected with equalization.That‚Äôs what makes these so frustrating. They‚Äôre very close to being a wonderful budget headphone. They look good, they‚Äôre well-built, the slight ergonomic imperfections can easily be overlooked at this price point. But for a company like Sennheiser to have missed so thoroughly in the sound quality department is baffling."
"Sennheiser has been my go to brand since I found light weight headphones several years ago.Sadly they stopped making those, but I had found some bigger headphones from them that I like a lot. But I needed to find a replacement as the cord has started to come apart.I am a very petite woman and this pair of headphones were so tight I couldn't keep them on my ears for more than 5 seconds! So based on that I can't recommend this style to anyone (except perhaps a child of about age 6-8 years).I do plan to try to find a different style from Sennheiser..."
"I wanted a pair of headphones, in case there is a problem with my stereo system, I can tell if the problem is with the speakers or the amplifier.  My old pair of headphones stopped working several years ago.  My amplifier takes stereo phono plugs aka 1/4-inch stereo plugs.  To use these headphones, I needed an adapter: stereo 1/8 to stereo 1/4 so I bought that right after I realized I needed it."
"The sound quality is pretty good but not great, for the price though its good enough.They are  rather small and get  uncomfortable after ~1 hour of wearing themThe earcups are a pleather like material which causes my ears to sweat very quickly"
"These headphones were for guitar practice. I haven't even used them for that and I'm already ready to return them. they are very uncomfortable. The cups really are so small. I have a small head and they were so tight. I paired them with my MacBook, sat in them and I'm sorry these are just too uncomfortable. The sound is also not that big of a deal. I need them for my amp so I had no intensions of using it for anything else. I've heard better. And because these aren't very multi task for me and they aren't very comfortable I'm going to return them. 50 dollars is still a lot of money to pay for something from this brand. Hopefully my other headphones will do the job."
"Mine came with a broken aux cord. I messaged the seller about a possible replacement just for the cord and, predictably, they did not get back to me. That being said, the headphones themselves worked great when I bought myself another cord. My only complaint is that I have larger ears, and they're pierced all to hell, and the ear cups tend to irritate my ears after wearing them for a couple hours. I'm a video editor, so wearing them for a while is kind of important to my workday. I end up taking out my cartilage piercings if I use them for extended periods. Quality is wonderful otherwise though."
You get what you pay for I guess however these are terrible headphones all things considered. I am a huge fan of Sennheiser the brand I would say the best headphones I have ever had are their open backed HD line of studio headphones. These share their name and thats where the similarities end. In audio quality they sound like you are at the end of a tunnel there is a mild echo sharp and miserable eq and the microphone is one of the worst in line microphones I have ever come across for reference 9 dollar Walgreens headphones in line mic blows these out of the water and those are my previous candidate for worst mic ever. The build quality is solid and they are comfortable to wear but all things considered 50$ can bring you a much better experience if spent almost anywhere else. Save your money don't purchase this garbage product.
"These headphones have enough fidelity that I was picking out new details from my favorite songs. They also have less distortion than cheaper headphones. The bass is disappointing however. Tonally they are neutral, but sounded quite cool the first time I put them on. They are comfortable enough to wear for a couple of hours, but they are not nearly as comfy as other headphones I have owned."
"Nice amount of noise reduction, they're soft and cushiony, but man these things fit TIGHT. Feels like my skull is being squeezed no matter how I adjust them, and I'm a small woman. We're these made for children?"
For the money I expected a better fit and better sound quality. Will be sending them back. These things hurt my ears and they have a weird shape to them. Maybe more suitable for a child.
I have a lot of headphones. these are just ok.
"Comfortable to wear, but quiet and sound quality isn‚Äôt great.  For the price it was fine?"
"The worst part is the top of the head -- the padding is way too thin and after awhile it becomes really uncomfortable. The padding should be about 1/4 inch thicker.The ear cups aren't bad but the padding should be 1/8 inch thicker.Great sound, definitely sound awesome, nice bass response and crisp highs that don't hurt your ears. The mid-range is on-point.Overall I'd recommend if you catch them on sale."
Plug comes out of my phone very easily. Very comfortable well built headset. Sound reproduction is very inaccurate. Sad because these had such potential. I'll probably give these to my kids to use for school.
"It's an okay headphone. It's really unconfortable, but for the price kinda makes up for it. not recommended for long sessions."
"For something in this price range, the sound comes through exceptionally clear. However, these are smaller than you're probably expecting, and that leads to two problems:-Although the cups are advertised as over-ear, they're quite small to the point of only barely fitting around my (rather average-sized) ears. Do NOT buy this if you have large ears.-No matter how much you adjust it, the headband always feels as though it's pressing into my skull. Incredibly uncomfortable for extended use. The only form of padding it has is a thin (rubber?) strip that easily gives way to the plastic underneath. These headphones almost feel as if they were designed to fit a child. I've never worn any headphones with a headstrap this uncomfortable. When I want to listen to music, I'd rather not feel like I've strapped a nutcracker around my head. I'll try to tough it out but I can't help but feel I'm probably going have to return these eventually."
"I should preface that I'm coming from having a pair of Beats Solo 3s to these, but I was looking for something that is reasonably priced as headphones realistically shouldn't be over $100 in my opinion, so I opted for these because they were just over $60 and I figured if they were good enough I wouldn't mind.I genuinely mean this when I say it - You are better off buying a pair of $20 headphones from walmart buying from the impulse section. They definitely hold up as Noise Cancelling, (I was whistling and humming away and didnt hear myself once) but they feel like they're crushing your skull by how small they are, and they sound like they have a plastic bag on the speakers. The audio just really is the worst quality I think I've ever had."
"Before I start this review.I am not an audiophile.I'm using these purely for gaming and ofc sometimes listen to music.In terms of comfort, these are the 2nd worst pair of headphones i've ever worn.In terms of sound QUALITY, they are the worst. Even my cheap mystery meat chinese bluetooth headphones sound better. Even my AKG earbuds that came with my Samsung phone sound better.The only thing these things have is okay bass.Everything sounds like it's under water and almost all the details are gone.And to top it all off, these are BARELY over ear headphones.I am a small person and as such do not have big ears and these barely go over my ears.So right away when putting them on my ears were immediately annoyed and hurting.If you're reading this wondering what my deal is.My issue is people who review products after using them for merely 5 seconds.I gave them one night and couldn't take it. My ears were hurting and the insane drop in audio quality drove me mad.$70 isn't a lot but for Sennheiser it should of been way more than this.Go for AKGs instead."
"When my HD 202s got a short in one ear, I started shopping for a replacement. Was pretty excited about getting these, since the 202s sounded AMAZING! and these appeared to be a step up.To my disappointment, this was not the case. They sound muffled, like something is covering the speakers. I bought some $20 Amazon brand that sound way better than these. (They sound pretty great, actually.) But I still missed the sound of the 202s and found a couple of pairs on another sight.These are more comfortable than the 202s, I'll give them that. And better constructed, as 202s are kinda fragile. And I would definitely want to try more expensive Sennheiser headphones before purchasing them considering their cheapest, no long produced, model is the best I've ever heard."
the cord came in twisted and about 2-3 months of use it stops working and need readjusted
I used them mainly for gaming a few hours per weeks and they did fine for about a year but abruptly quit working on the right side. I tried all the troubleshooting techniques but to no avail. They‚Äôre acceptable quality for the money but only lasting a year is a bummer.
I expected more for sound quality but it's ok. The ear cushions does get a little uncomfortable after a while to the point where you feel you have to take the headphones away from you for a bit. The foldable option is pretty handy though.
"These headphones are great for music, but my ears ache not long after putting them on. My search for a great sounding AND comfortable pair of headphones continues."
"These headphones would be ""around ear"" if your ears were the size of an infant, otherwise they are ""ON ear"" headphones. Very disappointing all around.. (except they're not around)"
"These don't go over the ear, they are half-on half-over. The bridge over the top of the head is a little short. The sound quality is good, however people said that the microphone seemed a little muffled. I think this was due to orientation, make sure that the little mic hole is pointing forwards."
"Bought this headset based on overall reviews. I don't know what these people were listening to, but it definitely wasn't the equipment I received. The sound on this set has no depth, no bass, and very little volume. I don't listen to my sound turned all the way up, either. This was my first purchase of a Sennheiser product, and will undoubtedly be my last. I was theoretically trading up from my old JVC bluetooth, but this wasn't ""up"" in any context.Returning today."
"Durable, but not the sharpest sound quality, a let down for the brand name."
"Loved the sound of these but the problem was the comfort level. They made the top of my head hurt quite often. Which was unfortunate for me since the sound was great. But they may fit perfectly on you, just giving a cautious tale of a thick skulled person lol."
"big sound for the price.  small ear cups. small for me, and I do not have big ears.  other reviews mentioned these made their ears hot.  I doubted.  but they do."
"I bought these to replace my apple came-with-the-phone ear buds. I gotta say, these are maybe less sound quality at a higher price. The ear cups were too narrow and were painful right at the get go. The build quality was excellent but the fit was off, and the sound quality was very poor. Very low bass (which is not typical for Sennheiser) and the high's were tinny, vocals were sometimes fuzzy (Dua Lipa and Kendrick Lamar were my trial voices) and audiobooks were even worse. Cannot recommend, returned."
"You get what you pay for. The only thing these headphones offer is comfort, the sound quality is bad and noise isolation is decent. These are neither good for music nor for meetings."
dont work when using phone call on iphone
"Audio quality is comparable to living in an apartment and your neighbor is playing music through a subwoofer, The treble is super condensed and the headphones try to compensate with heavy bass. These headphones also aren't very comfortable, it feels as if it's trying to squeeze your head flat and the top part of the headphones feel as if they aren't padded. If you're looking for cheap headphones, look elsewhere. Sony's 20 dollar headphones are better than these."
"I don‚Äôt have many products from this company but what I have tried were the HD660s and gaming headset and both were decent. These however need a ton of work, low clarity, mid comfort level, zero excitement when listening to music. I‚Äôm sorry for the low star review but y‚Äôall could‚Äôve still offered something better at this price point"
"Why use a proprietary cable for something like that? Absolutely asinine, defeats the entire point. They sound nice, and they're decent value for money but the cable is way too short and good luck swapping it out for a longer one. Seriously, why not just use a normal auxiliary cable? Unreal."
"I am beyond dismayed that this is the quality of Sennheiser products now. Granted this is the low end of their line, but these headphones are just awful. There is no bass response at all and they hurt. I am a small woman, but wear glasses, and while the tight fit did cut out a lot of room noise, they are so tight that they cause pain after only 2 minutes. There is no way to adjust the volume either.I bought these to replace my $12 Gear Head headset. I was blown away by how much worse these Sennheisers sound in comparison."
"Only right ear sounds. I used to have them 3 years ago, but they broke down. I remember them having a good quality so I tried ordering it here, but what arrived was utter trash in terms of quality and the fact that only one of the ears is working on all of my devices. Disappointed. Was waiting for the to arrive and now I am waiting for a refund."
"We've heard a lot about Sennheiser is a brand name headphones of German design.  We decided to try out the Sennheiser 400S around ear headphone.  Although the 400S is considered as an entry-level item.  We were totally disappointed with the total performance of the unit as a whole.  The treble, mid-range, and bass are all vague.  As for comparison, this headphone is on the same par as the free ones they give on airplanes.  Not much better!"
"Bad experience took a long time to arrive and when the item finally arrived it was damaged, only the right speaker of the headphones sounds, do not make the same mistake as me when buying here, this will be a bad memory, returning it is not an option because the cost It is very high since I am in another country, my hearing aids will go straight to the trash."
"At first I thought my interface was the problem, I'd been troubleshooting with no luck. Finally plugged in my old headphones and they work just fine, feel like I wasted my money and I'm sad. I got them as a gift so by the time I was able to use them, the return window was closed so I can't even get them replaced."
"I honestly wouldn't recommend these headphones to anyone, they're really uncomfortable, I'm wearing them as I'm typing this and I want to take them off. They feel cheap and I expected more from Sennheiser, but at the same time that's what you expect at this price. don't get them, not worth it at all :/"
overall great sound quality but it was too small uwu
Thanks Sennheiser for your misleading product description. Not as described. NOT over the ear.
"It's average headphone, compared with my friend Sony which is cheaper and better noise cancellation."
"Genuinely the worst headphones I've ever tried in both comfort and sound quality. It should be criminal to charge 50 dollars for these, let alone the full price being 70 dollars. They clamp onto your head stronger than a vice and are so narrow they rest entirely on your ears. You'd get better sound quality, and probably comfort, by taping 2 tin cans to your ears with earbuds inside them."
"I use it once a week for 1 hr class. After 5 months, it feedback me loud mechanical  ""be be .... ""  sounds. I can not wear it anymore."
"The headphones were great, until they developed a short and no sound to one side at all.  They last less that six months."
Presses the ears too hard and combined with sounds creates painful sensation. No go.
Very disappointed. Arrived with product package sealed open!
"Product has something wrong, there is a high pitch whine whenever plugged into any device.  Sound quality is very poor.  Microphone has an echo that makes me sound like I am in a cave.  These are unusable."
"Uncomfortable, cheap feeling, flimsy things and mine was defective right out of the box.Nice one, Senny."
"have aways been happy with Sennheier Headphones, I was with this pair until one side went dead after about four weeks of use. Too late to return so not much recourse open to me"
This product shipped broken. Audio only played from one side. Waste of time.
"the bass on these is the worst I've never heard. I was playing drums, too."
"Terrible sound quality, sounds like every sounds is coming out of a walkie talkie. Not even that comfortable :/ not worth the money"
Cable broke within the first day.
"To echo what was said in other reviewes, the cups are much smaller than expected given the description, to the point of being uncomfortable."
Sound quality is bad!
"Product needs to be removed from market, not good.."
"Terrible product and by the time I discovered it it was not returnable.Poor, misleading advertising"
"I like these headphones, the audio is great and it looks slick.However, the material the cushions are made of are of terrible quality, or at the very least not suitable for the intended use.They crackle and come apart way too soon, making the headphones look terrible and  leaving bits of itself in and around your ears."
Headphones only had 1 working ear and the sound quality was terrible.
"There's not enough bass in these without using an equalizer. And if I use the Spotify equalizer on my Pixel 4a with these, the volume is too low. Disappointed."
"Sound quality is muffled, pure rubbish. It ruins the whole experience. Don‚Äôt expect quality sound from these.I ordered these thinking it‚Äôs good German quality and engineering which turned out far from it. What you‚Äôre essentially paying for is the trademark.I regret purchasing these. I‚Äôve purchased cheaper, better products."
"As for sound quality the headphone were good.I had an issue with the mic were it was not recognizing my voice, as if it was muting me slowly, also it was detecting the sound from the headphone itselfI ordered a replacement and it was the same issue"
"I've got several other Sennheizer models.This one though had a very, very canny sound, a bass ""boost"" that was just far too heavy, and all in all just terrible sound coming out.It's really a shame as I hoped for this 18 Ohm impedance headset to be louder than my old Sennheizer (301) BTH I couldn't listen to these for either speach nor music."
My old pair of HD400s finally started giving me issues after a couple years of use and i was delighted with them in terms of build and sound quality so immediately ordered another pair. The replacement pair instantly felt poorer quality material and the sound quality really poor and comparative to low end cheap nasty products. Really disappointed.
Unfortunely was really uncomfortable. The padding was too thin and the actual head set was more of an on-ear instead of over-ear. Sent them back.
"I'm really not a picky audiophiles with high standards, I just want an okay sound for a decent price, but I was surprised by how flat and muddy the sound is at low volume which is how I prefer to listen to my music. It's not terrible, but far from great, especially compared to my Audiolux, which were cheaper.The 400s are also really uncomfortable on all contact points. I would not recommend"
"I would recommend Sennheiser's older model HD206 over this one, they are larger, cheaper and more comfortable. Sound quality difference isn't noticeable."
"Quality of audio is poor for music. Very muffled, too much bass. Just acceptable for video. I really wanted something for recording monitors and this wasn't it.Also the mini jack is bespoke so you cant change the wire."
"These earphones are very light, portable, easy to pack due to how it folds. Sound quality is decent for the size, but a little disappointing for the price - it sounds slightly muffled and slightly bassier than it ought to be. The closed back design is supposed to help with noise isolation, but I've used open-back headphones with noise isolation that was about as effective.Being that this is a lightweight/portable set of headphones, the pads/cups are smaller than one might like, and only just about cover the ears. The padding is quite stiff, and probably is expected to soften with use. The padding on the upper part (connecting the two cups) is almost non-existent - it's essentially just a thin layer of rubber. The item as a whole feels a little bit too tight and uncomfortable, even when adjusted, perhaps due to the lack of padding on the central band - it doesn't sit right on the top of your head if you loosen it, but if you tighten it, the left/right pads squeeze your head more than is preferable.As a lightweight headphones set for travel it does it's job, but the issues with sound quality and comfort make the sale price somewhat unreasonable."
"I purchased the Sennheiser HD 400S headphones with high expectations, given the brand's reputation for delivering exceptional audio quality. Initially, the headphones lived up to their promise, providing an immersive and rich sound experience. However, my enthusiasm was short-lived as the headphones unexpectedly broke after less than a year of use.Regrettably, the headphones failed to live up to the expected durability standards, tarnishing the otherwise commendable audio performance and comfort they offered. Given the high cost and the expectation of a premium product, the lack of durability is a significant drawback. If Sennheiser addresses these build quality issues in future iterations, the HD 400S could potentially be a top-tier headphone choice. Until then, potential buyers should approach with caution and consider alternative options with a more robust construction."
"I never had an issue with over-ear headphones until I tried these ones on. The ear-cups really are much small than any typical over-ear headphones. I've owned other over-ear headphones such as V-Moda's and even the competitor to this headphone: the MPOW H17 (which is now the Infurture H1). The sound signature of these headphones is mostly flat with a bias towards treble rather than bass.The headband cushioning is so minimal, that I truly believe it would be more comfortable without any cushioning at all. After 15 minutes I feel as though I have a dent on the top of my head. The ear-cups are well-made but are just far too small - and I don't have big ears (despite the headline). Overall, I wouldn't recommend this headphone simply because of the headband. You may be satisfied with it if you've got a smaller head with smaller ears, but for me, it's going to be a pass."
"I don't recommend this for people that intend to use for long sessions, that use glasses or that have an above average size ear/head. A lot of people complain the earcups are too small and that is true, but for me the worse is the adjustment not going far down enough to properly align the cups to the ears, so it ends up with the hard plastic band pressed even more strongly against a small area on the top of the head, the ears also hurt when using glasses.The sound has quality but is mid heavy, it makes the voice pop out and the rest gets more distant. It bothers me to have to stop just enjoying the song to look for the parts I cant hear. That is good for some music genres, specially the mainstream ones which makes sense from a design point of view and explain why so many people praise Sennheiser. To me it is the worst headphone I ever tried, using ¬£5 earbuds don't bother me this much, even with lower quality sound the music feels more complete and it doesn't hurt."
"For the price you're paying for these headphones, the sound quality is quite poor; there's very little bass or low end, everything sounds pretty flat and lacking dynamics.I've tried using them on different devices, I've tried changing the EQ, I've used them for music and podcasts and everything just sounds poor.I have a good number of headphones that range in price, style and manufacturer, and these are the worst sounding headphones I own, it's really unfortunate.I know Sennheiser makes good products, but this is not one of them."
"Pro's - Sound quality was very good. Didn't use them long enough to have much of an opinion on anything else.Con's - very small inflexible ear cups. Even my roomy with really small ears says he couldn't wear them. I would say my ears are average, but these cups push heavily on the front lower part of them where your ear canal is. I tried very hard to get them to sit further forward, but then the back doesn't fit well. And I have glasses so I can't move them much.  The pressure is so hard it gets very painful to wear these all day long. And I sweat with them on. Wish they were fabric covered. I had to buy new ones. I am looking into returning them. Would not buy again or recommend these to anyone."
"THey had a great sound but as soon as i put them on my head i knew i needed to return them. The huge ear cups are super thick and fit on top of your ears instead of around them. super uncomfortable the moment I put them on.IF you prefer that feel, I will say these had great sound for the price."
Too small for the ears (no you do not have but g ears). Too tight on the head. Makes them very uncomfortable & you end up adjusting them every 5 minutes after 5 minutes of just wearing them. Will have to return.
"Not good fitting range pulls my ears upwards. My kids liked it, good sound quality."
"Fast delivery, but the box for an Xmas gift is badly bashed up. The outer packaging had no sign of damage, so it looks like it was packed in this state ...  Great :/"
I purchased these based on two things: (1) the reviews and (2) the price. Boy was I wrong! My Sony's and JBL's sound so much better; there's absolutely no comparison whatsoever.... and my JBL's were less than these. I have the aforementioned brands as well as House of Marley and Bose. These Sennheiser's sound about the same as my HOM but NOTHING like my other brands. Will I return these? No. I'll probably keep them as backups. Would I pay this price again for the quality? Absolutely not. Will I purchase Sennheiser again? Absolutely not. I'll stick with Sony and Bose. Much better sound and the rates they charge are worth it. Sennheiser isn't what it's cracked up to be; that's for certain!
"I'm gonna be honest here these headphones are pretty crap, they really clamp onto your head and feels like a vice at some times. The sound quality is alright for the cost but I probably would not recommend buying a pair unless they're on sale"
*Good Bass* Tight sound stage good mid  Light highsComfort good for hrs of Listening
"It's been a while since I last owned a pair of Beats and I thought these would be better, when in reality, it was just more of the same. The only real good thing I can say about these is that they do, in fact, have great battery life and their design is sleek, but other than that, they just weren't for me.These Beats Solo 4's do come with a carrying case along with the charging cable and an AUX cable for wired playback, which I appreciate. The headphones fold up compactly and they are easy to transport, but I do have one issue with the folding mechanism that I'll talk about later. The headphones are lightweight and small, and the design is great. The headphones are easy to adjust for your head size, and the ear pads have modest cushioning. The Bluetooth pairing is simple, and on my iPhone I was immediately prompted when they were powered on to connect them.Now, let me talk about the sound quality. Unlike the older Beats which were mostly bass focused, in my opinion, these headphones were much more neutral with a flatter EQ that I generally prefer. It makes game audio richer when listening for enemies, it makes background instruments in songs more vibrant and focused, and it just allows you to hear things more how they truly sound. Except, something went wrong with the treble or the midtones or something as they were extremely sharp sounding. Most music sounds great and it is harder to notice this sharpness unless the volume is loud, but for listening to podcasts or watching online videos- that sharpness is extremely noticeable, especially in people with softer speaking voices as they sound almost whispy with sharp ""s"" and ""t"" sounds. These sharper voices almost make it sound like people or hissing as they talk and I just couldn't get over it. Admittingly, this issue is much less noticeable when using them wirelessly with my phone where I have more direct control of the EQ, but when using them wired on my PC or through my PlayStation controller, that ability to adjust the EQ diminishes. For movies or well produced content, some of that issue is more mild, but as a huge online content consumer, who mainly uses them wired, it was just not my taste. I know some won't have this issue, and I just might be more sensitive to it, but that was my experience.Furthermore, we have to talk about my other complaints. First off, the hinge mechanism for holding the headphones is a bit dangerous if you have your hands near it when storing them, as I got my finger badly pinched a couple of times while doing just this. That may not be an issue for some, but I feel like I won't be the only person to experience that. Additionally, the comfort could be a bit better. Despite the headphones being lightweight, the clamping force on the ear cups is still very strong and after just an hour of wearing them I would begin to get migraines from the pressure. My head is fairly normal sized, and even when adjusting the headband to be looser, that experience didn't stop. The headband itself is also not that comfortable. The headband, which has a silicone-like padding, gets very thin and flattens out a lot as your body heat from your head warms it up. After a while, you will feel that the headband starts to sink a bit more into your scalp before it becomes uncomfortable. Once again, all of this is just my experience, but worth mentioning.The main thing I can say is that the battery life is actually really good. They seem to charge quickly, and I haven't had issues with leaving the charger connected which destroyed one of my older Beats Studios from years ago. The battery seems to last forever as you scroll through videos, watch movies and play mobile games before that recharge is necessary.Overall, I ultimately returned these headphones. Not because they were bad, but just because they weren't a good fit for me. The sharpness in some voices over the wired connection was hard to ignore, and the migraine inducing pain from the poor comfort also wasn't worth the subpar experience I was having. While these headphones may still be great for a lot of people, I had to share my thoughts to be as honest as possible."
"I picked these up during Prime Deal days and have to say, it was way less than what I expected when it comes to quality. First, these are not cloud pink, they look more like beige with the exception of the metal connector piece which is rose gold. Second, the size of the ear covers and band seem to be built more for an 8 yr old. I don't have a big head but I prefer that my ears be covered for headphones rather than just sitting right on them as I am more likely to get headaches from them. When I adjusted these to fit, even though there is a small cushion on the upper bar, you cannot really feel it. It feels like a bar pressing on the top of your head. I knew right away, definitely not for me. If it was not for my son asking if he could take them, I would have sent these back quickly. I've owned other brands such as Bose, Sony, and yes, other Beats, but these are a step down.What is good?Paired easily with my iPhoneSound was clearGood fit for a child"
"Nice sleek updated look.  Charging port updated to usbC.  Good sound quality. Still lacks volume, but simular to solo 3. The deal breaker was the ear pain.  It applied so much pressure to my ears I felt like I was in a vice. I couldn't take it and had to return them. I'm  still searching for suitable headphones,  but have decided that for me, overear headphones are better.If you have small ears and/or wear glasses be warned, these might be painful for you.Update:Still waiting on my refund. They first stated Nov 30, now Dec 10. No explanation. These where returned with nothing wrong with them. I'm not sure what's delaying the refund.Just be sure you want this particular model and that it fits. The return process IS NOT easy. I'll update if I ever see my refund.12/5 update: They completed the refund today. I use Amazon A Lot and that is built on trust.  Beats are good headphones. This was just not a good match for me. I'm so glad this is completed."
"Just got these Beats Solo 4s today, and I really wanted to love them. Let‚Äôs start with the good stuff: the sound quality is amazing, the battery life is solid, and the look? Stunning. I got the cloud pink, and it‚Äôs even prettier in person. These headphones are almost everything I wanted‚Ä¶ almost.Now the bad news: they‚Äôre super uncomfortable. After just 30 minutes, my ears are throbbing and feeling pretty warm. It‚Äôs not really the heat that‚Äôs the problem‚Äîit‚Äôs the tight clamping. My ear cartilage just can‚Äôt handle the squeeze! I feel like I‚Äôm trying to ""break them in"" like a stiff pair of shoes, but I have this feeling it‚Äôs not going to get any better with time.I knew about this from reading other reviews, but the sale price tempted me to try anyway. I‚Äôll give them another shot, but honestly, the discomfort is intense enough that I‚Äôm considering a return. The sound and style are top-notch, but when it hurts this much, it's hard to enjoy them. I‚Äôll update this if I have a change of heart, but right now, it‚Äôs looking like these might not be the headphones for me."
I got these when they were on sale for $100. I saw they had pretty strong reviews and figured if I wanted to try them out this was a good opportunity.These are fine. The sound is pretty decent. There is no noise cancelation which for $100... I feel there should be?They come with a case and an aux cable which apparently they can be used with if the battery is dead which is pretty cool.They are well made and the Bluetooth sync is very fast.For this money I wish I had just bought another level up in my Soundcore headphones.Take my opinion with a grain of salt. I'm not someone who buys things for the brand and I am not any sort of sound professional. But in my opinion there are plenty of similarly priced/ much less expensive  headphones that are a better value.
"I've tried a lot of over the ear headphones and these may be my least favorite. After my son broke my beats Studio headphones, I didn't want to spend that much money again so figured I'd try the solo beats. The studios lasted me about 2 years and the comfort/sound quality was top teir.The solo beats were crazy uncomfortable!! The tops of my ears started hurting only an hour into wearing them. Maybe I have a weird shaped head because I could hardly make them fit properly without the pain. The sound quality is okay. The bass sometimes give out and they're not as noise canceling as I prefer. I'd say spend the extra money and get a better pair. I gave these to my son after only a month and ended up switching to The Bose Quietcomfort headphones. 10/10."
"Bought these after reading all the rave reviews. Wore them for a couple hours while working and realized I was getting a headache because it felt like my ears and head were in a vice grip. The sound was alright but the small earphones made noise cancelling not work very well. I decided to let my 13 year old daughter have them much to her excitement and she came to me a couple hours later and also stated they were too tight.I'd like to think we don't have alien heads...they seem relatively normal sized...so I am concerned how there are so many good reviews when these are TINY.Went with a nice pair of Bose headphones for me and Sony for my daughter. Better sound, better noise cancelling, better fit!"
"Pros:- Sound is good. I'm not an audiophile so I couldn't tell you how it compares to other headphones at this price range, but I like what I hear.- Battery is amazing. Battery was less than 50% when I bought it, haven't charged it yet despite using it for about 5 hours a day for nearly a week.Cons:- Ear pads are small, I was hoping the cups where a bit bigger and went over my ears instead of on stop of them.- The pressure these put on your ears will make it extremely uncomfortable after a while, especially if you wear glasses.- Not very moisture resistant, not good for working out."
"I bought a pair during the $99 sale to replace my old Beats by Dr Dre Studio 3 which I received as a gift in 2020. I loved my old Beats compared to my new pair. The new Solo4 are smaller and sit on top of the ear so after a while they become uncomfortable. The soft case they came in is smaller with a smaller zip pocket, so it‚Äôs somewhat awkward to take the headphones in and out of the case. The battery life is great so far and easy to pair with multiple devices. I also love the slate blue color. Overall I wish I had paid more for Studiopro or a different brand."
I really wanted to like these! They are so cute and the different color options makes it fun. But that being said I was a tad disappointed. First off I didn‚Äôt know there was a difference between ‚Äúactive‚Äù noise cancelling and noise cancelling. So when I found that the cushion was what was noise cancelling that was a let down. For a while wearing the headphones were fine but after a while they hurt my ears. Which I was surprised by. Battery life is great. Price is decent. But for what I was wanting in a pair of headphones it didn‚Äôt work for me.
"I have always been one to ignore Beats headphones, but recently, I decided to try a pair of the Beats Studio Pros because they were on an irresistible sale. I was more impressed with them than I thought, even with some of their shortcomings.Which is why I decided to give the new Solo 4s a try. For me, these simply didn't have enough for me to keep them in my collection, particularly given that I own the Studio Pros.Recently, I have become a fan of on-ear headphones (as distinct from over-ear). I own the Skullcandy Riff 2, the Sony WH-CH520, and the JBL Live 670. The Solo 4s are the only ones I've returned. And it's not because they were so offensive or horrible; they simply didn't add anything to my collection.First of all, the clamping force was inordinately tight for my head. Normally, this doesn't bother me. But these simply were too uncomfortable from the moment I put them on, and they only got worse the longer I wore them.Then there was the sound. Like I said, I own the Beats Studio Pros, and have an appreciation for what they are and what they do. Even though they don't have the ability to be EQed, which I prefer, I like them in and of themselves and enjoy the sound they provide. The Solo 4s are similar in that they are a what-you-get-is-what-you-get sound. In this case, however, I found myself wishing for an equalizer. They sounded thin and harsh, not full like the Studio Pros.When I compared them to my other Bluetooth headphones, I couldn't justify keeping them in the collection. To be fair, there was a lot to like about them: the iPhone and Android compatibility, the folding design, the carrying case, and the look/style. However, the comfort and sound were just too much of a negative for me.I can see that many people will like these a lot, and I'm glad. They fill a niche and they fill it well. But for me, there are just too many other options I like better."
As far as sound quality its pretty good. I like the spatial audio feature for some songs. Im assuming thats what it is when i turn my head i can hear the sound coming more into that ear. Anyway besides that the comfort I want to give a 1. These beats 4 solo start to hurt my hears after about 30 minutes of use. Maybe the ear cushion is too small. Not sure. I prefer the studio for comfort. I can wear those all day.
"I purchased because I wanted to get a pair of nicer headphones that would last a long time with good sound. The sound is good, but comparable to $20 -$30 headphones I‚Äôve had in the past for mostly listening to books & music. They hurt to wear for long. My hair kept getting wrapped around them when taking them off.  Too expensive to have so many issues."
"I did not like these and I returned them to Amazon. These were designed for low bass listening and do not have a good range. Evidently when studying these, I learned that they were not an upgrade to the beat solo 3's but simply a different kind of headphone for people who do not like heavy bass. I do. It's not that they don't have good clear sound, it is that they sound very flat because of the low bass response. I go to a lot of concerts and I like my music loud and proud. These are not the headphones for me. I returned them and got beat solo 3's which have a very heavy bass response. Be aware that these headphones cannot be manipulated properly even with an equalizer on your source. It will not bring up the bass enough. If you do not care about the bass, then try these headphones out and see if you like them. They are certainly high quality and crystal-clear. I need a heavy bass and so they are not for me."
I got these during Black Friday sale (apparently the same sale that they‚Äôve had even to this day) and they turn my ears red after 15 min. If you have any piercings I would not get these I have the basic two and my cartilage done. If you have smaller ears or no piercings they arnt bad.
I was expecting a little more considering they‚Äôre beats. Spend the extra few dollars and get the bigger ones. The ‚Äúpros‚Äù or whatever. These play great quality sound but when working out in the gym I still hear outside noise even tho they are on max volume. Not a ‚Äòzone out‚Äô type of headphone
"These headphones are overpriced . I get more bass and better sound out of a 40.00 set of headphones. The main reason I returned them, because they are very uncomfortable , hurt my ears and gave me a headache. Also you have to pay for the app to control them."
"I like the sound. I like the ease with which these headphones pair with Apple TV box. I like that we can pair two sets of headphones at the same time.But I do not like the ear pain, the headache. I ordered ear pads to replace the originals, only to find out they won‚Äôt work with the Beats 4. Did the manufacturer even test these for on their ears for any length of time?  My husband wants to return them as they pain his ears too.  Beats needs to rethink the earpiece. Such a disappointment, considering the excellent sound quality and ease of pairing. Now I will take a Tylenol. Gads."
"Total honesty; you‚Äôre better off buying a pair of AirPods Pro OR paying the extra money for the over-ear Beats‚Ä¶ I have had a few pairs of Beats headphones. 3 on ear style and 1 pair of PowerBeats Pro‚Ä¶ If you like on-ear headphones these are pretty good! But I prefer the previous generations as they had volume and track control from both sides not just the left one like these.The color is beautiful and it‚Äôs probably my favorite thing about these to be honest. Sound quality is good, but despite the high price point; they don‚Äôt have noise cancellation. And It could just be me‚Ä¶ but these seem to cause a bit more ‚Äúsoreness‚Äù in my ears during and for some time after wearing them -for a relatively short period of time as well-.These are definitely a pair of headphones to avoid if you‚Äôre even slightly sensitive to that. It keeps me from wearing them as often as I would like to for what I spent.Another thing that I have noticed is that they seem to be more durable than the previous generations and do hold a charge somewhat longer. Although this gen does not have the led indicators on the side of the ear cup to indicate charging progress and what is left in the battery. Just a single light this time to tell you which mode they‚Äôre in and whether they are currently on."
"I ordered these for Black Friday since I've been needing a new pair. And since they were 1/2 off, I JUMPED at the opportunity! I opened them to try them out and OMG they are so tight my ear felt like they were burning!! DEFINITELY returning them ASAP!"
"The headphones are okay at best. The sound quality is similar to that of headphones that are $30 MAX. The pink color is hardly there, they‚Äôre basically white. Returned them because they work yea but not hardly worth the price"
I loved them and i wear them 1 hour to find out they really uncomfortable they just too small and press in the ears (and i have a small head and small ears if they not comfy for me they probably not for anyone)
I thought they were noise canceling headphones and that‚Äôs the main reason I got them. They also are very small and don‚Äôt fit around the ears. They sound really good and are easy to use
These sound fantastic however I can‚Äôt stand the power button and trying to determine how long to hold it in before it starts up. And the Bluetooth connectivity is a little wonky as well.
"The headphones are good just the sound isn‚Äôt as good as I liked, my AirPods were louder. Turning them on and off is a little weird too."
The sound quality is unmatched but the on ear design is for small people. My ears hurt terribly when wearing these so I am returning them for Beats over the ear
"The headphones are of acceptable quality. Sound is just okay, not outstanding. The headphones are made for smaller heads. They fit too tightly om the ears eventually causing discomfort. Not good for extended wear."
"The sound quality of Beats has always been a little above average.. not the greatest, but not horrible.  Not as good as Sennheiser, but far better than Skull Candy.  The Solo 3 cans were good value travelers.. worth listening to on the road, but if they got broken or stolen you wouldn‚Äôt die of a broken heart (or wallet).  Sadly, this new Solo 4 introduced some size changes.. the most egregious of which is smaller ear cups.  They‚Äôre now painful to wear.. even my youngest daughter and her tiny head can‚Äôt find comfort in these things.  Had to send them back."
Not sure why I spend $129 on a pair of headphones and the sound glitches out when listening to music. Weird. Might return.
Great product. Great sound but I should've just spent the extra $100 dollars for the over ear. These ones sit right on your ear so they fall off and if worn too long they start to hurt.
"I had high hopes for this item.  Had great reviews.I really liked the sound.  It's not in the 'top notch' category, but it's excellent for the price.  The battery life is really incredible....40+ hours...wow.  Although I wish I had read the fine print, and assumed that most Apple type products have the 'sound through' option, or touching a button and being able to hear externally.  This one's on me for not checking.The only issue (a big one), is that these are EXTREMELY uncomfortable on your ears for more than a short amount of time.  I wore them for about 2 hours on a plane to watch a movie, and kept fidgeting with them for comfort.  When I arrived, on the bus trip to the destination, I really thought that I had an ear infection from how achy one of my ears was.  It faded after an hour or so, but the cushions are so small that they can only sit on top of the ears, not around them.  Just didn't work for me.I tried to give them to one of my daughters with smaller ears, and she refused within 15 minutes as she could tell immediately that they would hurt over time.This is just an FYI for anyone who might consider these.  Short term, awesome, long term, no no.  My advice is that if you are in the market for headphones, save your pennies for the higher end over the ears."
"They are soo cute but very uncomfortable. After an hour my ears start hurting. Also, they‚Äôre not that loud and the sound leaks. You could hear everything."
Not what I expected. Not much bass. No volume control on the headset itself.can say the battery life is great. They do fit well.
"My jbl headphones are far superior to these and they are half the price. The sound quality is not that great, wish I never bought them."
I have a Samsung phone charger cord and it doesn't mix for the plug for the headphones...you have to buy an Apple one.
My ears were actually hurting after a while wearing these. Unclear if it the placement on only ears or what ?
"I really liked these headphones (Beats Solo 4) except for the lack of bass frequencies. Comfortable, light, easy to use the controls, good Bluetooth connectivity. But the low frequencies barely exist. They're probably good for listening to audio books or other strictly vocal sources, but if you want to hear a bass guitar or drums, look elsewhere. Odd, considering the reputation Beats has for strong bass sound. They were returned."
I have a Samsung Tav and it will not sync to it. Pretty annoying.
False advertising about noise cancelling. ..They are not
"I wanted to love these *so* badly... I thought about buying these for weeks and weeks before pulling the trigger. I was so sure that I would be thrilled. I was wrong.They are beautiful to look at and the sleek design and tech of them is fantastic. The fit however is not.I have a somewhat small head. Normal size baseball caps and standard size hats like such fit almost loose on me. I have very average size ears. but somehow these headphones are CRUSHING my ears when I wear them. The outer helix (the outside edge) is being crushed down by these, no matter how I position them on my ear.I have spent hours reading tips/tricks for positioning. I have tried flipping L side to R side to try that. I have spent WEEKS stretching them on items to make them fit looser. All of this to no avail. They have literally been worn less than 12 hours in the past 45 days since I've had them. I have been stretching them THE ENTIRE REST OF THAT TIME. Still, they are unbearably painful within 30 minutes of putting them on.I have to say- this is one of the most disappointing purchases I've ever made. I am very upset that I invested all of this time trying to ""stretch them"" to let them break in over the past month and a half (losing the ability to return them now...) because so many reviews online assure you that it is simply a 'breaking in period' and that stretching will assuage the problem. It did not help even in the slightest.Your mileage may vary- as they say, but just keep in mind that these are ON EAR headphones.. not over ear. It makes an incredible amount of difference."
"So I just ordered these today and they came in on time but i‚Äôm trying them out and noticed that even if my volume is at half you can still hear my music, tv show, tiktok, anything. not worth the $130 i paid for it. probably will return"
I was so excited about this pink headphones but unfortunately I had to send them back bc they are very uncomfortable:( the sound and colors are super pretty but I am not willing to sacrifice looks for comfort
"Sounds just like or worse then my air pods. Bought on prime day because they were on sale. Back up headphones at best, if I paid full price I‚Äôd return for sure."
Very tight even after loosening. Tight pressure on my ear so I cannot wear them long‚Ä¶ left ear is left sore. Definitely returning. Other than that I have no issue sound and clarity of great.
"It worked the first day, then stopped. I'm frustrated because I was so excited to utilize these headphones  I've tried every thing, gonna have to return or exchange."
"A little disappointed,  the beats solo 4  don't hold up to their name.  They sound good but don't have the bass ."
These do not perform as well as apple AirPods. They are only slightly compatible with iPhone  they stay connected even when off your head.They do not work well for phone calls. There is an echo of your voice. Also if you walk and talk you can hear your footsteps in your ears with each step‚Ä¶.thud thud. They also slip off my head when moving around
So tight on my head and it made my ears sore (they were so tight).
"Really nice product and colour, the earpieces are just a tad bit too small for full grown adult."
The wrapper around headphones inside the box clearly states 40 HOURS of battery life NOT 50 HOURS as the description states. I have Beats 3 and one reason i bought these was for the extra 10 hours of battery life. This is misleading! The color is a very nice pale pink. Others have said not pink at all but they are pink. The charging cable that comes with it will need an additional connection so just get it. i wasnt thrilled about that! be sure and read carefully. i thought who doesnt include USB chargers now?? The black case included is so hard to get hand in that I almost broke headphones getting them out. I am a small woman and could barely get my hand in? why? adding a couple of inches to the zipper would have been so nice. i will have to switch out the case with my retiring Beats 3. Ive not used them yet so I cant say how good they are. i was so disappointed at this point that I wanted to post the review now. I might update after using‚Äîwhen i can find the connectors to charge them
"These headphones are okay. Sound quality is alright, but should be better for the price. The headphones themself are very small, I wear a medium sized helmet and these headphones hurt my ears after about 20-30 minutes of wearing. In addition they will get caught in long hair, pulling it out. I would not necessarily recommend these."
"They are very good when they work. Sometimes only one side of the headphones work and you have to plug the headphones in to get the one side to work again. But when they do work they are amazing, they are loud, comfortable, and fit well, they just aren‚Äôt very reliable."
They are comfortable and stylish.  The sound is great but nothing like Bose.  Anyway it would have been nice if they included a connector for the cables. You have to go searching for these and just another money grab out of my wallet.  DISAPPOINTED!
"The sound is good, it seems like mic for conference calls is good too, and battery life. But they are not comfortable at all. After wearing them for 15 - 20 minutes my ears start to hurt, which didn't happen with other headphones I've had before."
"Good sound, but you can't wear them for more than a half hour without taking them off and rubbing your numb ears back into existence. Just not enough padding around phones, and the ear cup isn't big enough for an adult."
"My Beats Studio 3 finally quit working, I bought these to replace them. The sound is fine, but the muffs are too small and sit directly on your ear lobes. My ears actually start to hurt rather quickly, bummer."
"I work from home and sometimes need a headset so I don‚Äôt disturb the household. I can hear beautifully with this set however, when I am speaking it keeps cutting out. Sometimes the Bluetooth connection drops too."
"First let me give the positives, I like the color and the fact that it‚Äôs on sale for $120. The 50 hours of running time is also a huge plus, and when you have this on, you can‚Äôt hear much except the music you‚Äôre listening to but it‚Äôs definitely not noise-canceling nor does it claim to be. With that said, I should have maybe read more reviews. I‚Äôm not a sound expert, but I do know that compared to my Apple AirPod pro earbuds, this sound is extremely lacking. There‚Äôs not enough bass. Then there‚Äôs the snugness. This starts to actually hurt my ears after 20 mins or so, and I‚Äôm not even wearing any earrings nor do I have a huge head! Just regular-sized head, adult female, who‚Äôs never had discomfort wearing over-the-ear headphones. I sadly will be returning these and look for something better."
I was so excited to get my first pair of beats. The case was cool that they came in. The sounds is great but they hurt my ears to wear them üò≠ Which is very disappointing as I bought them to wear while at the gym
"The new Beats Solo 4 are not as comfortable as my previous Beats Solo 3. Like everything today it‚Äôs made cheaper and costs more. The ear cups are much smaller than the previous model, the padding is much less also, this makes for a less enjoyable listening experience. Also, outside sound gets in unlike the previous model. An other issue is that they should include a usbc to 3.5 mm adapter . They included a 3.5mm to 3.5 mm adapter, this does no good if you want to connect an iPhone or iPad to your headphones and not use the battery. I had to order one from Amazon at an added expense of $13.00. Apple is so cheap. Add the cable and charge a couple of dollars more to save me the inconvenience."
there are cheaper headphones out there that are just as good. the fit is a little small.
the beats ain‚Äôt no sound proof when i have it all the way up and them ppl b lookin at me in class üòÇ
Super comfy on the ears. Mic quality is okay. Always drop my calls
beats connects to my computer and constantly disconnects from my phone
These Beats hurt my head. They are too tight.
"Loved them when i first got them (they don't come with the charger though), and I'm a bit frustrated that i paid so much just for it to cut out randomly for long intervals randomly. Its not always so I'm fine thugging it out since the quality is so nice but its SO frustrating and I cant find info on fixing it"
"Sounds a little muffled, but some music I listen to sounds really good I'm only rating this product at 3 star only had it for a few days though, I have had headphones cheaper that sound better, the fit is a little tight but not really too bad for me"
"I first ordered the pink headphones for my birthday. They were tight on my ears, charging was fine but then after a few days they started to just disconnect from my calls. I returned the pink headphones and is still waiting on my $140 refund üôÑ I ordered the black and gold hoping that it was just a fluke. Nope. This pair is not charging. It has been on the charger for 8 hours and it is not even half way charged. I‚Äôm going to send this pair back as well and order A pair of raycons and pray for the best."
I bought these for my pink-loving 6 year old for an international flight. She was disappointed I didn‚Äôt get her pink. I think that tells you how white these are.
"pretty solid average beats headphones, decent quality for the price, however i got the color cloud pink and it wasn‚Äôt really pink at all, but instead a beige/brown/ very very faint white purple color. this really disappointed me as i did a lot of looking around for specifically pink headphones before deciding purchasing these ones.  i ordered silicone pink headphone covers to cover up the odd purple grey color that they are, just wish they were a more visible pink color, or even marketed as the purple ish grey they are. hoped this help clarify color of product for you!"
"I was so excited to receive these. My daughter has the solo 3's and I love them. Pairing them to my Android phone was super simple. Hit play on my favorite song. The first few seconds my thoughts were ""are these broken? "" Where's the bass? They sound like bright mid section with a lot of tweeter. Cant be I thought, there must be a way to adjust the sound. Nope. Did some online research and realize these are nothing like the prior beats. They are designed with a lot less bass in mind. No EQ either. For me they hurt my ears. Unless you're using these to listen to jazz or Beethoven they might provide a clear sound however for a rocker like myself they do not cut the bill. At the same time I ordered JBL live 460 for my wife. I played those and immediately the sound I was looking for was present. Warm and thumping. Plus they have ANC, EQ and Alexa built in at a smaller price point. I am now JBL fan and beats lost me. Was hoping to love these but they're going into the return pile. like others I just can't justify spending more money for something that does not bring my ears joy."
The two stars are for the great battery life and nice color. There are no other pluses. The sound is mediocre and doesn't get loud enough. Doesn't fully noise cancel and poorly insulated because you can hear anything I'm listening too from outside. I wish I would have sent it back but I tried to give it chance so probably too used to send back and lost original packing. Stuck with these expensive paper weights till i find someone who wants them as a free giftUpdate. I really hate these. Buy JVC products. This sound is so bad. Should have stuck with what I know...
Loved the quality of sound but with eye glasses and the size I found my ears hurting and hot. But if that doesn‚Äôt bother you a great product.
Nothing mentioned on head size before l purchasedI was approved to return but my time limit expired
I didn't want refund I wanted exchange product for same one it was not charging
"The Beats 4 headphones deliver decent sound, are easy to pair and have a lengthy life between charges. But, and it is a big BUT, they hurt your ears and head after an hour or so of wearing. I guess that is the tradeoff for limiting outside noise -- a very tight fit is the Beats form of noise cancellation -- but it comes at a steep cost in terms of comfort. I don't think I would purchase them again."
"Bought 2 of these, one for me and another for my husband. They are constantly falling off our heads when working out and have fallen on the floor a few times. Doesn‚Äôt seem like there is any way to adjust the fit. Also, noise canceling seems to work on his but I can hear everything with mine. My husband said today he was going back to the beats because these are so annoying."
"I think I have an average sized head with average ears.  So I was surprised at how tight and uncomfortable these headphones are. Visually, these are nice looking headphones.  And they look like they have thick padding.  But when actually worn, it just seems the pads are either too small or shaped strangely.  I couldnt imagine wearing these for an extended amount of time.  I will go back to my airpods."
"I searched ""Noise Cancelling Headphones"" on Amazon and these came up.  I ordered because I needed them quickly and they offered same day delivery.  I got them and set them up.  The television was on behind me and I could hear it with the music playing!  I couldn't believe it!  When I went back to the description, down in the frequently asked questions, it is stated that they are NOT noise canceling.  I feel like it's a bait and switch.  I am returning them and ordering Bose, which I know are definitely noise canceling.  It's such a pain to have to return these."
"Packaging perfect, instructions bare minimum on 3 x 5 folding card. Paired with TV via Bluetooth transmitter, sound not same as speakers and latency obvious. Reset headset and paired with iPad but no sound while iPad was playing music loud and clear.  Reset again and paired momentarily then dropped connection.  Repeated reset and pairing a dozen times, sometimes iPad showed window that pairing was in progress, another showing ""99% complete"" and each time window showed window ""not paired, reset and try again.""  Set return, repacked and wrote this brand off.  Terrible, painful experience!  Ordered a Sony headset!"
"These are great, don‚Äôt get me wrong. The look and sound are exactly what I was looking for, but the fit is just not great. The ear size is almost like a youth size and ended up hurting my ears after 20mins of wearing them. I can‚Äôt pay this type of price for headphones I can‚Äôt even wear for more than 20 minutes."
"I have to admit, my mother was right, you get what you pay for! I have had these for these past few hours and my ears are killing me!! I thought by adjusting the headband it would be more comfy but, nope! I came back to see if I bought children‚Äôs headphones but nooo these are adult. I will be returning these in the morning."
"They seem like a $40 pair of headphones at the price of $200. The only thing they have going for them is a sleek design. The sound quality isn't very far above the bar, the cushions are uncomfortable, and there is 0 noise canceling capabilites. Sure they're not over-the-ear but I figured they'd have something going for them."
"The product quality looks to be good, however there is no way I can comfortably use it. I have a small head and they just do not go small enough to fit correctly over my ears. I would have to wear a hat to take up the gap. Not at all useful for those of us with smaller head size"
"The Beats Solo 4 deliver on clarity with impressive highs and midrange, and the surround sound effect is surprisingly immersive.Unfortunately, that's where the positives end. These headphones are a massive disappointment in every other aspect, especially if you're expecting the signature bass Beats is known for. There‚Äôs virtually no bass at all, making the overall sound feel flat and lifeless. They don't come close to the Solo 3 or Solo 2. While the surround sound effect might make podcasts or movies somewhat enjoyable, if you're looking to listen to music, these will leave you frustrated.The lack of bass is so glaring that it makes you wonder if these even deserve to carry the ""Beats"" name.They made a pair of Beats, with no beat! These are on sale for a reason. I returned these headphones immediately!"
"These are the most uncomfortable headphones and worse yet the sound isn't equal between each side.  Thought maybe it was me so this weekend I asked my grandson to try them.  He immediately said he'd have to use his iPhone to set the volume equally,  But it was already set to be equal on both sides. And then he mentioned how uncomfortable the top band felt against his head.  When adjusted to the full length they were too long on the ears and still hurt the top of head.  So disappointed.  Puzzled.  Returning"
"The Beats headphones sound great with my Apple phone but it would not sync up to my Samsung 70 inch smart TV. I called Apple technical assistance and they told me I had to buy a coupling unit , ranging from $129 to $149 to listen to the TV through the headphones. I returned them and bought the Bose headphones for $249. Oh well !"
"Absolutely love them! Like others point out the pink isn‚Äôt that pink but honestly they‚Äôre still a very gorgeous pink! I can live without the noise cancellation feature honestly it‚Äôs not that deep, plus the price is better than others which is what sold me tbh! Overall excellent headphonesUpdate: after wearing for a while since the cushion is small your ears will hurt. It‚Äôs not the craziest pain but it‚Äôs not enjoyable"
I have a small head and they are tight on my head and hurt my ears. Not comfortable. Sound quality is good. My hair is also gets caught in the round grooves on the side of the headphones and that is often painfulSo they get a 3 due to sound qualityBut very disappointed in comfort and design.
I‚Äôve been using these headphones over a month now. They sound good and with travel bag you can go anywhere. So if you‚Äôre always on the go try these. The only BUT I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs that you‚Äôre ears hurt a little if you‚Äôre been using them for more than a hour. But if you don‚Äôt mind you can put them on you‚Äôre neck
"I used to have a professional headphones when I was learning to play piano , i have not found any like those , i was thinking the sound quality of these were better , but is not . so if you want some good quality go to the pro, if not you can buy the 30 -40 dollars , they are the same ."
"Unsatisfied with the design. So tight on the head, pinches my ear, gives me a headaches by all the induced pressure. Second beats product I have and I‚Äôm not impressed. The sound is great but the hardware functionality is very low in considering user experience. Sound is great, it links to my phone nicely but I regret buying them for how uncomfortable they are. Don‚Äôt be like me. Listen to the reviews."
"Disappointing. The sound quality is ok, but for $200 I‚Äôd expected it to surpass that of a $40 headphones, but they don‚Äôt.The look is nice, but the shape of the earphones causes so much pain in my ears that I couldn‚Äôt wear them for more than 30 minutes."
My $50 Cowins sounded much better and I could wear those for long periods of time. These... Uncomfortable to wear for ANY amount of time (IMO) and the sound is meh. Probably because they are on the ear instead of over the ear. Lesson learned.
Cannot wear with any earrings and hurt your ears after a short time of wearing.  I also have pretty small ears and head‚Ä¶.  They are not noise canceling and the buds would probably be better and had a lower price point‚Ä¶.  Super disappointed in this purchase‚Ä¶.
"I agree with other reviews, they are a bit too tight and ear padding is small. The main thing that I dislike is that I can hear my steps internally when I walk. I would use these in a plane or any car right. Possibly biking, I haven‚Äôt tried that yet. But not the best for walking. I‚Äôve had no trouble with connectivity or charging. But I do like the color."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            After a few minutes, I found them uncomfortable; my ears started hurting. My old Bose headphones beat the Beats in both sound quality and comfort. While the Beats microphone is suitable for making calls, I primarily bought them for listening to music. Spatial Audio surprised me initially, but they lack a full frequency range, missing both bass and mid tones."
I have small ears. These are phones must‚Äôve been made for kids.  They hurt my ears as the opening is really too small for an adult especially an adult with large ears.  Not comfortable at all.
"These were cute and have their accessories. The noise cancellation is good enough to be aware of your surroundings, but they are a little too tight for my ears. Within 30-40 minutes of wearing them the top of my ears would hurt and turn red. Cute but have to buy some that go over the ears not directly on top. Also, at times the left side would not sound."
Needs more bass and the ear things are small and that‚Äôs coming from a girl with small ears
"But not good, you get what you pay for, definitely a $30 headset because the sound quality is meh"
"For whatever reason often when I press the on and off switch it doesn't work (I don't know why it works sometimes, and other times I jam on the button and nothing). The return window has closed and unfortunately no way to reach support about it. I probably would not buy this product again because of it."
"Unfortunately this headset is not compatible with current version of windows. Windows 11 can recognize that the headset is plugged in, but it does not automatically install any drivers or have pre-installed drivers that are compatible. It simply states, in the system menu, ""Driver is unavailable"". I am forced to return it. Way to go windows... ü§¶"
"Heads up, this headset is HUGE around the ear.  I felt like Darth Vader wearing it.  I definitely was not expecting such a large size!"
Okay but a bit to bulky for me. Sound also needs to be up a bit to hear well.
I really enjoy the noise cancellation of these headphones. My gf tries to talk to me while I play and honestly I can‚Äôt hear. I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick but it‚Äôs just I‚Äôm very into the game. Ofc I take them off when I need to hear.I was disappointed that to get them to be wireless was sooo complicated. To this day the usb port has not been able to connect with the headphones. The instructions are clear but they just don‚Äôt match with what‚Äôs happening to the usb port.It‚Äôs also very sturdy and resistance to wear and tear.
"First of all, it's pretty good for it's price. When I first bought it it had a pretty wide range and I could walk around the house a fair ways before it started losing connection. Good sound, good mic. The only problem I have with it is that the plastic connector that adjusts for head size is pretty fragile. It's all one solid piece of plastic there and it doesn't flex as much as it needs to, so repeated use weakens the connection and eventually it snapped. It lasted about a year before it broke so I got another one pretty soon after and it lasted another year or so before it had the same issue."
"I bought this as a replacement for my PC headset after my previous headset broke. It showed up the next morning which I was excited about that for sure. It stated that the headset supported Bluetooth which would be nice bonus for travel, but the primary focus was the Wireless part as my PC tower is a good distance away from my play space and I sometimes use VR. However, I spent a good couple hours trying to get it to connect to my PC or even my phone and other systems.Both Wireless and Bluetooth did not work. All my devices that used Bluetooth couldn't detect the headset even when it was less than 6 inches from the device. When I plugged the dongle into my PC, Laptop, and PS4, it posted and got the necessary drivers, but the headset never connected and continued to flash the blue and red error code. The User's Manual didn't state anything about what the Error was and instructions for making sure Bluetooth was working properly were non-existent. The manual even seemed to contradict itself as it claims you can connect to Phones, Ipods and Macs via Bluetooth but on the next page, Phones and Tables are shown as not compatible with ""wireless"". I'm willing to chalk that up to a misunderstanding or something but it does not change the fact the product did not deliver.The only method I had any success with was using their 3 ft Aux Cable to connect to my Phone, Xbox, PC and Laptop which for the most part defeated the number one reason I bought the headset.Noise cancelation is a falsehood as well. When I had the aux cable plugged in with audio playing, I could still clearly hear the noises outside my room and the cars driving down the road which is about 300ft from my room with the windows closed. I get better noise cancelation from a pillow.Audio did sound Ok, not tinny by any means, but it did lack bass. Imagine watching Lord of the Rings and the iconic drums sounded muted.This headset is not worth the 40$ I threw at it on sale and definitely not worth the 60$ they are asking at full price. I have had better performance from a headset I bought for 20$ 7 years ago and the only reason I'm looking to replace it is the battery will not hold a charge anymore and the hardware is showing its age from use.An overwhelming disappointment."
"The sounds quality is nice, and the headphone worked with my computer with no trouble at all. A single charge also lasts a very long time (over three days being on 24/7 if you forget to turn it off) which is incredibly nice. However, you cannot use the headphone wireless while charging it. It is rather annoying, especially since I am unaware how to tell what the current battery level is. Once you start getting the very loud ""battery low, plug in"" sound ringing through your eardrums, you got about 10 minutes or so to plug it in. On the bright side, the headphones charge quickly.Overall, these aren't bad headphones, but I am sure you could find better."
These do not have sound canceling The Mike boom is kind of weird the way it doesn't conform. The sound is so so definitely no sound canceling and get what you pay for.
"These headphones were good while they lasted, but here we are, 18 months in, and the USB receiver that plugs into my laptop broke. It has been flimsy from the start, so I always had to be extra careful with it, but now it broke completely. While the headphones themselves are still great, they are useless because of the USB receiver component."
"Bought these a year ago to replace some dead work headphones.The good:- Battery Life. On a full charge, lasts a really long time. Have accidentally left the headset running overnight with no audio, and it worked for another 9 hours the next day without a recharge.- Range is pretty decent. I can walk all the way across my house before the audio cuts out.- Microphone is remarkably clear.Not so good:- When pressing the mute button, a recoded voice announces ""Microphone on"" or ""Microphone off,"" and drowns out any audio you're listening to at the time. This can be a pain when on a conference call or using Ventrilo while gaming.- The sound quality of the headphones is lacking. Not horrible, but bass is weak, and the midtones are somewhat scratchy. These are NOT headphones for an audiophile.- You cannot charge the headset and use the 3.5mm audio jack at the same time. Charging the headset turns it off.Not a horrible headset, but not fantastic either."
Sound quality and everything is good but not loud enough
I have tried everything to to connect wirelessly to my ps5 without success. The only way I can use them is with the audio jack from controller to headset
I've owned this for about a year and a half now. I haven't used them much over the course of that time. Now the battery won't hold a charge and the device won't turn on.Update:I reached out to seller and they were willing to refund me for the defective product.
"Feels light and cheap, but do work well."
"I bought these for my Fianc√©'s PS5 and they sounds better than pretty much everything else I've tried. Of course you get what you pay for so there is better ones out there, they are much more expensive though.My only issue is that when you plug in the USB, even if the headset is off the PS5 still is connected to it. Long story short, if you want to play a game without headphones, you have to unplug the USB no matter what."
"Billed as ""gaming headphones"". Audio quality is horrible. No directional audio at all. Can't tell where anything is in relation to my character.Update 10-24: Figured I'd try to just get a replacement instead of refunding bc I liked them the first time around. These ones have directional audio, but the bluetooth connection is shaky so it constantly pauses/unpauses videos on google/youtube/etc.Just a pretty mediocre product in general. I'd steer clear."
"UPDATE!!!  Went with Acinaci Wireless Gaming Headset with Detachable Noise Cancelling Microphone, 2.4G Bluetooth - USB - 3.5mm Wired Jack 3 Modes Wireless Gaming Headphones for PC. A little cheaper & are fantastic- great for WFH too. These didn't even make a month, just got returned. 4 emails to ""support"" trying to get help with volume issues- no answer. After owning 3 pairs of the BW02 in 2¬Ω years due to the cheap plastic holding the speakers breaking, I decided to ""upgrade"" to the BW01's. I am a disabled veteran who works from home. When I buy wireless headphones I look for ease of use, dependability, comfort, & ability to hold a decent charge. I moved away from the BW02s because they are poorly made and wouldn't hold up. The plastic headphones always snapped the housing around the ear speakers (either one). So I got fed up and ""upgraded"" to this pair, the BW01. When you first get the earphones, you have to plug in the dongle (USB stick) and the first time you'll hear 1. power on, 2. pairing, and 3. connected. After the first time, 1. power on, then 2. connected. All of this takes place in about 5 to maybe 15 seconds. When I got this pair, BW01 after I paired the dongle, after hearing ""power on"" I would have to wait 50 seconds to as much 1min and 8 seconds. Now I realize we aren't talking massive time but if you are waiting to hear music already playing or waiting to play a game (if I did) that is a pain. I was taught to hurry up and wait when I was in the Navy but this is absurd. I sent ""support"" 2 emails since the 5th (today is the 15th) without an answer. A computer friend said maybe the time issue is because of a bad dongle. I bought a new dongle for the BW01 and the connect time now fluctuates from 5 to 15 seconds. I turned around and got a refund and sent the defective dongle back in. Not the way it's supposed to be done I know but, oh well don't sell me caca and leave me hanging when I need help.  I hope that this helps someone out!!"
"The sound quality and noise cancellation of this headset is great. Comfort level is pretty good, they sometimes feel a little heavy but I also haven‚Äôt really tried other headsets to compare to. My only issue has been the mic, after a few months of use I have been experiencing some pretty bad static/echoing. The issue goes away after turning the headset on and off a couple times but it seems to be getting noticeably worse and more frequent. Hoping customer service will reach out and help resolve the issue."
"My wife got these for me, so I could play some decent CS2 or whatever, but after about a week, I went to turn them on and they stopped working."
Don‚Äôt buy for Xbox won‚Äôt work. In description it says Xbox but I didn‚Äôt go all the way to the end where is shows the picture graphic of what it does n doesn‚Äôt work with
"If you only have one - AND - you only use it for gaming ...Then it is an awesome product. Buy one and you will be glad you did!!!However ... for anything else - ie. Work, Conf calls, etc ...Problem 1 - If you have more than one in the room once in a while it will connect to the wrong USB - in 6 months it happened twice - that's twice more than I'd like as I am in front of multiple systems - two of which have these headsets - :-) - and at the most inopportune time I need to reboot one of the systems and the wrong headset latches on to the wrong USB - lots of fun.Problem 2 - I have a very large office with a bathroom and kitchen attached and a meeting room to the other side - I am not able to walk around my entire office (read: can't make coffee or anything else) while on a call - and no way can I go out of my office and walk around to the next office"
These were purchased for my husband. He said that they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbad‚Äù but they hurt his ears(he wears glasses when he plays). I bought him Ps5 headphones and he hasn‚Äôt complained about his ears hurting.
Worked fine for about six months. The game sound still works but the mic stopped working.
They have good sound... and price... just seem huge ... like I can launch a rocket
"I ordered these headphones and they are honestly pretty nice for the price point, but I don't wear them as much as the headphones I actually bought this to replace.  I just find that my neck feels a little sore after wearing them for a few days in a row, so if you think that's something you'll be sensitive to then be aware.Sound is quite rich, but be careful to turn them on BEFORE you put them over your head.  Otherwise you'll be deafened by the ""POWER ON"" notice.  It will also announce ""LOW BATTERY"" and this freaked me out the first time I was wearing them when it happened."
"Overall this headset isn't bad for the price.  Sound is fine, haven't had any issues with people being able to hear me, good for casual gaming ect.  It's not as comfortable as I would have preferred but it's not headache inducing or anything, I'm not sure I would want to wear them for more than a couple hours though.  The really obnoxious things, which I saw in other reviews and discounted, are the mute feature and how long it takes to connect.  It takes a full 5-10 seconds to connect once it is turned on, which is just irritating, not the end all.  However, when you mute your mic on the headset it announces such while cutting off all incoming audio, and same when you unmute.  So if you're gaming, say, and unmute to answering a question you're being asked, you may miss half the question while your headset tells you that it's unmuting you.  I figured this wouldn't be a big deal, but it quickly becomes infuriating.  Other than that mediocre and fine for the price."
"These feel cheap , though they are in the cheaper category, these are not as good as I thought they‚Äôd be. VERY HUGE ( but lightweight) , No bass at all . You can get better sound quality out of 20$ Sony Headphones/Headset. You can‚Äôt mute the mic even if you hit the mute button on the set (I use Xbox ) so it‚Äôs wired . Anyways I would barely consider recommending these to my friends or family ."
"I give this product 3stars because the mic does not work on pc , wats the point in promoting pc gaming if the mic doesn‚Äôt work , also it could have been somewhere in the description that the mic wasn‚Äôt going to work instead of waisting my time"
"GoodCheap price - it is a really cheap priceSound quality - sound quality isn't bad at allGood Wireless range - I can wear the headset upstairs and it really doesn't breakup much at allBadCheap Plastic - The plastic is cheap, and it already creaks when taking it off and putting it on.  I'd be surprised if the headset lasts more than six months.Extremely uncomfortable - while a lot of over the ear headsets tend to be uncomfortable, this is one of the worst ones I've tired. It doesn't breath, and the over the ear fit just isn't comfortable.Controls - The controls feel super cheap, and the buttons aren't intuitive at all when reaching for them. While every headset is different, placing the power button between the volume just screams terrible design.Note - I haven't checked the mic yet, so I can't say how good it is.Overall - if you absolutely have to have a wireless headset for gaming until you can get something better, then this is good enough.  But this should be nothing more than an emergency stopgap or a headset until you can get something with better quality like a Cooler Master MH670, or a SteelSeries Arctis, both of which are superior in comfort, and build quality."
"They are very comfortable and have a good battery life. They have no mic. I am still working on setting them up but with wireless it has been hard. They fit well and are easily adjustable to fit your head. Their light weight fits there comfort perfectly, overall a kind of good product."
"Used for around 2 weeks.Pros: the price, wireless range.Cons: microphone, sound quality, volume, bluetooth microphone, on-board voice messages, non-existent noise cancellation.Microphone: I mainly used it for gaming and voice chatting with my friends. The microphone picks up all the noise around you (someone drinking hot tea across the room) and the quality of your own voice is not good and not loud. weird.Sound quality: The bass and mid ranges are so high that everything sounds muffled. Songs are boring. No clarity. Also the volume at the highest is not loud at all. Like, you can pretty much hear everything going on around you at max volume playing a song.The on board voice message whenever you turn microphone on/off is so disruptive. It mutes everything to say ""Microphone off/on"". At first I didn't think it would be a problem. But when I need to mute and unmute the microphone quickly while still listening to the other person I have to anticipate for the them to stop talking. This is a really bad design choice.I would give it 2 stars, but the price point is really unmatched."
"Pretty comfortable and good sound quality for the price. Just a crazy design to them. The buttons are not intuitive and hard to find without taking the headset off. All the buttons feel the same so you'll have to find the first/last one and then remember the order from there. There's a volume up/down button rather than a wheel or slider. Sometimes I press volume down several times and can't hear a difference. Tough to find a good spot. The most annoying part is the microphone on/off. The mic on light is on the side so you can't see it without taking the headset off. It should be ON the mic. When you press it, a super annoying voice says ""mi-cro-phone on/off"". This recording takes a couple seconds to play, and while it's going the game audio is completely muted. A quick beep would have sufficed. Or an on off switch so you could tell by feel which mode you were in. Just seems like no thought was put into this."
"Microphone is very quiet, and there are no gain controls or software. Seemed like some form of noise cancellation affecting mic input. Tight fit on my head, even fully expanded.One of the arms cracked after the first time I was adjusting it."
"So like my title says, the headset was good for the first year. After that year passed, I got my friends telling me ‚Äúit sounds like you‚Äôre a robot‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt believe them until I checked myself how I sounded and sure enough, sometimes all you could hear from my mic was static and if I tried talking, I would cut in and out like the service on a phone was down. It had nothing to do with my USB ports and the stick it comes with but everything to do with the headset itself. Not sure what went wrong, I‚Äôve never treated it poorly and put it away nicely everytime. Just something went wrong. As great as technology is, it is also not."
"Was pretty good quality for a year worth of use. After 3 days after having it for a year, the plastic to extend the headphone is now about to break. Lasted Shorter when compared to my last headphone which lasted about 3 years"
Mic quality isn‚Äôt the best for ps5 and clarity isn‚Äôt the best. I will say I like the design and fit.
"If you're gaming by yourself, these headphones are alright, but I do not recommend these headphones because your sound will often play over the mic, including the annoying voice that announces when you mute/unmute your mic. Not great headphones and I wish I had researched more before buying these."
"So, I bought this headset for my PS4, for gaming and streaming/watching DVD‚Äôs.Headphones are comfortable, just the right size.  Doesn‚Äôt take terribly long to charge, seems to have a good battery life.  That‚Äôs the only reason why my review is three stars instead of one or two.My one issue is probably the biggest issue a headset could have:  the sound quality is WAAAAAY too low.  Even with the volume turned all the way up, what you‚Äôre trying to listen to is hardly audible most of the time, even when the headset is fully charged.You would expect a modern headset to have much better sound quality, and the ability to turn the volume up more.  I‚Äôm amazed at just how low the max volume is.Hopefully they will make a new model with the volume being able to be MUCH louder, because it‚Äôs almost comical just how low it is considering this is supposed to be a modern headset.  Honestly, I‚Äôd search around more before getting a pair of these."
"Audio cuts in and out every couple minuets. I thought it could be my computer with the issue but other headphones work great. The headphones worked great the first few months though, but eventually got worse over time."
"In a time when sound equality is just as important. It's visuals, it just doesn't cut it. It's comfortable and the fonnection is stable, but if you could have afford a few dollars more get something with better sound quality"
These stopped working after a month and could not return. Waste of money
I bought this as a replacement for another headset I broke it‚Äôs descent quality and feels nice but the sound and mike quality is not that good also if you yell it makes you really quite.
got it for my bf he loves it
My brother and I both have one now and now that we got two they don‚Äôt work. My headset that I got in white refuses to connect to anything via Bluetooth and it won‚Äôt connect to the usb that came with it.
"Worked great until... some tiny piece of plastic started moving around, making an audible rattling sound.  To me, it made this headset unusable.  and head movement (like looking at your keyboard) makes it happen..... otherwise its great, sadly."
"Got these cause I got tired of my wired headsets.. had these for over 6 months now.Pros-Wiresless with long battery life.-Light weight and comfortable.-Sound quality/mic quality is decent. No complaints here.Cons-Can't charge and have it on at the same time. So if your headset dies, you're out of ""commission"" for awhile. (Kind of a dumb feature.)-After 6months, these headsets are starting to lose signal to the usb receiver, creating constant static for input/output (both parties will hear static from my end as signal is lost.)-Controls/buttons are horrible, there's 4 buttons, power, volume +/-, and microphone. You'll try to adjust the volume and hit the microphone/itll turn off.-Voice that says power on/connected/microphone off/on is loud and kind of annoying.-No auto off feature. They will stay on until they die.I did originally like these when I first got them but after awhile, they're cutting out/losing signal. I can't understand what others are saying/they cant understand me when it does this,  which have been these constant intervals."
Worked fine with zoom and windows 10 but locks up in windows 11 while using zoom.  There appears to be NO support.  Their website has not information on how to contact them.
"Bought these for a new job to try for creating and editing videos. I would like a pair of Bluetooth headphones because I figured out after a few days that keeping my AirPods in all day really made my ears hurt, but I don't like having lots of things plugged into my laptop because that makes it less than convenient to pack it up and move around as my job requires.These ARE NOT Bluetooth compatible. They are wireless. They require a dongle to be inserted into a USB port in my laptop to function. My laptop requires a donlge to use USB drives, and then I would need the provided dongle to connect the ""wireless"" headphones. No thanks. Returning these and purchasing an actual Bluetooth compatible headset."
"I've had several different headsets over the years but this one is easily the worst even though it's technically more expensive than the others. Firstly, you cannot use it while it's charging.  The instructions make it sound like you can but when you plug the headset in to charge, it immediately turns off and will not turn on again until you unplug it. The buttons are small and placed inconveniently- you sometimes have to press and hold several times for them to work and it's hard to know which button you're pressing without taking off the headset to look. Audio quality is poor and very quiet- I very never really noticed any other headset having better/worse quality but i noticed immediately how bad these ones sound. I have all my sound settings maxed out just to be able to hear what I'm watching at a normal volume. Another small annoyance is that when you press the mute/unmute button, the headset will mute anything you're watching or listening to and say ""Microphone On/Off"" which is frustrating if you're trying to talk to someone bc you missed the last serial seconds of what they were saying."
Saw a bunch of good reviews decided to get it for my PS5. It got here and it was in the manufacturers box with the shipping label on it... Started off sketchy but when I went to plug the USB in and sync it it never connected. My PS5 can recognize it but I hear nothing the microphone won't work and won't sync up to the USB... The instructions just say plug it in and you're good but that's far from the truth. Looked at some YouTube videos on trying to fix it and even Reddit and nothing. If you are looking for a wired headset it's an okay option I guess but for Bluetooth or USB connection on PS5 it's a waste of money. Please get something else cause it's not worth it.
"I liked this headset, it worked well. But all of a sudden after eight months, it stopped turning on, I could see that it was taking a charge. But would no longer turns on."
The headset would cut out around 5 minutes or so. Reached out to the vendor and tried what they recommended but the mic would still cut out on occasion.  Not reliable for me
Worked really well for a while but it‚Äôs only been 8 months and the port stopped working so no way to charge them
"The sound quality and noise cancellation are really good. I purchased 3 of these between august and sept of 2022. The last one was purchased Sep 13 2022. Friday Feb 24 of 2023 all 3 are confirmed dead. The power states the device is on but there is no sound in the headset and no microphone. Two tech savvy people live here and we can not figure out why they do not work. None of them work. Only one got a great deal of use, the other 2 were used mostly on weekends only so the amount of usage did not seem to make a difference. One of them died before christmas 2022. I will not buy these again as 3 out of 3 failing within 5 months is just a total fail in my opinion."
"The headset does work, but suffers from some bugs and design features that detract from accessibility.  Occasionally, the USB wireless dongle needs to be switched ports or the microphone quality drops significantly, becoming almost inaudible or robotic.  This is easy to fix, unlike the second issue.Which is that this item cannot function while charging.  It is designed to shut itself off while you have the charging cable in, and this feature cannot be disabled or circumvented by any means.  This unfortunately means that the item is nonfunctional while charging and you must plan ahead by charging it when you are not using it, because if it runs low on power when you are doing something important, it will remind you ever 30 seconds about the batteries and there is no option to plug it in and keep going."
"Groundwork: This is the first cordless headset I've purchased with my own money; I've used ear buds with my phone for some time and my company furnished a different Bluetooth headset of the Plantronics variety (better than these believe it or not). The Binnune set took the place of an old wired set I had.Observations: They kind of suck, but I'm still kind of happy. Do they get the job done? Yes, but they could improve in almost every way.-They're big and bulky, yet light.-The build quality is good, but not great because it sounds like I'm going to crack it sometimes.-It makes the area encircling my ears sweat, but the noise canceling is decent.-Battery life is good, but the controls are aggravating.*Below average sound quality, yet cheap.Conclusion: I will continue using these for some time because they still got rid of the cord too. However, I will take the next step or two up next time."
"they are comfortable, mic quality is decent, tho a bit muted, like talking thru gauze.  the buttons are terrible, counterintuitive, you have to take off the headset to press which one you need and hope for the best as there is no light indicator if something is on/off/muted etc.  i had a time to get these to work, no plug and play. took alot of fiddling, redoing the same actions in order for it to finally recognize the actions and work.  not sure if im going to keep them.  i think the wireless is pretty useless for my needs."
"It's a great value. However as I've used it, the area around my ear gets sore. I don't think my head is larger than others, but these are very tight and constantly agressively push into the area around my ears. Exactly as promised, but for me may purchase something else in future."
These are awful. Bought in sept 2023. After about 3 months you couldn‚Äôt hear out of the left side. Now come Jan 2024 they pick and choose when they want to work. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
"Just received by headset to discover the charging cord is 12"". I have an under desk tower and that is a pain and not workable. I can go buy an extension, but really why aggravate your customers with this ridiculous short cord. Ok laptops I can see, but not everyone plays games on laptops.  Headset tested fine, not played a game yet. To be continued if necessary."
"The headphones are not as comfortable as I hoped, but they suffice and thats a truly personal variable.  Sound quality is decent. Volume could be better.The real issue, however, I have had issues with them from day one.  The bluetooth on them seems to conflict with that of my Logitech mouse.  Upon starting my computer (a new ACER Nitro ), the headphones will connect, but causes my mouse cursor to bounce all over the place. I have to go into bluetooth devices and disable them and then reconnect them. Annoying, but livable.The other issue is that they seem to have all sorts of problems with Discord.  This is the primary reason I purchased them in the first place because my gaming group uses Discord for Audio and Visual connection.  If I mute the microphone it completely disables the mic and I can't use it (ie. un-mute it)until I shut down Discord and restart it.  I switched back to my old wireless Logitech headphones and they work flawlessly (but are unfortunately physically broken) No one else has the problems I do with Discord in my group. Not being able to mute my mic in a gaming group makes them nearly useless to me. Needless to say, I am very disappointed in the purchase."
Bought 2 headsets and 2 different phones. No matter what we it did to both phones would activate.  We tried not touching anything and SIRI would come on. We even had a young person try to slove this problem and he was un able to. So we sent them back and bought head phones from a differt company and over 3 months later not a single problem.
The quality of the headphones feel very light and cheap aswell as the audio sounding not too good the microphone is ok and over I know there are better options and have better Bluetooth headphones for roughly the same price or less I recommend not wasting your money and looking for a better option
"The sound was really good, but using on a xbox series x you will not be able to talk online. Does not work."
This headset works really well for gaming and relaxing with friends while chatting with them. The sound quality is superb and the microphone easily catches the voice of whoever is trying to speak into it. The headset does have some noise cancellation but it is not the greatest. When someone talks it is very easy to tell that they are talking but it may not be as easy to understand what they are saying. Another thing about this headset is that if you wear glasses and wear the headset with your glasses on it will eventually start to hurt a little bit. The pain is manageable but gets annoying sometimes. Overall a good headset with a few minor downsides.
"Will not let you charge it and use it at the same time. If I didn't have my old set of headphones with me, I would be mute for a few hours in time of need. Headphones that have one job - to be headphones, and they can't even do that.Other than that, the wireless audio crackles a lot. If I'm doing anything ""intense"" on my computer, like loading a web page, it'll crackle for a second. It's not my computer, my computer's a beast. It just does it for some reason.It's nice to have a wireless headset but this headset really just isn't nice.UPDATE: I've also discovered a lovely ""feature"" about this headset where it will auto-play anything you last had selected *when it turns off*. Doesn't matter if that window is even minimized or not. If you had a YouTube tab open, it'll play when this disconnects. I assumed this was the fault of Windows (what isn't), but looking it up, people seem to say that issue is from a headset doing it. So every time this thing dies, I lose my place in a YouTube video because it decided to play it without my consent.This is not even worth it if it was free.Additionally, the audio quality is very low, I can barely be heard on the mic. It's better in wired mode. I'm just going to use this thing in wired mode and forget the completely useless wireless feature."
Other than the fact that every time I wanted to play my Playstation 5 I had to unplug the USB because the internet would not work with the headset connected. I know it is the problem because it happens every time so I take the USB out internet starts working then I can put the USB back in and everything would start working. Just a annoying process.
"These are a good wireless headset for your money, but if you intend to use these for their bluetooth functionality, find another pair of headphones.I've used them for a few hours, and they're pretty good, especially for the price. The earpieces are comfortable, and the sound is nice. Not professional quality, but nice nonetheless. The problem arose when I tried to connect them to my macbook using bluetooth, only to find out that the title is false advertisement, and these headphones do not in fact have bluetooth capability. Honestly, even though they are decent for the price (and I got them on sale, so bear that in mind) I would find another pair of headphones, because false advertising is not something to be supported."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It does not Bluetooth connect to ps5. A bummer at first so I used the headphone jack that came with it to plug into my controller. Surprise! I was only able to hear sound out of one ear. The lowest quality of sound. I used another headphone jack I had and I was able to hear out of both sides. Still the lowest quality of sound. Might I add, the microphone didn‚Äôt work whatsoever. Don‚Äôt buy if you are planning to use it for ps5. I will be returning these and getting my money back."
"I bought these because I recently repurchased a PS3 and wanted to chat with my brothers who also have one still in 2023. Luckily it works with the USB dongle but not bluetooth. Chat audio comes through the headset and gaming comes through the TV. Id have to connect it a special way for it to work with all game audio to the headset. I dont like the price ($40), because the product does have an echo when you try to use 2 on the same console and has that cheap plastic feel. No noise cancellation at all either. A very ‚Äúmade in China‚Äù product"
The headphones are loose and it makes it hard to hear unless you press them against you‚Äôre head.The mic is aggravating bc you have to hold the mute button instead of sliding the mic upward.The Bluetooth connector for these blocks my wifi signal to my PS.And you can‚Äôt use them while charging and the battery life sucks.
"Only put 2 stars because it arrived same day. However, I shud have just got my lazy self up and went to the store or just purchased different ones.The sound quality is subpar, and no shade, but i could do without ""microphone on/off"" announcement with an Asian accent which is triggered with every press of the mic button. Which in addition seems to add to the ""cheapness"" feel it has. The buttons are not ergonomically friendly, especially on the fly while gaming and of course the headphones are bulky and obnoxious.Again, 2 stars were only given due to promptness of delivery. They arrived on the 2nd, butbon the 8th I noticed that the headset sat on the charger all day but refused to fully charge. Unplugged them and plugged into 3 different USB C's and it did the same thing for another day. Now it refuses to even turn on anymore. However the USB dongle that goes into the ps5 did pair up with the headset etc effortlessly."
There‚Äôs always an annoying ringing that‚Äôs hard to get past.
"Build quality, etc. all seem good for the price, but if you want to use w/ a Mac or on any flavor of Linux, be clear - When they say it's compatible, that's only through the 1/8"" wired jack; Bluetooth will not connect even though the BW01 device shows in audio output options. Too bad, they seem good for the money otherwise, comfortable and all that."
"This headset works fine, feels fairly well-built and sounds very good for a low-end gaming headset. It is not very comfortable; the earcups are do not articulate at all, and the clamping pressure out of the box is headache-inducing. I left it overextended overnight to take a wider set, which made it much more comfortable, but it's still not great compared to even cheap headphones with better designs. The microphone works well, but the manufacturer opted to have a recorded voice say ""microphone off"" and ""microphone on"" when you toggle the mic mute, which mutes your audio for a couple seconds and makes the feature extremely impractical to use. A quick beep without muting the audio would have been a much better decision, but as it is, it creates too much of an interruption to be useful in most situations. Overall, it does the job, but I would reccomend looking for a more comfortable headset."
They work well but the cushion on the top of the head is too thick and pushes into your head causing a headache.
"The mic on/off is a push and hold button, but that‚Äôs not the most annoying part. Every time you toggle it, an angry Asian lady screams at you ‚ÄúMicrophone on!!‚Äù, ‚ÄúMicrophone Off!!‚Äù. I wish I was making it up.Max volume is just loud enough where you‚Äôre like, ‚Äúugh, it‚Äôs not loud enough but I guess it will do‚Äù."
"Nice headset, but doesn‚Äôt work wirelessly with Nintendo Switch‚Ä¶"
"The 3 stars are cause the Spatial Audio is really good but the mic buzzes, it picks up audio outside of my room which both are inconvenient for other people you play with. Nothing special"
Decent headphones but it doesn't really have a good audio. I've adjusted the volume on my PS5 and these headsets but it doesn't really get too loud. Noise cancellation is sufficient. Once you place them on your ears you can't hear anything outside of the headphones. It's just the audio isn't loud inside the headphones.
I really like how you are able to choose between USB and bluetooth connection. The USB connection works fantastic. The Bluetooth connection however greatly decreases in quality. A good and cheap starter headset regardless!
Works well no issues as if today.
These headphones are not that bad but at the same time not that good either it's very basic.  I tried these on my ps5 and the sound is very low. If you're in a tough spot and looking for something within budget these headphones might be for you but overall these are not the quality I was expecting. These headphones need an update in sound  I can barely hear my game play audio but maybe these work better on a computer or laptop idk but they ain't it for me.
"Hoping it was just a plug and play, and it‚Äôd work. Nope. I spent hours trouble shooting, reading the manual (which tells you almost nothing btw), and trying to find info online. Their website is terrible btw and tells you nothing."
Had these since Oct. Using with a Nintendo switch. Sound constantly cuts out - which I‚Äôm assuming is because of the system itself? I use these with the usb attachment. I bought a backup headset from another brand that did the same thing. My main issue is the sound is low. One day it turned all the way down & now it won‚Äôt turn back up. Bulky & blocks out sound which isn‚Äôt an issue for me. Quality sound wise is the reason for 2 stars.
"Worst headset ever. Its so heavy and big, it gives you a headache so fast. Its also had false information about compatibility with the nintnedo switch. Dont buy this gaarbage, save your time and moneu, buy something else fr"
We got 2 of them and they conflict with each other some times mine will connect to my wifes PC or connect to my PC
"I wanted a wireless headset for gaming that had one feature: movic the mic vertical would mute it. This is the only headset I found that lets you flip up the mic, but doesn't mute. Theres a button on the back left to mute. If you can't see behind your ear lobes you won't be able to confirm you're muted.And it powers on unmuted. So you will be taking the headset off your head to check a lot.Other than that they're fine for directional sound and team chat. I would have given it five stars if I could tell if I was muted."
"The headset seems well constructed, and sounds decent.  However, the sound is pretty heavy on the bass side.  I'd like to have more treble, as the sound is a little muddy.  I also don't like the ""microphone on"" and ""microphone off"" voice whenever you turn the mic on and off.  It's a waste of time.  A simple tone would be much better.  I'll probably return these."
"I bought this headset for use with a gaming console. It was intended to replace a basic PlayStation headset that will probably need to be replaced soon due to wear and tear.It appears to be solidly constructed.Not wanting to be bothered with using the wireless feature, I connect the headset to my controller. This type connection also removes the need to keep the unit charged.My problem with the headset is there appears to be no way to reduce the too-high volume. I have resorted to inserting padding into the headset ‚Äúcups.‚ÄùI guess I need to stop my practice of getting rid of packaging before using devices. I should have returned it."
It‚Äôs a good headset! But when useing the wireless usb it will randomly disconnect mid game
"Using for a telephone headset, not gaming.  I love the headset (fit, feel, looks, comfort, etc.) BUT the stupid thing WILL NOT stay connected to my phone (Motorola motoG) via Bluetooth.  Works fine for first few (6-8 minutes) but then just disconnects...no message, no nothing...just gone.  I've tried TWO sets, both worked exactly alike...dropped Bluetooth after a few minutes.  I'm going to try hard wire (phone USB-to-mic plug on headset).  Don't want to be ""wired"" but might be only option."
I bought these to use at work 6 months ago.  They work well for the price point for general purpose headphones.  I personally wouldn't use them for gaming but for casual music listening and video calls they're just fine.  I've never dropped or rough handled them but in just under 6 months the plastic on the headband has fatigued and broken.  I didn't notice it broken when i left last week. I picked them up this morning and noticed the headband was much looser than normal and found the crack.Tl;dr they function well for the price but handle them with great care if you want them to last.
This gaming headset fits well and has good noise cancellation. the only problem i found with this product is when using the usb connection for wireless use sound quality is severely quiet. Sound is better with the wire included.
Worked fantastic for over a month then it started to disconnected from computer consistently and I couldn't keep it connected. I got this headset so i could walk around and do things but its pointless if it won't stay connected and it won't pick up the sound for mic
Head set is big. Will definitely add a strap to back so it dosent fall off. I do not have a small head and it fits very loose. Sound is crisp but not that great. Microphone works well and does well at noise canceling.
"So, I was looking for earphones and after a lot of scrolling, ended up trying those. First of all, they were huge, which didn't feel comfortable. But I mostly was taked aback after hearing how loud they were. I could almost exit my room (which isn't a small room), leaving them on lowest volume, and still hear word to word. So I returned them"
The overall build if the mic is great also quality. But i‚Äôve had the headset for 3 months now and i‚Äôm very careful when using it. As i play video games the mic continues to shortage out and cuts off by itself
"I'm really torn on if this should be a 3 or 4 star review.Almost everything about this headset is good. The battery life is exceptional, the range you can walk away from your PC with no drop in quality is impressive, the build quality is as solid as I've come to expect from Logitech, and the comfort level is high. I've worn it for 8+ hours every day since I received it (I spend a lot of time with a headset on due to work/leisure activities) and it never gets uncomfortable. The cloth fabric on the pads also keeps it from getting warm around your ears, despite the fact these are closed back.Worth mentioning the Logitech G Hub integration is also very nice.Where this headset falls flat is the sound quality.This was my first try at using a wireless headset after my old trusty Sennheiser Game One headset began to show too much sign of wear in areas that can't be replaced after around 5 years of daily extensive use. All I wanted was for this headset to produce sound at around the same quality, since this is much newer and more expensive. To its credit, it sounds better than other wireless headsets I've tried when borrowing them from others.Unfortunately it's just not there. I'm a mild audiophile, I'm not on the level where you'll hear me talking about the minute differences in quality between $300+ quality headsets, but high quality sound is important to me, and these do not deliver. No matter how I adjust them in the G Hub software, they produce a slight tinny quality to the sound, as if talking over the world's most clear cell phone call. The microphone is similar, producing a sound that is good but not great for others to hear. As soon as I switched, others made a note of how I sounded much worse than I used to.The bass is also much heavier than I'm used to from my old Sennheisers, which to be fair, are a brand which are known for not emphasizing bass. But still, it's enough to be distracting and it drowns out the finer details in the midrange of sound, which is where the sound quality falls the most flat.Also, because it only works with the accompanying USB dongle, it will not work with cellphones or gaming systems such as the Switch or Steam Deck while they're undocked. It does work in docked mode if the stand has USB slots, but on my Switch, it kept making the USB volume slider pop up in the top left for no reason, which made it basically unusable for that, as well. I'm uncertain if it would work on the Steam Deck even with a dock.Unfortunately, I don't know if these are issues which are simply inherent to all wireless headsets. I can only compare it against the Sennheiser Game One, which has this headset easily beat in comfort, sound quality, and microphone quality, while also being cheaper. The only advantages this headset has over them are that it's wireless, the bass is much more pronounced, and the accompanying software lets you fine tune what you want out of your audio and microphone.If you care about audio quality, and you're not a basshead, I highly recommend the Sennheiser Game One headset over this one, as long as you don't mind dealing with the wire."
"I bought this as a replacement for the Artemis G933 wireless. Nothing was too wrong with mine, I just felt like upgrading since it has been 3 or 4 years. If you're looking for a good mic with cheap as *%*( headphones, may as well grab this cause that's basically what you're getting.  (COMPARISON OF THE TWO AT THE BOTTOM)This produced seemed like it was going to be better after reading stuff, and a lot of the reviews that were negative didn't make too much sense to me in terms of how they worded things, so I thought i'd give it a shot anyways.- The bit about the light reflecting on glasses, is absolutely true however it's not that noticeable. If you leave it a solid cool color you really don't notice it, but honestly there's basically zero point in RGB on headsets except to drain your battery.- It does noise cancel pretty good, I think it isn't as good as the Artemis G933 but it does a decent job.- If you're looking for a headset meant for gaming and playing music or doing literally anything other than watching Live Streams, I'm not quite sure about this. The Mic Quality is great however I have the headset all the way up and in games I tend to have issues hearing friends (In particular Phasmophobia in game voice, I didn't have an issue with the old headset but with this one I have some difficulties hearing people)--------------------Feature wise, I really really prefer the Artemis G933.THE POWER BUTTON IS IN THE WORST POSSIBLE SPOT EVER. Every time I go to unplug the headset I hit the power button and it's so frustrating.- Instead of a mic you can push up and down, this one has a removable mic. I think this is a preference thing, but I just find it way more annoying because it tends to get in my vision so I just have to remove it whenever I'm not in a call with someone, and I always have to take my headset off to plug in it and it just really feels like an inconvenience.- When your Artemis G933 mic is muted, there's a red light on the mic - this one has no light on the mic. I think I much prefer the other as it's very obvious when you're muted, and on this one I forget...a lot. (I know the RGB flashes once when you mute it, but I only know that because of my glasses reflection, otherwise you're not going to know literally at all)- This headset may be lighter, but it actually feels like it's going to fall of your head at any moment. I have a pretty small head, and it really just isn't as adjustable as I'd enjoy it being. (You can adjust it a little but man it just makes me nervous)- On a positive note, I have WAY LESS problems with my ears sweating. It does occasionally push my glasses up against my ears and it hurts a little but I'd rather deal with that than ear sweating that occurs with Artemis if you use it for more than 1 hour. These ear pads are much more breathable.The only positive thing I guess I have to say is the mic is a little better, it handles me screaming when I'm playing games a bit more compared to my old one - however it does have issues picking me up when I'm mumbling or a little quiet (My old mic did not) I believe I need to mess with settings but quite frankly I'll have to look up a load of tutorials because it has a lot of features on this mic.In conclusion, your ears sweat less & the mic is better quality but the sound quality is just not up to par with Artemis and also the other small features the artemis has are better.However the Artemis has so many glitches & issues, this one hasn't had any just yet.Placement of the power button sucks, and I also don't like that when you turn up the sound slider it makes no noise it makes me think I've got sound turned off since the artemis had a noise."
"This is long, I've had these headphones for a year and a half now and I've formed my opinion on it.Pros:-Easy to connect, small usb so it won't take up any other slots.-Software is easily used.-Buttons are very convenient and well placed.-Has a mute button, and a scroll wheel for sound which is very nice.-Decent battery life, and a long enough charger so it's not an pain even if it has to be plugged in while using.-Mic is of good quality, I found it good enough for standard gaming. Also you can remove it.-Headphones block most noise but not all, which I personally prefer. The sound quality is also decent.-Not heavy, very light and comfortable.Cons:-Software is buggy, I've had to redownload over and over for it to connect or to even open.-The battery loses hold quickly once it ages with use.-After a while, for me, it disconnects randomly, cutting audio and microphone. Software and charge doesn't change this. This did not happen with my wired Logitech mouse.-I have to keep a paper clip unbent incase I need to use it to hit the reset button (under the earpiece) because the lights won't turn off even if I hold the power button or if the headphones simply won't connect.Tldr: Its decent, probably one of the headsets you can get for the money with the features it has. Very beginner friendly. However it may degrade quickly with constant use."
"I like the sound and they are very comfortable, however, for headphones that cost more than $100, I would not recommend them for work or things that require good use of the microphone, it does not have active noise cancellation which is not acceptable for its price , I can't use them for what I bought them for (work). Blue voice helps a little, but it's nowhere near eliminating all the noise completely"
"Ok so I bought this headset because I tend to struggle a lot with my headsets comfort wise.  Most of the time I get awful headaches just after 20 mins of wearing a headset.  I'm also very picky with quality and functionality.  So first the things I love.  It's great wireless wise, I can go to my kitchen and walk around my room and still hear perfect audio.  It's range is decent.  I like not dealing with long cords and getting tangled in them so I knew wireless was the way to go for me.  These are SUPER lightweight.  Honestly when I picked them up I was worried since it almost felt cheaply made.  But I think the flexibility and lightness is going to be good long term.  I don't get headaches as easily with these.  I keep one ear uncovered so I can hear myself clearly, I'd say these headphones are meh noise cancelling wise.  I could still hear a decent bit with both ears covered.  The top band and muffs are very comfy and not too thick so their isent a bunch of squeezing on your head.  It is a little too light sometimes as when I lean backwards or wip my head around I feel like the headset might fly away into the abyss.  XD.I love the color changing, you can dim it a lot which is nice since I have a light sensitivity and RGB can really trigger that so I'm still able to have color but it's dim enough to not bother me in my perefrial vision.  You can also program in it's settings how long it takes to auto shut off.  I set it at 15 minutes, it's default is 30 minutes.  It'll turn red when the batter is low.  I also like the detachable mic, I'm awful at remembering to unmute myself, so just having a mic be detachable and plug it in makes it much easier.Ok now the bad, ;-; unfortunately this mic for it's price I expected a decent mic.  But honestly it's horrible.  My 40 dollar dupe pink UwU cat girl headset had better mic quality and no programming at all.  This thing even with the mic programming and tweaking studio still sounds awful.  So if you wanted something for recording with, ehhhh I'd suggest something different.  I have an external mic so it wasn't too big of a deal.  But I planned on using this headset to casually chat with friends on discord and do chores around the house or multitasking while cleaning my room.  Since my mic can't come with me, the headset can and it's a little saddening they'll have to bear with that rough quality when I use the headset mic.All in all I think I'll probably keep this, it's comfy and that was the main point of me buying it.  But if you wanted a more well rounded headset for this price I'd suggest looking at other products."
"Pros- i can wear them and still have a good signal to my pc from 40 feet away and through my entire house.- they turn on instantly and hold a very long charge-comfort = 4/5, they arent tight and have decently comfortable paddingCons-i dont like the fixed microphone, headsets are better when you can fold the mic up so its not in ur face, you can detach it like an aux plug but when you do that reconnecting can get buggy and annoying like on discord it resets my voice settingsHonestly the only real con for me is the lack of folding to mic out of my face so i can eat while wearing the headset, which is annoying enough to me to warrant the 3.5, the sound is ok"
"The headphones are really great i do like them they‚Äôre probably my favorite headphones ive gotten in a long time, but when i went to by my cousin these, they are not compatible with xbox at all, but are compatible with pc and ps4-5. Hope this helps looks stuff up before u buy it"
"The Logitech G733 Wireless Gaming Headset presents an intriguing blend of style and functionality, but its performance falls short in key areas.Pros:Design & Comfort: The headset's sleek design and lightweight build make it a pleasure to wear for extended gaming sessions. The suspension headband adds to its comfort, ensuring a snug fit without compromising on ergonomics.RGB Lighting: The RGB implementation adds a touch of flair to the headset, allowing users to personalize their gaming setup and create immersive environments.Wireless Performance: With an impressive wireless range and over 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, the G733 offers freedom of movement and extended gaming sessions without interruptions.Cons:Audio Quality: Out of the box, the audio quality of the G733 may disappoint. The 40mm audio drivers fail to deliver the depth and richness expected, especially given the headset's price point. While adjustments to bass, treble, and frequencies can improve the sound, it's disappointing that such tweaks are necessary to achieve satisfactory audio performance.Build Quality & Connection Issues: The overall build quality of the headset feels lacking, and tons users (myself included) have reported issues with its connection to the Logitech G HUB software. Discrepancies in battery percentage readings and other software bugs have persisted without resolution for over 3+ years, indicating a lack of attention and commitment to the quality of their products from Logitech.Price: At $130, the G733 is priced at a premium. However, considering its audio and build issues, some may find it lacking in value compared to other options on the market.Conclusion:The Logitech G733 Wireless Gaming Headset offers a stylish and comfortable option for gamers, but its flaws cannot be ignored. While its design and features may appeal to some, the subpar audio quality out of the box, build issues, and premium price tag make it a difficult recommendation. Unless Logitech addresses these shortcomings, the G733 falls short of delivering the immersive gaming experience that its design suggests.Personally I'll be returning and refunding my headset in exchange, I'll be trying out the Corsair HS80 RGB Wireless instead."
"I really like my first pair so I bought a second pair so I could use one for work. The second one that came is a different color and was on sale for 99 bucks. I was excited to receive them, but since testing them out, the wireless range quality is not as good as my first pair... My old pair, I could walk anywhere in my house and not loose wireless connectivity. With my new pair, I can't walk more than 5-10 feet away before loosing connection where my friends can't hear me or I can't hear them. Pretty disappointed in the quality of the new pair I received. Not sure if I should return or exchange to see if its just the pair I got."
"I bought these for work meetings. I'm on calls speaking for about 4-7 hours a day. For the first  ~10 months i owned these, they worked great. Zero issues.Since them, my headphone microphone would sporadically cut out while i was speaking or my volume would drop significantly and people could barely hear me on calls. I have never been able to resolve the issue. I end up just joining my calls via a phone if the call is important and I can't have my audio drop down suddenly and randomly.However, I will say, the sound quality and battery life is very good. I can usually go an entire work week before needing to charge them. So I recommend these if you don't need to be on calls/using your mic constatly."
"Bought this headset to use for work and gaming but quickly realized that LEDs cannot be turned off without G-hub software and are by default, on. Such a bummer I had to return them because they look, feel, and sound great."
"Though this headset has a mute button, it doesn't have a foldable microphone that will mute the sound. This is a feature that I really need."
"I so wanted to like this headset, I really did, but there are many cons and not enough pros here. I do not consider myself a pure audiophile but I do own some high end headphones and some expensive headsets, so I can definitely tell good sound when I hear it.First, this is a nice looking, lightweight headset that has the right ideal with borrowing the Arctis lineup with the suspension headband, but the front rgb kills this for one big con... You cannot turn the RGB off on console and that's a huge negative to me, even though I play primarily on pc, I do want flexibility as I am playing a lot of Genshin Impact on PS4. I will stick to my Arctis 7 for this.The comfort is good, but the odd shaped earcups have the same problem the older arctis did, my right earlobe touched the inner driver wall and these clamp a little harder then the earmuffs push, so the fit is a hit or miss, for me it's a slight miss, but is bearable.Next is the sound, these 40mm drivers are very weak, I spent maybe 4 hours tuning and using a V curve worked decent but the DTS is horrible, seriously, it's bad. The bass is natural and these are tuned for gaming only and fps is where these are good, but there are better options for that, so that leaves these as a niche option. Don't even think about music, these are not good for music at all. Also I bought these, I did not get these for free, whereas I see most people here did get them for free, skip every one of those reviews.Finally, the deal breaker. The volume is very low, I mean to the point to where either these are just tuned way down to save battery for that rgb or my pair is defective. I tested these and all my wireless headsets get much louder. Arctis 7, Arctis 1, g933, astro a20, A50's, even the old g930's. I don't understand where Logitech missed with these, these have the looks, the comfort, and the battery life, with all the audio tuned down and volume levels decreased. Either these drivers are really bad, or my pair is defective, either way these are being returned. Do yourself a favor, any of the headsets I mentioned above are much better. The battery life is worthless if rgb sucks 10 hours off of it on console and its pc only to turn this off. The niche use is only fps and streamer because the rgb serves no purpose. Logitech take notice here, you got most of it right but the price point is very high for the audio quality, it's bad, and the volume is to low. Place an update to firmware to allow rgb to be turned off period, so console users don't have to deal with that. Arctis One has these beat hands down. I know this won't be a popular review, but it has to be said.Edit: 10/23/2020 I can confirm that these are de-tuned, using a pre-amp on pc I boosted the db to 1.5 and the volume level is up 20% more than stock settings and of course this will drain the battery faster. For the price, these are a big negative from me. You will need to keep these at 80  to 100% on ps4 otherwise you will not hear detail. Logitech, if you are seeing these, its time to up that pre-amp in your software because your drivers are capable.TLDR: Niche headset saved for streamers with useless DTS, poor volume, and no way to turn off RGB on PS4. These are hit or miss on comfort, either these feel great for small ears or medium ears these are almost on-ear. Volume level is a deal-breaker and I should not have to pre-amp and bypass software to turn these up higher. Sorry, this might be the last Logitech headset I ever purchase, going for the HyperX Could II wireless.Also skip over every one of these Vine reviews, these people do no know audio. I have no ideal why Vine reviews are even counted."
The audio quality is great but my mic sounds terrible for some reason and I can't find a way to fix it.
good to decent headset volume control wheel on headset does not function. tried plugging into every USB on my PC as recommended online but it does not function. shame on logitech for poor support
"I realllly wanted to like these. They look super cool and the quality of the product seems good. But man, these things HURT to wear for more than 30min-1hr at a time. I ultimately ended up returning them due to this."
"First, I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the headset is very lightweight, super pretty, and felt so comfortable to wear! It also actually fit my petite face and head! I did put the band on the tighter setting. I originally bought this headset because it is 1 wireless and 2, the most important, I heard it was great for people with petite faces/heads and I needed this because I have TMJ and my old headset was causing me a LOT of jaw pain because it was too big for my face and the old headset covered over half of my actual face.The reason the stars are low is because I did know the mic quality would be bad. However, I didn't expect this $150 (with taxes) headset mic quality to be worse than one of my $30 headsets. It makes me sound gravely AND it goes very robotic with my naturally hight-pitch voice. My poor friends were so confused and couldn't understand half of the things I was saying and if they did it just sounded so bad for their ears. We spent over 4 or 5 hours trying to adjust the headset settings. It is just a terrible mic and the BlueVoice made it worse.Also giving a low rating because the software for this is very frustrating to work with. It was switching between profile and I had to go find out I needed to disable all the game profile settings I have for this to work. Which the software automatically imports EVERY game on your computer! I had over 50+ profiles to disable because it even counted games on my 2 external SSDs! If this had a bluetooth feature I might of kept it, but sadly it doesn't. Find something else, seriously. For this price the mic should be decent, which it isn't even decent in my honest opinion. It sounds like a $5 microphone."
Manipulative pricing. Headsets top notch this would be my 2nd.
"I want to open positively about this headset, there's many things I enjoyed.Audio - In terms of Audio it sounds great, it's not lacking and I imagine the only people who would actually complain about it are very particular or audiophiles who can really dive into the most minute of details.Battery Life - It lasts a long time, especially if you turn off the lights! Great for long sessions, you wont have to stop and recharge in the middle of your gaming binges.Comfort - In terms of comfort this is by far one of the most comfortable pieces of tech I've ever worn on my head, fresh out of the box I wore it for hours on end without any form of discomfort or irritation.Microphone - It takes a little setting up and adjusting, but once you dial in those settings it sounds great. Sure you could have better audio quality by investing in something that isn't built into your headset but for what you're getting this headset delivers good microphone quality.As you can see I have a lot of great things to say about it, but I give it a one star review... So lets go ahead and address that.Put simply, after some time passes while using the headphones the audio starts to turn to static and it will get louder until it hurts your ears. It's easily fixed by simply powering off and on the headset again.. Which may sound simple enough but when you're paying a premium for a premium product this is unacceptable. Having to do this every 20 minutes to an hour means stopping mid conversation, stopping in the middle of your game, video or whatever you're choosing to do to resolve this.When I did my research of this product it all looked great, so many fantastic reviews and I agree it's a good product otherwise. I tried so many things to solve this from switching usb slots, making sure it's plugged into the motherboard, charged... so on and so forth as I dug through reddit threads and posts of people who had the same or similar problems. What worked for some didn't work for others and for me I just never found a solution.I'm very disappointed that I have to give this a 1 star review, now I'm 215 dollars in the hole until I return this because I had to order another headset from another maker to replace this not even a week after getting it. So I can't in good conscience ever recommend this product or give it any score higher than 1 star otherwise it would be an easy 5. I'm feel very burned and frustrated with Logitech for this one and wanted to warn others that this could potentially happen to them too.All of this being said, you could still choose to try your luck and not have any issues and just have a great set of headphones but you'll have to be willing to roll the dice on that. I encourage anyone who reads this to really consider if you're willing to take a shot with this product to do so being aware that this is a possibility."
"Mic quality is decent. Volume isn't the best but it's adequate. I bought these because i work from home doing call center work and I wanted quality comfortable headphones to wear for 8 hours straight. They are very comfortable, but people calling in complain that they can hear my dogs barking in the background. My old Sony Gold ps4 headset had some kind of built-in noise cancellation, I guess, that eliminated such intrusive background noise. I suppose overall I'm not upset nor am I overly enthused about this purchase. It does what it's intended to do."
"Logitech products have always been great quality. I own their wireless G502 X Plus mouse and I've loved it since the minute I turned it on. But, I can't say the same for this headset.Cons: To begin, the headset was way too small for my head. I don't think my head is huge by any means.. but my ears were aching after an hour or two. Even being lightweight and tight, the headset also seemed to shift on my head a lot any time I pointed my face down. Although the headset charged in just under an hour and a half, the battery life also lasted around the same. Maybe four hours in I was already receiving the bright flashing red ""I'm dying!"" LED signal.Pros: The USB connectivity was fine and cooperated easily. The headset is sleek and the patterned band at the top really seals the aesthetic. The LEDS can be controlled easily through Logitech's app and react almost instantly after you save the preset.Other: I didn't purchase the headset for the mic. I use an external HyperX mic. A lot of reviews say the mic isn't the best quality, but I can say the audio quality through Spotify or in-game is pretty decent."
"I want to start out by saying, I love how it looks and feels. It's not tight, has an adjustable top and just feels great sitting on your head. The software as well is very intuitive and easy to work with, I already had it installed because I use Logitech keyboards and mouses religiously... sadly, that's all the good I have to say.I went to buy this one as my HyperX headset broke and I've never been more disappointed in sound quality.Context: I'm hearing impaired (75% hearing loss) and autistic. The second audio started playing from these, I got an instant headache from a sound that just felt... idk, empty? Scratchy? I messed around a lot with the settings, downloaded some user-made presets and did my best to make it work. It's like I had to chose between hearing my friend on discord and my game having any sound other than bg music.For reference, I play ffxiv. Messed with all in-game settings as well, did everything I could.. A really weird feeling when no sounds feel separated. I couldn't hear players emotes (even maxed out in settings) because it felt like it just meshed with in-game music and sound effects. It was such a strange experience. Otherwise, it was just very.. scratchy and empty, no depth to the sound at all. It was also not very loud, and the volume wheel wouldnt work for me. I may have gotten a defective one..Another weird situation occurred when I tried streaming a game to my friend. I'm not sure if it's tied to the software specifically, but he described the audio just like I was hearing (empty, distant, scratchy, ect). I wonder if the software somehow effects the audio of streams? I'm not really good with that technical stuff so not sure if that's a fault of the software or headset. It's never happened to us before, and I'm always streaming to him.The LEDs are also placed very strange (beware glasses wearers, they will reflect off of them), but easy to turn off in the software.As far as the mic goes.. well my friend just said I sound like a customer service agent with a company provided mic, so take from that what you will. I didn't have time to fully test it sadly because of my sensory processing issues.Unfortunately I couldn't test battery life either because after an hour I had a sensory meltdown with the static and popping noises that began when my friend was streaming a video to me. I didn't even have it loud, only about 50% on volume mixer and pc volume.Thankfully amazon worked with me on this purchase, I'm going back to hyperx."
I thought this was a normal headset that you can use on anything device but it doesn‚Äôt work on Xbox
"I have customers tell me that I‚Äôm breaking up and they can‚Äôt understand me and I have to hold the microphone for them the then hear me. The headset is also heavy and bulky. My ears sweat wearing them. Not my favorite headset to use, but I do like the color. I have yet to find a wireless headset I love this is my 3rd set."
"I'm disappointed with this product, but before I start on that there are some good points I want to mention. These headphones are very comfortable for one, I love the option to remove the headband for adjustments to the head and how it is over the ear which is great for someone who has a lot of piercings. It is also just a very pretty set and goes well with a gaming setup if you have one and even if not it is good for just aesthetics. As for the sound quality, it's all right. I'm no sound expert but I would compare it to a set of 1st of 2nd generation airpods. Just very basic sound. For the price I think it works.Okay now for the bad stuff, I'd say the biggest issue is that the microphone is not the best. And mine broke within 2 weeks of using it. When I say it broke I don't mean the detachable mic part broke, I mean the mic just stopped working. It worked one day then the next it just stopped, the mic wasn't picking up my voice anymore. Although I understand that compared to a lot of other gaming headsets this isnt' the most expensive, it is still a good chunk of money. So I'd expect it to at least last me more than two weeks. Lastly, this'll be a personal comment about this product. This set is connected wirelessly by USB right? But I think for convenience and price sake they could've been bluetooth. With that said I have a problem with that only because my mic died on me with such little use, meaning I've found the overall product a bit lackluster.Anyways, thats my tid bit about this. I don't usually write product reviews but I do feel slightly robbed about this one."
"My wife wanted to like them, but because of their narrow shape (narrower than SteelSeries Arctis 7+), she found that they were pressing painfully on the back edge of her ears. If the cushion itself were thicker perhaps it would not have been painful, but that's not the case.On the plus side, they are extremely light weight for a wireless set, and it didn't cause any additional discomfort from weight or pressure. The adjustable suspension band was needed, and we were thankful it was there otherwise it wouldn't have fit her smaller head shape. The way it's designed I would hope it would be easy to replace in the future if it stretches too much (it just pops on at the one of the two adjustment points on each side). It actually being so will depend solely on whether Logitech actually wants to keep stock of the part.She didn't report anyone having any difficulties hearing her (with Logitech software installed, which reportedly makes a decent improvement to its quality via the Blue software). This may be a problem if you don't want to add another piece of 'unifying' software to your system, this could be another deal breaker.Sound quality I'd say was ok-decent. Not horrible, but not outstanding from my brief listening. She didn't say she disliked the sound quality, but she also didn't comment about it like she enjoyed the sound quality of the SteelSeries Arctis headsets (7+, wired pro with dac - even better, but now comparing wired to wireless).In short, if you don't have rounder shaped ears and don't mind the thinner cushioning (still seemed adequate), you may want to give them a try particularly if you are looking for lightweight wireless.If you like thicker padding, have larger or rounder shaped ears, or want to avoid having to install another 'unifying' software to your system to get the full potential of the headset, I'd look elsewhere."
I was so happy to get these and try them out- these came at such a high recommendation and i cant recommend for all day 40 hour wear. I am in a call center and thought if I had over the ear headphones my ears and head would feel better than if headphone were on my ears. These worked great for about 3 weeks now I have massive migraines from the squeezing on my head- i have to take off when not is use for long periods of time. I am sad that for the cost these didnt work out and I am on a search again for a great pair of headphones.
"Everything about this design wise is amazing, it's really comfortable and easy to wear for hours on end. But the mic is so so bad. Which depending on what you need/want will be a deal breaker. For me, the mic was so bad I wasn't able to stick with the headset, especially considering there are other headsets for a similar price point out there that do it much better."
"The microphone is trash, don't even bother. Your phone probably has a better microphone.As for the rest:Light weight so sometimes you forget you have it on which is great for comfort, however it also feels frail. I was always afraid that if it bent a bit too much it would snap. It just feels like the frame is cheap plastic, really doesn't feel like this device was +100$Sound quality and surround sound are indeed amazing though and the battery lasts so long it was hardly ever an inconvenience.HoweverI bought this not even a year ago (6-8 months) and everything was fine. I left it plugged during the night to charge and now it wont turn on at all. I always left it plugged in to charge during the night. Never had an issue, no physical damage, no special cable, nothing. It just won't turn on.Seriously?I spent around 150$ to use a headset with a flimsy frame only for it to last around 8 months?Currently looking to see what I can do with the protection plan, I honestly doubt I'm ever buying another one again, aside from the sound itself it the rest of the product doesn't represent the price tag: I rather check out others.Oh yeah it also has funny RGB lighting which I immediately turned off, if that interests you."
"After the wire on my Razer Kraken Kitty headset went out and kept causing my gaming to go awfully I decided to buy a new headset. I‚Äôve seen many gamers wearing these (and they‚Äôre even featured in the sims 4 now as an accessory) and then a good friend further recommended them as she uses them frequently for streaming. Naturally I thought it was a good idea, and I‚Äôve never considered myself any sort of sound snob ‚Äî in fact if it‚Äôs not a competitive multiplayer game I usually play without volume. As soon as it arrive I found it really cute and comfortable and I excitedly loaded up a tv show on Hulu‚Ä¶ it sounded awful to me. It was like listening to it out of the speakers on my Nano‚Äôs tv. I thought okay, let me try with Spotify or iTunes‚Ä¶ music was worse. Then I considered that maybe I didn‚Äôt have the correct ‚Äúsound profile‚Äù (again not an audiophile) and I downloaded a couple off the Logitech G Hub. Still not great. I tried loading Dead By Daylight, a game I play regularly. Now I will say the game volume was better??? It sounded more clear and crisp than the tv show and music I tried to play. But ultimately it was harder to tell where footsteps and other sound cues were coming from and I grew frustrated. Not sure if the pair I received were defective or perhaps I‚Äôm spoiled after the THX spatial audio on Razer but I ended up coughing up the extra $50 to buy a wireless Kraken V3 Pro instead and I‚Äôm happy again. I gave three stars because it is cute and comfortable though, despite no noise cancellation and the sound being so muffled and distorted, and it also shipped really fast."
"I've got well mixed feelings about this headset. Speaker and mic quality seem good, which I would've thought would be the most important things about a headset before owning this. I hate that an app is required to change the lights, and the lights themselves are annoying sometimes.The existing onboard controls are simple and good, but they're all on one side meaning there is plenty of room for onboard lighting controls, making the app requirement even more infuriating. The lights didn't bother me at first, but the more I used these the more I hate them. They can get bright enough to cause glare on a nonreflective screen. I wish I'd realised how annoying the lights and app would be before the return window closed.Depending on the size, shape, and material of your glasses, these will be almost impossible to wear with them. I have three pairs and only one doesn't produce enough glare to make these unusable while wearing glasses.Charging works great. They take a little longer to charge than I would've thought given the battery size, but the battery life is good for the battery size, so it doesn't bother me. The interface is really well designed. All the buttons are really easy to identify and use without taking off the headset."
1. Good. Looks sleek & feels comfortable2. Good. Nice charger3. Bad. TERRIBLE mic quality4. Bad. No LED on/off button5. Bad. Bad LED design. It literally reflects off my glasses at night. Were they not thinking?Honestly if they cared and fixed what‚Äôs ruining their product they would bell have a lot of sales. But overall I‚Äôm never going to buy from them again. Logitech is a üëéüèΩP.S I bought it when it was on sale. Even on sale it‚Äôs not worth it
"I was incredibly disappointed with these headphones and ended up returning them. My headsets that I've gotten in the past that are $20-30 were much higher quality with both mic and sound, which should tell you a lot.Pros:-Comfort [10/5 stars]I've never had a pair of headphones anywhere near this comfortable before, it feels extremely soft and doesn't apply much pressure to the top of your head while still maintaining a very good seal around your ears. I was beyond impressed by that, and it gets an immediate and easy 10/ 5 stars on the comfort scale.-Aesthetic [5/5 stars]They're really nice looking headphones, very sleek and pretty.-PC app [5/5 stars]The app that you can download and adjust the audio mix and other settings with is very nicely set up and easy to use.Cons:-Mic quality [0/5 stars]This is something that I absolutely have to have. Above all things, this was the most important to me and the ultimate deal breaker. The mic is tinny at best and has some really odd qualities to it that I don't want to put my friend group through listening to. If a 1 is a perfect mic quality and a 10 is so muffled you can't understand the person talking, it sounds like a 5.5/10 on the tinny scale (sounds muffled, muted, and like I am talking through a tin can). My 'S' sounds were also apparently extremely sharp and ear piercing, which has never been an issue with any of the headsets I've used in the past. I tried this both on PS5 and PC, and it sounded exactly the same with both regardless of what settings I swapped. The headset was fully updated, and I'm fully confident the mic was properly locked into the jack how it was supposed to be.-Audio quality [2.5/5 stars]The audio quality is pretty meh. Honestly, I would have kept using them regardless as long as the mic was good, but the speakers sound extremely cheap to me even after making sure the headset was updated and adjusting settings in the pc app. The depth was pretty lacking and it sounded closer to the speakers that you get built into PS5 controllers than a quality headset."
"I got these in December and everything has been fine until recently. Audio will be perfectly fine then out of nowhere it gets all roboty and like white noise is the best way to describe it. It won‚Äôt go away unless you completely turn them off and turn them back on, only for them to repeat the same issue. It is very annoying an convenient. And I‚Äôve babied these since they‚Äôre on the pricey side so I haven‚Äôt dropped them or anything. This happens both when I used them on PC or my PS5. Makes me regret getting these because I just want to play and not have this inconvenience happen over and over. So just a PSA before buying these. Other than that they are very comfortable and great audio."
"I am docking a star because my hair regularly gets caught on this headset. I have used countless headsets over the past couple decades and I have never encountered a headset that my hair regularly gets tangled on until this one. I have very long, straight hair, but it is voluminous so maybe if your hair is finer you'll be okay. I am also docking another star because the microphone quality isn't as good as the one on my last headset. The day I switched from my razer to this headset, my husband could immediately tell the difference and said it didn't sound as good. If all you care about is appearances, the color purple, and shiny lights, then this is the headset for you. If I could do it over again, I would keep shopping around because this headset ain't it."
its decent but when charging it glitches and says its 6% till its fully charged. not sure if its the headset or the logitech software but either or it should be fixed.
"So, I bought these after a ton of research, I WFH and thought these would be great because of weight and the cloth earpads. They met those expectations just fine, but the microphone was not good at all, not only was it strange way to connect it, but it just didn't feel great, and it does NOT have a mute button on it. There is a mute button, but it is located on top of the headset. I don't know, I also had nothing but issues when I connected it to my PC, sometimes it worked and most times it did not. I had problems once I downloaded the driver to my PC not only with this set but then my old set also had problems after installing the software. I sent them back and do not recommend for WFH, for gaming might be great, the weight is good, and the comfort was great also but for sure do not think WFH is good with these."
Over all the headphones are good they are comfortable and sound is good I have a small voice and people are about to hear me clearly. My only issue is after 3 days the program that reads the percent of the power is stuck at 6% charge for an hour and still at 6% waiting over 3 hours and still at 6%. Tap the power button and it says low power. So no matter what i do the power reader doesn't work.
"Everyone occasionally runs into a defective product.  I ran into a completely dead battery that wouldn't charge...but what really makes a brand worth its money is their response to the issue.  I reached out to Logitech and was forced to use their web-based AI chat.  It took forever to find my serial number because I couldn't ask it ""where the heck is the serial number on this thing, there are 15 different numbers and you don't like any of them"" (only to find I needed to remove a piece of fabric to find it).  The serial number is the only number that's hidden....then it transferred me to a ""live human""...who told me that support for the device isn't handled through chat.  Or through phone.  She had to email them and they would reach out to me.  After 45 minutes of trying to deal with the issue, she said she had emailed them and I should expect a response back within a day.  Finally got a response from Logitech after a month.  They shipped a replacement using the slowest possible shipping option, and after 10 days I had my replacement headset.  A month later, the replacement headset was sitting on my lap.  Without thinking I stood up, and it fell ~1.5 feet to the *CARPET* below.  After that, the it stopped charging and now my replacement headset it dead.  Two dead units in 4 months.  Absolute garbage.Logitech used to be a great company.  They built quality hardware once upon a time.  They used to *immediately* take care of their customers.Apparently those days are gone.  I'm buying a new wireless headset, and it'll be some cheap imported device from overseas.  I can by 10 cheap wireless headsets for the price of 1 Logitech headset, and they'll easily outlast the Logitech.Update: I have an employee that we bought one of these headsets for too..  This morning he sneezed and his headset came off his head and fell about a foot on to his keyboard.  The keyboard still works, but guess what doesn't?  The crap Logitech headset.  The left ear cup speaker broke.  Come on Logitech...your name used to stand for quality.  Now it stands for cheap garbage that's priced much higher than the identical garbage coming in from across the pond...Aaaand an update.  Logitech replaced my bad headset, and the replacement died within a few months.  The battery doesn't charge.  The replacement was NEVER accidentally dropped 1.5 feet onto carpet.  It just randomly decided to stop charging.These headsets are complete garbage and very over-priced for being so."
Been taking great care for it but after a year or two the glue or adhesive they use will fail and the ear piece will fall apart on you. It might be worth getting the 2-3 year warrenty if they replace it for you. Essentailly 2 sets of head phones for $128
i have a big head and this almost doesnt fit
"I wanted a wireless headset + mic for casual gaming with friends because I was tired of my wired headset getting tangled in everything. The audio quality SOUNDS good when you watch a video but SPEAKING is terrible. Everybody said that I sounded muffled like I'm being smothered by a pillow and there was no way for me to fix it. I went into sound settings, discord settings, and even downloaded Logitech G Hub and that didn't fix it either. Turns out, it's the product that's awful, not anything on my end. I'm really disappointed and I'm going to be returning this product, even if this headset looks pretty."
"unfortunately you can‚Äôt turn off the lights that are on by default without downloading an app and opening the app which will keep a program running in the background even when exited, clearly these weren‚Äôt designed with glasses-wearers in mind, this DOES NOT function properly out of the box if you wear glasses the lights will reflect make gaming unbearable without an app (whoever decided to not have the lights default OFF should be fired and banned for the industry) absolutely unnecessary and predatory business tactics, stay far far away from anything this company does2 stars because the sound is alright i suppose"
"I got these as a spare wireless headset while my primary headset recharges. Tried them on in a store, and the primary selling point was comfortability. My new pair‚Äôs ear cushions aren‚Äôt as good as in-store, but I assume they will break in with wear. What I miss from my SteelSeries Arctis Pro is that mic turns red when muted (very handy feature for discord users) and my Arctis Pro also has a wheel that tunes audio between game/chat (wonderful for not having to leave applications/games when needing to hear friends or game more). If you‚Äôre a big gamer and looking for a primary headset, I would recommend spending the extra money for extra features. If you‚Äôre a casual gamer or don‚Äôt use discord/chat, then these are excellent for comfort (good for smaller heads) and affordability.Pros: Comfortable (fits small heads), light-weight, competitive pricing ($127 at time of review), detachable/replaceable mic, good battery life (states battery remaining when you click power button), excellent wireless range.Cons: Hard to tell when muted (makes an audible noise but no mic light), can only change master volume (no game/chat control), RGB light placement reflects off glasses, audiophiles probably won‚Äôt like the sound quality."
"I liked this headset more than it probably deserved. The sound quality was decent and I've never had any major complaints. The microphone was fairly mid, but it did the job and the people on the other end didn't have any complaints. The Logitech options were pretty nice, although that UI could use a bit of fine-tuning. Overall I've been happy with it.BUT: I've had it for almost a year and a half, and suddenly the mic will only pick up very loud input. If i speak at a normal volume, it doesn't pick up. Once I raise my voice up to an uncomfortable level, it picks up. It's the headset and not the mic (and not a software issue), because I bought a second replacement mic after I had lost the first, and then found my original. So I have two OEM mics (which are easily swappable). They both have the same problem.I've read in other reviews where this same thing happened to other users and that there is no fix. Real bummer, as this was one of the only headsets I've had that didn't make my ears hurt in the first few hours of gaming. After like 5+ though, I don't think *any* headset doesn't hurt my ears.Anyway, sad day to have to chuck these, because my microphone is very important to the way I game."
"Im not sure how to feel. First off I will start by saying I bought this because it‚Äôs purple lol. I‚Äôve stuck to Corsair‚Äôs since ps3. It took a lot of thinking for me to decide to commit cause I really like their stuff and the company itself. I saw all the reviews talking about the glare from the lights, but decided to take a chance anyways cause I have anti glare on my glasses.. boy was that a mistake. You definitely notice it and it honestly makes me kind of nauseous. I also feel like these always had less features than most headsets around the same price. However I don‚Äôt feel super negatively about the headset. It looks great and the sound isn‚Äôt too bad as long as you change the settings. When I first got it the sound was REALLY flat, like so flat. So make sure you plug it into to a PC and turn on surround sound and a different EQ. Im unsure if I‚Äôll be returning these or not, im gonna wait a week and see if I can adjust to the glare in my glasses. If you want a really sleek looking headset with decent mic quality, this is it."
"Have had these for about a month now and overall disappointed.Cons:GENERALLY UNCOMFORTABLE.Begins to hurt my ears after about 30-60min pf use.SOUND QUALITY IS NOT GOODThe sound quality is about as good as $30- $40 ear buds/headphones. I am pretty picky nowadays on sound quality and I found these to be lacking big time.Pros:GREAT BATTERY LIFELast longer than I expected on a single full charge, this is always one of my biggest concerns with wireless headsets.MISC:Mute button in the back is a convenient and well placed feature. The e Bluetooth connection is always strong. No complains on cord length or durability.SUMMATION:Overall it does not warrant its price tag at all. I wanted to give other brands a chance but this is a brand I'll be steering full clear of in the future. HyperX is way better, also the DT 990 headset is easily one of the best audio quality headphones I've ever had, sadly my head was too big for them and the top half broke."
"Ever since I bought these I've had issues with them. I use the Logitech software on my PC, but even with or without it, the sound is completely subpar. You almost always hear ringing when you're playing with them and there's no way to get rid of it no matter how you adjust it. The ringing actually gets worse whenever you pair it with the actual Logitech G Hub - and the LED's must also emit a high frequency noise because if I ever mess with the brightness of them, it makes the ringing noise worse. After having these for over a year and never wanting to use them because of their horrible quality, I found myself back and looking for headsets again and saw these pop up in the search and thought 'There's no way I paid near $150 for those garbage headphones'.Went back to check my orders and found out - alas, I very much did. How on earth I managed to buy horrible quality headphones for over a hundred when I know I could get far better for around $75 is beyond me, but it's a mistake I won't be making again."
"Purchased this in Oct 2023. I work at home and do a bit of gaming, so it is not uncommon to be wearing these for 10+ hours a day during the week.Lately I've noticed some discomfort while wearing as the stretchy band that keeps the plastic headrest off your head has worn out, so the hard plastic is directly on my scalp. With short hair, that becomes pretty uncomfortable.I will say the sound and voice capture seem to be good quality, but with this more recent issue and the lights built into the headset that are on by default, this may not be the headset for working folks. Will be looking at other options to replace it."
"SOUND QUALITY IS TRASH!!!!!I bought these headphones because of the aesthetic of the build and after reading multiple reviews, hopefully the sound was good as everyone said it was because I play fps games so sound is super important. Unfortunately I feel like people are tryna hype these up more than they deserve. The sound quality is awful LOL. I tried testing out the sound and it comes out all muffled, I have to turn my volume all the way up to 100 just to hear as decently mid as my old headphones (razer krazen BT kitty wireless headphones). I dowbloaded the software to see if I could play around with it and make the quality better (it did not even do anything)‚Ä¶ For some reason the sound is decently OK on the app for these headphones but everywhere else on any games it‚Äôs like really bad? Even then, it still doesn‚Äôt compare and i‚Äôve had my old headphones for over 2 years. Don‚Äôt buy them, they‚Äôre garbage and only cute to wear on your head."
"I've owned Logi products for years, and have owned quite a lineup of wired and wireless mouse, trackball, keyboards, webcams and headsets and have never been disappointed. So when I was looking for a wireless headset, it was a no brainer to stick with Logitech.Based on price and features, the G733 looked like a great option. I wasn't expecting high fidelity and. all I wanted was decent quality gaming headset app I wouldn't get tracked up as I often did with my G430.Loved how light these are, and have supper comfortable head support band and great ear pads.  Setup was easy overall.After a few minutes of using it, I launched into a game to test the experience and as soon as the game music kicked in, I heard distortion on the bass/drum. Volume was only about 30% and there was no change to headphones settings. I quit the game, played around with Windows settings but even the Windows ""ding"" sound was distorted, robotic.  Then it went away on its own, only to come back a few minutes later. This happened several times while playing games or listening to YouTube.Long story short, I tested this on two different computers, one a custom desktop with Windows 10 and the other a gaming laptop with Windows 11, and I had the same exact experience with random distorted audio.Reached out to Logi who suggested I get a replacement from Amazon. That made no difference as the new headset has the same issue.Funny thing, I tested the headset for two days on my work Mac and had zero distortion issue.My suspicion is the Windows drivers are bugged, but Logi has no solution.  So, as I bought these for gaming, not work, I have no choice but to return these and try something else.  Very disappointed!"
"I've been using this headset for about a year.  It replaced a pair of G935's that I got a solid 4 years out of, after replacing the earbuds and head cushion.I like Logitech sound quality, and the G733's share the G935's exquisite fidelity-without-ear-fatigue.  As an example, I use a pair of Sennheiser's for more than an hour and the sharp, cutting treble has my ears bleeding.  I want to throw them through the nearest windows.  Logi headphones never do that.But the old phones had rear-facing multicolor RGB LEDs.  The 733?  Front firing.  Which means they reflect off my eyeglasses.  Reflect off my monitor.  Reflect off my second monitor.  Reflect off my third monitor.  Reflect off my window.  Reflect off the other window.  Reflect off any little bits of chrome or shiny plastic that are on my desk.  Reflect off - you get the picture.You can shut the lights off, but that requires booting the G Hub app.  And booting the G Hub app means sitting through a 20 second process where it scrapes your registry and sends every app you use, along with usage data, back to Logitech.  So they can SELL it.  I hate this.  I hate it irrationally.  I really hate how hard they worked to make sure that you could never get the LEDs to turn off without making sure the app phone home first.  Even black nail lacquer couldn't completely squash the glow.Never again, Logitech."
"Purchased device during pre Christmas sale for a discounted price of $120 as a Christmas gift. Product performed great but after a little more than 6 months of almost daily usage the ear cup broke off the head band with no way to fix. I have had this problem with older Logitech models for my older son so I had purchased the assurion warranty for three years. They reimburse my head phones cost but that wasn‚Äôt enough to buy a new set, and my three year warranty wouldn‚Äôt cover the new product, so i‚Äôve lost over 2 years of coverage. Logitech does not make a product that holds up to usage and I would never buy there more expensive models. I thought the warranty would be a solution to this and allow me to get three years of usage out of the product but I have been taken by the warranty company, assurion. Figures."
"To keep or short, the word ""Gaming Headphones"" have really dropped in quality. No to mention Logitech. They used to make great products but always lacked in software. Instead of keeping the quality and fixing the software, they dropped the over all quality down to match the lack luster software. If you ask anyone that owns these and have used good headphones before, they will tell you the audio in these sound like you are listening to everything through a bucket. It has a muffled sound to it. Even after you mess with all the options, adjust the EQ, even turn on DTS. You just cant get rid of it. Its no as clear and clean as you would expect. If you want something with ""meh"" audio and you dont really care. Pick these up, but if you want something with clear audio. Go else where.With that all being said... The one good thing about these and main reason why I picked these up was because they do last 30hrs wireless. Which is great for when you have log gaming sessions, or you wanna listen to music while cleaning the house, ect ect... They do last, but again, lack audio quality.I am no going to talk about the Mic as I have not even plugged it in or used it. I bought these just for the headphones."
"Pros: lightweight, convenient buttons and controls, easily connected to PS5.Cons: foam padding is not breathable and gets hot, audio quality is not worth the price."
"The sound quality on this headset is great. I didn't know how much I was missing until I replaced my old set with this one. Fit is good - adjusting is easy. Now for the part that isn't so great. First, in order to shut off the led lights on the computer, you download Logitech G Hub. It's easy to control from there. However, if you use the headset with consoles, there's no way to shut off the led lights. So the battery is used up much faster, and there's nothing you can do about it, but charge a lot. Then there's the fact that when you plug in the headset to charge, there's some green light flashes and that's it. No indication it's charging and worse, no indication when it's fully charged. Logitech just says the unit needs 3 hours of charging so I guess you're supposed to set a timer or something or leave it plugged in overnight. Pretty prehistoric to me. So bottom line, as far as sound and mic goes - it's good. As far as being in the 21st century for the rest of it - not so much."
"I was downgrading from a broken set of Arctis Pros and got this because it was considerably cheaper than a replacement. For gaming, the mic and sound is fine. However, there are annoyances when using the device.Power Button: When I travel, I throw this into my laptop bag. I always open my bag to the headphones being on because the power button is protruded and light touched and does not require being held to turn on but needs to be held to turn off. Literally anything that grazes the bottom of the headset will turn it on.Mute function: My old logitechs had a flip mic so you knew when it was muted. My arctics pros had a toggle button that you could feel if it was pressed down or released. This has one single on/off button and the only feedback you get is a non intuitive tone when either is switched between. It's digital instead of analog. This further creates the problem that if you have your mic muted and you go out of range of the receiver and come back, you're unmuted without you knowing it.RGB: The position where the lights beam into your peripheral vision. It's more prevalent with the lights off. The only time you'll ever see your RGB is out of the corner of your eye when you don't want to.Charging: Green light flashes when you plug it in and turns off and that's it. You just unplug it when you feel like it might be charged. The reason I came here to write this review right now is because I just experienced the third time my cable was plugged in all night and I turn it on to have a low battery warning as if it never charged.|Software: Only works with Logitech's G Hub software and not Logitech Gaming Software so if you have legacy hardware like me that doesn't work properly with G Hub, you're screwed because Logitech won't let you have both installed and you will need a separate computer to adjust settings on one device or uninstall/reinstall the software suite you need at the time.It's pretty light and easy to wear for long sessions. That's all I can really give it.I'm also not a fan of detachable mics. It's annoying when you want to eat and you have to pull off a tiny piece of your headphones and hope you don't misplace it. Again, I understand this is the budget line but it's like they cut small costs for huge functions. Couldn't they have just not included RGB and pay for everything else the headset is lacking?I get this is the cheaper variant of logitech headphones but some functionality of it is plain broken."
The only thing carrying the headset is the audio (which is really good) - But the microphone is awful and the headset is flimsy as all can be. How can a headset that's 1/4 the price sound 4x better??????
I paid for the fastest shipping and it arrived late. Let alone the box was damaged and taped shut as if it was opened. The ear phone cloth was smashed against itself so it isn‚Äôt attached correctly too. Disappointed.
"I am extremely disappointed in this headset and honestly, I expected better from Logitech. As soon as I set this headset up and got it running, about 10 minutes into my Microsoft Teams meeting, the audio started crackling and coming out distorted to the point where I could not even understand what anyone was saying.I tried all the troubleshooting steps:- Plugging the dongle in to multiple different USB ports- Uninstalling and reinstalling the audio drivers- Windows updates/firmware updates/driver updates- Using the headset on a different PC (same issue)- Uninstalling and reinstalling G-Hub app (turning off surround sound and audio enhancements- Switching to a different playback device and switching back- Restarting PC multiple times- BIOS UpdateI really expected more from a $100+ headset and ESPECIALLY from a Logitech headset. Switching to a different playback device and switching back keeps the audio distortion at bay for a mere 5 minutes and then it's back again.The real slap in the face is that I spoke with Logitech about this issue and they refused to issue me a replacement which really sucks and now I have a headset that I can use for maybe 5-10 mins and that's it. Honestly, don't waste your money."
"The mic quality isn't good, I sound muffled. The sound quality is nice. It has a comfortable fit. Would recommend buying a separate mic for this product, rather than using the mic attached to the headset."
"Overall I like these headphones. If you're looking for a wireless pair of headphones for use on your computer and possibly for your console games this'll do. However, if you expect these to be a goto for all your wireless headset needs you should look elsewhere.The issue is that the headphones can only communicate with whatever device you want to use it on only if the USB dongle is attached to it. I've seen listings that say this is a bluetooth headset but it *must* use its bluetooth receiver to function. For example you can't pair this with your phone unless you attach an adapter to it that'll allow you to plug their bluetooth dongle.I also feel like it was a miss to not just use the logitech unifiying receiver you get with so many of their other products such as their mice or keyboards.Looks are awesome. I do love the look of this headset and the rgb lights on the set itself don't get in the way at all when you're gaming. However, I can only stand to wear these for an hour or two before my ears start to ache from wearing it. Adjustment is limited to adjusting the band between two tabs on either side of the headset so if neither works for you, well, that's it.I really wanted to love this headset but without offering bluetooth that doesn't require their adapater and the ability to pair with any of your devices its function is very limited and so I ultimately can not recommend this product. When I can go out to the dollar store and pick up a wireless headset for $5 that can pair with all my devices -  not offering this functionality is too big a miss to ignore."
"I really wanted to like this headset but it was very hard to, after using it for 2 weeks. The sound quality is no different than any other headphones and they were light and comfortable ‚Ä¶. but that‚Äôs where the good ends. The mic is garbage and the charging did not even work for me, upon multiple attempts to try and charge them. Not to mention, G hub is one of the worst proprietary softwares available.I gave these 2 stars because functionally they work as intended but there are some issues that prohibit a good rating.If you can, buy the steelseries arctic nova 7. If you catch them on sale, they are around the same price as these, and offer loads more. The mic quality is miles better, and the software is easier to use."
"Bought these because I needed a headset for a small head, that is lightweight. (I wear my current one so many hours a day that it starts hurting halfway through the day.)This headset is great in these two aspects. It doesn't fall of my head when I look down, despite my small head. And it is really light and the extra headband distributes the weight so that I could barely feel it (after you adjust it to fit your head).I'm not a fan of the volume control - it just controls your system volume, and is not a separate control. But it's not a deal breaker (though it intermittently stopped working and I had to switch USB ports)The sound quality is okay, nothing to write home about, but fine for gaming and work. But the microphone killed it for me. I sound almost like I'm speaking into an old telephone receiver, or, well, just like someone with a cheap headset.While playing coop, I got several comments in how my voice quality went down so much (compared to my previous headset). I switched headsets with my husband to listen to his voice via Discord, and sure enough, it sounds like I'm wearing one of those $20 headsets.I'm returning the headset and have purchased an HS80 instead."
"let me tell you something I was always a big fan of Logitech. Always reliable until I had to deal with an issue and the customer service is the WORSE that I had to deal EVER. So I got this G733 headset, it is not the cheap one, it was a good one, worked for a few months and I had an issue with the USB connector stopped working. After wasting a long time on the chat/website/crappy customer service they sent me another USB connector (also was going to take more than 10 days to a replacement, and I needed it for work, anyways). Another USB connector was sent and nothing listed on their page worked to make the connection again. tried customer service. I've been on hold for 10 minutes for the past 3 days. It does have a 2-year warranty and this headset is less than 10 months old. If you ever need help from customer service, forget about it, you better get one of those knockoffs that will save you a lot of headaches. I will never buy anything from Logitech again after this. or just stick with the 20+ dollars equipment.. those sems to work fine and not a big loss if they don't work."
"I bought these to replace my 7 year old g633 Artemis Spectrums that are starting to show signs of being on their way out and I will be returning these to go back to those g633s until they no longer work.The good: I will admit these are very comfy, they can fit a smaller head, and they are aesthetically pleasing. But that's it, that's all I like.THE BADMic Quality: My friends immediately commented that my new mic sounded really bad quality, even after confirming the mic was connected properly, usb directly into the motherboard, advanced settings tuned in G Hub. Gaming headsets tend to not have good mics but I was expecting a lot better after the mic on the g633. A lot of this might have to do with it being wireless bluetooth.Sound Quality: The bass is too pronounced and the mids and highs just kind of blend together and sound indistinguishable. If you do any FPS gaming, it's near impossible to get footsteps to come through clearly enough without the din of everything else. I messed with the EQ settings for hours a day and there wasn't much improvement. The surround sound doesn't seem like true surround, it's still hard to tell which direction things are coming from and far away sounds end up sounding like they're right next to you. Not what you want when you need to hear someone creeping up close by and not someone across the map. Once again the g633 was leaps ahead on this front (maybe to do with the fact g633 uses Dolby Atmos and all new Logitechs use DTS?)All in all, my old g633 has its problems but the superior sound and mic quality make it worth it. I think I will be skipping the new Logitech headset models."
"I purchased these headphones in February and LOVED every second of them. They are extremely light-weight and very comfortable. The sound quality is great and I love the ability to edit your microphone settings inside the interface is great, especially as a streamer. However... I only gave it two stars, because having it after just under two months the sound stopped working on the right side of the headset. I tried to troubleshoot it in anyway possible. Unplugged the receiver and plugged it back in, changed the ports, cleaned out the headset and checked for clogs. Even made sure all drivers and programs were up to date... And simply turned it on and back off. Nothing.I contacted Amazon Support, because I loved these headphones so much, they helped me through the steps of requesting a replacement as I am within my warranty. However, going to logitech's site and finding the headphones was IMPOSSIBLE. Couldn't submit a replacement since these headphones were not listed.Unfortunate, but these things happen. Hopefully you have better luck with yours."
"If you're looking for some inexpensive headphones to listen to things on your computer or to use as a microphone, then this is an okay ""users first gaming headset"".Overall the headset is honestly a bit too small and it's probably geared towards maybe a younger demographic. It's not a bad headset, but it's not a huge step up from what I used to have. Gets the job done just know you get what you paid with this."
"It works fine and does what all the other headsets do; It's not my first headset. I wouldn't have anything bad to say, except it comes with a USB receiver, and if you lose that receiver, you're most-likely going to be buying another headset.You can contact Logitech and they'll give you a link to their support site where you can request one. You can't buy a replacement, because that'd be too easy. Of the responses to Logitech's support website I've seen, it's not helping anyone with this exact problem, solve it.If you run a search for ""G733 LIGHTSPEED USB receiver"" you'll find receivers ranging from $8-$80 from all sorts of sellers; don't know if any of them are legit and work though. It'd cost you some money to find that out.All in all, as long as you have the USB Receiver, you're good. If for any reason you don't have the USB receiver, your $140+ headset will probably need to be replaced despite the fact that it isn't broken and has nothing wrong with it.If I'd known that from the beginning, I would've got a different headset..."
"I had seen these in store and saw they were on-sale so I thought I'd try them out since they felt lightweight in the store. But actually getting them at home and having a chance to try them some more and I'm very unimpressed.First off, to me, with a large head, these are not at all comfortable. The earcuffs are too small, so they sit around the edge of my ears, not around them fully. Also the material, to me, feels very hot and heats up quickly. Finally, even at the max size, while it fits OK, it's more tight than I'd like. All that together makes a pair of headphones, that while light, is very uncomfortable.Moving on to sounds... Meh. If you've never heard good headphones, these might sounds good to you, but I found them to be very average for this price point. It's not poor, it's just not impressive. The bass is meh, the highs are meh, it's just meh sound. Again, that doesn't mean bad, it just meh.They do look nice, and the lightweight feels good in your hand, not cheap like you might think. The LEDs give it a cool look. The software isn't too annoying, I had no issues with it.For me, I'll be returning them as they're just way too uncomfortable, and with meh sound, it's not worth keeping. I wish they used this same lightweight design buyt just made the entire thing like 20% bigger - then dramatically increased the audio qualify, I'd absolutely be willing to pay more for something like that.But if you have a average sized head, live in a cold climate, and have never heard good quality audio (which is most people, to be clear), then maybe you'd like these more than I do."
"the design is very light weight and comfortable for extended use. souind quality (when you can actually hear) is very good , but unfortunately way too quiet. nowhere near loud enough to hear clearly while gaming. at full volume can barely hear hushed speaking in movies while watching Netflix or other streaming. cant fully enjoy music with such low volume either,these are a definite skip if youre looking for clear but also louder sound or if youre even mildly hearing impaired"
"When I first got this headset, I was very excited and impressed! Most of my desktop setup is Logitech and I needed a headset that would give me the high-quality sound I craved and a decent mic attached. For the first 8 months, I had it, it was wonderful. Super comfortable, long battery life, great sound with customization in the GHub, cute design, and better than expected detachable mic. However, over the last 4 months, I've noticed a SIGNIFICANT decline in quality. Like, it is noticeable. Even with the headset at 100, full volume, audio for browsers and applications sounds like it's at 40-50 volume. I'm unsure why the headset has degraded so much but safe to say, I'm upset. I was hoping the headset would last me at LEAST 2-3 years. Now, I'm back in the market for a new headset and wish that I hadn't gotten it in the first place. Save your money, and invest in better quality."
"I bought  these headphones because I teach classes online at night and sometimes my husband will be playing games in the same room. After reading the description, I was under the impression that I would be very minimally able to hear him and that the microphone would not pick up his voice. Neither of these things are true. Each of my classes are recorded so I listened to the playback after class and could clearly hear everything he was saying which means my students could as well. He was talking in his regular volume and is a good 6-8 feet away from me. I can get in trouble with the company I work for if they detect outside noises such as other people, dogs barking or my baby crying. That is why I decided to invest in some new headphones. I am very disappointed that these headphones did not meet the expectations set by the description. The sound quality is really the only good thing about them though I can hear everything around me.****edit to add that we played around with the setting some. Still does not eliminate noise that I am hearing so I wouldn‚Äôt call them noise canceling. The microphone now minimizes outside noise SOME. But if my husband says certain words it will pick it up and the microphone will hear the entire sentence. For example when he was on the other side of the room he said ‚Äúbut‚Äù it picked up on that word and then each word after that was heard. However other sentences with softer sounding letters were not picked up."
"I've had these headphones for a little over a year. They are having multiple issues now and Logitech has proven to be no help. They frequently have static or the sound will glitch completely. The worst though, is my set will give me actual shocks to my ears when the static issue gets really bad. I contacted Logitech weeks ago and sent in all the proof of purchase and photos they requested, yet they have not sent any kind of response. Worse was when I initially contacted them they asked what I thought they should do. Obviously if these headphones are shocking me without having any physical damage, I would like a replacement with a better quality unit or just an all out refund. After the shotty customer service, I will no longer be buying from this company and regret wasting my money on these."
"I returned the product because I originally bought a headset that didn't fit my platform, I'm on Xbox for context. I bought a new one and they sent a used busted headset that wasn't repaired at least."
"I‚Äôve been on the hunt for a good balance of comfort and quality in a headset with microphone for my Work From Home job.I spend my day on phone calls, so input AND output audio quality is very important. I had 2 complaints from callers on the other end the day I tried these; ‚Äúhard to hear‚Äù and ‚Äúmuffled‚Äù.The noise cancelling is distracting for my purposes. I couldn‚Äôt hear myself talk. I never realized how important that is until I couldn‚Äôt.The elastic band at the top is very comfortable, and I liked that you could purchase different designs when you get bored with one.The weight of the headset itself was too much for me. I felt relief when taking them off.I loved the lavender color and that it coordinated with my Logitech mouse, keyboard, and gaming mouse/desk pad. I felt sufficiently cute and coordinated.These headphones are not a good choice for an 8 hr shift while working from home. They‚Äôre heavy, have poor audio output, and don‚Äôt allow me to hear myself talking.I understand there is an app that allows you more control over your microphone quality, however I was not able to download this app on my company laptop. I feel that the default quality should be better out of the box and not require tweaking."
"I have a big head so it was pretty tight and uncomfortable(yet oddly comforting for a brief duration), and the audio quality left something to be desired. Of course I could just be used to my Astro A20 headset that I've had for a few years, but maybe one of y'all out there like how this Logitech set sounds.It has some nice features with the app you download to control the rgb and sound profile, but it feels rather lacking and a smidge buggy from time to time.Overall probably good to spoil a gamer kid, but not the greatest for an adult(unless ur tiny) imo."
"I thought these were going to be great. The sound quality is fine. They are lightweight and adjustable. The software for the headphones changes the settings on the computer to make the headphones the default for sound output which is annoying but tolerable. Sadly, I need these for streaming and after 45 minutes the ear pain they cause is unbearable. I'm sending them back."
"The headphones performed beautifully at first, the sound was great and the RGB lighting was fun. The headband was comfortable and it started off as a great experience.Over the span of a few months, the headband got stretched out and was unable to support the hard plastic above it, making the headphone extremely uncomfortable to wear. I ordered a replacement headband a few times but they only last a few months as well.The USB-C charging port also became extremely loose a few months in as well, to the point where it's been impossible to keep a USB-C plugged in while wearing it because gravity is sufficient to unplug it. Even charging the headset while lying flat on the table is difficult, because the USB-C port is just so loose that it just falls out if the table is bumped. I'll frequently try to charge it, come back after a few hours only to find that it hadn't spent any time actually charging.I had bought two headsets at the same time, one for me and one (in a different color) for my husband at the same time and both headsets experienced the same headband issue and USB-C issue."
Bought this headset back in 2021 and had to return it due to the mic not working. I got a replacement that worked perfectly fine until today.Worked perfectly for almost 3 years. Sound and mic were amazing and had no issues till today.Anyway logitech hardware warranty only lasts for 2 years and this headset mic lasted me over 2 years.So now I get to find a new mic now.
"Audio : The mic muffles your voice (even with their stupid application), the Audio is lack luster and low + it has little to no bassRBG: For whatever reason the people who designed this product thought it was a good idea to put RGB Lights right in the persons peripheral vision? Like who tf does that? The only way to turn RBG off is if you have the App. open at all times in the background...even then I've found that the lights randomly decide that they want to turn on and go disco mode next to my eye balls completely distracting me from whatever I was just doing.Genuinely who ever design this pile of trash needs to be banned from ever spit balling design plans."
"After testing out the microphone it turns out the headset only registered my voice thro the mic if I was YELLING. I game on a PS5 which is compatible with the headset and through my gaming with some friends, none of them could hear me unless I started to yell. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a defect on my specific headset but based on other reviews it‚Äôs pretty common. I recommend skipping this headset and look for something else :/"
"2 stars? Why? The headphones are comfy, reasonably priced and sound really good? Yeah? Well the dinguses at Logitech put lights on the front that reflect off of glasses directly into your flipping eyes! Why? It‚Äôs not like a bunch of people wear glasses, especially those that work with computers or gaming, right?Can you turn the lights off? Sorta. You have to download logitechs proprietary software, open the hub, and toggle the setting. Problem solved, yeah?Well if you game on a console, they turn right back on. Can you put tape over them? Maybe, but I don‚Äôt want flipping tape on my new $120 headphones!Can you flip them around? No! They are surrounded sound!I wouldn‚Äôt be so mad about this if I hadn‚Äôt already thoroughly enjoyed them during daylight hours, and the official Logitech website didn‚Äôt LITERALLY say ‚Äúhold the power button for two seconds to turn the lights off, press it again to turn them back on.‚ÄùNo kidding, THAT TURNS OFF THE FREAKING HEADSET! I DONT CARE IF THE HEADSET LIGHTS ARE OFF IF THE ARE NOT ON MY FACE!!!If you don‚Äôt were glasses, or if you do but don‚Äôt console game, go for it. Seemed like a great pair."
"I bought these in 2020 and have enjoyed their quality and features, including the lights and accompanying software.  But as time went on, my experience with these headphones turned sour, experiencing software and connectivity issues continuously with no improvement in sight.  I forget how many updates I've been through but each time I think little problems like audio cutting out every 5 minutes and the built in volume control not functioning would be fixed, every issue would reoccur without fail and I've had enough.  I wish I could say I'd recommend these headphones to others but my questionable experiences far out weigh the positive ones that I only had when I first purchased these."
"Returned it on the same day after receiving it.Why: I do play time to time fps and wantet to have some, more, game oriented headphones. After playing a few hrs I understood, it sounds good, but hard to point precisely enemies by sound. So, I stick to my rs 175 for a bit longer."
"Let me start out by saying this: I love Logitech's products.  Since I first started gaming on PC, Logitech was my first choice for peripherals.  I started with a Logitech G930 headset and Logitech G300S mouse.  I absolutely loved those products, and I was hooked.  Once those inevitably died, I upgraded to a Logitech G933 headset and G502 HERO mouse.  Fast forward to today, and I need a new headset.  I look on Amazon for a replacement, and I run across the G733 Lightspeed.  It has wireless connectivity and excellent battery life, so I buy it.  About 5 hours later, the product arrives at my doorstep.  I open it up, attach the microphone, and connect it to my computer.  Logitech G Hub instantly recognizes the headset and gives me a quick tutorial.  I close out of it and test the sound.  I'm not joking when I say this: the headphones bundled with the iPod Touch sound better than the new headset.  A little confused, I go into the settings and try enabling surround sound.  It just amplifies the problem.  Now I'm hearing hissing noises in the right earcup.  My G933 never sounded this bad, so I wonder if it's a problem with G Hub.  Uninstalling the program makes no difference.  At this point, I am very disappointed, and I feel like I've been lied to about the sound quality.  I spent $140 USD on a headset, and the sound was on par with grocery store headphones.  While I'm not an audiophile, I can recognize bad headphones and pinpoint what is wrong.  The sound is tinny.  The bass is lacking.  The clarity is trash.  I went ahead and returned this headset, and I will be trying a Razer headset.  I expected better from Logitech, especially considering the sound quality of their previous headsets.  As much as I regret to say this, it needs to be said: I can't recommend this headset to anyone.  The sound quality is atrocious, and the surround sound functionality is useless.  Spend your money on a different headset, especially if sound quality is important to you."
"The headset is super comfortable immediately upon putting it on, but I was extremely disappointed once I turned it on. The mic quality is extremely terrible, and I was hoping that coming from the G432 this would be an upgrade instead of a downgrade. Being that I use this for gaming and discord communication, this was a huge letdown, but at least the sound quality is great. Overall I don't recommend it and am sending it back."
I really liked everything about this headset until I joined any chat with friends. I was previously using Hyperx Alphas wired and the difference in mic quality was a complete 180. Ended returning this headset and buying a wireless Hyperx and it is crystal clear through the mic. I would suggest these as a good solo mic as headset was quit comfortable and sound through headset was great. When trying the mic settings after 2hrs of downloading random people's settings it still sounded like I was talking through a ski mask.
"This headset worked just fine when I first got it, but four days into using it, the right speaker went out. I tried turning it on and off, and dug through all my audio settings to see if that would help. Unfortunately it didn't work, so I had to buy a new headset. I don't think this headset is bad, but I personally just had a bad experience with it."
I had a razer kraken n they were pink I wanted another decent quality headset that were a pretty color lol and this was more expensive so I expected better quality!! I can‚Äôt really hear footsteps and for some reason when we get into loading screen and in the game the mic stops working !!! It works if u start a channel party in call of duty tho. It no one else can hear me so search n destroy sucks unless u have a full party!! They are comfortable and love the color sound is meh Mic is terrible !!  I should just return them lol
I liked it at first but then I tried using it with my phone‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no Bluetooth‚Ä¶ a $100+ device with no Bluetooth basically you can ONLY use this with its USB. For a premium product I expected better.
"I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend. The microphone quality is terrible. He sounds like he is using a cheap Xbox controller mic. We even used the included software to attempt to fix the quality, with no success. The fit and weight of the headset itself is very nice but you can get those benefits with a much cheaper wireless headset. For reference, I use a Razer Blackshark V2 Pro and should have just invested in a second pair for him as well. If you intend to use the mic with this headset, I cannot recommend this purchase at all."
"I bought these headphones and unboxed to test them out. After about 10 minutes of use, the headphones started making this awful loud staticky noise. I turned them off and on thinking there may have been interference of some sort, and after 10 minutes it did it again. I restarted my computer to see if there was any difference, but unfortunately, the same noise started up another 5 or so minutes after restarting. I read reviews before the purchase, but I decided to search a bit more to see if anyone else was having this issue. Low and behold, another person had the same exact issue and did some research finding that this problem is a well known problem with this specific model and allegedly, Logitech won't do anything to fix it. Guess I'm going back to Corsair for my audio needs."
"Bought this for our daughter for college but the mic came defective (didn't work). So my husband attached her old mic to it and it worked.  Unfortunately, we only had a few days before she went back to college (she took it with her) and there was no way to contact the seller to get a new mic (I tried). So, I contacted Amazon and they said that the whole thing would have to be sent back that they can't just replace the mic.  So 3 stars."
I've had this headset for about a year now and it has been decent all around. The issue is the mic stick is super short so it is like decent distance from my mouth. The Software has to be running in the background for the MIC volume to be turned up. If I don't go into the Logitech G hub and increase my output on the mic EVERYTIME after a pc restart no-one in discord can hear me. Do not think 130$ is worth for this mic. It's kind of booty. It ‚Äúauto‚Äù turns down mic output with no option to turn it off. Came back to review but realize I already do. Getting a new mic today and best believe it‚Äôs not going to be Logitech. :) haven‚Äôt been this excited in awhile.
"Buyer beware: Some headsets have software issues and not always fixable. The headset was plugged in and lighting up but was showing up as inactive on Logitech GHub. There was no sound coming out of the  headset at all and no input from the mic. I spent a month emailing Logitech support trying to find a solution. There were Reddit posts saying to try enabling the microphone for the headset in the sound settings, but this did nothing for me. I tried reverting the audio drivers and then updating them to the newest version and that did not help at all. I also tried installing different software versions of GHub and that also did nothing. I tried everything to get it to work but unfortunately nothing I attempted got the headset to actually work. I ended up returning the headset and getting a replacement. My replacement worked flawlessly out of the box.Other than the software issues, I enjoy the headset. It is comfortable, but like other reviews said it is a quieter device and the settings will need to be tweaked. Also, compared to my corsair HS70 headset, the audio quality is not as crisp. I will say that it has good directional sounds for fps games. Overall not a bad headset for the price point, but Logitech needs to fix the software problems."
"Im giving this a 2 star because you cant fold the mic out of the way amd its not flexible.  Ites a plugin jack type which the worst on many reasons whos idea this was should of been fired for this disgrace. Plus the LED lights are on the dumbest spots to place on the headset. On top of that, the software dont keep it off completely. In time if there is an update or restart, it turns back on.Besides on all that, the battery life is most impressive so far, not sure how long I have this but I know its been over a year or so and the battery lasts over 20 hours straight, just gaming and voice chatting on discord. A big win for that."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I‚Äôm really disappointed in this headset. After 2 days of using it, it randomly started having these really weird audio issues where it sounds like there is some type of staticky interference happening, almost like a loud robotic under water gargle noise that completely ruins the quality of the audio. Not only does it ruin the audio and sound terrible when it happens but it also hurts my ears because what happens is, I‚Äôll turn the headset on listening with clear audio for about 5 minutes and out of no where the noises just shoot into your ear like a bullet and it hurts and startles the crap out of me, I then have to turn off the headset and turn it back on and the process just repeats every 5 minutes and sometimes doesn‚Äôt even stop even if I turn it off and turn it back on. I‚Äôve tried absolutely everything to resolve the issue and after doing some research I found out that this is actually a very common issue with this particular model from Logitech and yet Logitech refuses to do anything to correct it. It seems like some of their supply doesn‚Äôt have the issues but a lot of them do and they are knowingly still selling them. So now I have to wait a few days for a replacement, I have to drive all the way to a nearby store to drop off the defective junk they sent me. Terrible experience, we will see how it goes with the replacement but so far these headphones are absolute dog water. Do not buy these."
"What the title says, the battery is amazing, the noise quality is great, but the mic pics up my girlfriend laughing from 6blocks away"
"Logitech is a good company with some great products, however, this product let me down.  I had problems getting the headset to ""plug n play"" with computer and had to troubleshoot the issue right off the bat.After getting the headset and computer issue worked out and let the headset charge before use.  Once charged, the headset was bulky and uncomfortable to wear after a short time.  The headset is a bit oversized and took up quite a bit of space on my desk when I wasn't wearing them.  Also, after a bit of time of wearing them, I took them off and my ears were very sweaty.  My teen aged son didn't even care for them for the same reasons.The controls for power on/off, mute and volume were easy to find.  The padding around the ears was soft, good for gamers and the hours of game play.  Best suited for those hardcore gamers who don't care as much for bulky and sweaty headsets."
"Needed to replace a headset for casual gaming and chatting on discord.  The adapter to connect to the computer aux and mic was defective, so my son used another adapter we had on hand.  After a day or 2, his head started to hurt from the tightness of the headset.  There is padding around the ears, but not enough, so there was pressure directly on the ear.We ended up returning it to try a different brand.Pros:  sound quality, mic, price, and cord length were good.Cons:  Defective adapter, tightness on head, cheaper quality (but reflective in price)"
I bought it while it was on sale for $18 and I believe it is worth that amount.  I am no longer dealing with my headset dieing mid round and the fit comfortably over my ears. The mute the mic function doesn't work though which was one of the selling points for me but I can just mute myself in game  ‚îê(Ôø£„ÉòÔø£)‚îå
"I purchased these for my Grandson. The headphones stopped working, and it took a while after I contacted the company/vendor to get them replaced. They replaced them with no questions and fast shipping. Thanks."
"The audio quality of the headphones are great, the buttons work awesomely, but the quality of the microphone is HORRIBLE, I recorded myself talking with these headphones and it sounds so distant, and even if I put my mouth right on the microphone, it just sounds loud and unbearable to hear, do not buy these headphones if you plan to use the microphone for streaming, creating videos, or for something where the quality of the audio is very important.Another thing that bugs me is the structure of the headphones, they are bendy and smack you right in the face sometimes while putting them on, and they fall right off EVEN if you adjust the headphones your head‚Äôs size, it just doesn‚Äôt get a grip of your head because of how bendy it is. The size of the headphones are not for small heads since it will not fit even if you adjust the headphones.The buttons are very easy to use though, you can easily change the volume of the headphones and turn on/off your microphone. The range of the wire is pretty long, and the lights and colors look awesome! The versatility could be better."
"So, I love how comfortable they are and the blue and black looks coolButNo matter how I adjusted the mic, people tell me to turn my mic up. There is too much distance from the mic to my mouth and people only hear me when cuff my mic in my hand and speak directly in it.Sound quality is okay, but I do have to make people repeat themselves at times.It is wired so there is not a battery life or fast/slow wireless connection.Other than that.... they have been working on both ears for months. So... that's a plus."
"Headphones are comfortable, decorative light feature works but the mic mute doesn't mute the mic and my clients claim that it's hard to hear me."
"I bought these cheap because my son has a habit of dropping them and we've gone through several sets over the years. This time I bought the cheapest ones I could find. It's decent for the low price. Sounds quality is good on his end, the head set fits him well, and he hasn't complained of discomfort. It's easy to control with the buttons and volume adjustment within each. The only downside are the lights and mic. His mic cuts out sometimes, randomly. The lights only work if you plug the USB adapter into a computer od something. He plays on x-box and it connects easily to the remote, but there is nowhere to plug in the USB to turn on the lights. He tried using a portable phone charger and that worked, but it was more trouble than it was worth to have the charging bank haning from the cord, so now he just doesn't use the lights"
I don't get it. I go out of my way n pay more for a supposedly better product  to get exact same results. Doesn't even last longer nor work better. Like what prices continue to rise but the quality of product does not.
The headset is okay it‚Äôs kinda bulky but that‚Äôs not my main issues they keep going in and out which is super Annoying when your in the middle of a game trying to mess with the ports.but for the price there okay.
It was supposed to light up but
"UPDATE: seller refunded me the money, which was great!This product worked for 2 months and is already broken. Terrible quality and so disappointing after the high reviews"
"For the price, it‚Äôs good. The lighting up only works if you plug it into A usb Port, which sucks. Has a weird clicking noise, but aside from that good headset."
My kiddo's fellow gamers shared he sounds metallic. Kiddo likes how the sound bit work but those that hear him? They say is bad.
Nice easy to hook up but the mic üé§ did but work and I didn't get my money back.
Ok if you are in a pinch for sound or a mic. Would never use as a main.
Mid grade. Doesn‚Äôt last long. Buy 1 good one instead of buying multiple.
Worked for a few days and then the speakers stopped.
A decent headset.  Looks nice but the mic is kinda weak and I can still hear my keyboard clicks so can't say much about the noise cancelling but I wasn't expecting it to.  For the price it's well worth it.  Got it on discount on top of the low price.
you need small ass ears for this to work the speakers inside are waayyyy to big and crush your ears i gave them to my friend and he couldn‚Äôt wear them he would rather go with no headset than these
"I can't say these headphones are 100% good quality but it does have good sustainability from breaking and noise control. If you want a headset with the highest mic quality, by all means, this is NOT the right headset for you.This is the second time I made a purchase because of the mic quality. Unfortunately, the mic did not last long; leading me to have to repeat my words to others again as if my mic sounded muffled or covered (even though it is not or did I ever change my sound settings).As for the cost, it might not be as bad but going for a long term  or long haul, I highly suggest going for branded names. It's better than repurchasing a product over and over again."
"Got this a few days ago due to an older headset no longer having a functional mic. Saw the high star rating, and got it quick with Prime 2-day.Firstly, let me say that I didn‚Äôt use this thing long at all, so please consider that within the review. It‚Äôs decent looking, with pretty straightforward design. It‚Äôs affordable, which seems to be a plus. It seemed to have decent sound, but the sound did cut out a bit at first.Most importantly, this headset hurt my head. Specifically, the area around my ears, all within 1-2 short 10-15min games of a FPS online. If these had softer padding around the headphones, they‚Äôd prob be much better. But, as it stands, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them due to the discomfort factor. I don‚Äôt care how good the sound quality is if I can‚Äôt wear something due to the pain caused by usage."
"Got these as an intended upgrade for a previous 15$ headset I got from Walmart. I wasn't expecting much, but I wish I had kept the Walmart headset now that I've tested these. They work just fine for video playback, no real complaints there. My main issues are how incredibly cheap they feel and how crummy the microphone is. The store page claims it has noise isolation to better pick up your voice, but from my basic voice recording tests comparing my laptop and this microphone, my laptop consistently provides louder, clearer results compared to this headset. There was still quite noticeable background noise in the headset's recording as well. There's also some design flaws with how the microphone is implemented; it is a completely rigid peice of plastic that only rotates vertically, so it just ends up hanging a good 5 to 6 inches from your mouth when deployed (yes, I got out a ruler and measured. It's that off). This is compared to other headset mics which can be adjusted as needed to sit much closer, and in front of your mouth instead of beside it.The cheap feeling is the next biggest flaw. Simply put, the glossy plastic used on the exterior of the muff housing reminds me of a cheap toy. The case on the connecting band is a bit better, being made from matte plastic, but not by much. The only things on this device that don't feel like they were slapped together for as low a material cost as possible are the ear mouths and the braided cord, which comes with nice plastic protectors for both the 3.5mm audio jack and the usb that powers the contractually obligated ""Gamer"" lights. I'd have honestly forgone the lights for better build quality on the muff housing, and a microphone that's actually somewhat flexible so I can actually hear myself speak.Overall:-Average playback quality. Nothing that would impress an audiophile, but nowhere near terrible. It's painfully average (and unfortunately that's more than can be said for the rest of the device).-Bad microphone design and quality. Just... don't bother. I got better results from the built in microphone array in my Thinkpad w530 from 2012 than I did with this thing.-El cheapo feel. Like a toy from a dollar store.Verdict:If you care about quality in your headset?Don't buy this. They sell this thing for 50$ at regular price. I got it for about half off with the amazon prime discount. Even still, I somewhat regret spending money on this thing, and I'd be leagues more disappointed had I paid the full asking price for it. It's barely worth it's weight at 25ish dollars, and there's no way it's worth the normal 50.If you just want something for discreet audio playback?Go find a better headset, or just settle for some earbuds. There's plenty of decent options for the latter under 20$ both in retail stores and online. This one isn't worth your time or your money. The only reason I'm even keeping this is because returning products has always been a pain in my experience, and because the headset itself technically works. But that's it. It's not even worth the hassle of chasing down a refund."
Chose to purchase based on reviews. Found to be uncomfortable and poor sound quality. Returned.
the sound is good but i have been told that the mic is muffled ü´†
They lasted for about 2 months and the. The sound went out in them.
"It's a great pair of headphones in terms of sound quality, I bought an adapter to use it on my Xbox, my friends consistently said they couldn't hear me, ended up using the Xbox App and my other headphones. I would go with a pair that cost a little more."
"They were good while they lasted. In my opinion I don‚Äôt see why anyone would need the volume that loud. I could hear the people talking to my son from across the room on them. I had gotten these for my son‚Äôs bday at the end of April 2024, and it‚Äôs now August 7th 2024, they do not work anymore. Cannot hear anything from them and we‚Äôve tried it all. The quality was decent enough, until it wasn‚Äôt."
"I have been using these almost 2 years before rating.They are comfortable and still work like new. I wish the microphone could bend towards me but it's only up and down. I will probably heat up the microphone bar and bend it closer to my mouth. I have to speak loud for gamers to hear me now.The volume doesn't get loud enough to hear people in my party even though on my S Series I have them max volume.I can hear them but I'd like it louder.The biggest problem is the usb A , to light the headphones up, and headphone jack are connected by a plastic block that prevent you from being able to light them up. See picture above.  So when I'm using these headphones plugged into my controller I can't light them up unless I use a battery bank. Non of my controllers have a USB A built in."
"I read the reviews before I bought these and decided it was worth a try. I can wear them for hours and they do not annoy me and stay very comfortable. After a little time passed, like a few weeks, my mic continued to stay on‚Ä¶ I was playing DMZ in COD MODWARFARE II so a headset is a must and the mic staying on was an issue so I had to continuously turn my mic off to get my gamer tags to disappear. I bought these to plug into my PS5 controller and they fit well for a little while. They eventually got to where they did not want to stay secure and I would have to constantly slide them up and adjust them to keep them plugged in. I am not a crazy mover when I play, so if you are animated when you play do t get these. They won‚Äôt last long at all‚Ä¶ with PS5 compatibility anyways. They do have great sound though. I‚Äôve had some of my friends say I‚Äôm echoing occasionally and that came as time passed and my gamer tag stayed on constantly. They‚Äôre a nice little set, but are not made to last. Def worth the money if you‚Äôre waiting for a better pair to come."
"These headphones are equipped with a thick control block in the middle of them which rests on the middle of your head. Which is nice to avoid head pain and vibrations. The ear pieces are large and can fit anyone's face which is nice!.The colors are bright and not dull in the least bit.The cord is braided and stripped with blue and black. The overall build is slightly bulky and the headphones are not made of the best durable plastic. If you are buying these for someone who rages a lot playing games, these will break. If you take care of them, they CAN last for a bit. The sound is basic, it does what it needs to. It is certainly not noise cancelling, I can hear others in the next room when playing games or listening to music. However, the noises are certainly dulled, which is okay. There are lots of options to plug this headset into pc, laptop, console, and controllers which is amazing. These are not wireless headphones, and the wires on this headset are LONG. There is an audio control box on the wire itself that has the volume control on it. There is a button directly on the top of the box that is a fake plastic button (most likely there for aesthetics), and then there is the actually scroll dial on the side of the box. I wish the button on the top was actually useable, but you win some, you lose some.In short, these are nice for the budget savvy shopper. If you want your teen kids to still hear you while they play games, these are a decent option for you. The headphone paddings decent, its foam, cant go wrong with foam really, so the headphone are relatively comfortable.Mind you, I stated ""teen kids"" I said this because of the size of these headphones. These are not meant for kids younger than at least 12 -13 years old.Hope this helps!"
"Rating this is difficult. Performance and appearance is 5 stars. However as seen in the pictures, the cable is really long until you get to the last 10 inches. The last 10 inches splits off into the usb and headset jack connections. They are so short that in order to use it like this you have to hold your controller up against the console bc the connection is too short. I am going to order a USB extension cable to hopefully resolve this issue so I don't have to return the headset. The diagram shows the end of the cable where the split is being really long, but it is not designed accordingly."
"The headset itself is ok. I had a custom Astros headset (A40) and they stopped working after only a few months so I was not convinced to spend $150+ again on another set. Overall, the headset is lightweight and comfortable. The audio is decent. However (and this is a big however), the mic would not register as a recognized mic on my PC despite other devices that I have which are able to be recognized; webcam, external speaker/mic, PS5 controller. When I elected for a replacement I requested that Amazon expedite the shipping so that I would not have to wait for my item given that I received a defective one and had originally paid for expedited/same day shipping. Interestingly enough they were unable to do that for a reason that does not make sense to me coming from an organization that is suppose to be logistically sound. However, if I were willing to place a new order and pay for expedited shipping again I would be able to receive it same day from 5-10 p.m. What? My point is it is a gamble that you will receive a headset that works properly and then to replace it will end up costing you more time/money."
"When I first received the headset it seemed to be working fine. However the jack that fits into the controller didn't really seem very firm. I don't hear it but when I'm playing with others they hear a constant click click click sound. I can only assume that it's from a poor connection. I never had any issues with other headsets with my controller. The sound quality is pretty good on my end. Aesthetically, it looks nice."
"I bought this item about two years ago and just decided to use it on a new pc build.  The audio works fine but the mic isn't able to be detected by windows and when you have downloaded the driver from the website, the driver install is missing files. You can't use the mic!"
"Headset size meant for children... This headset quality of sound is low. Sound is not loud at all even if everything is turned max its still kinda low (probably so kids don't go deaf). I got them to temporarily help me until I can get a solid pair but unfortunately im going to have to return them due to the sheer size alone, the ear covers are meant for a toddlers ears to fit. It also sqeezes your head pretty tightly, don't order these unless you buying for a small child gamer."
"The sound quality on this thing is amazing although the speakers on it are good, the Mike is trash The people I‚Äôm talking to can barely hear me. This would be a two star project but for the amazing sound quality I‚Äôm bumping it up To three Do not recommend if you are using the mic Sound quality is amazing"
When it's plugged into the Xbox controller it's not very loud at all you can barely hear it. I tested the sound quality on a cell phone in the music playing off my phone sounded good but I didn't buy it as a set of music headphones I bought it for my game. I can't hear what anybody is saying in the video games.
"I bought these headphones in September of 2017 and I am writing this review a several months after purchasing these headphones.These headphones are pretty darn good for being under $30. These headphones are pretty enormous which is good for users with big heads. I don't necessarily have a big head so these headphones were a little loose on my head. If you are purchasing them for a child I would recommend they wear a beanie or hat while using these headphones to help secure them on top of the head. As for the quality of the headphone material, I would rate it a 2/10 just because all the outside plastic is just that, plastic. It's a hard plastic that seems like it would snap/break easily if they fell from more than 6 inches off of the ground.I mostly use these headphones to play PS4 with friends, which helps me actually hear footsteps in games. However some feedback that I have received from my friends is that the Microphone on this headset makes some sort of feedback/static noise. My friends complain about it happening a lot. To fix this, I usually have to try and straighten out the audio jack cord and unplug it from my PS4 controller. This will fix for problem for about 5 minutes until it happens again.So if you want these headphones just know that there are some issues for what you are paying for. A faulty microphone might be one of the problems that you encounter.Update: Excellent customer service. I had been getting emails monthly since righting the initial review. The emails wanted to confirm my shipping address so they could send me a new pair of headphone. I acknowledged the emails and they shipped out a replacement the same day and it arrived a couple days later. Right off the bat, I could tell the headphones where different from one another. The volume/mic knob was different and even the size of the headphones seems a little smaller than the original pair. However, I have not had any complaints from my friends about how staticy my mic is. The price is not bad for the headphones and they are really diligent about providing you with a new pair of headphones."
"They aren't bad, definitely for the money. There isn't a lot of bass and the microphone is very quiet, you have to talk very loud almost yell for people to hear you."
"Cheap headset, needed a replacement in a pinch. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price point of near $20 and what initially sold me is the build in microphone.The headphones are small and press on your ears, causing a headache if worn for a while.The microphone is extremely quiet, to the point that you have to yell or eat the mic if you want anyone to hear you. There is a way to boost the volume with the sound settings but it ends up with horrible white noise that not only plays for others but in your own headset üíÄ. I even tried using third party software to boost it. The source audio is just really bad."
"I picked these up for $18 usd. At that price they are great; however, their normal retail price of ~$45 is... go buy something else. It would be more wise to wait for one of the higher end headsets to go on sale and splurge for that. I didn't even want these, but a friend wouldn't stop harassing me and wait for me to shop around and wait for a sale.Would I buy then again? No. It's hard to justify buying a better set when by all metrics these work. I hate throwing good money after bad. Save and get yourself better ones.I can't wear them for more than a few minutes. They are uncomfortable for me. That's fine, that's just me. Everyone is different. I thought they would be better than the lower end cloth ones, but it could be my melon sized head and Dumbo ears.They seem decently made and I've had them for about a year now, they still work.Sound quality. Yikes. Don't wear any good ones. You'll hate yourself. By comparison these are shit. Bass? What bass?!?! Sound is crispish, but don't advertise bass when it's nonexistent.Unless you absolutely need a friend to stfu do not waste your money unless you're on a hotdog in a cooler gunna eat it cold because you can't afford electricity budget."
"Deceptively uncomfortable + terrible mic. The main discomfort comes from the ear muffs are limited on how high they can be shifted upwards towards the top of your scalp. I am an adult male, average size body, and yet the inside of the earmuff cushion presses down towards the top of my ear and after about an hour or so its so irritating that I have to take it off. The apparatus is also quite heavy and bulky. The flashy and chunky plastic pieces on the edges provide no function other than 'aesthetics' and the blue lights around the edge cannot be turned off unless you unplug the power supply. The worst aspect of this though, is the mic. The mic is fixed into a swivel position to move it up or down and that is it.The problem with this is that you are not speaking into the mic directly but rather parallel to it and unless you are speaking at an abnormally loud volume the mic won't pick up the first couple of words and your audience is left with, ""What? We missed half of what you said, and you are very quite"". Maximizing output volume and microphone sensitivity doesn't help unless you take it off of your head and speak directly into the mic. This could of been avoided if the microphone arm was rounded more so that  it was positioned more towards the front of the mouth and not to the side of your cheek.Positive notes: The audio is good, the volume control/mute is easy to access with the attachment on the cord, and the audio cord is robust. Although I hope I accidentally run over it enough time so I can justify purchasing another one, but not from this brand. The customer support from the seller of this product is quite good, and while I was disenchanted from this purchase, I will look into getting another Bengoo product as the design has potential and perhaps other products are more effective at their design."
there not bad but there not good right in the middle for the price of the headphones makes sense
I bought these for my grandson and they only lasted a few weeks. I would buy a better quality.
"The second I plugged this into my PC, it didn't work. I tried with both the plug, with and without the Y shaped plug piece AND the USB. I tried the plug in the front of as well as the back of my computer and I really wish I hadn't been so cheap when shopping for a headset! This headset has really messed up the sound on my computer! I can no longer hear videos when streaming. I couldn't get it to work with Discord and it completely screwed up sound when I play any games - some will work, some will not. I just don't understand what happened. I've tried doing self diagnostic and updating drivers but nothing helped. Now I'm left with a PC that has sound issues and no idea on how to fix it. My sound worked fine and then it didn't and the only thing that happened in between was this headset. Yes, I read the instructions. Little good that did. Hopefully you will have better luck but, I wouldn't chance it."
I've only had this headset for a month and the right side doesn't even work anymoreDon't get me wrong this headset was great until out of nowhere the right side of the headset just gave out
"The over all design and esthetics of the ear phones are good, however the padding is very stiff so they get uncomfortable relatively quickly. The sound quality is mediocre. The speakers are very tinny with little to no bass. I purchased these to replace a headset that was over 8 years of age however I found I still liked them more than these new ones. I am giving them three starts as they are not trash, but they are not for people who spend hours in teleconferences or if you play a lot of games where bass is a desirable acoustic range."
I used it for a month before the mic became useless. Started with crackling when I would speak and then ended with not being able to hear or talk at all without a loud squelch from my end according to other players and friends. Did not last long at all and after buying these three times knew it was time to switch. Not a good buy.
"Worked fine, but didn‚Äôt hold up to use by a 9 year old. Stopped working after a few months."
***update  company refunded in full****Just stops working not sure what happened other than it jst doesn't work anymore.Cant get a refund at this point .. need to start buying America made product for sure..Dave
Tbh I love these as long as they‚Äôre working properly‚Ä¶ Not sure if maybe I got a faulty pair but since the first day I got them it‚Äôs been constantly cutting out. Generally if I move the wires a certain way they‚Äôll work again but now it‚Äôs starting to seem that won‚Äôt even work anymore. I‚Äôm waiting for a replacement pair so we‚Äôll see how the next ones are
"I used this headset with my xbox one. Got it for $20 on a black friday deal, which was nice, though I guess I got what I paid for. Was lured in a little by the LED lights, and I was a bit disappointed to find out I wouldn't be able to use them, since they only activate when connected to a PC.The sound quality was as expected for a $50 headset: wasn't amazing, but was by no means terrible. The ear cuffs are definitely noise-blocking and they're surprisingly comfortable to wear, even if you wear glasses. Since I wear glasses, most headsets start to hurt my ears after a while; but I experienced no pain with this one.The mic was okay; never really had any problems with it. I did have slight problems with the volume control though; sometimes, it would catch/rub on my clothing and randomly turn the volume up or down. Wasn't that big of an issue, though, since it rarely happened.I'd say my only valid complaint was the letdown of only having it for 4 months before it died. I was really excited about this headset. The whole reason I bought it was so I could get something that would last me a bit longer than a cheap, $20-$30 headset would; but it barely lasted me four months. What's even worse is that I still currently have a $20 headset that has lasted longer! And I'm someone who takes care of all things electronic and electronic-related, so this was the result of the actual headset failing. Might have given it 4 or 5 stars had it been of use for just a little while longer."
"They work great‚Äîwhen they work. But they're hard to set up and switch between headphones and speakers, which is why I never bothered. In this day and age, everything should be plug and play."
Can't hear out of headphones after only 3 months of use. Save your money and find a product that offers a warranty
Good cheap option
Its okay; I use these mostly for gaming on my PS4 and computer. On ps4 you have to adjust the jack weird so the sound doesn't get messed up.
Bought in March 2024 and already the wiring is messing up. Sometimes will not hear out of one side and the mic won't work when this happens.
"I‚Äôm not really sure who writes reviews. I read about 30 before deciding to make this purchase. What‚Äôs interesting is that no one mentions the fact that the USB cord is about 8 inches long. In order for the lights to work, are you supposed to play with your controller 8 inches from an electrical outlet? The headphone plug and the USB plug split about 8 inches from the controller. That‚Äôs completely useless. The controller does not have a USB port on it. As far as a headset it works OK just don‚Äôt expect to use the lights unless you want to play in a very odd position with your head near the wall and an outlet."
"Comfortable headset, microphone only moves up and down. The pickup is minimum I have my PS4 mic pick up maxed out and can barely be heard"
Got these for my son for Christmas. They light up really cool when in use and at first worked great but within 2 months of use one of the ears broke and no sounds works on one side of them so bc of that he never uses them anymore  :/ maybe I got a defect
"the lights were excessive the quality was unremarkable and it felt like only a 14 year old could buy this. which i was. the mic was bad, i was told by my friends, and the only thing i recall that i liked was the length of the braided cable."
"The Headset that I Just got the day I'm making this post has a short shorcate in the wiring  (basically making it to where you have to turn the plug around in the socket until you can hear what's coming from the device into the headset).It has small earpieces which would make gaming for longer periods of time uncomfortable on your ears. Also with the L.E.D plug in and the device plug in being way too close ( in picture) making it so that if you were playing on playstation or Xbox just to have the l.e.d lights on while playing you would have to be up against the console or whatever USB plug in because you can't play controller without the controller in your hand so you would be limited in movement while playing in an awkward position. The headset cord is long which I find nice but, if you have the L.E.Ds plugged in it wouldn't matter because you'll be restricted to a short length regardless. All around I see the vision but I don't see the goal."
"Bought and returned on the same day. Two main reasons: 1. Felt cheap and the connection wire was a dual end which is ridiculous. 2. Main reason returned was that the ear cups are too small to fit comfortably over the ear, but too big to sit comfortably on the ear. For daily PS5 use, that's just not going to work."
"It's nice looking - if you like things glowing. It fit very well - for the short time I got to use it. It seemed well made or at least as well made as other brands in this price category - I got mine on sale for $18. I purchased to use with my PC and it comes with a few ways to plug into the PC However...The second I plugged this into my PC, it didn't work. I tried with both the plug, with and without the Y shaped plug piece AND the USB. I tried the plug in the front of as well as the back of my computer and I really wish I hadn't been so cheap when shopping for a headset! This headset has really messed up the sound on my computer! I can no longer hear videos when streaming. I couldn't get it to work with Discord and it completely screwed up sound when I play any games - some will work, some will not. I just don't understand what happened. I've tried doing self diagnostic and updating drivers but nothing helped. Now I'm left with a PC that has sound issues and no idea on how to fix it. My sound worked fine and then it didn't and the only thing that happened in between was this headset. Yes, I read the instructions. Little good that did. Hopefully you will have better luck but, I wouldn't chance it."
"The mic barely worked and the audio was very quiet, even when turned up all the way."
"Although the sound quality is decent for the price and loud, the mic is complete garbage and the ear pieces would better fit a child or someone with generally smaller ears.Comfort is meh because of ear piece size, although I would tolerate it more if the mic actually worked. The mic is not bendable and even after adjusting settings on my PC and in discord I can not get anyone to hear me without screaming. Not sure if mic is just defective, but I will be returning once I find a replacement."
"Goodness, I think I've had this headset for two years, and recently sent another pair to a friend who couldn't afford a new one.  Now I want to make this perfectly clear: These headphones are VERY good for the price you're paying, and a lil $20 set with over-the-ear style, led lights, anti-tangle sturdy cord, separate volume wheel and mute switch, lasting for two years? Heck yeah that's my money's worth, especially since, at the time, I didn't have a lot of money to spend but still wanted to game with friends and chat.Now if you're looking into heavier use I would, of course, recommend something a little higher quality. I'm not sure if it's age or if I just never noticed before, but there is an issue where participants in a call can hear what I'm listening to, even if my mute switch is on, as clearly as if I were playing it on their system.  So I can't exactly listen to music, voice chat, and game at the same time without my headset taking my audio and feeding it directly back to output.  It is because of this, that I'm looking into a new headset, but I'll either send this to my bro who has none, or keep it around for myself as backup.All in all, if you just need something to get started and don't really plan on voice-chat and music or vids at the same time, please check this out! It's a very good headset for so little and while I'm sad to part ways with it, I'm glad that it gave me such good use for so long."
Audio went bad quickly. Son only used for about 1.5 before they didn‚Äôt work
"The headphones work pretty good but to have them light up, you have to keep them plugged in which is a little annoying. Also, the headphones sometimes get disconnected causing the sound to play from the tv instead and my mic cuts out a lot."
i bought twoboth of them (the microphone) are not working good
"Update: unfortunately I think we got a bad batch. The mic stopped working just outside the return window. Such a bummer.My son does online gaming and loves these headphones. He had a previous pair that he accidently broke and has tried others, they just don't fit the same as these."
It appears this headset is only good for computers as found online and in my own experience. Consoles and anything else it‚Äôs useless. Just a bite out my pockets.
"Horrible mic!!!! I bought for my son so we could play together and it doesn‚Äôt start picking him up till mid sentence and cuts him off before he‚Äôs done speaking and many times he cuts in and out. Also the volume is very low. You can‚Äôt move the mic closer to your face, it‚Äôs way far away from your face. No one will understand what you‚Äôre saying. Seller was prompt in helping with the issue and made it right!"
"My critiques are going to be very dramatic, but here they are-1: I wish the part that covers your ears were a little bigger. These press down on my earrings which isn't comfortable.2: they squeeze your head very tight(not sure if they loosen up over time, I imagine they probably would but initially straight out the package not very comfortable)3: the cord that plugs into your controller is like.. uncomfortably long. I'm guessing it's because it doubles as a PC headset?4: sound qualities o.k. does what its supposed to but Nothing impressive.If money's tight and you need a headset go for it! If you can save up $40 extra though for something a little more comfy, I'd probably recommend that tbh"
You can't always have the lights on
Have to talk a little loud in there
"If possible, I would rate them 3.5 stars. The mic didn't last very long. Overall, they were *okay* for the price."
It‚Äôs mic quality is alright but muffled the cord has nice range but it gets on the way very big size but it does get the job done
The microphone and headset won't work when plugged in to a pc USB port doesn't even recognize if i plug the aux plug in my controller it works fine mic and headset works but not when im using bluetooth mute slider doesn't work half the time and as time goes on it gets worse
Sound quality is glitching like the headphone has a shortage and Mic isn‚Äôt working at all when plugged in the PlayStation. Can‚Äôt hear anything at all when plugged into the pc. I‚Äôve done all the troubleshooting and still not working properly
"After posting the below review, the company reached out to me and offered a replacement or a refund. It was unexpected and I am glad they were willing to work with me.Don't waste your money.Pros-Headset fits loosely and doesn't squeeze my head, which I like-They look nice-Sound quality in headphones is averageCons-Microphone barely works (I have to take calls all day long for work so I need a working mic)-Mic only moves 90 degrees so headset always has to be worn same direction-Too many wires: It has the sound jack and also has a USB for the lights, which means that you are either wasting ports on your computer or you have dangling wires. Other similar products I've bought have had everything wired through a single port, so not sure why this one doesn't."
"The sound quality was acceptable but fairly middle-of-the-road. Unfortunately, one ear stopped producing sound after only a couple months."
"Got these for my son for his XboxOne.  With his knowledge and 3 adults pulling up instructions online and multiple attempts at setting adjustments this set would not work fully with his Xbox. Gould get sound to work but volume was low even turned all the way up, never was able to get the microphone to work at all."
"Used for gaming on a ps5. Poor sound quality, mic only works periodically, headphones are very heavy and bulky."
great for audio but i have been told from multiple of my friends that it sounds dampened like you are in a tunell and have to have the mic really close to your mouth
Just worked fine for a while but something happened to it. It doesn‚Äôt work now and it‚Äôs just sitting in my room waiting for me to do something to it. I had to go out and get a new one for my son.
"I honestly didn‚Äôt like anything about it. The comfort level is nonexistent, the padding was very firm, and not squishy. The audio quality was notably bad, and the microphone was almost unintelligible to my friends via discord. I can‚Äôt honestly think of anything nice about it except the aesthetic, and even that‚Äôs just OK"
"I regret buying this product while it was on sale, I should have went with my first mind and purchased from another seller. It is not even worth $10 dollars I‚Äôm not sure why they have any positive reviews. I bought this to use with my PS5, connected through my controller. After about a month the sound started going in and out, it‚Äôs so annoying. I have to continuously rotate the very LONG cord to get the sound back. This headset is literally a headache. I should have returned it sooner but realized too late that it was a recurring sound issue."
The sound isn‚Äôt the best. The headset doesn‚Äôt light up but they are pretty comfy
Cheap headphones and hard for anyone to hear me. Would not purchase again!
"The only reason I got these was because I thought they'd be similar to a pair of head phones I got a few years ago.  They had a similar design but with a few slight changes.First of all, the.... ear holes are too small.  Maybe these are good for a child but my earlobes get sore if I wear these for too long.  It's a relief to take them off at that point.  Will Probably have to get another pair because the soreness is not worth it.It's also an akwardly designed headphone.  Like the Headphone itself seems sturdy and works as you'd expect.  I haven't had a chance to test out the microphone, but the sound is decent (although I'm not a stickler for that).  What is weird is that the cable splits into 2 ends.  One is a USB and one is your standard audio jack plug in.  At first I thought it was so you could choose which kind of plug in you wanted.  So I plugged in the USB, the head phones lit up, and I tried to listen to something with sound.  No sound.  After trouble shooting and looking it up online, I discovered that the USB is for the lights only.  (Personally, I don't understand the obsession with lights.  They're on the side of your head; you won't be able to see them.)  So I used the audio jack instead.  And since it's one jack for both audio and mic, a splitter dongle is required for it (however that's provided in the box).Overall, I'm disappointed by this.  Ultimately, it's the ear size that kills it for me.  I've never been told I have big ears so I can only assume I have average ears for an adult man."
"I purchased this for my bf for gaming and it works well, audio is really good."
"after seeing such high praise for these on Amazon I decided to give them a try. Well I must have gotten a bad set because the sound quality is absolutely horrible. No upper mid range or highs at all, just lower mid range and bass from the set I received. every sound response is muffled and drowned out from bass with no way to adjust sound levels and they don't respond to any changes from the sound presets on the ps5 audio settings, except for the bass booster, which makes the experience worse. the basic wired phone ear buds that come with the ps5 sound better then these. I ended up buying a more expensive premium headset which I was hoping to avoid, but after using these it was no longer an option. as to the look they do look good but are obviously made of cheap materials. like I said I may have just gotten a bad set and if you choose to purchase i hope your experience is better then mine."
"While these headphones lasted me awhile, and worked really well when I first got them, the mic snapped off when I lowered the mic to talk to a friend. Before this happened, they complained about how they disliked how I sounded. The headphone aspect worked perfectly, and I greatly enjoyed the sound quality, but the mic snapping off when trying to talk with friends made me dislike this pair of headphones. The adjustability did not help prepare against the mic‚Äôs destruction."
"I bought these as a gift for my roommate, and compared to the headphones I use personally, they aren't fantastic. The sound quality is passable but nothing crazy. We had significant difficulty getting the audio and microphone to work on the computer. The headphones themselves are hard plastic and very uncomfortable after long periods. They were the exact same price as my personal headphones, but have worse sound quality and are far less comfortable."
"I bought these specific headphones because they look nice especially with the light option I looked at the schematics online and it looked like there was more than enough lead line to have adequate play, I enclosed the pictures so you can see that it is not what it's advertising You literally need to have an extension cord plugged in with the USB to have the light function on and the speakers ain't working nor the mic I read the reviews and this is a frequently returned item I wouldn't waste my time like I did..."
The product is really good overall. It's like having a substitute teacher that you can chill with. The cord has its issues of getting in the way or feeling too heavy on one side. The mic works nicely so no itchy or rasp sounds when communicating. I've gotten a better wireless set that competes better than this. Only downside to the wireless is battery life and charging. Otherwise this product is not bad but it could improve especially with the pointless USB connection for the lights.
"Says that the headset is compatible with switch, which the audio is but not the microphone. Which defeats a purpose."
"For paying nearly $50 at time of purchase, these headphones felt like cheap plastic. They didn't fully cover my ears (the bottoms of the padding on the ears are either too short or they have some sort of awkward curve?). The sound quality itself is fine, I just can't imagine these lasting much longer than any pair from 5-below.Update:I've changed it from 3 stars to 1. This is probably the worst pair of headphones I've ever owned. The sound quality makes videos sound distant and muffled and they're constantly wanting to disconnect from whatever I'm listening to even mid-video/audio. It took less than a week of proper use for them to instantly drop in quality. Not worth $40, and not worth $5 either. I would probably have fewer problems if I really did go to five below, I think in the future I'll just splurge on a better brand since these are functionally useless."
"Bought these for a return flight, after leaving my Mpow headset home, and I'm very disappointed.  The ANC (automatic noise cancellation) works - except when there is audio coming in over Bluetooth!  When watching a movie anytime an actor speaks the sound is accompanied by the airplane noise.  When the movie is quiet the noise reduction works.I tried a direct connect to my Android with the included 3.5mm audio cable and with that there is ZERO noise reduction.  Unless the Bluetooth is on the ANC is off, and plugging in the 3.5mm cable turns off the Bluetooth.The headset was fully charged overnight before use so the only thing I can attribute this problem to is a poor design.  If you just want an ANC headset just to quiet your ride these were fine.  But if you are planning on using them for entertainment while limiting background noise then I suggest you look for a different product."
I was really looking forward to these headphones. I‚Äôve needed a new pair for work and have to wear them almost my whole shift. I got the cream color and they‚Äôre so cute. The ear covers are so comfortable and lightweight. Unfortunately all of the weight was in the band and pushing right into the top of my skull causing instant and lasting pain from just a couple minutes use. May be better for larger heads. The sound quality is high and the anc really works well. It‚Äôs unfortunate they‚Äôre not comfortable.
"I mean it works I guess, the sound is quiet and I have to turn it all the way up for a decent experience. It could be normal for bluetooth over ear headphones I usually wear ear in or plug in. The buttons suck- the sound up button called my most recently called which was weird. It's pretty comfortable but too big on the lowest setting for me. For $20 it's not bad but... meh."
For the price these are fine but they are not even close to as advertised.  The noise cancelation is non-existent but for $40 I don't care.  On the bright side I find the very comfortable.
"The noise cancelation feature only blocks out faint ‚Äúwhite noise‚Äù in the background. I could hear people talking the same if the feature was on or off. If you want something to make a noisy room quiet, these are NOT the headphones for you.However, while this aspect of the headphones significantly lacked, the music quality on these are great! I don‚Äôt have much experience with headphones as this was my first pair, but I was very satisfied with the music. It sounded like my earbuds, which is fine in my opinion :)I gave two stars because these headphones are advertised to cancel out above 95% of noise, but they maybe cancel out 10%üòÇ I got them because I want noise canceling headphones‚Ä¶ not just headphones.Anyways hope this was helpful fam :)‚úåÔ∏è"
"Bluetooth connection is super iffy. Works OK on phone, doesn't work with most laptops I've tried."
"The sound is pretty good. Noise canceling is not bad . The fit is not good for me. Top big, doesn't adjust much . These are HUGE.  If id known they were NFL sideline headset size i would have chosen something else"
"Not super happy with the quality of these. The sound cancellation is totally non existent but the sound quality is pretty good. I like to have sound cancellation to meditate while I fall asleep so that was quite the disappointment, I see why there was a sale."
Had to returned it because the noise cancellation was non existent.
"Be aware you may receive used head phones. I ordered 2 pairs and got 1 new pair and 1 used pair. Both were left to sit in the rain by delivery driver, so now I have 2 pairs of soaked head phones. Hope your luck is better than mine was."
If you connect to any other speaker then try to connect to these headphone you have to reset blue tooth every time
The volume is so low on this headphone
These are absolutely not fit forming to the head they stick way out on both sides. Would not feel comfortable wearing them out in public. Ugh I did not notice this in product reviews when I was looking at reviews.
Sound quality is very good. It doesn‚Äôt have a low enough setting to stay on my head. When I walk around they slide. So I wear them while I sit.
The headphone fit was less than desirable.  The width of the headphones caused an uncomfortable fit.
Bought for my nieces birthday. Returned after charging and trying them out. The noise canceling doesn't work at all. When music plays it's scratchy sounding.
"The volume doesn‚Äôt play very loud, the on & off doesn‚Äôt work well, and the Bluetooth doesn‚Äôt always connect to my iPhone."
The noise canceling feature does not work while connect to a device via the cable. I had two 16 hours flights and the ear covers did not do an on job at canceling noise by themselves.
What‚Äôs the point of Bluetooth headphones if they won‚Äôt pair? It took 6 mins to convince these to pair with my MacBook. It takes several attempts to pair with my phone and tv. The noise canceling is ok if you are using them wired. Using them to watch video isn‚Äôt an option since there is so much latency. I gave up on them before listening to music because I was so frustrated.
"These are decent headphones.  They are not the full featured, expensive ones; they are cheap, but decent.The volume is EXCELLENT when powering on or off unlike other devices which announce the change far too loud.The headband is not really soft, but it did not bother me.  The ear pieces are a little small, but they have plenty of adjustment up and down and rotate left and right.  Each ear piece also clearly has a letter identifying it as the right or left.The sound is good.  The battery is good and I was able to listen to music from my phone for several hours.However, while on a video conference call on my laptop, it simply stopped the audio after about 15 minutes; I disconnected the Bluetooth and the audio was fine on my laptop speakers and mic."
"There‚Äôs literally no difference when I turn on the noise cancelling feature and turn it off, either way doesn‚Äôt cancel out anything."
The ANC function is useless with external noises. Volume is way too low. If you are mowing your lawn these are not for you.
"I have several pairs of over the ear Bluetooth headphones and have learned you don‚Äôt have to spend upwards of $200 for Bose or Sony to get decent sound and comfort as I have tried both before. In fact, I have a $25 pair that I will put up against those big names as it has fantastic sound, comfort and passive noise cancellation. Unfortunately, I found this pair of 6S headphones to have neither comfortable fit or decent sound quality.Out of the box, they have a clean, modern appearance and are very lightweight. The list of features is on par with other brands with a microphone, phone call connectivity and multiple equalizer settings. Then I put them on‚Ä¶The ear pads are thin and small meaning they sit flat on your ears instead of encasing them. After a while wearing them, my ears were sore from the compression to the cartilage. As for sound quality, I went through all of the equalizer presets and found that none of them helped improve the tinny flat, lifeless sound. Bass is also very lacking on these headphones. I think these would be OK for a child‚Äôs pair, but I found these headphones lacking for anyone who values fidelity and rich sound. You will have to spend just a little more than the 6S to get decent sound performance."
"The design is strange. From the single power button You must press and hold the power button for 3 seconds to turn on and 4 seconds to connect bluetooth aaaand 5 seconds to turn off. I pressed 3 seconds and the headphones says ""headphones on"" and immediately ""headphones off"". I tried over 20 times with the same results, I tried pressing for only 2 seconds and nothing. I pressed for for seconds and 8/10 tries it gives the same on/off message. The rare times I pressed 4-5 seconds I received a ""Headphone on/bluetooth connect"" , but the problem is no device can detect or link to the headphones. Poor design, doesn't work, do not buy!"
"This headset has been amazing! The battery life is wonderful, haven't charged it in over a week. No audio problems or almost any problem save one. The mic. While it sounds like it clicks into place and you would think it stays connected very well, it does tend to come loose quite often. I tried contacting support but was given the run around by the autobot in chat and was never able to reach a live person to ask about the seemingly faulty mic. Would have been 5 stars for sure otherwise."
"The sound quality is great with this headset, although I returned it because the frame felt super cheap, and I couldn't get behind spending $200 on a headset to where I felt like it would break if it dropped 2 feet onto carpet. The other dealbreaker is that the headset cuffs don't rotate, they just move up/down, and not sideways. After being spoiled with headsets with cuffs that rotate, these ones just felt uncomfortable on my head."
"So I've been watching these headphones for over a year now, waiting for a good sale. They are $70 off so I got a pair for my GF and I. After some testing and tweaking of EQ setting in the Ngenuity app, I cannot get these headphones to not sound muffled / tin can like. Coming from a 5 year old Hyperx Cloud Flight wireless headset, I definitely expected a jump in quality all around. That is not the case. The cloud flight is much more natural sounding, mic sounds better and is just about as comfortable. It's drawback is the more traditional 25-30 hour battery life.I will be returning these in disappointment as I really wanted to like them. My big annoyance was how these headphones made everyone sound in discord voice chat. Was like a walkie talkie quality vs my cloud flight wireless."
"I bought one of these because I had a similar version of HyperX with a wire and I was tired of accidentally tugging the cord on my tower.When this headset showed up, it wouldn't turn on. After about an hour of troubleshooting and talking with support, it turns out that a lot of these sit on a shelf waiting to be bought for so long that their batteries go into safe mode and can't be started until you introduce a specific voltage (Which isn't provided by the charger that comes with the case). So I actually had to plug this headset into my phone charger before it would turn on. Was a really unintuitive and frustrating experience to troubleshoot.On the positive side, that was 3 weeks ago. The headset hasn't been charged since, and I use it for hours every day. It's still at 20% on the original charge. This thing lasts practically forever.It's reasonably comfortable. Other hyperX models have velour earcovers instead of the cheaper memory foam that comes with these ones, and it makes for a really noticeable comfort downgrade. I think that if this headset came with the velour ear covers, I'd give it 5 stars. But without them, it isn't great for long term use unless you plan on buying the ear covers separate and going through the 20 minute frustration art piece that is switching ear covers on these headsets.Ultimately, 3 Stars - This product would benefit immensely from some sturdying up around the first time user experience, as well as using better materials for ear comfort."
"The Volume adjustment wheel on the right side doesn't do anything at all.For the price that is being asked of this product, you think everything would work flawlessly.Other than that they do work well."
"The battery lasted a very long time; but the headset also didn't get very loud, so this ensured the battery would last as long as possible. Today I tried to charge it and received no light and I can no longer turn it on; it's a brick. HyperX replaced it since it was within the warranty window; we'll see how long the 2nd headset lasts."
"Battery life is amazing as stated and sound quality is good. Microphone quality and audio is poor, it broke in less than a year and I could barely be heard online.  I contacted HyperX, provided photos via the the chat as requested of the broken mic which they stopped responding during the chat. I purchased cheap replacements here on Amazon as I never received a return response.Apparently the poor mic audio was also a known problem, and tied to latency in the firmware to improve battery life. The most recent firmware update only slightly improved voice quality according to online teammates. 8 months later, it powers on but no audio/voice period coming or going from multiple devices tested (consoles or computers). Awaiting response from HyperX on RMA for the defective device which is still under the 2 year warranty.At this point, I would not purchase again nor recommend. Will update if/when ai receive a response from HyperX. Until then, it‚Äôs a paperweight.Update: After a month of jumping through hoops, I received a replacement dongle. After pairing the new dongle to the original headphones, the headphones are now working again. That said, sound issues have persisted with mic noise being introduced from non ambient sources, i.e. hardware or software of the device. It drives teammates batty but I am unable to hear it unless on the mic sound adjustment tab (PS5) or the HyperX app. Unfortunately, HyperX (HP) drug out the RMA process so long that the headset is now out of warranty. I regret ever buying this garbage. Save your money for a better known product."
"I bought these in May 2022 and they lasted until August 2024. They just stopped turning on and I suspect the battery has fallen down to a threshold that prevents them from charging due to some circuit protection. Owning these, you will never know when this might happen because the headset never updates its battery status, so every time you turn them on, they will report whatever battery charge status existed the last time they were plugged in. This is normally just a minor irritation and when they would die, I'd plug them in until charged and they would last a very long time between charges. I think this might be part of the reason they died though - the amount of time you can go between charges probably really batters the battery.Also, since the dongle uses 2.4ghz and USB devices, if enough are plugged in to a usb hub, will start to generate interference that intersects with 2.4ghz. This means that if you plug the stubby dongle directly into a USB hub alongside (in my case) 10 or so other USB devices, the interference will be enough that the headset disconnects randomly. This can be solved with a USB extension cable but it is annoying. Anyway, the headset failed exactly 2 months after the warranty period expired. Maybe that was just serendipitous but it strikes me as a funny coincidence that their warranty only extends to two years and the headset failed just in time. For the 200 bucks that I paid, I'd hope for a longer-lasting experience. I basically rented these from Hyper X for 8 dollars a month and then they will go into a landfill. Maybe that's the fate of all wireless headsets but my previous pair, a corsair set, lasted from 2014 until they broke in 2022 when a dog knocked them off my head. It's anecdotal but still."
"I really want to like this headset, but I just placed an order for another brand.I bought this headset because my wireless Cloud II from a few years back started suffering from a crack in the plastic molding that keeps the headband attached. I was sad, because I'd really been enjoying the reliable long range on the Cloud IIs.I'm terribly disappointed with the Alphas because it is effectively a wired headset. The range on these headphones is so poor I have to remain in the same room in order for them to work. The Cloud IIs, and the prior Logitech headsets I had for years before are able to function without disturbance on the entire first floor of my home, and all but the furthest corner of my second story. I start hearing complaints about my voice breaking up when I step four feet away from my computer. At six feet, the sound I'm receiving starts breaking up. At 7 feet, the headset informs me (loudly) DISCONNECTED. RECONNECTED. DISCONNECTED. RECONNECTED. DISCONNECTED. RECONNECTED. Yes, I measured. No, there are no walls in the way and I'm not running a microwave.These are distances that only slightly exceed the latitude granted to me by the Cloud II Wired version, and this fact makes this headset entirely useless for my purposes and makes me question the cost of the item, considering it is effectively a wired set. Why do I care about the exceptional battery life when I have the same range as a cheaper, wired headset?This set will likely be relegated to my at work headset, which I think it will fill the role of nicely and declutter my desk. But for home use, especially for something like running D&D where I'm up and moving around, I feel better off with my $30 earbuds and the memory of my Cloud IIs."
"After 6 years of good service from a pair of HyperX Cloud Alpha 2s, I thought I was upgrading with these. Apparently not. After about 4 months of daily use there's already low end buzzing in both ear cups. Wasn't expecting insane audio quality from Bluetooth gaming headphones, but that's just ridiculous! Especially for the price! The design for the microphone jack is also bad. Adjusting the arm of the microphone makes it come loose from the jack very easily. I love trying to speak to my friends only to realize I've been talking to myself because the microphone was slightly unplugged. Really, the only nice feature is the battery life. These will not die on you when you need to use them, hence the price. So really a terrible value imo. Consider sticking with wired headphones or find an alternative to HyperX."
"The one I purchased around a year ago works great. The battery life has never been less than 70% as reported by the unit and I've put it on a charger only a few times, and in those cases it was just because I wanted to top it off, or in the case of problems with trying to get a 2nd one.I purchased a 2nd one to play with friends at home with other friends online at the same time. I could not get it to work even after trying to charge overnight, more than once. I returned it for another and the next one came will a low charge before a trip. When I returned home, I found that it would not charge and it showed no charging lights when plugged in. While, my original shows charging status lights on the same charger and reports having a greater charge after.I wanted to return it for another because I feel it was bad luck to have two bad ones come but the only option is for a refund. I am returning for a refund I will probably not buy another one.My reasoning for my feature ratings is:Gaming: 5/5 The entire time I've had my first set I never really have had to charge them and having a headset never go dead when playing is crazy to me.Noise Cancelation: 3/5 When I had a friend playing with a wired headset next to me they didn't get feedback/echos from out communication but I did when I was wearing this headset.Sound Quality: 4/5 I don't want to knock the sound from these, they can be loud where I couldn't get the same output from equally/higher priced headsets. And the sound is pretty good. Though, I have had better sound from other headsets so can't give it a 5."
Broke exactly a year after ordering. Not really worth the money if the sound is going to cut out the exact day I ordered them.
"left side extends too easily, range is bad, quality dips and sticks, hurts ears after a while, less padding than historically. This used to be a quality brand but I suspect private equity has taken a dump here."
There's a little static I can definitely notice sometimes but besides that they're great.
"Pros:Battery life obviouslySound is pretty goodMic is pretty goodCons:The wireless range on these things is HORRIBLE. Do not expect to walk more than 20 feet an still have a stable connection. Honestly kind of defeats the purpose of being wireless if I cant even go to the kitchen to get a drink without my music cutting out.Sound is overly trebble focused so if you're looking for gaming AND music you would think to download the software for these, but please dont, download literally any other eq.The software for these honestly messes them up lmao. It makes your mic randomly turn down to half volume, the EQ is too simplistic to a point where you might as well just pick a preset and be done with it, dont expect that much fine tuning unless you use a different eq software. The battery life on it is inconsistent, sometimes I'd see it jump up from 24% to 50% at random.The highest volume is too low.no bluetooth whatsoever. and uses usb type A instead of type C so dont think you're going to be able to use these with your phone, because it also doesn't even have the option to use an aux cord.Overall:it's a pretty good headset if you're not planning to actually test the wireless range by walking out of your room. The battery life is one of the most convenient things i've experienced. its 300 hours which is 12.5 days of nonstop use, meaning if you only use them for 8 hrs a day you only have to charge like once a month, which is honestly the primary reason i bought these. Everything else is... alright. Definitely expect more from such an expensive headset considering the xbox wireless headset lets you listen to your phone and PC at the SAME time and it's much cheaper, but then again the sound quality on that headset is abysmal and it doesn't last 300 hours."
"I want to love this headset, but it comes bundled with some major problems.On the positive side, the headset has black-magic levels of battery life. It can easily last 200 hours between charges, and no that is not hyperbole. As a negative trade-off there is no battery indicator beyond the headset voice on launch. This voice says ""power on, battery level is... 100%."" The problem is that it says 100%... no matter how much life it actually has left. So if you don't frequently charge you'll end up dying with no warning.The sound quality and wireless range are excellent, no complaints at all. When using the headset with my PC it works damn-near flawlessly and if that's your only device I can 100% recommend it.However, there ses to be a major issue when using the headset with a PS5. The wireless connection will randomly drop when connected to a PS5 around every 30 minutes. This connection is not a normal disconnect either. If you try to wait it will never reconnect. If you turn of the headset and turn it back on, it will not reconnect. The only method to reconnect is to get up, go to your PS5 and unplug/replug the USB. This defeats the entire purpose of a wireless headset. During this period of disconnect the PS5 still believes there is a connection and doesn't even switch to your TV speakers. So you lose all sound and all communication until you manually unplug the USB. This is totally unacceptable in competitive multiplayer where a few seconds can win or lose games.I've owned numerous HyperX products over the years and this is sadly the only one I can't give 5 stars to. I'll gladly update this review if the disconnects are addressed. The battery level indicator is a minor annoyance at worst."
"ORIGINAL REVIEW:I am a software engineer that works from home. I'm in a lot of meetings throughout the day, and also like to listen to music and watch movies while I work. I need a good wireless headset with long battery life. There isn't a single headset that matches or even comes close to the battery life of this headset. Additionally, the sound quality is AMAZING. Before this headset, I had the Corsair VOID RGB and the sound quality was garbage. This HyperX headset has great highs and lows.1 MONTH UPDATE:I use this 5-6 days/week for at least 8 hours each day. It's been a month and the battery life is still at 100%.1 MONTH 2 WEEKS UPDATE:Okay, now I'm annoyed. I'm having trouble sleeping at night thinking about how is this engineering phenomena even possible and why has this not been implemented in other existing technologies? At least just get me to 90%... As of today, I'm turning my music up to 75% (which is extremely loud in this headset btw).2 MONTH UPDATE:Alright. So it's been two months. The battery indicator guy that states the battery level every time you turn on the headset said ""Battery level is 100%"" this morning. Halfway through the day, the headset shut off while I was listening to music. I thought maybe something fried and the headset is no good anymore. However, after plugging in the headset, it powered back on. Turns out, the power level guy is a damn liar. Literally told me an hour ago that the battery level is 100%, when really it was nearly dead. After plugging it back in, the battery level guy changed his mind and said ""Battery level is low"". I've updated the overall rating to 4 stars because of this. It'd be nice to have any kind of battery level indicator, but the fact it only says 100% deems it a garbage feature. However, the fact that the headset lasted 2 months on a single charge, while using the headset 9 hours a day, 5 days a week is still an amazing feat.2 MONTHS + 1 DAY:The headset no longer holds a charge. The battery is only good until it needs to be recharged. Read other reviews. This headset lasts about 2 months if you're lucky. If it's under 90 days, you can get a replacement (which will probably just last another 2 months). So basically you get 2 months of wireless headset for $200, then the remainder of it's life must be wired.I contacted customer support at Amazon, they forwarded me to the wrong place, who then forwarded me to HyperX, who then put me on hold for an hour, who then told me to try plugging it in to a different outlet. After about 30 minutes of me trying to explain that I know how outlets work, they said I need to mail in the headset and the tech will do testing on it. If he can't get it to charge, he will send out a replacement. If he can get it to charge, he will send it back to me. Smh, this is not even worth it. I'll just keep it and use it as a wired headset."
Purchased this in May of 2022 so basically 2 years and 4 months of use before I noticed durability issues.  As u can see the plastic piece between head rest and telescoping ear piece has broken free.  I did not notice this until I realized the head phone would not stay on my head because one side of kept falling down.  Even with the durability issue I gave these a rating of 3 because of the audio quality (which is very crisp) and the how long the battery charge lasts.  For durability they deserve a 2 of 5 for only lasting 28 months.
"So, let me start by saying that, other than the cheap ""breathable leatherette,"" this product is great! The 300-hour battery life is legit and AWESOME, the range is great for non-Bluetooth, and even though the sound quality isn't by any means phenomenal, it's pretty decent and I have no complaints about it.However, this craptastic leatherette is cheap and drops 2 stars off the review for me, personally. If I spend over $150 on a product like this, I expect it to last me more than 2 years of use. With this stuff peeling off and leaving black chunks of ""leatherette"" everywhere, I am forced to find a replacement for the ear pads.If you're going to be cheap, at least provide us the option to buy replacement ear pads and not force us to go through other companies."
"I bought these thinking that the 300 hour battery would be enough to make up for the price point, but after only a few days of using them, I decided that they just wasnt for me.If you are like me and tend to always keep an ear open so one side of the headphones is behind the ear, than these are not the headset for you. They do not swivel so when you put one side behind an ear, the other side becomes very uneven and ends up quite uncomfortable.The sound quality is pretty average and is not even close to what is advertised. At first I thought the poor quality was because they dont sit evenly on my head due to one side always being behind my ear instead of over it, but I tried wearing them like most people do and was still unimpressed with how they sounded. Not even Ngenuity EQ settings was able to make these sound good.As for durability, they seem solid for the most part. However because of how I wear headphones and the fact that these have no swivel, I can feel alot of pressure against the joints, and despite being mostly metal, I give them maybe a few months before they start to break. Hopefully I will find the right headset for my needs, but these are not them."
"I've been using this headset for 2 weeks now for gaming, watching videos, and videoconference calls. The Ngenuity app is showing I still have 58% battery left, which is incredible. I've noticed some finicky-ness with the app. Pretty much if I turn on the headphones before the computer loads up, then it won't detect the headphones. I'd have to do an app/headphone restart to get them to see each other. This is the only way to toggle DTX and change the EQ.When it comes to gaming, I've only played Apex Legends. There was noticeable audio latency when DTX and custom EQ settings were enabled. So I've turned them off and the latency is more tolerable now in game. Unfortunately the sound isn't as great with these settings off, but I'll live with it given the battery life and going cord free. I do however turn on DTX and equalizer when streaming music and videos, and the sound is respectable.Mic quality seems to be good. At least my coworkers noticed it, without me telling them I got a new headset. However the microphone sticks up in the air, and is unable to fold when on my desk so I'll have to consider buying a headphone stand or hook.The buttons on the headphone feel good. It's easy to find the mute button, and the volume wheel is smooth and has just the right resistance.Coming from a wired headset, it's been such a relief to not have to worry about my chair hooking onto the cables or seeing which side of the armrest the cable is hooked around."
"I'll start with the main con and why I gave it three stars. No matter the drivers or the program to use with this headset. What I found to minimize/ get rid of popping/crackling is not using dtsx/spatial sound. Also turning off Exclusive mode and audio enhancements in control panel > sound. I also changed format to 16 audio.I did test this out with low and high volume in games / music. These are the best settings. The reason why its a 3 star is because we basically have to not use any of the additional features that it comes with on its NGENUITY program. Which is also only through the windows store.Battery for me is great. The first 70 percent when it came in right away it did drain rather fast. After a charge to 100%. I can confirm its a good battery charge for the potential 300 hours that they claim. \\Conclusion: cant use any extra features while turning off everything else to get rid of popping. Battery life is great. Charger cable is short. The sound wheel isn't a loose wheel and its firm so it doesn't change audio by accident. I never tried the mic since I didn't buy it for that purpose. Most say its bad-average. The comfort is top tier. They feel light and they do not hurt my ears over a long session. Noise cancel is pretty good. Only buy on a sale for 160 or less. Not exactly worth 200, or get the wired version. It may need the same fixes for the popping / crackling issues."
"Got these headphones since I was in need of an upgrade. Overall, the headphones are comfortable to wear and the sound quality was good when the headphones were functioning properly.Since it came out of the box, I would get popping/static noises consistently. Sometimes there would be a severe audio lag that made everything sound robotic. It would randomly disconnect from the receiver despite being less than a foot away from it. I've done anything I could possibly think of to address these issues. Updating firmware, installing and using their software, switching USB ports, uninstalling their software, rolling back to stock drivers, uninstalling drivers+rebooting, updating drivers, the works. NOTHING has resolved any of these issues. At best, I had a temporary reprieve for maybe 30 minutes. 2 days of troubleshooting with no real results to show for it. I had 3 disconnects in a 15 minute span at one point lasting anywhere from 15 seconds to a minute.The range on this is awful. I could walk just outside my bedroom door about 3-5 feet away from the receiver and it would immediately disconnect. I wouldn't be able to watch shows on my monitor from my bed because the headphones would just disconnect.I have had friends and colleagues telling me the microphone was popping and making loud static noises in voice calls so I had to disconnect the microphone from the headset.I'm sure these headphones worked perfectly for others. Unfortunately that has not been my experience at all and I'm incredibly disappointed with its performance considering the price tag on these headphones."
"It keeps reporting 100% battery every time I turn it on (using it for 2 months without charging it), and now suddenly nothing works, even after charging it. The buttons are unable to turn it off. I can see the green ""breathing"" light indicating that it is trying to connect to the wireless dongle. I think the headset glitched out when I was holding the button to turn them off, about the same time I shut my PC down and they disconnected just at the moment they were about to turn off. So I recommend shutting them off far prior or far after to shutting down your computer. Don't try to do it at the same time, or you could get the same glitch I had where it seemed to get caught between modes.Edit: I disassembled it and hooked up a resistor to the power pins to make it discharge quicker. Once I was able to get it to fully die and then charge from a dead battery it has started working again.Also, I wish I could turn up and down the ""mic monitoring"" volume. It is a little quite when it is on and the only option is to enable or disable, no settings for how loud the mic monitoring should be.I have been able to get the headset to work with HyperX NGENUITY software now too, where you can edit equalizer settings and even have certain games automatically switch the headset into a certain preset when the game is launched."
"Sooooooo I got this headset NOV 16th 2022 and out the box this headset lasted forever on its first charge (4mo to be exact). The second charge (the one I am on now) is not holding up as long, but it is still a long time. The bad thing that happened is this headset fell apart today on stream and all my viewers were just as shocked as me. I have uploaded pictures to show the point of failure, but I cannot return it to Amazon seeing how it is out of the 30 day window. I will attempt to draft an email to HyperX to see if they can assist... but who knows what will happen there. The other downside to the headset is that particular sounds make the headset go CRAZY audio wise. I play a game called APEX LEGENDS and when I shoot one particular gun (the G7) the headset will do a LOUD audio spike that drowns out all other sounds and hurt my ears if we are being honest. So the charging does what it says and it worked well at first but as I said in the title of this post ""Ummmm I don't know about this one"". Hope this review helps some people and maybe HyperX can see this and explain what may have happened to the headset falling apart like it did."
"It looks like a nice, well built headset, however the sound quality out of the box is lackluster at best. After downloading the software, the presets changed nothing.It doesn't seem to have its own independent up and down of volume, but rather controls your computers overall volume. Also, setting up an equalizer, for me at least, is no fun. I hired a person to do my goxlr that's how bad I hate it, so having a headset ""require"" such effort is an auto-return.Also, for those who like headsets with deep ear pockets like the Astro A50's, your ear will 100% get smashed. Not as bad as the old turtle beaches, but similar."
"Been trying everything, googled like a mad man, tried everything suggested. Even HyperX support i have had zero response from since i contacted them  over a week ago. Trying to get trough to them to actually talk to someone seem 100% impossible. Worst thing i have ever bought. It will be returned. Last HyperX product i will ever purchase.If there where a zero star i would have given it.UpdateSo now i am on the second headset like this. Still nothing. Have even reinstalled windows to try andsee if that had anything to do with it. No luck. Since i am way past return date for Amazon iam now the lucky owner of a 160 dollar paper weight.A supervisor at HyperX told me to email him at anytime and he would get back to me since hehad his email open at all times. Well, i have sent 2 emails to him over the last 3 days and not a word.I will never ever buy another HyperX product ever. Should have stayed with Corsair.Another update.After a complete clean install, and yet again trying everything that was suggested by them, still nothing. Now i am having a $160 paper weight since it is past Amazon return time. HyperX response. ""We honored you with a replacement, have a good day"" So damn done with them."
"I have had this headset for about a week under a year now, and am looking at replacing them because the charge port has failed. The battery life was great, and the comfort was okay. Beyond that, I really didn't enjoy wearing them or using them. The mic was spotty at best, and id say at least once a week I would have to unplug the dongle because the headset would freeze. I felt that after wearing them for more than 2 hours at a time, my jaw would start being sore from where the cups press against my bone. The DTS functionality never got used because it introduced a 2 second audio lag."
"I've had the original Cloud headset for many years and it has served me well. I figured that I might as well upgrade to a newer headset with better speakers and wireless capabilities. If you are only using one application, the speakers are great, but if you are trying to run Discord, music, and a game all at the same time, you'll get audio cuts and popping noises. The battery is as advertised, at least I think so. I haven't had to charge it over the week that I've used it. The wireless range is advertised as up to 10 meters or 33 feet, however I can rarely get more than 10 feet from my PC before partial or complete loss of connection. The microphone is worse than the original mic that Microsoft sent out with the first gen Xbox 360s. It sounds as though you are speaking through a tin can down a deep hallway. I've troubleshooted all sorts of audio drivers, sound profiles, and changing USB locations but have been unable to make the mic sound better. My options are to either invest in a separate standalone microphone or to return this headset for something else. I am just a casual gamer and don't want a big clunky setup just so I can talk with my friends. Tried going through the HyperX support channels, resetting the headset and updating it to the newest version of software, but it has not improved. You can't change what channel the headset runs through if you are in a high density wireless signal area, nor can you change the audio profile from the one that they have set from the factory. The build quality is good and it feels great, especially after several hours of gaming, but that doesn't make up for the poor audio and mic quality. I knew that a headset with a 300 hour battery life would be expensive, but for 200 dollars, I'd expect everything else to be of the highest quality as well. I will be returning this headset and looking at other headsets."
"TLDR; purchasers should evaluate whether the price is worth the headset as advertised EXCEPT having DTS surround sound and EQ due to clicking and popping issues.The headset are awesome... except for the clicking and popping that accompanies the firmware installed by Hyperx's accompanying software, Ngenuity. I attempted to reach out to HyperX for advice on the issue since it seems to be a known problem with the headset, but have not received a response. My request to HyperX was after I consulted HyperX's support page for this headset and ensured that the USB transponder was as far away from other transponders as possible.For anyone else who is experiencing this issue, the clicking and popping stops if you uninstall Ngenuity, uninstall the headset (you can uninstall by going to Device Manager, selecting ""Sound, video and game controllers"" right clicking on ""Hyper X Cloud Alpha Wireless, and selecting uninstall"", unplug the usb receiver, restart your computer, and replug in the usb receiver. Following these steps will lead to Windows installing drivers which do not make the headset click or pop. You will not be able to use the DTS surround sound nor the EQ that is advertised as accompanying features to the headset but the headset will otherwise work."
I've been using these since November of 22 and I'm not a heavy gamer. But I noticed that after a few months of use they no longer accurately gave battery percentage ratings. Regularly would die on me even though it said it was at 90 or 100%. When fully charged they did not perform bad at all but didn't really work well with the built-in battery life information. Recently switched over to a completely different set but will be holding on to these as a backup. The noise cancellation isn't really that amazing either. Also had a very hard time with spatial hearing especially compared to the set that I just purchased or other sets that I've used and other people's houses.
Works great but don‚Äôt expect it to last a full year mine didn‚Äôt make it a year before it just completely stopped working. Never slammed or dropped just plugged it in and never worked again after that
"I would rather buy these for 300 with metal buckles for the size adjustment because the plastic buckles will inevitably break, no matter what if you wear these daily, I advise you to immediately tape them together when you first receive them! I just don‚Äôt understand why that‚Äôs the part they decided to go cheap on?"
"Before I had the wired version of this, I loved these headphones. The only issue I have with the wireless ones is that the microphone is a little loose so it comes out at random times and it made it harder for me to work with them."
Sound is good but the mic echos. I tired turning down volume just in case it was too loud but no matter what it echos.
"This headset seemed like a keeper, with outstanding battery life and good sound and noise cancellation. I used daily for remote work video meetings without problems, for about an hour each day.But a few days ago, this headset started being problematic. It would disconnect and the only thing that could be done to get it to re-connect was to unplug the wireless dingle, wait a few, and plug it back in.But now, it no longer works doing that, and I have a dead headset.  This isn't the first wireless headset that I have been disappointed with in the same way.I don't understand why they don't make these also bluetooth capable, or be able to be used ""wirely"" via USB-C. Yes, I know bluetooth sound quality is lesser, but whoever designs these things needs to understand the USB dongles are common failure points."
"I have had several pairs of Hyperx headsets over the years. Two pairs of the Hyperx Cloud II, which I had to replace because the cable broke on both of them, and a pair of Hyperx Cloud Alpha, which was much better because the cord was replaceable and they sounded somewhat better. I also have a pair of Logitech G Pro wireless that I've been using for a couple years and when I decided I'd replace them I saw Hyperx had released a wireless version of the Cloud Alpha that I liked so much.I was pretty excited when I got them, so when I heard how bad they sounded I thought it must be a problem with my computer. Maybe I just needed to download the software and change some settings. I've messed with the sound settings on and off for a couple months, and no these just sound terrible. Music is ok, but dialogue sounds like everyone's wearing masks. I have a pair of earbuds that sound better than these, and I've read online that I'm not the only one with these issues.The only good thing I have to say about them is that with Dolby Atmos for headphones, which costs a couple bucks, the spatial audio is pretty good for games. The audio quality still sucks but at least you can tell where it's coming from.TL;DR These sound terrible and nothing like their wired counterpart. Just get those or the Logitech G Pro Wireless if you need it to be wireless."
"It was such an amazing experience for the first year-ish I had it, only had to charge it once a month while using it 10+ hours a day, sound was decent for a wireless set.Sadly out of nowhere maybe 16 months into its life, the right ear just died, completely silent. All forms of troubleshooting/research did not even get a crackle of signal back into it; reinstalled drivers, on/off, jiggled wire, volume wheel, etc.. It would be a solid 5 stars simply for the battery/good audio combined,  if it would've lasted more than a few years."
"This headset had amazing bass and I loved it. Probably one of the best headsets I ever had. One issue I always seem to have with wireless headsets though is that they randomly die and stop working for no reason. I use the headset normally, and then they die after a few months or so. Same thing happened with this headset. After 3 months of normal use and only having to charge it maybe once or twice because the battery life was so good, it randomly bricked and won't turn on or charge any more. After researching online, apparently I'm not the only one and this particular headset (Hyper X Cloud Alpha Wireless) has happened to many people which is a shame for how expensive the headset is. I also loved how you can change the settings with some software with how much bass or no bass for the headset. It's too bad, the headset was great but it just randomly dies on me like past wireless headsets. I had this headset for just about 3 months before it randomly turned off during use and would never turn back on again. Will not be getting any more wireless headsets from these experiences. Hate the wired ones, but it seems like the expensive wireless versions die where as the wired ones always seem to last longer."
"Overall was happy with the headset.  Charged it to 100% before use.  Used it almost daily for 16 days for a few hours.  Worked fine.  Tonight it's just dead.  When i powered up last night it was 80%.  I plugged into usb and i get nothing.  Had to switch back to a cheaper headset.  Far from what I wanted out of a ""alpha"" headset.EDIT: Found a reddit post that referenced putting them in the freezer overnight to fully drain the battery.  That Actually worked.  They are back working and I flashed the latest firmware.  Hopefully it was a fluke."
"Great headset until they mess up,then you have to wait 4 weeks for a possible fix."
"I have had these headphones for about a month and a half and not once did they need to be charged, that 300hr battery life is amazing.  Sadly my headphones finally ran low on power and needed to be charged, plugged in my headphones before heading to bed and figured they would be full when I came back to them.  Over 16hrs later I finally get back to my headphones and find its battery is still low and flashing red which according to their instructions means it has less than 20% power which is the same place I left when I started charging them.  At this point I am assuming the battery will not be charged at all no matter how long I leave it plugged in and I will have to keep them plugged in when I use them (I have no idea how long they will last being used like this).Still a great set of headphones but now they are no longer wireless and I have no idea how long they will be able last."
"POSITIVES:+ The headset is comfortable to wear, like all HyperX headsets+ As a not-audiophile, the audio quality is fine to me! Other reviews cover this in much more detail.+ The microphone is specifically a directional microphone - it has to be angled correctly to pick up really well. I didn't have any complaints on this.+ Battery life is fantastic - with heavy use I got weeks out of a single charge.NEGATIVES:- THE BIG ONE: After just under a year, the headset died entirely. It just...doesn't turn on any more, at any level of charge, even when plugged directly into my PC. For a $200 headset I expect substantially more than one year of product life.- When I tried to raise a support request to troubleshoot it, HyperX support were completely unresponsive. My chat request stayed at number 1 in the queue for 30min (within their declared service times) and then timed out.- Minor, but - every time you turn it on, a voice reports to you that it's turned on and what the battery level is. This sounds convenient but also overrides the audio you actually want to listen to."
"This headset brand does work for Xbox console's but this specific one does not sadly so if your on ps4,ps5 or PC then this headset will work but on Xbox it wont. I wasted 171$ on this just to find out that it doesn't work on the Xbox and I am actually upset cause this headset felt sturdy surprisingly."
"The battery does, in fact, last what feels like forever. I had frequent to constant crackling sounds from the speakers, though, because of what I suspect is trouble with connectivity, which I was never able to resolve and for which HyperX does not have a fix. I am very sensitive to that kind of sound, so it was a deal-breaker for me.If you as a manufacturer can't sort out connectivity, you don't have a good wireless product."
"Bought this headset because ive always loved my past HyperX headsets. They've always had great sound and build quality. This one was the first wireless headset from this company that I've owned. The setup was easy, the EQ through the software was okay. But they reason I gave it a 3 star review wasn't because of the sound or software or build quality. But after 3 days of use, charged only with the cable that was included. Charged to 100% before I used it.  It just wouldn't turn on. Even when plugged in, no light indicator that it was charging and wasn't able to even turn it on. Everywhere I've looked people have loved it but I must've gotten a 1 off that was faulty. Very unfortunate, because at this price I am very hesitant to purchase it again."
"This is my second HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless headset because the first one's audio stop working after a short period of time. I gave it another try and got it replaced because the headset is comfy and the sound is pretty good for the price. Now today, after only a week of use, this one's audio is also cutting in and out when playing games like CS2 and League of Legends. I dont know if I just got unlucky with 2 bad headsets but I would steer clear because it just doesn't seem worth it. I am going to return this headset and be done with HyperX all together."
"Audio quality seems nice, and this headset is extremely comfortable. However, I can't for the life of me figure out why companies making headphones like this insist on forcing features on users that at least some of them don't want.I really, really, REALLY hate auto-shutoff. To me, it's worse than useless. If I want them off, I'll turn them off. This is a computer, not a console. Sometimes, there's just no sound to play, and that's OK. It doesn't mean I need the damn headphones to turn themselves off. At least let me disable this silly nonsense. Looking at the subreddit for HyperX, this is something people have been wanting for several years, and it's disappointing that a company that claims ""We're all gamers"" is so unresponsive."
"These are great headphones, but after I ordered them I found the manufacturer had a coupon code on their website that made them about 25% cheaper if I ordered through them directly. Otherwise they sound great, the mic is a bit not sensitive enough since the other people have to dial me up, otherwise great wireless headphones, the battery lasts about what you'd expect, certainly not a long time but it is good for a single intense multi-hour raid at least...and no dumb wire getting tangled up.."
"I love the fit, the mic sounds much better than my GSP 370's, sound is great EXCEPT - there is a constant low level hissing noise when no audio is being played. Depending on the audio playing I can sometimes hear it during audio playback. This hissing goes away when I power off the headset.Muting the microphone from the headset doesn't stop it, and I've made sure the listen to the mic option in windows sounds is disabled. My motherboard only has USB 3.0 ports and the same slight hissing occurs when connected direct to the motherboard or via a powered USB 3.0 hub. This hissing happens with or without DTS:X enabled within the Ngenuity software.This hissing is the same level from my usual listening volume of 16 all the way up to 100 with no change to the slight hissing sound. I've also powered off the only 2.4GHz device anywhere near my Cloud Alpha, my wifi router, and the hissing is still present. This hissing persists even when the USB dongle is disconnected - all leading me to believe that this is internal to the headset.I'll likely be returning this for a refund since Amazon doesn't appear to offer a return for replacement option."
The headset honestly sounds and feels amazing but sadly it stopped turning on after just 2 months of use. It was fully charge and when I went to turn it on BAM no light no power no matter how long I held the button. I even tried to charge it but it wouldn‚Äôt even register that either.
"I've enjoyed this headset for about half a year, but this is the last straw, and there have been a lot of the exact same straw. If you finish watching a movie or something and your browsing around reading comments or checking social media, whatever. If you don't play something for maybe 5 or 10 min this voice says ""POWER OFF"" at about 9/10 volume, blasting your brain with that lizard brain reaction like you just walked face first into a thick, tacky spiderweb. I don't need this at 5am. Why tf it can't just play quietly or even normally for something bolted to your ear holes, I don't know."
friends on discord can barely here me to now its not working at all why charge 200$ for a headphone with a crappy mic
The headphones are great. They have good noise cancelling. They are also very comfortable. The mic is useless and needs to be updated. I have had to switch back to my old headphones because the mic is so bad on these.
"I‚Äôm going to start off by saying these headphones are amazing. They are very comfortable, and they are very light. But I have one issue with these headphones. These headphones are not very hearing impaired friendly.I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a me issue, but I try to go into windows and manually change the left and right balance, for I am partially deaf in my right ear, but as I go to change the left, volume the entirety of of the headset volume changes with it, including the right channelAs it stands, though the battery life is indeed long the sound quality is indeed amazing. Just wish I could actually change the left and right volume."
"I was quite happy with it for the first two weeks of using it, the sound quality was pretty decent and the battery life was a dream. Then one day it just turned off and would not turn back on. Plugging it into any USB port does nothing, my computer will not recognize it's plugged in and the headphones do not get a charge. This seems to be not an uncommon problem, so just don't bother taking the risk. Get something else."
"Bought this as a gift for a friend, helped him set it up. The audio on it was apparently amazing, however the microphone itself was worse than his previous one, which this was bought as an intended replacement for."
"First day and beyond, the dongle and headset would randomly disconnect from my ps5. Once or twice a day. Every day. Aside from those annoyances it was great. Sometimes I would get a loud, high-pitched scraping glitchy sound that was nearly a max volume sound despite being less than 50% nearly the entire time.After a month or two the headset didn't disconnect so much, but I did have to plug it into a different port on my ps5 (from a back one to the front one). Disconnected once every few days. I'm less than 7 feet from the console too.Oh, battery only got charged once a week even tho I used it maybe 12 hours max a day. Would almost always say it was at 100% tho.My gf came to visit for nearly 2 months so I stopped using it for a while. And maybe a week ago I used it to talk to my cousin on my PC. Tonight we were supposed to chat so I tried to use my headset and it will NOT connect to the dongle. I tried everything except contacting support but late at night on a Sunday doesn't seem like I'd get a response.Oh better yet, I tried using my old headset and dongle (the cloud wireless one, not alpha), and my PC will only recognize the old AND new dongles as the 'alpha' headset. So now I can't even use my old headset while I have this issue solved.I'll update this if I get any solutions on how to solve these problems because nowhere online or on the support pages did I find anything of these issues or how to fix them."
"Headphones sound great and the battery lasts FOREVER it's crazy how long the batteries in this thing last. 300 hours according to reviews online and I believe it. Also they are fairly comfortable though I wish there was some kind of way to easily make them more loose.On the flip side the microphone is awful. It sounds horrible. I'm about to zip tie a better mic on. The mic quality is actually so bad, everyone I talk to comments on it, every time.The software is also bad. It's buggy. If you run it, it will cause your headphones to lose sound for a few seconds every so often. Very annoying, been happening for a while. Uninstalling the software fixes it."
"I have been using this headset nearly daily for 5 months now, and until last week I had 0 complaints. The battery life if excellent! Sound quality is great! However, after 5 months detachable boom mic no longer works. It started with people telling me I would randomly sound far away or ""under water"" sounding. Then it would randomly cut in and out, and now they only hear random bits of what I am saying. I have tried cleaning boom mic jack and performed all of the troubleshooting steps to no avail. They still work great as headphones, but a bit frustrating considering how expensive the headset was."
"Comfortable, with great sound...  Unfortunately I have only gotten the microphone to work once for about 10 minutes.  Since I'm trying to play Microsoft Flight Simulator and can't talk to air traffic control this is pretty worthless so far.  Nearly $200 that I really can't afford down the drain.  If someone could tell me how to fix the microphone, or send me a set that works, I would be tickled pink with this set."
It‚Äôs a great mic but false advertisement of connectivity to xbox.
[EDIT]As of 06/29 it has stopped powering on. It was working earlier in the day but after plugging it in to finally charge it back up it no longer powers on. Text below was written a couple of days ago.Sounds great. Battery lasts forever. I've been using it since I received it on 04/12/2022 and haven't charged it since the initial full charge. I'm currently at 12% with another 36hrs remaining. I use the headset everyday for multiple hours and on days off almost all day.I wish you could change the volume of the voice prompts but everything else is fantastic.
"Had the product for about 8 months now and it has worked perfectly, until today or well at least since I got it back‚Ä¶ now it won‚Äôt turn or show any LED lights (for charging at all) the dongle blinks red but the headset shows no sign of life. Like it‚Äôs dead in the water. I sent it back to the manufacturer two months ago for the same issue and all they said was it needed to be updated and gave it back to me updated... I've personally never heard of or owned a headset that completly locks itself until it updates but maybe it's just me... Overall I would say great headset but if there are any problems... DON'T be surprised and DON'T LOSE THE DESIGNATED CHARGING CABLE."
"It's a well built set of headset but the Bluetooth connection drops so much if you have other BT USB devices.  Sound quality wise, it is just like other mid price range headset and does not justify for $170."
"The headset is generally very good. The battery life is incredible, sounds quality is great but this headset is not plug and play. The software is buggy. Sometimes won‚Äôt recognize the headset is plugged in. The microphone is quiet in general for people you‚Äôre talking to and misses words. The microphone wire is also a bit short which may contribute to the sound level. Would not recommend buying this especially for the price."
That's about it.
"-Device will only pair at 100% battery then will unpair when it hits around 95%. Attempted all troubleshooting methods provided by support as well as our own troubleshooting (we are an IT company). Headset will just randomly start disconnecting and reconnecting over and over, then will just stop connecting period until it is recharged to 100%. While it was paired the range is PITIFUL. I have a cheaper razer model that works around the entire office. These will stop working if I get up from my chair.-While it did work. The default setup has an extremely LOUD voice tell you when it is connected. You can only change this to ""beeps"" IF you download their software. The volume of that loud voice is not controlled by your volume control. In addition, the volume control itself has no absolute in either direction. You never know what volume you are going to get when you turn it on. The sound quality is no better than sub $50 headsets.Remember...this headset is 160 dollars.These are things I would expect from a $50 or less pair of headphones. Bluetooth pairing is not difficult technology, it's been around for a long time. Not sure why every HyperX product we've bought has the same damn issues. This will be the last one we purchase."
"You cannot wear these for more than an hour or 2. These are not worth even half the price of other wireless headphones, this is another crap HP product."
"Sound quality is good but has occasional scratching in audio, they are not great at blocking out noise as I can still easily hear someone talking at normal volume in the room. There is also an issue with the headset audio control which may be a defect as it sometimes turns audio up and down other times will only turn it up no matter which direction you scroll."
"People complaint my input was too low. Connection issues. Mic mute color isn‚Äôt working (red glow). Disconnection issues next to USB device. Returning. Sucks I can‚Äôt get a replacement for the same price, I‚Äôm willing to try again. Guess I‚Äôll be moving on."
"everything about it is perfect. long battery life, great sound, comfortable. but after I took it off one day it fell apart. one side of the ear part just fell off? I've had the knockoff version of these before and they lasted over 2 years. just buy the knockoff."
Not very good headphones in my opinion. I mainly play Hunt showdown and the sound is very quiet and muffled. Not what I am used to.
"Max 20 hours power, lost the usb and you can‚Äôt get a usb replacement without buying the headphones again and the headphones have no Bluetooth"
"Have had this headset for a few months, loved it, the battery life was amazing just like they claimed. Then the headset told me that it was low, so I go to charge it and poof, it's bricked. The battery will not charge at all and it refuses to turn on. I have tried every USB-c cable I own, tried charging it from my PC, wall adapter, cell phone etc and to no avail. I looked it up and this is a very common problem. Buyer beware!"
"I bought these Headphones on June 25th 2022, they are amazing at sound quality and gaming. The microphone is underwhelming but it works. Where they lack most is in quality of plastic bits and parts.The pieces around the Metal frame started breaking about a couple of months ago and i contacted Hyper X customer service, i was told we do not have individual parts for products so we cannot complete this claim nor can we send you the part to fix the headphones. Well this also disqualified from replacement as they technically did work, Until today. The pieces broke and the right headphone is dangling from my head.(First picture from 2 months ago when they started breaking apart, second picture from today June 7th 2023, less than 1 year of purchase)I tried calling during business hours received automated response that the office is closed, alright. Clicked on Chat and talk to agent on website, no agents available, alright. Went to go on ahead and email and that option is not available either.Needless to say due to poor customer service or lack there of , and product quality i will no longer be purchasing any Hyper X Products again."
"When I first got it, the drivers it had produced static noise when more than one sound source is playing, and experienced sound cutting off. Updating the software it suggested, and once it was updated recently it removed some of the static, less sound quality issue.Other then that, the build quality is great, and decent mic."
"The sound on these headphones is horrible. I have had better sound quality from cheap generic headphones.  The wireless range is also laughably short.  The range is short that it basically defeats the purpose of having a wireless design.  My old Steelseries wireless headphones had 4 times the wireless range, and the sound quality as light years ahead of thoese headphones."
"The wireless range is less than the Hyper X II.The audio will randomly cut off and give you a light buzz noise and the only way to fix it is to turn on and off the headset.The audio will randomly get distorted for no reason even when your less than 1ft. from the receiver.Does not look like they updated the plastic piece that connects the headband to the rest of the headphones, this has been the weakest part of of the headphones.  I had to replace other Hyper X headphones for this exact reason.You are better off getting pretty much anything else for the price your paying."
"I bought this headset because of all the reviews. I'm going to return it. The sound cuts out even though I'm sitting right next to the PC. The audio is fantastic when it can stay connected. And the battery life is amazing.The distance of the wireless connection is terrible. There is a bathroom right next to the room my PC is in and I lose connection at that distance, and the home is wood frame construction.The kitchen is directly below the room my PC is in and this headset will only stay connected as long as I don't move at all. Tough to do when you're cooking. Continuous ""connected"", ""disconnected"", ""connected"", ""disconnected"".I thought this was going to be a solid product but I was wrong."
"As headphones, these are amazing. Comfortable, long battery life, good range, noise cancelation, good sound, etc..... They have the same issue every HyperX product before I've owned has, their microphones are terrible and go bad within an absurdly short time. If this was $70 for just a good pair of headphones, yeah. With this price, stay away."
The screw fell out of one of the sides on its own leading to the plastic bending and breaking. Disappointed it lasted a year. The sound is also pretty muddled without doing a lot of audio mixing to clean it up. The app they provide sucks and causes the headset to have a near full second of delay
"The headset is comfortable even for someone with a massive head like mine. However, that's about where the positives end.The mic sounds like a tin can, reinstalled drivers for USB devices in Windows 10, reinstalled drivers for the headset themselves, and installed their middling software which had a surprising lack of features compared to razer and corsair. When swapping from a 10 year old headset that's a fourth of the cost, the Corsair Void Pro, my friends noticed how bad my headset sounded even compared to that headset. The sidetone (where you can hear yourself) sounds like a Call of Duty lobby from Modern Warfare 2. If you don't care how you sound at all and want to roleplay as a call of duty lobby permanently, then you're probably just overpaying when other wireless headsets do the same or more for less"
"Started losing channels, then it started garbling noises over time... just decayed, mic is so bad had to download some 3rd party apps to make it work.  I don't recommend, the only thing good about it, is that it comes with DTS."
"The receiver has to be unplugged-replugged every reboot, the settings in the software are barebones and don't save anyways, the auto-turnoff timer is stuck on 20 minutes, the volume wheel doesn't control the volume sometimes without rebooting.I guess the battery life is long. So that's cool. Other than that, pretty obnoxious product."
"I bought these in March and worked great. Battery life, sound, etc., all for simple activities. Unfortunately, they will not charge at all and online recommendations involve opening the headphones and soldering. I will be contacting the seller in hopes of a replacement or fix, otherwise beware and heed the 1 star."
"i was replacing my hyperx cloud alpha S wired headset. i received these expecting similar sound quality but was significantly disappointed, the overall volume is less and all the audio sounds muffled. i adjusted every setting thinking it was user error but nothing fixed them. returned and ordered the wired ones again"
Spent weeks reading reviews and read some people having problems. Over 70% approval rating. So thought I would take a chance since the headset was highly rated by most. Was extremely disappointed when it would not turn on or take a charge. Will return and try another brand. The fact it takes two weeks after they receive the defective item to refund your funds is also more then a little annoying.
"I'll start off with the fact that the headset itself is very well made. It's quite sturdy and the controls are easy and straightforward. It's a shame that the software is such a joke, which wouldn't be such a big detractor if it weren't for the fact that the software is the only way to turn on surround mode."
"Do not buy this product. In fact, do not buy any HyperX product. After less than a year of reasonable use, a critical component that keeps the ear cup attached to the headband failed. I did not treat my headset poorly - it was either on my desk or my head.After being informed by their support that 'physical damage' is not covered by the warranty, their support staff have stopped responding to me, leaving me to believe they will not cover this as a manufacturer's defect.Clearly, despite hiding behind the 'physical damage' exception to their warranty, this is a manufacturer's problem. It represents either poor design, poor material choice, or a defect in production, and yet HyperX will not take the blame and own up to their poor product.Given the price of these headphones, this poor workmanship is inexcusable. This hopefully serves as a warning to you to avoid this brand all together."
Everything about this headset was amazing until it started randomly cutting the sound off while I would play my games. Sometimes it works fine but other times it starts to cut off which is super annoying. Only had them for about a month. Returning and hopefully can replace them for better ones.
A bit over priced.Somewhat lacking in base.Also for this price they should have better amps.Battery life is crazy long.
"left ear no sound broken cup after just one year, avoid product"
"When I first started using these for streaming/gaming I was IN LOVE! The sound was seriously amazing! I had been using the same ASTRO A40s for about 4 or 5 years & decided I need an upgrade. I‚Äôd never heard call of duty like I did with these. I was about 1.5, maybe 2, hours into stream when, all of a sudden, my game audio, discord audio, & music went all staticky & horrible distorted. It was also lagging in a weird stuttering way. I powered them off & even the voice from the headset was completely garbled & distorted. They have not turned back on since. Ive tried EVERYTHING but they are just completely useless now. Thank God it happened the same day I received because, for the price, I‚Äôd be choosing violence if I couldn‚Äôt return them."
"After 2 years of working well, the last couple of months was not.  Multiple times not connecting to dongle until it just completely stopped connecting. No troubleshooting techniques worked."
"I bought these thinking they would be better quality to hold up against my being gruff as they have aluminum frames. While they may have held up better, I will never know as I asked for a refund after trying them on. The sound is muffled, and you cannot turn it up loud enough to hear people walking around in a game. I tried all kinds of settings on the EQ and several other settings. Nothing helped! I am going back to Razer or Logitech; they have much crisper sound and bass if you want it. Seriously, these are almost as bad as cheap airline headphones."
"Just received it today and i've immediately noticed the sound cutting out constantly. I'll put up with it for a couple of days but i'm probably going to end up returning it. What a waste of money.EDIT: After using it a bit more, i can also tell the sound quality on these are horrid. They're even worse than my old hyper cloud x headset that cost $40. Hell, even the $20 headset from logitech i bought from target a decade ago had better sound quality than these, and all for 10x the price! Stay away from these."
"While the headphones themselves have a good quality sound to them and the battery life is amazing, the mic quality absolutely sucks. (coming from a Logitech G pro X wired) As soon as I started talking in discord, it sounded like I had a kinect as a mic."
"Purchased these wireless headphones because the Cloud Alpha (wired) version were well reviewed.  Within ~45 days of light use (i.e. just outside of the Amazon return window), these Headphones will no longer turn on or indicate they are charging... and appear dead.  No support on the weekends, and no helpful troubleshooting on the website.  I expect to have to RMA these now, less than 2 months after purchase."
"I used this headset for a little over 1.5 years for gaming and it was a fine headset. The sound quality is good and I like how the earpieces fit completely over my ear. The headphone part is sturdy and well-built and it is very comfortable to wear.However, the microphone is flexible but has become very flimsy recently. It now naturally rests far from my mouth and sometimes my friends have a hard time hearing me when I'm talking. I try to move the mic closer to my mouth but it's so flimsy that it won't stay in place. I also don't like how you can't move the microphone out of the way if you don't need a mic; it's attached to the headset in 1 place so you can't slide it out of the way unlike some other headsets. I'm now getting a different headset that has a sturdier microphone.Overall, it's a good headset for the price, but be warned that you can't slide the microphone out of the way if you don't need it and the microphone isn't the most well-built."
"DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES, they are complete garbage, they were good the one month return window but it went downhill from there once it was over. First the mic stopped working but I was able to use my webcam as audio but then no audio worked I couldn‚Äôt hear and no one could hear me and now when I try to stream I can hear just fine but my audio is super glitchy like something is constantly rubbing against the mic but no way to stop it, save your money because now I‚Äôm out of close to 30 dollars because of these trash headphones if you need headphones go to a store and get them so at least you can take them back if they decide to break it‚Äôs ridiculous"
After about 4 years of using these on and off the leather covering the foam part of the earpieces are starting to deteriorate. You get what you paid for and for the 4 years I used them they were great. If you want something that lasts you may have to pay $50+ but in the meantime this is a great stop gap
"These headphones have a really decent sound to be only in the $25 range. The major problem is that they are made with the thinnest, cheapest ABS plastic, to save money. THEY ARE HOLLOW. Tap them and you will see what I am saying. Kind of a shame, because the 50mm drivers are very good, actually. If you can take out the drivers and put them in a better cup housing (I did), amazing diff. But some wouldn't be too bothered by the cheap build, and hollow cups, but it drove me nuts. But $20 for really good 50mm drivers that can be swapped into an upgrade mod is a good thing, too. FINAL THOUGHTS: After going deep into my headphone collection (95-plus, so far) - I have to say save your money and spend about 7 to 8 bucks more for a pair of CORSAIR HS50 - A much, much better quality of headphone with a really good all-around sonic delivery‚Ä¶I am rocking them right now to some really good Norwegian Jazz Combos, that I am streaming from AMAZON MUSIC HD (oh, baby) and these HS50‚ÄôS are handling their own very well with a great bass end and full mids! One thing about streaming that most people don‚Äôt know, if you want to make your music sound it‚Äôs best‚Ä¶TURN OFF THE VOLUME COMPRESSION FOR ALL OF THE SONGS!!! You know, the button that makes the volume of all the songs the same?? Kills the quality of the stream; turn it off, and you‚Äôll hear the difference‚Ä¶.you‚Äôre welcome, kids‚úåÔ∏èü§† - and for 25 bucks, the HS50, or heck, you can even score a most excellent HYPERX CLOUD ALPHA used, which are to me, amazingly good $100-plus phones, I have about 12 pair of those when I see them for $25 or so. That‚Äôs the real deal, mates; Namaste üôè"
The headphones themselves are alright the mic quality is kinda bad also I had to use a ruber band to keep the mic at a perfect angle away from my face because it was way to low and their is no way to move it and the headphones have a giant metal thing as shown in the photo that make them kinda unconfortable
"it‚Äôs so comfortable to wear, and it works great on my switch, but it‚Äôs sooooo quiet on xbox and i‚Äôve looked through console and tv settings to try to adjust it. cord looks to be nice quality and is a decent length"
"I decided that I needed a new set of headphones, and that I wanted ones that were a bit nicer than the lowest-priced ones I usually buy.  Unfortunately, basically every set of headphones over $20 is a gaudy, LED-covered mess, as if I'm supposed to measure their merits like so many birds of paradise, or something.  I thought these might be the exception: Simple.  Black.The first problem I noticed in the pictures: a big old ""LEFT"" and ""RIGHT"" on the appropriate side.  How about you include a sign that says ""I'm an idiot"" too?  But whatever, that's not a big deal.I also wondered why I couldn't see the mic switch in the full picture--""must be somewhere I can't see"", I figured.  Turns out the switch is ON THE MIC.  As in, underneath the foamy, breath-cancelling thing on the mic.  You turn the mic on, then put the foamy thing on.  If you want to turn it off or on quickly (that happens a lot), you have to feel around for it under the foam.  You could just leave the foamy thing off, though, so no big deal, but talk about poor design.Also, on the subject of the mic, it's attached to the left ""muff"" on a wire that does NOT seem very stable.  I think prolonged use of this thing would result in the mic hanging down away from where it needs to be, and then how would my friends be able to hear my pithy comments?I will say that the headphones are very comfortable--much more comfortable than what I usually use.  They do seem to drown out noise pretty well.  I can't speak to their noise-cancelling capabilities, but they may in fact be quite good at that.I could have lived with all of these problems, but for the biggest issue.  The cloth-covered cord (which I liked at first) rubs up against my clothing, and the headphones seem very good a picking up that sound.  I don't think it's an electronics issue, but a physics one; the sound travels up the cord, and the plastic they use for the headphone casing picks up that sound REALLY well, and all I hear when I wear them is this really annoying grinding sound.  Practically speaking, this completely cancels out any benefit from the noise cancellation.Finally, after I purchased these headphones, I got an email asking me to talk to the company before I wrote a negative review, so they could ""make it right"".  Amazon tried to get me to do this as well--instead of returning the headphones, would you like to talk to an ""expert"" who can ""make it right""?  I had to click just to see the option to return.  This to me (and call me paranoid, if you like) seemed like a not-so-subtle way of falsely (or at least improperly) buffing their amazon rating.  I was on the verge of just returning them and forgoing the review, but then I realized that the marketplace only works if there are negative consequences for such behavior.You can all thank me later."
"I've had this headset for about a year and a half. The sound quality is near perfect, but the microphone quality is a bit grainy. The noise cancellation kind of works but not very well. At random times the audio will cut out or only play in one ear and I would have to adjust the cords. Also the cords are not very strongly connected, and will often unplug when I turn around in my chair. I've had to tape the cords together to prevent that and it's really annoying because I have to replace the tape every month. I bet that it can last a bit longer with better care, but I wouldn't buy it.My dad works at a gun shop and once said ""Sometimes guys will come in looking for a specific gun. I'd have a few guns around $600 and a few guns around $900. They'd get the $600 one because they want to save money. Then they stop working, and they sell it. They'd get another of the same gun, and they break, and they'd sell it. It would've been less work and less money to just get the higher priced gun than to keep replacing a cheaper gun."" I would use this example for headsets as well. Don't buy this headset because it won't last long and you'll have to replace it. Instead, go out and buy a headset from Razer or Logitech or some other big company with really good products. Yes, it will be more expensive, but it'll be worth it in the long end."
Every soft part is falling apart. Leaves stuff everywhere on your face and sometimes in my drinks. Great comfort headset but only lasts a little over a year.Most headphones hurt my ears but these never did
The quality is not bad butt not good its feels straight from china tin head band i used it for one day then never again save your money for something better if this head set was priced a little lower then 30 or 40$ it would be good for the price butt feels really cheep for 40$
"I have a pair of $17 Logitech headphones since 2012 that still work today.  I bought those from Walmart. Earmuffs are torn , duct tape to hold one side together. cuts in the wire. The sound on them is still crisp and clear.  No bass though.The NUBWO n7 however took some tinkering to get the sound I wanted. Out of the box the sound was muffled and not crisp at all. The bass was too overpowering over the treble.  That is why it is 3 stars for me.I had to download Sonic Studio 3 along with Realtek drivers to manage what I wanted as far as bass and treble levels.  Sonic Studio is for the ASUS ROG series motherboards.  After messing around for a while to get the right sound video games and music sounded so good. Way better than my Logitech headphones.  They are so light and comfortable.  The main thing I am worried about is longevity.  Will my beat up old headphones outlast these?  I don't know.The NUBWO n7 definitely changes the experience for people that have been using cheaper non-over ear headphones.  The $25 price tag for something that was originally $50  is too good to give up. I like the aesthetics too. It looks professional. the N12 model to me looks cheap and fragile.If you buy these headphones be prepared to download your motherboard's audio software to get the most out of them."
Seems like these headphone are quite. Like party chats are at max for each person and I still struggle to hear them over the game.
"These aren‚Äôt bad headphones. They‚Äôre definitely not the greatest.The key phrase with these is: ‚Äúfor the price.‚ÄùFor the price: they don‚Äôt sound too bad. There‚Äôs enough low end to experience quite a bit, but don‚Äôt expect the depth of Bose or Beats.It does have an inline volume control. So if your computer or phone volume is maxed and the headphones just aren‚Äôt giving you the levels you‚Äôd expect, check the inline dial!For the price: they‚Äôre quite comfortable actually. No complaints there. I‚Äôve worn them for a couple hours straight while gaming and neither my ears nor head fatigue.I think my biggest complaint about them is the noise cancellation, whether in or out. Sitting in the same room with my wife, she can hear them while I‚Äôm wearing them and the volume on my phone or PC is up past 50%. And while they do block SOME sound, they don‚Äôt block nearly as much as you would think. I can hear some standard volume talking around me, TV and such. The fact that what I‚Äôm listening to can be heard above 50% volume really stinks because when gaming I like a lot of volume to hear everything going on. Immersion if you will.So for the price, they‚Äôre not bad. They‚Äôre not great. But they‚Äôre not bad. I use them happily and will for some time.Plus it has a microphone with mute switch!"
"The first thing I noticed upon putting on this headset is that the earphones are huge.  They're so huge that they don't fit my ears well.  Normally I like over-the-ear headphones because they seal my ears well and that helps block out background noise.  These are so big that they don't seal my ears, and I can hear quite a bit of background noise.  I'm using these in an open office environment.  I could hear the conversation behind me louder than the video call I was on.  Sure, I could have turned up the volume on the headset, but then my video call counterpart would have been shouting into my ear.  Volume level wasn't the issue, it was the inability to block background noise.I also had trouble with hearing an echo, not of myself, but of whoever was talking.  Once I muted my headset, the echo went away.  That wouldn't be too bad if muting the mic wasn't so weird.  There's a switch, but it's on the mic itself, which is covered by a foam pad.  So you have to feel around for the switch.  I can only imagine how that sounds to the people on the other side of the call, as I'm fondling the mic trying to mute myself.I was also disappointed with the quality of the audio.  The people on my call didn't sound as sharp as I expected.  This may be due to the ill-fit of the headset.The headset was cheap and I feel I got what I paid for.  I don't need to use it often, so I'm hoping it will just work ""good enough"".  But after I feel I've gotten my money's use out of it, I'll be upgrading to something better."
"The headset looks nice but upon inspection it‚Äôs very cheaply made, the ear pieces are very uncomfortable and the headset its self is very snug.Aside from the appearances the sound quality is severely lacking, my stereo speakers produce better sound.It sounds like you‚Äôre putting a glass to a door and hoping to make out what‚Äôs being said.The microphone doesn‚Äôt seem to work at a distance, every time people couldn‚Äôt hear me until I put the microphone an inch from my mouth.Overall I‚Äôd pass on this and keep a close on on others."
"I just received a pair of these headphones at the end of 2023.  The quality of these are below average.  They have a thin sound, lacking bass, mid-range and highs.  I am not impressed by the sound quality at all.  Don't be fooled by the stellar reviews."
Sounds amazing but it breaks rlly easily so just be careful with it
"I struggle to find headsets I can wear.  These are wonderfully wearable for two reasons: 1) they are lightweight and the design keeps what little weight there is off the top of the head; 2) the foam around the ears is squishy soft, not too dense, and actually covers the entire ear (the ear pieces are oval rather than circular). Additionally, there isn't the compression that occurs with many headsets.  I cannot speak to sound quality because my needs are very basic: I need to hear and be heard which this headset allows.  UPDATE: Mic no longer works as it should.  Cuts in and out with static according to those who hear me.  I can't hear it."
