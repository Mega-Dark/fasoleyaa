"I bought this laptop for basic work. I used it for three days before I started having network connection issues. I would be connected to the internet, then randomly unable to connect to the network for about 15 seconds. This would occur randomly but inconveniently during zoom calls. (I have 2 gig internet speeds and was only using my phone at the time so it wasn't because of other devices bogging down the connection speed.After five days of having the laptop, it started to randomly freeze. I would be forced to reboot manually after using the laptop for an hour. My point of decision for returning the laptop was when at startup, I would get a message saying windows failed to restart. The computer was telling me to reinstall windows since it was unable to boot windows up.I had hope for this computer, but sadly it was not a good computer in many ways. I bought software that I'm now stuck with and unable to use unless I buy a new laptop. I would have given it a chance if it hadn't been having major issues within the first week of owning this laptop."
"I did not try to change out the drive or the ram so I am unsure if the laptop can be upgraded or if the ram is soldered into the board. Regardless, 8 gb of ram will work for every day use bare minimum device these days. This laptop so far has worked well for every day use. I gave this to my cousin to use in college setting and it works great so far.  The laptop is on the heavier side compared to others of this size but it is thin. It still has the same issues as most HP computers though which is the weak hinges. I am not sure why the hinges are always so weak with HP but it is the same for this one. The i5 processor is not bad and does great for most multitasking. The battery life on this is not too bad but it is not as strong as many other devices. It really only last about five hours on average use. Unfortunately the fan is a bit loud on day to day use. The charge is not bad either. Upon boot up of the HP laptop, the laptop boots up at a decent speed. It does have a little of a hard time going from sleep to powering on. The setup is just like any other desktop/laptop and  pretty straight forward. You do not have to install any driver installation. There is not too much bloatware on this. The laptop also has a 15.6 inch screen but the resolution is only 1366 x 768. It is not even 1080 which is a bit of a bummer. You can only get 1080 p if you connect external monitor. The screen has an okay brightness but not the best quality. It still keep the traditional two USB port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port charge charging and using with a dock if you have one. The laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. The hinges again feel a bit flimsy which make me worried about future use. The bright silver color casing does get easily scratched up and the wrist rest fades slightly overtime. The keys are okay and pretty standard. The trackpad is okay but not as nice to use. There is a camera that will record at at least 720p. You also get a switch to cover the webcam. The microphone is not bad but it does pick up some surrounding noise. There is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. You can do some emulating of old games on this but nothing that is graphic intensive. The overall charge time depends but it can take up to four hours to charge the laptop to 100% on average. The speaker system is okay. It does the job for something like this but it is not surround center. The heat from this unit still has the same issues in that the HP runs a hot and the fan gets a bit loud. The processor is an i5 which is good enough power for what is needed on a daily. Overall this laptop still has the same HP problems in that it gets hot, fans loud, hinges are not very strong, and the battery life is not as good. I would not really get this as a budget PC because of that."
"I only needed a computer to watch Netflix and do some other online browsing, so I figured a reasonably priced one would be fine. OMG, trying to watch anything on it is like going back in time to the 1980's. The colors are washed out and the audio is tinny. Seriously, I can't just watch a movie for under $600?? Terrible product. Keyboard is not backlit and there is no indication if the number lock is on or not. I'm so mad I bought this piece of crap. I'll use it as an extremely expensive paperweight, I guess."
Need to keep your charger with you at all times the life charge last about 1 day I'll keep it for basic information
"Why can't they just let me into the system to set it up on my own - like it was before.  I really hate it when MS tries to ""help"" me because it generally just pushes me into a corner.  Windows 11 sucks."
Why do I have to press the power button 10 times or hold it down for 3 minutes to get the computer to come on?  Every single time I want to power on my laptop I have to do this..... Also the computer supposed to be a 13 generation but it says it's a 12th generation I need to talk to somebody about that.
"I am so pissed, no backlit keyboard as described the only reason i chose this one as it has no touchscreen which sucks to start with. I thought what a great deal during prime, Apparently if the description is a lie that is the deal. It is flimsy as well. super pissed to waste this money i was so excited....what happened to HP? no one has any extra money to spend now a days."
I think I have to get used to it.
The product is built in a flimsy light plastic shell. The mouse pad sticks when using it as a button making it unusable. The power button is in the top row of the keyboard. Battery life has been poor.
I ordered this product because the description stated that it had an added feature of a SD card slot as well as a backlight keyboard. When it was delivered I found that it didn't have these features as advertised. I returned the product for this reason and the vender charged me a $40 restocking fee. It was their error in the products description that caused the return.........I should not be charged a restocking fee for their error.........DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR.
Laptop battery wont charge. Diagnostic test result...needs replaced??!!! Check with HP for Warranty.... Expired 2022 ?!! What??? !! I just bought this supposedly Brand NEW lsptop on Oct 18...of course I cant return it now and a new batter will cost over 100 dollars. I guess I got scamed...some refurbished product advertised and sold as brand new. Shame on you😡
"Had to return as soon as it arrived, security tape was cut and the item in the box had marks on it and the screen had smudges. Clearly not new.I have a similar problem at auto parts stores, make sure the one you get is actually new, and not just put back in the box."
After having the laptop for a little over 2 months it no longer turns on and Amazon states there is nothing that can be done.
Quite literally the worst laptop I’ve ever owned. The keys get stuck. The mousepad gets stuck. It doesn’t hold a charge. It feels cheap. The only benefit is it does run quickly but what good is that if the hardware barely works? It feels used though I bought it new. I have a high suspicion they sent me a used product then packaged it as new. Can’t wait to trash this thing and get a new laptop.
it's super slow out of the box. computer stumbles on easy tasks.
"The seller buys there laptops from HP, activates the warranty long before they are sold, than modifies the hardware which voids any HP warranty."
Have to set up a hp account to use the printer. Sooo annoying getting a dell
Completely misrepresented as a new HP machine.  Came in a box that was unmarked and zero HP badging on the machine other than the outer case.  No HP set up paperwork.  Phone number for warranty repair was not for HP.
This is a terrible keyboard.  Product update---WORST KEYBOARD EVER!!!
"Didn’t work well, while using it restarted again and again. Spoke to IT support at amazon he couldn’t able to fix that and ask for return and refund.😔"
Slow processor. Pre-installed software I don't want.
"Has almost no ports. Impossible just to have a basic mouse, keyboard, two monitor setup without buying some dock station which may or may not work properly."
"Says 5GHz in the description and yet cpu says 1.7GHz in the System>About section.Not sure whats up with that, feel like I've been lied too."
"I bought this laptop 20 days ago Build Quality 2.5/5, Screen 1.5/5, Battery 3.5/5, weight 4/5, key board 2/5, performance 2.5/5 Value for money 2.5/5, Overall Not at all Satisfied with the item."
"To be fair, I have a lot of high end machines that I use so my review of this computer may not be relevant if you only want an average system. I'm going to break down my comments into sections to help me organize my thoughts and hopefully make it easier for you to find what's important to you.Pros:The battery life is really good, I've used it on and off for an entire day without needing to charge it. I can't tell you the total time in use but I can't remember every having a laptop that was usable for a large part of a day.The total weight is on the light side, It adds very little to a backpack filled with other electronics and charging equipment.The Keyboard is a full size with all the important keys in their standard locations, I can switch from a desktop keyboard to this without even having to think about it.Cons: Some of these are very important to me.The Screen Resolution is at the very low end of acceptable, some of my software and apps have problems when the menu's don't fit on the screen. I'm currently running my browser at 80% zoom so that I can see roughly the same amount of information that I get on my other laptops.My biggest issue is the Screen Color/Hue & Brightness. The screen has a washed out look to it. The angle that you look at the screen changes what you see to a very large degree.  Tilting the screen backward and forward can make it feel a little better but I can't find a way to get the brightness, saturation and hue all balanced at the same time. It has a very cheap look to it.This is a purely subjective topic but I don't like the feel and sound of the keyboard. It's not terrible but the sound is a little on the clicky side. Oddly enough this does appear to be getting better with use.The computing power is decent, battery life is very good and it runs all of my software without a glitch. If it had a decent screen this would be a really nice middle of the road pc."
"This is a tough one to review. The laptop and the hardware are not bad but this is priced way higher for what you get than other brands. What you are getting is the HP name. There is value here as HP has their own proprietary system for support which you won't get in those other laptops. When it works it definitely has value but that is not always going to be the case.The laptop comes with 8 GB ram and 512 GB m.2 SSD. The M.2 Drive is actually a gen 4x4 drive which surprised me a little. This is a good thing and ads speed and value. The size is a bit small but should be ok for most people. The 8GB ram is a little on the low side for Windows 11 in my opinion. For simple tasks it will get things done but really 16 is the standard and again finding a comparable laptop with 16GB and 1TB SSD for this price point or less is very easy so once again paying for HP brand and what they offer with support.This can be upgraded, however, if you are not familiar with opening laptops and working on them then this might be a bit more than most will want to take on. The cover only has 4 screws but takes some careful work to get past the internal plastic clamps without damaging anything. Once open there are two ram slots and the M.2 slot all with easy access. I upgraded mine to 16GB of RAM. This may void the warranty though so tread carefully here. Not sure if it can support more than 16GB but no configuration on the HP site allowed me to get more than 16GB factory installed so my guess is that is the max.The other big issue I have is that the display is not 1080 FHD. It is 720. At this price that really surprised me as again you can find laptops with much better hardware for lower than this price. You can even find some entry gaming laptops near this price point.Overall, this is compact and light in weight. Has descent specs that can be upgraded but honestly unless you really need to have HP's support you can get much more for your money on other laptops. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars here but ultimately the lower resolution 15"" display pushed me to a 3 star choice."
"I'm writing this strictly from a user experience perspective. I know nothing about hardware and the last time I bought a personal laptop was 12 years ago (and was an Apple). However, I also have a work laptop that is more similar to this one.So far, this is what I like:- Lightweight- Camera shutter feature- General ease of use- Feel of keyboard- Fingerprint sign-inHere are the quirks:- The power adapter gets HOT.- Touchpad does odd things. I need to figure out why it will randomly delete things on spreadsheets and change that setting. I don't have that problem on my work computer.- Bluetooth doesn't always work. I have headphones I have paired to many devices and they automatically connect once they are turned on again. I have not gotten this computer to automatically connect to them. Instead, I have to manually connect them. Today, I couldn't even manually connect them. Again, I'm not sure what is happening but I don't have this problem with other devices.- Battery life doesn't impress me. It depleted in about three hours with half screen brightness, volume 30, and inconsistent use. It took about 2 hours to charge back to 100% (when not in use).- Power button is in an odd place (see photo) in middle of keyboard instead of in the top corner like most other laptops.None of these things by themselves are deal breakers but there are enough small annoyances to make it just ""okay"" to me. For what I have to use it for (which is mostly remote work), it works fine and I don't need much from it."
Dear Amazon teamSince last 2 days laptop bettry is getting died up in just 3-4 hours after full 100% charge. I would like to do replacement or do something as this is not what i have expected for the new HP laptops.
It's battery power is quite weak.. my old laptop of 10years was given better battery power than this
"This product, for as long as it works, will actually do a decent job:It's fast, it's quiet, it lasts long enough off of the charger, and when you game, it does a great job of gaming.Why, then, would I give it a single star?Because from my experience, the lifespan of this item is about 3-4 months before you need to replace either the charger, or the charging port. Because I've had to send mine in twice within a year (and what would technically be a 3rd time if it wasn't a week outside of warranty), due to the fact that the charging port--or charger, because the repair notes that they send back are rather unclear--is utterly worthless. Over the course of a few months, in my experience it seems that the communication between charger and charging port deteriorates, resulting in your computer constantly freezing as it states, ""charging--not charging.""This 3rd time around, on the instructions of a piece of paper taped to the computer when they'd shipped it back stating that ""you should unplug the device before moving it,"" I literally would disconnect the charger before moving the device from my lap out of fear that this issue would resurface - and guess what? It happened anyways. I contacted their support again, exhausted, defeated, because this has honestly been a trial trial, and was told to try it with a different charger. So I went to the local Best Buy, which had two chargers to give it a try, and it worked. So, since I'm out of warranty, I'll be spending 140 dollars after so helpfully being given the part number, and hopefully get another 3 months out of this device before the charger fails again. That is my legitimate expectation at this point. Here's hoping that I land a new job so I can invest in a different PC for the future, rather than continuing to throw money onto this garbage fire.My sincere opinion is to go with another device."
"****EDIT****So, I've had it for a couple of weeks now and I, unfortunately, had to return it. The issues with the overheating just got too inconvenient to try and work around. Not only that but I was genuinely scared that it would only get worse and the laptop would eventually have a literal meltdown. I only used it for gaming one time, but with it giving me multi-daily overheating warnings I was too scared to do anything else but browse the web on it. It was literally blaring alarms at me and warning me of overheating when I wasn't doing anything but using Chrome for schoolwork, sometimes even when it was just sitting there and I wasn't using it at all. I used all precautions--I adjusted settings, I elevated the backend, I got a cooling fan...None of it worked. And I resented having to carry a bulky cooling fan with me everywhere I went, esp if I was just taking the laptop to do schoolwork somewhere. I also resented having to do trouble shooting on a brand-new laptop. To have a gaming laptop and not be able to game is...not ideal. The alarm system wasn't faulty either because I was monitoring the temps with two different programs; the built-in Armory Crate and the IOS advance system care. There was a couple degree difference between the two but nothing drastic, and they both picked up on high temps consistently. I got a newer model from ASUS directly, we will see if that has the same issues. If it does then I will just switch to a different line completely like the TUF or something. I didn't put it all the way down to 1 star because I still think ASUS is a good brand and theres a chance I just got a defective one but overall, my experience with this device was not great.Original Review:I am an avid gamer but I'm relatively new to PC life. I just invested in a really good gaming desktop last year and I finally decided to get a quality laptop. First of all, I love this machine. It's definitely high quality and runs intense/high-energy games incredibly well. The design is slick, and I am overall pleased with it. But...1. No camera. For the price, I really would've liked to see one, even if it's not the best quality something would've been better than nothing. Bit of a disappointment because I also wanted a laptop I could use for my online classes.  Nothing a webcam can't fix, but that lessens the convenience and portability slightly. Which brings me to my next point:2. what the heck is up with this almost 5lb charger? The charger battery is about the size of a brick (literally; 7in long and 1.5in thick) and about as heavy as one. Hardly seems necessary esp considering it does not seem to hold a charge beyond that of an average laptop. Again, this takes away from the portability. And finally,3. This thing overheats. Definitely to be expected from a powerful gaming laptop, but NOT to be expected when a game isn't even running. I was only INSTALLING a game and the laptop started yelling at me (it sets off loud siren/alarm warning noises when it gets too hot). Which I was able to fix by adjusting some settings and, most importantly, getting a cooling pad, which helped a lot. But, like the other things, having to lug the fan around with me almost makes a portable gaming PC redundant. But for my purposes, it's not a dealbreaker, because I really just wanted something for school, and to use for gaming during trips. And mostly so I can play in different rooms of my house instead of being confined to my office.But with all that being said, I still think this is an above-average machine. I did a lot of research before choosing a laptop and I kept coming back to this one. So far I have yet to regret my decision. ASUS is a solid brand, my desktop is an ASUS as well and I love it. The 16GB ram is not great but it's fully upgradeable, the first thing I did was switch it out with two 32gb RAMs and maxed it out to its 64gb capacity. I got the 240hz one, and I got it on sale for 1699 which is even better because the price jumped back up only a few days later. But even if it's not on sale, as long as you can live with some minor annoyances I still think this laptop delivers and lives up to its price tag when it comes to performance. Definitely recommend!"
"I've had other computers, including a MacBook Pro, and now I've bought this machine at a discount with free shipping to Colombia. Before this, I had the Asus TUF. I decided to make the investment thinking long-term, though being a technophile makes it a bit difficult. The computer is very nice to look at, although it's a bit heavy. Its performance is very good. I bought a 100W USB-C adapter to keep it connected and working since the original charger that comes with the machine is a real brick. I'm not much of a gamer, but those who have reviewed it say it's very good. The battery lasts well, keeping the beast running for about 4 to 5 hours, which is quite good for this configuration. What caught my attention the most when I first turned it on was the screen; the colors and the sound are very good, the best I've had in laptops. This computer is quiet, and when I game, it doesn't overheat much. It's the best and most beautiful laptop I've had. For office tasks and video editing, there's no problem. Finally, the lighting detail on the lid is a plus.Edit: I lowered the rating from 5 to 3 stars because it's unacceptable that in such a short time of use, a costly computer's numeric pad fails. Suddenly, the entire pad stopped working, then it worked again, and then it stopped working again. However, it hasn't been possible to make the numeric pad work, meaning the num lock and the numbers that appear on the pad don't function, which, by the way, was something that caught my attention and one of the reasons I decided to buy the laptop. It's frustrating that the most expensive laptop I've bought has these flaws."
"Edit: Below is a summary of the power issues with this laptop model. However, the gist of the problem is that if you unplug the laptop a certain number of times, the power connector together with extremely sensitive firmware, start to detect a loose connection and interrupt CPU processing (Kernel power error). Therefore, the laptop becomes unusable as a laptop and can only be used as a stationary desktop without slightest movement. I'm confident in saying this is an overall model issue since I've had two laptops of this type. Huge disappointment and a headache and absolutely atrocious design for the power port/connector that are unable to maintain solid connections through a very limited cycles of plugging/unplugging (less than 100).I used the laptop for about 6 months without significant problems; however, soon thereafter i started getting frequent warnings about power adapter. I returned the laptop once for repairs which was a huge pain - took at least 10 days before i got my laptop back and it was difficult to even explain the issue to customer service. Lo and behold all they did was to replace the power adapter. It's not the power adapter that's the problem is the horrible port design with the port being potentially defective - i explained this ad nauseum. Well, 2 months after i got the laptop back it's back to having the same issue because there is no room for the adapter to be a little loose. This is probably the most frustrating laptop I've ever owned.Edit: Updating to 4 stars since Asus gave me a slightly better replacement laptop. That said, it took 3 RMA tries and my warranty almost expired.Edit: Back to 2 stars. The replacement laptop is having the same problem. Absolutely horrible design for the port location by Asus."
"This laptop is solid for running heavy duty games on, but it has no camera and only two USB ports, so you can't even have for example a webcam, wireless headphones, and a wireless mouse all plugged in at once without some kind of extender. It's pretty heavy too (though it's my first gaming laptop so it may be light for a gaming laptop). I'm also finding I miss having a number pad on my keyboard. Ultimately not a great purchase if you're hoping to combine the conveniences of an ordinary laptop with the gaming capability of a desktop computer, because it isn't great as a general-purpose laptop."
"***Important Update: Noticed that when the laptop plugged in AC power, and play anything with sound. The touchpad will stop working without any reason, and will work again after stop playing the sound.If i play sound using Bluetooth, even with power plug in. The touchpad will work.Playing sound without power plugged in, touchpad work.Tried update driver no help. (And there are a lot of people facing this problem on reddit)-------Got this on sale before xmas.Is QHD with 240. Working really fine and work like a beast considering spending less than 2k usd and got such powerful spec. Other brand or laptop with those spec u need 2.5k and above.Really easy to upgrade.  Added 1tb extra ssd and upgrade from 16gb to 32gb ram myself. (Although bios cant change any xmp on ram speed. But i think it running full 4800)Although the fan is quite loud when running at full speed/turbo mode. But on other mode is okay.Only downside is battery life last me around 2 to 3 hour on light to medium use.(non gaming use)Come with 280w big power supply.  But on light to medium use. I just use baseus 65w type c charger. And it was working fine. So super portable to bring around without the big brick."
"I bought this computer to use for graphic related processing.  I have used it less than 10 times while still using my old computer and planned on implementing when I upgraded my computer area.  I occasionally surfed the web and downloaded a few 3d related programs and went to start it one day and it came up with a black screen saying ""Please follow the steps below to recover your BIOS""I followed the 5 step process to the letter and the same message came up over and over.I called ASUS customer service (I think it was a daycare because all I could here were screaming kids in the background).  They said there was no way for them to help me without sending the unit in for repair.  I told them that the machine had only been used a handful of times and they said it was a hardware related issue.Why is ASUS sending out machines with no quality control.  And if they know the issue why are they sending out defective units?!?There should be a lemon law for computers because I see online that others have had the same issue, repeatedly, and have to send units in over and over.This will be the last time I by from ASUS!  There quality has dropped terribly over the years.And of course Amazon won't do anything either!  Buyer beware!!!"
This computer was bought to do video and picture editing and it ate up the battery life right out of the box.  Not suitable for our needs and didn't want to have it plugged in all the time so we returned it.
"The touchpad stops working ,I updated driver ,remove and add again but same error,I was trying to fix it with fn+f10 to disable or enable but not working my last option is use a mouse :/"
"It was a disaster from moment one.  Touchpad not working, so googled and nothing worked.  Called C/S and they were like, ""what's a computer?""  Like that clueless.  Windows wouldn't load right.  No manual to be found on their website to tell you about the features etc.  Just a huge waste of time and tying up of $2k for a while.  Got an Acer Nitro  with 64GB memory, i9 chip, 3060 GPU, etc. instead for $500 less or so and it worked out perfectly.  Love it.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBMHJFGL?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details"
"I got my laptop and i was super excited to get things started, downloaded my drivers, set up the system with core software and did windows maintenance updates as usual, just like others, about an hour after being on, the laptop tuned off and it would not boot after that no matter what I did. It was such a sad and disappointing experience because the laptop istelf is a gem with beautiful specs and performance but what is the point if half the time there is a chance it will fail and go into dead state?! Asus please do something about this, it’s unacceptable. Specially on day one, first hour using it!!! Save your time and money for a more reliable brand."
Reading the reviews I was a bit scared to order this laptop but figured surely they have cleaned up their act by now... Nope! Was turned on and within the first hour it started to freeze and was non responsive. Could only hold power button to force a reboot. Returned device and was told by Amazon I could be waiting up to 30 days before I get a refund to order a replacement.... Great so now I have 2k tied up for a faulty device.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Bought in May 2023, Less than 10 hours of usage and it stopped working. The screen started to pixelate then went black now when you turn it on just the keyboard lights up. Went passed the 30 days so can’t be returned. One star would not even give it that but can’t post without a rating."
Lapotp had to be sent to Asus for repairs after a week of buying it. Shuts off on its own all the time.
My laptop died within the first week. Dummy pissed
"How many apps do you think you have on your phone? 40? 50? how about your phone from 2 or 3 years ago? 15-20 tops? LOL  ah, yes the days when we got excited to get a few free apps or games on our new phones... alas those days are OVER bro! get you a variation of the moto g device family. Out of the box, she is pretty amazing. I didn't have a single complaint really. Super fast, tons of storage, great camera, new updated apps, lots of customizing, etc. JUST WONDERFUL. After a few months it happened, the dreaded update in April I think it was, maybe March, I now have 400+ apps. (I will attach a pic, it shows 399, there have been about 30-40 more that have trickled in since the initial dump, which took about 5-7 days to finish up... and 75-80% are ""system apps"" (bloatware from any and every carrier in fact.... ALL. OF. THEM.) For example, a bluetooth app for t-mobile, & verizon, & sprint, & metro, && cricket. Before you say, ""just uninstall them and move on!"" - I did. I have. I've factory reset twice and they're just BUILT INTO THE phones disk memory. There simply is no ""delete"" them. Some of them, as duplicatory as they are, messing around with them can still brick up your jawn within a few clicks... and before you even start, you are not a dev... so chill, I mean neither am I... but you just stay out of that menu, that app, and that folder. Really, who knows why they name everything in tech sketchy stuff like ""com.sys.IM-WATCHING-YOU-PAM.000"" and ""<%real/secret/23-LISTENER999>... but anyways... JUST PROMISE ME, YOU WON'T GET INTO THAT APP, OR FOLDER.... okay?So Motorola should reimburse me for having to put myself through IT school to teach myself to operate on this phones guts and remove all these garbage apps manually to create the phone I thought I purchased. All you can do is force stop and disable them. Buuut I still feel like they are gathering data, bc, why wound't they be. Its not just this model either, my partner has the moto g stylus 5g and its even worse on theirs. the play store basically never gets a break from constant updates (and then theres the transferring of precious data to the mother ship)yeaaaa we also had to upgrade our home internet plan and router because of all this. We couldn't both use the wifi at the same time doing anything at all. it was crazy. allllllso the apps are gathering intense amounts of data and ALL WANT crazy permissions that have nothing to do with the app itself. like the calculator wants camera permissions... nuts. The sheer number of apps that require making system changes or having total device control... it was too much. I would almost ask for a refund, but from what I see these days most phones are leaning that direction, making money off our god given ones and zeros.... and then still try and look at us in the eyes while they sputter out the retail price of the next generation of your favorite device. can't even hold it down on a free case or something..THEN - - when you finally get a break from force quitting and removing permissions that, somehow keep TURNING BACK on... you might have a few minutes to enjoy a quick photoshoot. NOPE. the camera app it comes with stinks, it just soooo basic.. so then you think, oh, i'll download a cool camera app off play store... NOPE. theres a fricking governor on the camera. That makes it so NO 3rd party camera app will get full usage of ALL THE MEGA PIXELS YOU PAID YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR (48 megs to be precise, which is overkill, but still, you will be lucky to get to use 10 or 12 MP!!)Seriously. And JUST as google starts conveniently implementing the awesome 2 step verification, and authentication keys.... JUST in time for you to have to answer to your wife about why you don't have as much info in your google takeout as she does... yikes... oh and squeeze on some more of that exact same conversation about your FB activity as well.. yaaaaay.So, let me get this straight... I now have to REMEMBER ALL MY UNIQUE PASSWORDS && double log in, && verify 3 ways, all to check a notification thats just a promotional email about the new apps GEWG will put out next week. AND then FINALLY the google security come forward to say they don't trust my log in (bc i've got a VPN) - - - (from guess who - G1 - duh!) and they really cant tell the difference between MY REAL actual login on my trusted device from what it must assume is a HAKKr logging in 3 states away. . . . . . E.V.E.R.Y. LOG - INNNN!at this point i am thinking about a jitterbug and some stress eating of sour worms to relax.but yeah the phones cool, other than that."
"I've been using this phone for about nearly a year now, the fingerprint sensor stopped working and resigering my fingerprint within 6 months of having this phone and the camera is Honestly pretty blurry in general unless you get very close and personal with what your photographing. The phone turns on and works fine for calls and scrolling Instagram. However with games, streaming music, watching YouTube and or texting or typing, it lacks a bit. The keyboard is either slow to react, doesn't type at all, or ""ghost types"" (Registers your typing but you can't see what your typing) or all three. It can freeze up and be stuck on one page for a while too, it can take up to a solid 2 minutes and a half for it to start working again. It's terrible with games that require more then tapping and can crash really easily, same with streaming music and watching YouTube. It can also crash uploading photos to other websites (like profile pictures, things like that) it's a very buggy and finiky phone. The phone works as a phone but it lacks on so many aspects besides calling and speakers. I'll also give it that It holds a charge for at least the full day. But with all the bugginess of it, it's just irritating to deal with to say the least. This phone is quite literally meh. It's a pick your poison situationship with this phone. Not bad but also not good, buy at your own risk I guess. I'm going back to Apple once I'm able to."
"The unbelievable amount of configuring and disabling to get this intrusive garbage from constantly nagging you is a nightmare. I can't recommend this phone simply because so much of this device is geared toward monetizing you, this is definitely how they make their money back. I was really irritated that the Screensaver app called ""Glance"" doesn't even have a [X] to close the nag window that kept popping up, I had to use the navigation buttons on the phone to bypass it and then eventually had to find a way to force stop this app. Its just one of the many horribly intrusive programs that's preloaded and impossible to avoid. Just look up how to remove ""Glance"" Lock Screen. It's unbelievable that not even your lock screen is safe from advertising. GROSSLY PATHETIC. And all the Google settings you have to disable to keep your apps from sending info to google to send you ""SUGGESTIONS"" What a load of crap. I've used cell phones, just like so many people on the planet without google telling me how to use it. I know what a browser is, I know how to use one to find stuff I want, that's where it ends. NO I DON'T NEED OR WANT YOU GOOGLE. F the F OFF. I try not to even use the G-Play Store, I use F-Droid for Open Source Alternatives. And Android makes sure it's difficult to install unapproved apps, but you can still do it with most free software on F-Droid. Honestly if you want to be free of these intrusions you really have to work hard at it. Another thing I found out about this phone is that there is a tiny IR LED that blinks constantly in the upper right hand of the screen, I have still yet to find out for sure why it's blinking constantly, but from what I have read it might have to do with something related to detecting if the phone is near your face or if the phone is in your pocket, but it blinks ALL THE TIME, look at your Moto G Play 2024 phone with another camera and you will see it blinking too. It's disturbing knowing this device is constantly blinking a light. It's strange because it's not a patterned blink it's like a data signal, so would be interesting to find out if this is actually trying to communicate with other IR devices. No clue but interesting. Aside from my paranoia regarding the light, the phone functions for the most part as intended, as a phone and browser and I use it for multiple apps that seam to operate well on this platform. I just don't see myself owning another Android based phone after this experience, it's just more and more obvious that you have less and less control over what your phone is doing. In my ideal world there would be an open source phone where there is nothing hidden from the user. That's not the case here, so many agreements to click through, who knows what this thing is actually doing half the time. I can be certain it's trying to find ways to analyze my usage so it can predict ways of emptying my wallet. Just a shameful digital world we've entered, it would be nice to see an alternative to all this garbage. I'm already looking into rooting and installing a degoogled mobile OS, but I've done stuff like that before and it's just as much a headache but one with less worry regarding apps spying on you. I needed a new phone and the price was right but that is about as far as the compliments can be extended from me. Phones these days are less about the user and more about being used."
"I was very disappointed when I opened my Amazon package only to see the phone box had been already open! The box seal sticker had been ripped and resealed over with a transparent sticker for resale. Even so, I was curious and carefully opened the phone box to see it had clearly been used due to the finger strokes/scratches on the phone's peelable screen cover! (Nothing else in the box appeared as if it had been touched though, such as nothing else was ripped or peeled and the charging cord was still neatly rolled up.) I had bought a NEW phone, NOT a used one, so why was I given a visibly used phone?? At this point though, I didn't have the time, patience or luxury to buy a new one, because I was in desperate need of a working phone and didn't wish to go through the hassle of returning it. It must have been luck, but thankfully, apart from how the phone appeared, it worked like a new product; no slow battery, had to set it up, etc. I do like it now after about a week of usage; I'm impressed with how well it performed for such an inexpensive phone and it's also unlocked for any phone service. This is a great phone if you're on a budget or  a nice starting phone for your kid(s).Anyway, I'm still pretty certain the phone given to me was a returned item and I would be sure not to buy again from here."
"I wanted an inexpensive phone and had the Moto g-play 2021.  The security features (except PIN) aren't reliable at all (touch sensor, face ID, and ""safe places"").  So if you rely on those features, this isn't the phone for you.  It has plenty of memory for the apps I use and I installed a SIM card for photo storage.  I think the 2021 screen features (esp the clock) were more aesthetically pleasing.  One plus - I can SEE THE SCREEN in bright sunlight.  It was nearly impossible on the 2021 model.  Volume control is good (I have a deaf ear), but the phone external speaker quality doesn't seem as crisp as the 2021 model either.  Voice pick-up from across the room is good and the phone receiver is good. I often need to turn the volume down when listening to help improve the clarity.  Camera is fair but I don't take a lot of photos.  Not at all bad for a less expensive phone (but was considerably more expensive than the 2021 version... Like everything else is today)."
"The Moto G Play 2023 has impressive features making it a good value. But the value is compromised by the speed. It sometimes has sluggish response to screen refresh and taps. Sometimes response to a tap is so slow a 2nd tap is delivered thinking the first went unnoticed. But it didn't. Now there are two taps registered and both are executed. I placed an unwanted online order because of this glitch. It uses a 10 year old ARM Cortex-A53 processor which was announced on October 30, 2012. Old and slow I guess. Sometimes frustrating  but a good value for an entry level phone, backup phone or for smart home apps."
"Not the greatest of phones but it shouldn't be expected to be at the less than $100 I paid for it.  There is a noticeable bit of lag at times with scrolling up or down the screen and I have to say even my old Android 7 phone is still smoother than this, a lot of bloatware (of the 32GB you'll end up with about 18GB usable depending on what you remove), and many app notifications that need to be shut off.This still isn't a bad phone.  It's also not particularly great either and leaves a lot to be desired, and also probably not the phone for any power users out there.  The phone is not worth the $180 that it retails for but it might be if you can get it for significantly less."
"Performance of this phone is mediocre. Touch sensitivity is also mediocre. While the cost of the phone is low, it could be a lot better if they'd improve the touch sensitivity."
"I ordered this phone cuz it said brand new unlocked along with a so-called new SIM card well as they're trying multiple times to activate it on metropcs's app and being told that there's another account to this phone and that the SIM card was no good and if I wanted to get it activated I would have to pay another $38 for a new SIM card and the activation fee so it appears I'm stuck with a useless phone huh but I'm in a tough spot right now , a good return it and wait for a refund but I have to wait 30 days Plus however long it takes to get the money back on my card I'm not going to do that again I don't know what I'm going to do I spent over $100 on junk I can't use unless I hook up to my hotspot with use my other phone and that makes me have to dish out more money I guess that would be the last time I buy a cell phone from Amazon if I had known that there was another account attached to my phone I would have never bought it like I said be prepared"
"Being a senior citizen, I am not totally on top of all things in the phone world. It would have been much better if the fact that the SIM card was not included and the fact that if you have an existing Android phone, your current SIM may work.  Very disconcerting to someone my age!!!"
"This is the worst phone I have ever gotten and I have only had it for three days.If your thinking of getting this phone I advise you to look at other options.Firstly, this phone has been designed by someone trying to meet a deadline. At first it looks good l, but if you at any point dig any deeper you will find a ton of errors.  If you try to change the button orientation you will have go on a reddit deep dive because your not given an option in your settings,if you try to change the wallpaper to something you like that's too bad it will go back to the default the next time you close your phone.If you like listening to music on your earbuds that's to bad, it sounds like trash.If you try listening on a speaker that horrible screeching sound plays when you try to adjust your wired headphones that should have been replaced 3 years ago happens. Oh, and another thing if you idk like your apps to stay open when you use your phone this is not the phone for you.I hope you don't have a time sensitive task because you phone will close right out of it. This phone is also stupidly slow.it will process about half of everything thing you do if you try to type in any that was not made by google.Oh and I forgot to mention that your phone will have every product Google has ever made download on to your phone as well. In addition to that, if you idk use wyze it is not compatible with this phone. And btw, if some says that is is happeing because you need to clear your storage, I have over 6g left of storage.So don't get it if you don't want to put up with any of these problems."
"Coming from a high-end phone ( Pixel 8 Pro) it is dirt slow, but I am able to adjust. 5G isnt very impressive in the US anyway, WiFi Performance is fine and I use that 90% of the time."
Phone works good. But this phone does not support nfc so I can't use it to tap for payments
"Samsung has been my number one love.  Motorola is a close second but this phone though it's okay and it does the job, it's very slow and once I added the apps I needed on my phone it has taken up a lot of the memory and very quickly I'm already needing to expand it. I'm hoping that when I do it will add more speed. Otherwise this phone will be replaced as soon as it is feasible and possible. For now it will do and I do like it but it has a few drawbacks that has me a little frustrated which again is in regards to the speed.For what I paid for it which was on sale for $99 I can't ask for more."
"Bought for daughter, phone works fine but it was not a new phone out of box. Had issues because it was linked to someone else's number. Luckily our phone company was able to resolve, but it was sold as new"
I did not like that you had to tap twice and it keep talking. It would not stop talking and I cannot switch it over to my company
"Screen is a full inch smaller than the prior years for the same model.  An inexplicable backward step.We ended up purchasing a refurb 2022 Moto Stylus model from Amazon instead, for roughly half the price.  (Seems to be new, in box, etc.)Love the Moto Gestures and Moto G line pricing, but they make some really questionable design decisions."
"This is a decent starter phone but the description is misleading... The section that states:""32GB built-in storage. Get plenty of room for photos, movies, songs, and apps—and add up to 512GB more with a microSD card""You CANNOT run apps from the SD card. With all of the bloatware and the addition of 4 or 5 apps, that 32GB built-in storage vanishes very quickly. So although the phone has decent features and, yes, you can store ""up to 512GB"" of photos and video (not apps) on a SD Card, it becomes useless very quickly."
"Moto G Play 2023This phone is sleek and handy. Good to use. It's pure stock android. Display is nice and camera is pretty decent.The phone is for basic use and for smartphone beginners.This isn't capable to handle multiple tasks and it becomes slow while you switch or swap between 3-4 applications simultaneously.I tried using Whatsapp, Spotify and chrome browser in parallel and it becomes slow and starts lagging on speed.The camera is nice for daylight photos (attached).Front camera is good enough for video calls.Doesn't support 5G.Doesn't have dual sim compatibility.Doesn't have wireless charging.Doesn't have fast charging."
"Good price comes with side effects.... such as slow processing features. You can touch the icon for an app and it's like hmmmm the phone is thinking if it should open the app. Takes like 4-5 seconds to open then about the same time when using the app. Another issue is with Facebook, when I see something that I want to take a screen shot of, I will minimize the screen to activate the screen shot app. Then when I return to Facebook, it refreshes and what I wanted to take a screen of then disappears :-(  I am currently searching for another better and more responsive phone without all the bad issues. Good luck shopping!!!"
The price was good but I expected more than what I paid for. I think. From the time I first used the phone it was slow running when it came to the internet as well as the touch screen seems to run slow it takes three times me touching the screen for it to finally respond I'm not sure if that is because of the phone or because of the extra glass that got put onto it by me through a recommendation by Google for a phone case it came with the glass. The phone how everything to be running slow and be delayed quite a bit before I even put the new glass on so I believe something's wrong with the phone I'm not sure. I went from having a stylus 5 Moto g 4G/5G to this phone and there's a too much of a big difference between the two I should have got the same phone I had last time then I would be happy with it.
"If you are looking for a phone that take an entire minute to open Facebook messenger, or if you’re looking to wait 10 seconds for your phone to respond to a tap; then this is the phone for you! It is so bad that old apps like Pokémon go crash, and don’t bother trying to get it to track your movement or open up AR features. (Ar doesn’t work, and the motion tracking lags then crashes.) I can not express how terrible this phone is, the UI crashes about every time I attempt to send or respond to a text. When I’m reading articles and things like that it freezes and won’t let me scroll down. It will eventually scroll down super rapidly and crash my browser after about 15 seconds of waiting. I have never left a bad review before, but this phone isn’t even worthy of a single star it is terrible. If you want a faster phone I’d look for something like an original black berry phone or the original flip Motorola razor. I’m telling you this thing performs about as well as the old school smart phones before 4g connections. It is very very slow, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone unless they were insanely patient and don’t mind waiting 15 seconds for your phone to respond to a tap. In case your wondering I had to put the phone down, and use my iPad because it would probably take around an hour and a half to type out this simple review."
"I know that the content of the title seems like a nitpick, but it's not. This is a missing feature that makes the phone unpractical for anything other than true burner phone use. The phone only has 64GB of storage which is not enough for messengers much less as a practical phone. The SD Card should solve that, but because it's only available for portable storage (and not as internal storage), it can only be used to store files, not to store apps or app data. It can only store app content for apps which support sd card storage to portable sd card storage. afaik that list includes, Youtube, Netflix and the camera app. So it's a total waste of the sd card slot. And as a result, my phone can only hold apps up to to the 64GB, not including the sd card. So there's a lot of apps that I can't install on the phone."
Lags. Don't press too many function buttons right after one another...
I was looking for an inexpensive unlocked smartphone to use for social media live audios. This one for the bill but boy howdy is the performance slow when switching apps or typing in the keyboard. I guess that's what you get for the price.
So I had to return this phone because it wasn't compatible. The received the phone back. But I've been waiting over a month now for Amazon to issue the refund. The phone was brand new. All I did was turn it on and stick my sim in it. Then when it didn't connect. I took it out. Put it back in the box and returned it. Soo what is taking so long.Other than that the phone seems like it would be such a nice phone. I wish it would have worked out like it said it would in the description.
"I only use this phone for the basics: phone, messaging, navigation.  Even with no other apps installed/running, it is incredibly slow responding.  This is simply because it doesn't have enough processing power to run the Android OS.  It is cheap and solidly built, however."
"A great phone, no issues. Does not have enough storage, I can only have a few apps on phone."
Phone is nice...however most websites load very slowly
"Pros:Affordable priceUnlocked and works with most carriersUSB-C charger includedDecent screenFast and accurate fingerprint sensorCons:Comes with a lot of bloatwareFront camera is just okayRear camera is poor, with no image stabilizationMic sounds robotic and tinnyCan struggle with modern appsOverall:This phone is a good option for budget-minded users who need a basic phone for calling, texting, and browsing the web. However, the camera and performance are not great, so it is not suitable for users who need a phone for more demanding tasks.If you are willing to spend some time uninstalling the bloatware, this phone can be a decent option for the price. However, if you are looking for a phone with a better camera and app performance, you may want to consider the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G."
"Compared to the g Power, and other phones for that matter perhaps, it functions slowly, and eventually may irritate you. I replaced it with the g Power. Also a pretty weak battery, needing to recharge throughout the day."
It is well worth the price and does everything I desire a phone to do.  The only negative I have is the screen is somewhat difficult.  I have had to touch an icon as many as a dozen times before it reacts.  I have not installed a screen protector.  Otherwise it is fine.  I have had prior issues with this brand  delaminating most likely overheating when recharging.  I am now trying to only charge 80% or less (which it does quickly).  I have yet to have a problem but it is likely too early to know.
I had put off switching out my old phone. I didn't think this new phone would be glitchy with video. I can't really enjoy video on youtube or any app because it starts to turn green with the video and glitch out. I'll never buy a phone off Amazon again. Bait and switch on quality.
"I accidently ordered the 32 gb and not the 64. Totally my fault. I decided to keep the phone anyways, but now have found the battery takes forever to charge and then barely lasts the day. I will be upgrading soon."
It works for a temporary phone but definitely slow and vattery last like 2 days with me playing on it all the time so if u left it alone it would probably last 3 days
"I haven't even had this phone for a full two months and it will not last a full day. My past two moto phones took years of use to get to that point. The storage is awful. There are a ton of unused apps and processes that I don't know of or want, but I also can't fit the apps that actually plan on using everyday. Let alone storage for photos and the like. My last two phones I was capable of continuously running multiple apps at a time with no issue. Not the case on this one at all. As soon as my phone shuts off, I have to wait for whatever app I'm using to reload every time I come back to my phone. And forget about going back and forth between apps. As you can imagine this makes it very difficult to listen to music or podcasts because they crash as soon as my phone turns off. Very upset with this phone. What a waist of my Christmas Amazon gift card."
"I ordered this phone for my dad, the phone is perfect for a old person, just the problem is with the software.he just want to call and see videos, the thing is the HBO, Netflix and Pluto is not connecting to Internet over WiFi, just over data, but he always are in home. I expect this problem get fixed for moto."
This phone has very poor design.  it's too big and heavy.  It does not respond well and frustrating to use.  Touch screen has serious issues in terms of responsiveness and getting you to right destination
"I bought this phone for myself and have used it as my primary phone.Its honestly great in nearly all waysits light, pretty, and plenty fast.HOWEVERit seems to be MORE glitchy than the older Motorola g power 2021 phone it replaced.Maybe this is android's fault?I don't knowAll I know is that when I'm using Maps or Messages, about once a week it will freeze up and I have to reboot it.Technology is so helpful :)**possible sarcasm"
"I paid the price for a new phone and instead received a refurbished phone with someone else's videos and apps installed. Very misleading, if I wanted the refurbished phone I would have chose that option for the lower price. Instead I paid more only to receive a used product. Very disappointed."
"I just started using a Pixel 7 Pro, to replace the Moto G Play that stopped working properly. The interface on the Motorola runs rings around the Pixel -- try activating the camera flash or the self-timer on both phones; simple and easy on the Motorola. Many things are easier on the Motorola: three-finger screen captures. Unfortunately, a good phone should also last longer than five months. The G Play stopped holding a charge for more than a few hours of use, and took longer and longer to charge, making it unusable. The money saved from buying a G Play isn't really any saving when the phone is only working correctly for a short time. My phone previous to the G Play was a G Power and it still works fine, even though it's now a bit slow."
Phone doesn't always charge due to broke and missing prongs in the charger port. Happened not long after purchasing but haven't had a chance to write a review
Not at all pleased with this phone. I use the phone a whole lot less than anyone I know or see others who use theirs alot. This makes it just thru 24 hrs then have to charge. THe picture quality is not wonderful it will just do for average picture taking.
"My favorite phone was the motorola ecruise. I loved that phone. Sadly phone phone died and I had to replace it. I bought the moto g play and I expected it to be similar. I paid 60$ for the ecruise in 2018 and 120$ for the moto g play in 2023. I figured that this updated one should be slightly better even though it was still at the bottom. It is not better. Now in Feburary of 2024 (~6 months later), the phone is impossible to use. I don't have that many apps on this phone but it is running so slow I can't use it. It takes minutes for the keyboard to pop up so that I can simply send a Text! It's glitchy and slow and slow and slow. I have a lot of patience for phone since I typically just buy the cheapest one but my 5 year old e cruise is  space ship fast compared to this 6 motnh old moto g play."
"The only thing that I dislike about the phone so far, is that it freezes up and I have to restart it again, because the other person on the other end  can't hear me."
"It's ok but the storage space is bad and it takes all day to charge. Plus it is only a 3/4 day charge, not a 3 day."
"Phone manufacturers have once more decided to boldly go backwards! Making products worse than they did two years ago!I got a motorola phone a couple years ago and it served me well, but it was slowing down and finally got finished off by some water damage. So I decided to replace it. Turns out the newest model doesn't have expandable storage. It says it does, but it doesn't actually expand anything. You cannot put apps on the expandable storage, so the tiny internal storage is all you get. I thought 32 gigs was fine because expandable storage would make up for the shortfall - NOPE! Because motorola decided to make an ""upgrade"" worse than the previous model.Way to ruin a good thing."
"For $79-99... to be frank its a decent value, just don't expect high end performance from it for modern apps/games/etc.I misplaced my mainline apple iPhone 14 on a trip and needed an urgent temporary business phone until I could get my replacement original phone. This phone fit the bill for less than $100.Some pluses:+long battery life+good for general purpose usage, playing music, chat apps, tik tok, phone, text, email.+headphone jack+big screen+cheap ""brand name"" phone++ oddly enough the best finger print scanner I've used, the little motorola logo on the back instantly picks up my finger print every time immediately unlocking the phone.I recommend getting a otterbox defender basic case with this unit.The bad:-Old processor in a new package, it's a 3-4 year old processor in the unit.-Motorola shovelware installed on the phone.-Setup took a long time to patch even on a fiber connection. Took 2-3 hours before the phone was really ready.-I think there's only going to be another year of OS updates for this phone and then it will be abandoned, maybe some android super tech guys can figure out how to patch this to remove the motorola shovelware and get vanilla android on it and extend support, but its a sub $100 phone so I wouldn't expect that much.-Some lag/delay on UI on some apps"
"I purchased this phone to use with spectrum wireless. when I attempted to activate the phone it told me it would not work with spectrum. Issue a side, the phone quality seems in line with cost of phone. Definitely not a premium phone feel."
"The phone drops calls,slow opening apps, have used this brand for years,am looking for replacement after 1 month"
Will not work if you have more than 3 things open. Extremely slow.
I could make a sandwich by the time this changes screens. I've never experienced a  Motorola that runs this underpowered. A ton of bloatware. I could get this out of a $50 phone
"Aesthetically beautiful, charger chord complete trash.  Takes about a day to fully charged. I purchased it to only play pokemon go for the God kids and it is deathly slow.  Returning."
"I did like that this phone is close to what I had, so no learning curve.  The sound is very good also.  But it has been a big disappointment in the battery department.  I have charged it several times, in 3 different ways to make sure it wasn't something I was doing or my charging methods were bad.  But it has performed the same in all 3 methods of charging. I did a test, started the charging process at 9am at 58% battery life, by 9pm it had only risen to 62%.  That's 12 hrs. of charging and it will not charge to 100%. Not sure how long this phone will last me."
Cannot create folders for albums - got to rely on GOOGLE - my SAMSUNG A71 can
"75% of of the memory is used by unremovable bloateare and operating system apps.  Due to the low memory, it does not operate well.  Of course, when you get a customer service ( that term is used with prejudice) you get a body in another country.  Horrible connection every time while talking to them overseas.Phone drops calls and will not work with WiFi calling.  The touch screen is frequently unresponsive.Called and got the worst customer service.  3 reps, 30 minutes, 0 help and finally just no response by the last representative."
"Genuinely bad product, extremely slow, and does not include enough ram to perform basic internet operations like keeping a webpage open and submitting a captured image to it without hitting an out of memory errorHonestly. Be better motorola. I've been using Motorola for over 7 years, and I'm baffled they could release this garbage heap labeled as a 2023 model when it doesn't have enough ram or power to perform light non gaming internet business and workloads that phones 9 years ago crushed just fine.Motorola you deserve to be punished for even creating this option and selling it under a 2023 label.Shame on you."
"I absolutely love this phone. The other reviews complain about battery, it last like 2 weeks for me lol. And complaints about prop 65. But that is any phone. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a battery charging block. Just the usb-c cable. They used to come with that block but now they don't. I have been buying all motog phones for years. And I must say this is the best one yet. Thanks!I still love the phone. but the major issue is that if the battery drops below 70%, it wont charge unless you restart it. Everytime. not just once. Every time it drops below that percentage, I have to reset phone to charge it."
For being a phone from 2023 it is super slow to load anything and swiping or opening apps is terrible and feels almost glitchy
"I have never had such a terrible phone. I'm an honestly shocked that they would let this phone hit the market. It actively tries to make my life more difficult. It has done harm at work, in my personal life and at home. It is crap that the return window is so short. I want to throw it out a window on a daily basis. This phone should be embarrassed to call itself a smsrt phone"
I definitely would not buy this phone again as it's a poor quality phone.  There are a lot of things it won't do & apps it doesn't support. Phone is extremely slow. Not enough memory & has 1/4 of the memory that my old phone had. The touch screen is not sensitive enough at all & you have to repeatedly touch it to get it to register it. It flickers when you first book it up.
Phone is slower than the speed of smell. Lags freezes unlocks half way. Aggravatingly slow trying to load a GPS or download files. What kind of phone comes with only 30 gigs of memory? Just the operating system on the phone takes a third of the phones memory. 5 apps and and 200 pictures the memory is full already. Didn't even bother with the fingerprint reader because the screen can't figure out where your pressing anyways. Battery last 3 days if you don't open the phone for 3 days. If you actually use the phone it won't even last a day. Camera is ok I guess it takes pictures but you will have no memory left to save the pictures. Sound quality is ok which it should be it's 2024
Side buttons are really hard to click or push.  Screen icons are very slow to react.
I liked it at first but after a few months (3 1/2) it has become very slow. have to delete apps for updates as it has extremely low storage. I want my money back as now I am seeing options a million times better for $50 more. My major complaints is the storage and freezing. Battery life is fine. Difficult when you are outside doing side gigs and it starts freezing up. Happened to me the other night and I was in the WORST NEIGHBORHOOD. I need to check the warranty if there is even one.
"As far as I can see, there is nowhere to adjust the timing of when the lock screen activates.  It is set to one minute and it can be pretty frustrating at times."
"I am not picky when it comes to phones, but I will say this is my most disliked phone. I'm too lazy to want to set up a new phone right now, and this phone at least takes care of my basic needs. I knew the storage wouldn't be great from the description, but I didn't realize how bad it actually would be haha. I try deleting so many things but haven't been able to get the ""storage running out"" notification gone since 2 weeks after I got it (that was 4 months ago, even with an SD card for photos). I am sure it is a reason contributing to why the phone runs slow. The keyboard is also super glitchy. Not super impressed, but I guess you get what you pay for. I hope to get a different phone in the near future."
"My Moto G has been a frustrating experience. It's performance is below expectations. Slow loading, slow response, often it takes multiple taps for the phone to acknowledge what you tapped on. Very bad at switching between tasks. ""Smooth"" will never correlate with this phone experience. Realistically, how high could I set my expectations for a cheap phone? My expectation was for it to be equal to or better than the Moto G7, the phone it replaces, which I think is reasonable. It is comprehensively markedly worse. In my experience with several G7's (both Play and Power models), the G7 had better performance, smoother experience, and even a better camera. Ouch. I would buy another G7 if I could, but there are no reasonably priced new ones available since they've been discontinued. I will not be using the Moto G for long."
"I have bought Motorola phones for years, but unfortunately Motorola has lost its way by flooding the market with different models. Although this one in particular has memory and space, in other aspects it is even worse than the entry-level Moto E models. Its camera is terribly slow and when it comes to moving images they come out blurry. After taking a few pictures, the camera freezes. It does not have NFC, something that is essential to incorporate these days."
If you're getting for your kids think again. The only way to uninstall is settings>apps>select app>uninstall.If your kid downloads a bunch of apps you are going to hace to go through these steps with each and every one instead of simply selecting the app and uninstalling like every other device is capable of.
I like the new G6s features and controls but the older versions snapdragon processor is much better for my aspects. It doesn't pause when you want response like the octagon processor in the newer version.
Bought this cheaper phone to get my by for a few months. It will not run any app and will glitch out constantly. He battery life should be 6-7 hrs total. Also for an 100 dollars there are way better phones then this one in that price point. Do not buy. POS
Ok I guess but it arrived without a SIM card
"Battery not holding charge.  Considering I've had the phone for less than a year, very disappointed.  Updated review:  took phone to repair place, something in the board is bad.  Not worth it to fix, so I'm purchasing a new phone.  Extremely disappointed in this phone."
"It crashes randomly while playing higher intensity games like guardian tales, sometimes glitches when using simple apps like YouTube and Google chrome, and god forbid you have auto-rotate enabled. Overall, this phone isn't the one for you"
"I bought this for my work phone, and was getting numerous alerts about shoe sales and postings on how to ""mindfully"" do this or that.  IMO one key to being mindful is to shut down all the alerts.  Once I shut down the built-in shopping alert app, another app stepped up and started delivering the same junk alerts.  I had to disable alerts from 5 or 6 apps just to get the noise to stop!Also, YouTube is continually running, and you can't shut it down. (I wonder how much Google paid for that feature.)  Just swipe to the right, and YouTube is already pre-loaded for you (and any active app can track you as well).  The Recent Apps list doesn't list YouTube, so you can never shut down the app!If you want to be a tik-tok-head and spend all your days watching how everyone else ties their shoes, then you'll love this phone.  Especially if you want perpetual distractions to give your life some meaning.  However, if you want a phone to assist you in living your day the way you choose to, then stay away from this junk."
Don't buy this.It's slower than my 1998 cellphone.
"Overall ok, but it is quite slow phone. Only for basic stuff you may use it."
"Was excited to finally escape the apple user club, so I bought this phone to give android a try. BIG MISTAKE! This is by no means a top line phone, but good LORD. The neverending GOOGLE UPDATES chew through data faster than you can believe. This morning, my plan renewed for a month and within the first HOUR of data availability, this piece of CRAP has used an entire GIGABYTE of overpriced data without me using it for anything... what a let down. Back to apple and their rigged to fail phones. The money it costs to buy a new phone every other year will surely be less than the expense of wasted data using android (GOOGLE)!"
"I have never had a problem with any phone I've owned but in just 3 days of using it, it has frozen up a couple dozen times and glitches to the point it won't do anything."
"This is a "" faulty product that  Amazon refuses to replace."" Phone does not hold a charge and crashes constantly therefore is not usable. Trying to contact the manufacture is a joke. DO not buy this is a complete rip off to customers and Amazon refuses to replace or return these"
Don't buy this model not enough internal memory to run more than about 4 apps.
"A budget phone that would be just fine, except that these morons weigh it down with bloatware apps. Some can be uninstalled - but who the f&*#! are you to install Tiktok automatically for me?? - but most CANNOT be uninstalled. There is a metric ton of junk ""system"" apps that run in the background and cannot be uninstalled, including YouTube Music (?!?). This makes the already-spartan processor slow down regularly. Keyboard complaints are valid; the stupid thing takes forever to appear. Additionally, prepare yourself for an avalanche of BS notifications constantly, some of which you cannot disable.In short: This model phone may be fine, if you can order from a decent company with some morality and common sense. I'll be returning this ASAP."
"Worst phone EVER!!!!!! I've always preferred, bought and used Moto phones last one being the Moto Z Play which gave me several years of good quality. This Moto phone is awful. The slowest processer I have ever dealt with. Speaker is meh, loud but no bass whatsoever. It's not like there's an equalizer to add some bass and trebbile. Camera is ok and better than the last Moto but honestly would rather just buy another Z Play and throw this one in the trash. If you like to click something and move quickly, this PHONE IS NOT FOR YOU..IT IS SO SLOW"
"In my 25 years I have yet to own a phone as slow as this one. Maybe this phone would be a decent cheap backup for your other phone, but it's slower than death in a gas chamber. And crashes frequently"
I've always liked these cheap moto phones but the 2023 g play has become a joke.  The battery that used to genuinely be great is gone despite the claims.  This thing dies just as fast as any other cheap phone now despite very low use.  What a bummer there is truly no reason to recommend anymore
"The phone is the 2023 model.  You would think Near Field Communication would be standard. Nope. Without NFC you can't tap to pay. You can't tap to ride on the subway. You can't get Bluetooth and WiFi settings from another device.  It may be a 2023 model but it uses 2013 technology.  Complete with 2013 bloatware. Certainly a case of buyer's remorse.  Now, after several months of ownership, it randomly decides I have no cell coverage.  I will be sitting in a cafe or wherever scrolling away when suddenly, no service.  I haven't moved an inch, my wife is at the same table using the same wireless account and she is connected?  Oh, and time for an update -- delete apps and files to make room for that -- and it takes forever!  The brand name was bought out and the product is worthless. Stay away!"
"Hairline crack straight out of the box, could only be seen on white back ground. Also new screens with carried colored back grounds to find defect. Hdtvs included."
battery doesn't last 3 days.  maybe 8 hours at best.  keep getting storage alerts for no reason.  phone also gets very hot sometimes.  liked my old phone better.  look around for something else.
This phone is literally a wase of money. I have only had it for a month or two and I want to throw it across a room. It's so ungodly slow. The storage is basically non-existent. Anytime I try to type it take like 15 minutes for the keyboard to decide to pop up so I can send a message. I have had phones with poor storage but I've never had it be slow and glitch out on the keyboard. It will straight up kick me out of my app when it is slow.
"Misleading listing. The battery lasted a little over a day at best. Also, incompatible with apps on app store & some apps just didn't run right. Returned it.Feels solid with. Nice screen."
"We bought this phone for our daughter to replace a broken phone. It works as a phone but it will not connect to the internet or download apps. We have tried to solve the problem with the phone carrier but it did not help. They say the phone appears to be working properly on their end. We have reset the phone a couple of times which did not help. Her internet provider, Spectrum, even replaced her modem. Her other devices work on the internet, this one doesn't. Can we return it? Does anyone else have this problem?"
"It works okay as a phone for calls and texts but is horrible at anything else if you're used to something like an iPhone. Like the title says, save your money and get something better than this POS"
"The screen is slow to react.  I have to wait for it to recognize I need the keyboard to fill in fields or write a message.The memory is awful.  I installed a 512gb micro SD card and set it up as internal memory.  I still get warnings that I'm low on memory and some functions may not work properly.  I have uninstalled as many apps as I can and disabled others that the phone won't let me uninstall.  I give up.  I'm shopping for a new phone already.I like Motorola and am sorely disappointed with this one.  I just wanted a basic phone with a couple of simple games at a decent price.  Buyer beware, this one can't handle it."
The only worth this has would be as a spare phone and thats it. Other than that it hangs even without any apps on it.
Phones are slow they load slow I don't like the phone drop calls stops shuts down all the time slow connection and loading
"This phone was hard to set up, it didn't pair well with my previous samsung and it was not working. The first time I opened the phone it worked but if it sat for only an hour it would not respond on the screen and had to be restarted, ie, I couldn't answer a call, send or answer a text, check data, etc. The support staff were hard to deal with. I had to return."
"Not sure where any of these positive reviews come from.  I understand it's a cheap phone, but this phone operates worse then phones I had 15 years ago.  Sluggish to the point where it's often unusable.  Every app takes 5+ seconds to open.  Text windows take extensive time to open if they do at all.  Didn't expect much from a $100 phone, but this thing is pathetic."
"Save your money and buy a different phone!  I just wanted a cheap phone, but this is ridiculous!  Poor image, poor color and the loading speed is comparable to the old ""dial-up"".  The battery is pathetic: It drains quickly, and takes forever, it seems to charge.  You need to power it off completely in order to conserve the battery.  I don't think a child would even be happy with this as a first phone.  Spend a few more bucks and buy something worthy.  That is all."
"The phone appears sealed on the front and back.  How do you remove the battery cover?  Unless the company helps me, I will soon return this item."
Nice phone but slow
No battery life. No sound. The worst phone i have ever purchased
Will not connect to internet. Camera doesn’t take photos… sending back
The battery life on this phone sucks
So it doesn't work with any carrier & I was charged extra shipping to get it here before my child's birthday but ofcourse it was late. Not that big of deal but then to give them a phone that doesn't work crushed my soul. I'm done with Amazon
Phone takes to long to turn on. Its also runs very slow and it overheats
This tablet was really slow. It was working fine the first few weeks and the. Just started slowing down and then last week it just turned off and I’ve not been able to turn it back on.  I feel like it was a rip off.
"I was looking for a reasonably priced tablet and picked this one. At first it seemed okay but the more I used it, the more I hated it! It's very slow and many times it just won't turn on. Just yesterday, I had been using it in the morning, plugged it in when I was done and went to use it later and it wouldn't wake up. I tried many different ways. I held the button down many different times from 2 seconds to 30 seconds many times. I tried a couple hours later and it still wouldn't wake up. The battery was fully charged. Finally this morning I held the button down to the turn it on and it finally turned on after holding the button down for quite a long time (after trying multiple times). Then it took about 2 minutes for it to finally turn on to where I could get to the main page. I use it mainly to read my local newspaper while I'm having breakfast. It could have completely made breakfast and ate it by the time I was able to read the main page of my paper. If I want to use it to look up something quick I don't even bother. I just use my phone. Sometimes it'll go for a week or so and be just fine, sometimes not. Even when it is working well, it is very slow. I should have definitely spent a little more and gotten a better tablet."
"I got this tablet for the GPS functionality.  I have a 1980 Jeep CJ7 that I go ff-roading in, and having GPS navigation on an inexpensive device is a goo idea.  The geo coordinate navigation is indispensable when the nearest pave road is about 10 miles away.The GPS connectivity is also kind of handy for use as a speedometer.  If you've neve driven a CJ, let me just say that getting an accurate speed reading is more art than science.  As a result, the nice digital speedo is handy ...When it works!  The tablet has an extremely annoying tendency to randomly power down/reboot while driving.  I don't know if it's the vibration in the Jeep,  or what, but it's super annoying when I see a flash out of the corner of my eye, look over at the tablet, and it's rebooting.Granted, I got a refurbished item, but it would be nice to NOT have it reboot every 10-15 minutes.I'll keep the tablet; might be useful in another capacity."
Have had since Feb. Aps keep having memory issues and crash. Also got blue screen of death this week. Luckily restarted and got it back.
"It was simple and easy to use. But having had it for less than a year,it no longer will hold a charge and is unusable."
"I've watched two YouTube videos, both approximately twenty minutes in length on a full charge, and the battery level dropped to 69%. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be good for the tablet, but if I were using my phone I'd still be at 98%.Also, I seem to be unable to pair either if my Bluetooth earbuds to the device. Neither appear when scanning for available devices. I don't mind using plug in earphones, however wireless earphones are much more convenient.I appreciate the ability to increase storage to 1 TB and I have a feeling I'll need it seeing as though 10GB of the 64GB has been used on mostly pre-installed apps already."
"I Recieved tablet in March 2024 and should have sent it right back, tablet was bought to replace aging Fire.  I wanted to save a couple twenties$ and purchased this tablet, which had good reviews (lies).It was bought so that I could  and read Kindle and play games.  I try to play Rummy 500, one jigsawapp., Eucher,  Block Puzzle and cribbage on thistablet.  I am 75 years old  and move faster than these game function.  I AM ADDING THIS AFTER I SUBMITTED A REVIEW.  I DIDN'T NOTE THE BATTERY LIFE IS NON EXISTANT.  ON FULL CHARGE IT'S DEAD IN AN HOUR OR LESS.What a waste on my S.S. dollars.  I'm very disappointed."
I forgot android tablet aren't that great. But this one will do for what I need it for. It's a little slow.
Tablet is extremely slow loading pages from a browser.
Tablet is a great size but seems to have charging difficulties. Switched out to different outlets and even switched out charger.
The picture is terrible. Can't live stream without a major lag. It's not my internet I can stream on my phone and other tablet with no problem. It's slow. Not worth it.
I received this Saturday..but 3 days and I have a problem turning it on...it getting stuck und wonder start...takes 3 times before it starts going...did I get a dud????.5 min laters still same 3rd pic..still stck...after 5 min..i haver never had one that did this ever...screen...I am disabled and I can't get anywhere to send it back in my town...I am very upset....thx u..
"It is nice size easy to set up. But I bought this tablet mainly to Zoom. And the volume is way to low, the picture quality is not good and the case will not allow it to stand straight so therefore you get only the top half of your head on Zoom. So disappointed and will be sending back."
"Bought this to run the app that controls our sound mixer at our church. So, only used for 2-3 hours a week.  Went to do setup and it was in a constant boot loop. Once the battery died, I attempted to recharge it and try to repair, but it won't even power on."
"I don't know why my tablet apps icon duplicated? Like i have 2 calculators? 2 calenders? 2 internet? Anyone have the issue? If yes, can you help me how to fixed it? I don't know how."
it’s a good tablet for how cheap it is. it can be slow and it will restart itself randomly
"This device did not come with a wall plug in, only the cord.  The battery drains quickly and the internet speed is slower than other devices I have.  It was easy to setup and came with a lot of useful apps."
"For anyone interested in this device for connecting to a monitor, it's not for you. It has the settings but nothing is clickable.  HDMI connection is not an option. I'm returning mine. As a stand-alone, it's decent for a kid's use. Nice enough sized screen but not loads of storage."
"Do not buy this tablet. I bought two for Christmas (one for my 8 yr old and one for my 4 yr old) and because they only play games and watched YouTube I figured a basic tablet would suffice. WRONG. You absolutely get what you pay for. The picture quality is horrible and the batteries don’t stay charged long at all. Not only do the batteries die quickly, but even after being on the charger all night they’re still not 100% charged. Some mornings they’ll be at around 80% but this morning after charging all night one of them were only at 42% and the other was at 73%. Had I only purchased one I may have thought I got a bad apple and just exchanged it for another one but because I bought two and they’re both having the same issues I will be returning them for a full refund. I do not recommend these tablets at all."
I bought this for my little brother it really good I say but one problem is that it turn off and I can’t turn it back on and I don’t know what to do if someone knows what to do then pls let me know
Stopped working 6 months after I got it really frustrating
"We bought this tablet for our 7 and 8 year old kids.  They do not charge at all now, even with a replacement cord.  We bought these specifically because they had a 5 year warranty.In reading the desciption today, this has been removed.  Obviously, many have tried to replace thisitem with a new one, so the seller had to remove their ""fake"" warranty for the garbage they are selling.Don't buy this!  My son is still crying for a new tablet and we're still trying to find a good one!"
I really liked this tablet but the internet connection kept shutting itself off then to reconnect took forever.. no could not keep doing that so opted to return
It's too slow even with good wifi
It will not connect to WiFi
The RAM is not even 1GB. But they claim it is 6GB lol
Bought a new tablet fory wife for Christmas and she opened it today and it has scratches on the screen. Several of them to be exact. Some of them more then 3 inches long and very visible.
Slow to open
"Purchased in March 2024 .  quit charging in a month.  purchased new charger started working and now it is completely off .  tried to charge it, nothing.  tried to reboot, nothing.  contacted seller and have not heard from seller."
came with a crack in the screen .. my child doesn’t want to wait for an exchange sooo i guess that’s that for us but just so others know
Nor a good quality
"As long as you don’t turn it off, it’s fine for simple things like reading. Took about 7 minutes to finally power on. I’ll probably be returning it."
The touch screen requires a lot of patience so scrolling etc is frustrating. Would not recommend
"Absolutely trash. After a couple uses of eye straining, low quality, headache inducing video streaming; turned it off and took about 20 minutes just to turn on a boot up again. It’s very laggy with swiping and response time. The battery is okay because saying it’s complete garbage is a lie. Just overall don’t waste your money, even if all you use a tablet for is to watch YouTube, browse Instagram or play a few games."
Worked foe 40  days then would stall then after a few days  stopped  working  altogether. Piece of garbage. DO NOT PURCHASE
"It worked fine at first, but it is starting to glitch a few weeks after buying."
"My kids got these tablet for Christmas.  One tablet has quit turning on, the other tablet doesn’t sense any touch on the touch screen.  Would not purchase these again or recommend"
The instruction book would be better to show the  way the buytons work
"I bought this March 2nd and 3 months later it's not connecting to wifi, has awful touch sensitivity, and everything is delayed. I have barely used it."
Very very slow not sure why.... not happy with it.
I bought this tablet two months ago and it keeps shutting off on me and I lose whatever I was doing.  The seller was suppose to return a call to me about the problem and never did now I had to order a new one because they can't help with the problem
"I just got this tablet 2 weeks ago. The on and off button already broke and it was stuck in off mode. I have a replacement coming, but I’m not sure how much I trust it since the original stopped working so quickly."
This item is it even 3 months old an will not turn on at all. What a waste of money it won’t let me not post this reciew without a star. But if I could review without a star it would get none.
Freezes up. Slow. Not compatible.
"My first one was replaced almost immediately because the screen quit working, now again, the touch screen quit working and we are unable to use the device."
"Battery stopped charging after 2 1/2 months. When it worked, it was a good deal, but I can’t afford a new one every two months"
Tablet is total junk. Constantly shuts down in the middle of using. Cant even use to play games!
"Took hours to set up a kids profile, tablet kept stopping saying ""sorry, there was a problem"". Just overall not a good tablet for kids. Will be returning asap."
"I regret this purchase so much. Bought it primarily for travel entertainment. It freezes on playback and moves slow with WiFi connection. Wasn't bad at first but as time went on and I was past my return window, it got worse. Live and learn."
The tablet won't charge. I haven't used it a lot so it was using the factory charge.  Now it needs charging and after leaving it charging all night the thing still won't charge.
It’s junk! As soon as you open any app it says close app on wait. I’m just so tired of being cheated. l haven’t used it 5 times Amazon won’t even take it back.
It’s burning out literally every charger I buy. It even broke every extension cord that it was plugged into. Eventually it completely broke and stopped charging all together. Not worth it. There’s better out there.
You will see if you purchase one I am very disappointed . Don't want to even give 1 star more like 2 minus stars
"The thing worked for 1 day, tried turning on a couple days after use after charging it and it would not turn on, tried 3 different chargers and nothing. So i returned it."
Wi-Fi won’t stay on. Internet won’t work on this one device. Z-TAB 10. I’m glad you posted this review. I’d be better if you or the seller would make it right
Is extremely slow even with high speed internet.  Takes forever to even start up. Wished I had not gotten it.
It won't charge.  I've only had it not even 2 months!!!!! Don't buy it!!!!!They say 5 year warranty.....SURE there is no one to contact!!!!
When I received it the screen was cracked and damaged but don’t know how to return it and either refund or replace it
I never had a tablet go bad so quickly. Who do OI call for information on My warranty. Thank You
I downloaded 2 apps. Download was extremely slow. And the apps didn't work after downloaded. I have to return the package.
Bought May 12..worked fine then. Aug 4th went to turn on and completely unresponsive. DO NOT BUY
Do not buy it . Bad quality. too slow.
"Touch screen working too slow, battery drains overnight when on standby and takes too long to start"
"This tablet for under $100 can get the job done for media consumption, basic gaming, and light productivity. Some things to highlight, this is using Android 12, and native android apps are pre installed. There is no bloatware like some of the other big name brands usually have. This does have the Google play store so you can download all the you are used to. There is only 4 GB of RAM which should be enough until you start having lots of apps open at the same time. It does have the option to use an extra 2 GB of your storage to bump the RAM to 6GB temporarily, that takes away from your available storage which is only 53 GB available to you out of the 64 GB. The processor this comes with is not great. It makes the tablet feel laggy and sluggish compared to tablets that cost about $30 to $60 more. The screen resolution is only HD (720p) and the colors look a bit washed out. But for the price it isn’t that bad. The dual speakers can get decently loud, but the quality of sound is not great. It’s missing the mids and lows. I was able to use the usb-c port to use a mouse, keyboard and external storage device with no problem. I did try an external monitor as well since there is an HDMI menu in the tablet settings, but it would not work. You can however screen cast wirelessly. The wifi worked just fine, the processor is the real weak point in this tablet.  As for the included case and screen protector, the case is okay, but I would get something else because the tablet fits a bit loose. The screen protector is just a thin laminate, not a glass protector. Getting the bubbles out are a pain. If this is all you can afford, this tablet will work, but I would look to spend around $130 to $200 for a much better experience from a name brand company.  Hopefully this review helped you out."
"This tablet is quite slow, and the screen resolution is noticeably low. The text and images just aren't as sharp as even my oldest existing tablets.We're wary of the potential for privacy issues with cheap tablets, and so we're using a dedicated other Gmail address for the purpose of using this tablet. We plan to keep it for the kids to play free games, read online books, access the internet, etc. So I can't comment on how well this would serve as a work tablet.All this said, we had no problems connecting to our WiFi, and accessing the Google Play store, etc."
"I primarily got this for my daughter to use during screen times. The tablet comes with a cover, which was great considering it was for a child. Dad and I have iPads. Compared to ours, this one is slow to respond at times. Additionally, the touch screen is sometimes a bit off. If you don’t touch exactly over what you want, you end up with the link above or below. We have also had 2 instances where the tablet just wouldn’t connect to the internet. We had to power down and reboot to connect. Overall, I think this tablet is good for a child or as a spare, but wouldn’t be the best choice for an adult looking for reliability. I couldn’t imagine trying to work on this."
"First, I view this as a lifelong Apple user, so that's my baseline for comparison.The Z-TAB10 tablet comes with Android version 12, 4GB of memory, and is priced at only $89.98 (at the time of this review).  I had no issues getting it to connect to my wifi, and it seemed to run the updates just fine.  It also came with a case, which was a nice surprise.The limiting factor for me is the 4GB of memory, but at this price point, it's hard to complain.  I don't have elementary-aged kids anymore, but if I did this feels like something I would probably get for them.  It could work well for an adult who is going to use it for basic web browsing or as a Kindle or something."
Tablet technically works and has Android 12 on it which is nice but you are going to be waiting a while for it to do anything. The listing said it included 5G but there is no SIM card tray or 5G antenna in the tablet. While it has Google Play store and I could install apps getting anything to run was a test of patience.
"This is not a great item. It's not a horrid item. It's PERFECTLY SERVICEABLE. The cameras are trash, but most tablet cameras are. The processing speeds are okay. The screen quality is fine. The audio isn't terrible. It's a serviceable tablet for the price."
"I regret ordering this tablet.  The seller states it is 1080p. It is not. It is 720p.  The tablet itself is quite heavy.  It has Google play store, that's about the only good thing.  It came with a green case and a screen protector.It is sloooooow.  If you need something for email and light media consumption, this might work, but I wouldn't do it. I have not had any issues with the touch screen, and it is running a current android version.If you are thinking about this tablet I would suggest you look at a Fire tablet instead. Our fire 10 is much faster and has a better screen than this thing."
"This Android tablet comes in a nice box and it comes bundled with a green case. The tablet itself is relatively heavy and it does look solid. In a nutshell, if we evaluate it simply from a looks perspective, you would think this is a premium device, as it looks and feels like one.Once you go through the specs, it seems to be a good device. Android 12, 6Gb RAM, 64Gb Storage (expandable via microSD cards), 8000mAh battery, 1280x800 resolution, USB-C, etc. Not killer specs, but makes you feel you're getting a nice tablet. Oh, and pricing is not bad...But all first impressions disappear the minute you try to use it. This tablet is really slow, to the point it gets annoying to use it for some tasks. For instance, as I was setting it up, when I was asked for the Wi-Fi password I thought it wasn't working as the onscreen keyboard wouldn't appear. After waiting for several seconds (not 5 but more like 30-40s) then it finally showed up. It's that slow! I have no idea if it's the CPU or GPU, but honestly I haven't had an Android device this slow for several years.Battery life is good, sound is OK, screen is sharp and bright and the cameras are OK (just don't expect super high quality here). To summarize, it looks a lot better than it actually is."
"Update: after only having used this tablet just a few times it is very very slow. I have 5G network yet the pages load like dial up. Even if I'm just using the settings and changing something in the settings it still has a 2 to 3 second delay If not more once I've tapped where I want to go. As an adult with no patience, this is not good. As a child or young teenager it might not be an issue. But for me it definitely is.I like that this tablet comes with its own case covering. Which is a very nice one. I also like that it has a rubber silicone around the outside of the tablet. It comes charged and it is very easy to set up. So far using it I have no issues. It is lightweight enough and small enough to fit into most bags. It is about the size of a hard back book just not as thick. This particular one does not have a SIM card you can put into use as a phone. The touch screen is perfect as far as the connection and the speed to go where you need to once you touch it. At this point I have no issues with it but only time will tell. I say that only because I had another tablet and right after 30 days it started messing up. It was not this brand or this tablet but it was an unknown brand such as this one. So with that said, I will continue to use this tablet over the next few weeks and if it starts having hiccups or glitches I will definitely come back and update this review. In the meantime, the price point is relatively good. Especially since you get it the case that you know fits it and the feeling and quality of this tablet. I do like the picture quality and the sound. Adding my own earbuds to it does nothing but enhance. I can't discourage you from not getting it but just beware that when it comes close to the 30-day return policy that it is working up to your standards. This rule should be followed on most anything you purchase regardless if it's Amazon or a brick and mortar store. After all it is an electronic device. If you are really serious about this tablet, check the reviews. Always."
"Android Tablet, 10.1 Inch Android 12 Tablet, 6GB RAM 64GB ROM, 1TB Expand, Android Tablet with 8000mAh Battery, Dual Camera, 5G WiFi, Bluetooth, FHD IPS Touch Screen, GPS, Google GMS Certified Green- difficult to set up, not intuitive, just seems like it wants to replicate your phone, portability is nice, a little heavy. Same charger as an Android phone."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Looking at the initial specs, I was excited about this device.When I got it and started trying to use it, I was disappointed.First it says 6gb of RAM and that is not true, you can enable it to use 2 GB of storage as RAM.So it really has 4GB.That should be enough, but it is so slow!!!It is either the slowest memory known to man, or the processor is just too weak.It takes 2 minutes to boot up.then you still have to wait a bit while it finishes loading things in the background.I included a video of how long it takes to launch youtube when you hit the icon and it is a 24 second clip!!!If you don't shut the device down, it runs the battery down while its sleeping, so you need to shut it down. Then it takes forever to startup again.The screen is OK.You can watch videos on it but you can tell that the quality is not there.I can't recommend this one.It really isnt usable in this day and age."
"Got this for my wife in September 2022.  By October 2023 it is a brick.For a while it would work, then reboot; soon the reboots wouldn't finish (restart after login), then it wouldn't do anything.  Now it won't even admit to having power connected.BTW, this unit does NOT have a power LED on the one and only charging port, so you can't tell if it is charging or not if the screen is off.I make this point because the Lenovo Chromebook I bought for myself after this one does have that LED and two USB-C ports, and that is useful because the primary charging port decided to not work for a couple of weeks and I could only use the secondary.  Then one day I tried powering it fully off and reconnecting to the primary, and it magically re-enabled itself.  Maybe there were some firmware updates in there, I don't know, but it was weird.  So I tried that trick on this tablet, full power off and ... well, now it won't power on at all or show the battery charge state.  Brick.  Or Frisbee if it wasn't rectangular and too heavy.  Too thin for a doorstop.  Dog chew toy?  No, bad idea, would set a precedent that could be damaging to good stuff...So for all the great engineering that Lenovo put into this thing for the sound and screen, it is betrayed by the selection of some random cheap component that only lasts a year.  I picked Lenovo because they didn't do the bloatware thing.Now the saga of trying to find a decent tablet for the wife continues.  But it sadly won't be a Lenovo.  The old planned obsolescence drill doesn't work if the time frame is too short, the mark just feels cheated.=====Update April 2024.  I'd looked on the web and found a site for Lenovo/TI that had a recovery program for Windows that would allow one to poke into the tablet and ... do stuff.  I loaded that up.  At this point the tablet had been disconnected and powered completely off for 5 months and was utterly and totally discharged.  So I gave it power and surprisingly it took it and charged the battery, unlike last October.  It then powered on and was more or less normal; it did need a slew of updates of course.  I wound up not having to use the utility program at all.  I was kicking myself for not trying this months earlier - it didn't come to life in a couple of days back then, but I don't know if it would have been a week, a month or more for it to ""forget how to be bad""."
"Have two of these and it happens to both, despite updates and verifying settings. The screen will just turn off without regard to battery life or temperature. It's just annoying. Other than that, a good tablet for what I need. I use it primarily for grad school reading and videos through canvas. Much better than using my mobile phone."
"Update:Now I've found that the refund from Amazon will take ~5 weeks: I returned the tablet on Jan 25th and I'll get my refund (supposedly) not sooner than March 3rd.Avoid this tablet, and if you decide to buy it, know that the refunds after returning these kind of products will take 5 weeks.Learn from my mistake.------------------------------Update: I ordered a second tab for office use and this tabled came stock with Android 13 already installed on it, a tablet that was amazing is now unresponsive and slow, I'll never understand why vendors decide to load updates to Android when their product was developed with another version.Avoid this tablet, at least if it has Android 13 on it, the 12 version was snappy, responsive, fast. This updated version is really bad.If you get one with Android 12, disable the automatic updates too.--------------------------I previously had a Lenovo tab M8 from about 4 or 5 years ago, it was an excellent tablet but became slower after the years, I was ready to update to a newer model with double of RAM and this M10 delivers.I use it mostly for web and some video apps and it's very responsive, the sound is better and louder than the M8.Probably the thing I like the best about this one and the M8 is that the screen is much more brighter and with richer colors than the equivalent Samsung tablets, I'm not sure which kind of screen is, I know it's not OLED,  but it's much luch better in color depth and brightness than Samsung.You won't regret buying this one, it's an amazing tablet for the money."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            To get it out of the way, if you’re getting this for taking notes, probably don’t. I’m pretty sure it’s the fault of both the stylus and the tablet, but the text does not write smooth at all.That said, overall for a $200 tablet if you want to use it for day to day generally, go for it!"
"I wasn't expecting a powerhouse, but I don't do anything super demanding so I didn't think it would be a big deal.  Some basic games, streaming, browsing.  However, this tablet still seems to struggle with most of that.  It crashes and stutters when playing solitaire, for crying or loud.  Even while writing this review it shows significant lag.  On the plus side, the battery does last for a very long time and the size is just what I wanted."
"comparable to Amazons tablets, which are less expensive than this Lenovo. screen was just ok, had some hiccups with the OS quickness, but overall a decent tablet that i choose to return. i needed something more zippy and with better screen quality. i did like the look of the OS and the screen layout and app integration."
"Ok, I'm gonna be as open and as honest with this review as I can be ...this tablet definitely has it's pros and cons.It is snappy, responsive, well built, has pretty decent sound is thin and has a somewhat decent screen.Cons are the screen is wayyy darker than it should be. Not that it's not bright but the colors are just dimmed and dark. The wi fi card in this thing is atrocious at best. I put this side by side with 3 other devices and it is consistently 30mbps or more slower on every speed test I have done. I purchased this tablet to watch prime video and Hulu while on the road for work. With Hulu on a 50mbps network the audio skips every 8 seconds and with prime video.... Thursday Night football was absolutely unwatchable. 50mbps network...kept buffering and popping up a message that said my network was "" too slow"" even when I used my phone as a 5G hotspot with full signal. My daughter's Samsung tablet speed tested the hotspot at 112mbps download and 19mbps upload speed. This tablet is useless to me and if you are looking for a multimedia streaming tablet....this isn't it at all."
"Overall, the product is not bad.  Hope not to have another review in a few months.  I have it for two months now:- The display shuts itself off with a certain frequency- The face recognition feature is not worth it.  It recognizes your face 1 of every 10 tries.- Most common APPs work fine.  If you cannot see the image of Netflix or Disney+, you have to turn off some of the display features.- This was the second unit.  The first one was sent with a lower capacity than I bought.  By reading other posts, this happened to other users as well."
"This is the first tablet I've had that had major issues during the initial setup. What you need to do is start the setup offline, then set the correct time and date. After that you will be able to connect to your WIFI without getting the ""limited connectivity"" error. From there you can continue on and update the tablet.Other than that the tablet is pretty nice for the money. Don't expect to be able to play 4k video on it though. It can barley play 1080p videos without stuttering and lagging at times. It's great for web and photo browsing though."
"I bought this to check my email while I am at work. This thing barely works for that. It scrambles things and shuts off the program for no reason. It is completely unreliable and I am so disappointed.  I have a Lenovo laptop that has been great for 14 years and that it why I chose this, but it was a huge mistake"
"The tablet looks great and works great, but I bought it because specifically said that it was 128 gig. It was not. If you scroll down and look at the details it says that it’s only 32 gig. I guess it was my fault for not double checking but it was still false advertising in the top part. I’ll be returning it…. Again!"
This tablet started out just great and just this weekend went dead!  I took it to the Geek squad and they couldn't fix it!  I called a repair shop and they want! $70.00 to diagnose and $130.00 to replace the battery!  That's more than the price I paid for it!  Amazon more or less told me I was out of luck.  Didn't want to offer any discount for a replacement!  So buyer beware!
"I purchased this tablet with the intention of using it to browse the web, social media and shopping. It’s super clunky and painfully slow. It takes forever to turn on, the battery doesn’t last and it takes forever for pages to load. Media is consistently lagging. It feels like I have reverted to the dial up era! I have google fiber and a gig, so I know it’s not my internet. I don’t have this problem with my iphone, iPad or PC. Just buy an ipad. This was a total waste of money imo."
I could only get as far as the screen telling me how to power off the tablet. Except it won't power off either. See picture. Was charged with accompanying cable and block. Tried all the online tips and tricks. So now I have a refurbished paperweight in a spiffy new case. Bought it in January.  My current tablet lasted until May. Now I can't return it. I can buy a 2024 Samsung Galaxy Tablet 9+ for the same price I paid for a non-functional refurbished Lenovo tablet as the Samsung is on sale. Lesson learned.
Purchased this tablet the end of November 2022. Right from the start I was having issues. The launcher kept locking up so I had to keep rebooting. Then the tablet started crashing continually and I had to reinstall everything four (4) times. Finally gave up and returned for a refund.I really liked this tablet at first. It had all the features I was looking for at a competitive price. The boot up time was a little long but it wasn't a big issue. I'm not sure if Lenovo tablets are going to be in my future though.
"Cannot play netflix from a browser, forces app usage. Forces login everywhere, cannot remove lenovo bloat ""sign in"" things anywhere, cannot skip initial setup notifications where it's mandatory to log in to google. Everything everything everything about this tablet is a pain. It's too slow to properly show screen transitions without lagging or skipping around. Android 13 home buttons bounce around so they are on either side instead of static the whole time, cannot remove home from basic screen. So if you remove all items from quicklaunch you still see the stupid circle there with nothing in it. The lack of control for an android device is frustrating. Heading the way of apple, want to own the hardware? you have to use it OUR way. Good for mindless folk I guess."
nice tablet but had issues with several standard apps
How is it possibly that I get the product by mail but the warranty by email never arrived
"This product was barely past the 30-day return period when the issue began. The display constantly shuts itself off. (No, it's NOT a settings issue. I set the sleep time appropriately.) This product is VERY unreliable. Don't waste your money."
If you used iPad before. This product might not meet your expectations but if you want good looking screen and Android experience PLUS very slow performance ( compared to iPad ) this is okay product
"Have used it for 4 months and makes no sound, nothing on the screen and now useless. Did all the power button stuff. My warranty ran out and they refused to help. So I replaced it with a Amazon fire 10 for 125.00!!!!!"
"First time you set it up, you get non stop notifications that it's installing junk. When you uninstall the junk apps, it will reinstall them."
Description says it 4MB/128MB.  It is actually 3MB/32MB
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Touch screen doesn’t work, I had to return it immediately"
The system is very slow and not at all worthy.
I called technical assistance 4 times. No one was able to help me. I either got caught in a loop or couldn't advance my screen. I decided to return it and buy a different tablet.
it was not compatible so I sent it back
"The update to Android 13 adds a ""helpful"" taskbar that you can't get rid of. Completely ruins things, and unless an update allows you to get rid of it, I'd avoid any tablets with Android 13, including this one. Really, really wish I hadn't updated it."
"Decent amount of storage, good build quality/design. Screen is decently vibrant/sharp. Sound quality from the speakers is really good as well. An overall good value for the money. The only con to this tablet is that the stock interface is super slow. Not a good device for multitasking, but just fine for media consumption."
"Received as a gift in September 2023. As of 2024, the device is stuck with an error message “system IU not responding”. Nothing I’ve tried will work, which includes clearing cache, software update, or system reset."
"After having several tablets, this is by far the worst I've ever had. Within 15 minutes of unboxing, I had immediate regrets of buying it. This tablet constantly closes or crashes apps. It will stall, freeze and or crash within 5 minutes of opening an app. The company website forums are loaded with the same complaints for the last two years."
"one of Samsung worse products I have ever used, it is slow, stopped working, sent it back to be repaired now it is even slower, only good thing I can say about is will take a 256 gb sd card, takes way to long to start up, sometimes it does not shut off when I power it down, even on my gigabit home wifi, it buffers bad, when all my other devices work fine. Thanx Samsung"
It's slow for doing most anything except for maybe watching Youtube.
"Liked that it was light weight, it kept getting longer and longer to charge it up. I can’t get tablet to turn back on . I wanted to delete my accounts and all info . But can’t . Still an Amazon fan . But I feel cheated. I ordered a knew Apple one thinking if I got more expensive one it would do better. It only stays charged 2 hours."
"Samsung, like a lot of the industry, assumes small tablet buyers want cheap tablets.The A7 Lite has a passable screen, mostly metal construction, good speakers, terrible fingerprint resistance, good battery life, marginal firmware updates, and passable USB-C charging.But, it's barely a Galaxy Tab.You don't get Second Screen, Bixby, Secure Folder. Samsung Internet isn't included, but is available. The default browser out of the box is Chrome. There is no first-party keyboard case. There's no video out and no Dex mode. There are no sensors for detecting whether a case is closed over the screen. You do get Call and Text From Other Devices support though, and your Galaxy Buds will seamlessly switch between the A7 Tab and your other Galaxy devices.It has been a few years since Samsung abandoned all but the low-end of the small tablet market. I think they should give it another try."
"Hardware is OK.  I personally do not like Samsung software.  I like just plain out-of-the-box android.  Also,  setup wants you to login or create a Samsung account.  I do not want a Samsung account. Again, just plain Google android."
"Update:  As of the OS update that dropped on 1/31/23, you can now move big apps that you don’t want to take up all of your internal storage to the SD card.  As I say below, this is absolutely vital for the 32GB version of this tablet.  This doesn’t change the fact that it’s generally a slower tablet than some of its similarly priced competitors, but the 32GB version of the tablet is no longer a hundred dollar paperweight if you need more than two or three apps.  I’d up the star rating a bit if the tablet wasn’t more expensive now than it was over the holidays.Original review below:This would be.a decent (if slow) entry level Android tablet but for the fact that Samsung’s update to Android 12 broke the ability to move apps to the SD card.  Since a lot of the 32GB is used up by the preinstalled software, this means you have very little room for adding apps.  You can still store media (movies, music, etc,) on the SD card, but you will still run out of space for apps almost immediately after getting the tablet.Avoid buying this tablet in the 32GB version until Samsung fixes this bug - if they ever do.The screen quality is not very good.  I’m not talking about the resolution (It’s low, but you can look at the resolution in the product description so it’s not a surprise), but I’ve noticed uneven backlighting near the screen edges (which can be annoying watching movies or using dark mode in dark environments) on several samples of this Samsung tablet.  I haven’t seen these issues on competitor tablets even at the same price point, so this appears to be a Samsung thing.Sound quality from the two built-in speakers isn’t very good either - even with the supposed Dolby Atmos features enabled - but is okay for basic media watching.The tablet is pretty sluggish - probably partly from limited RAM (3 GB in the 32GB storage version) and partly a sluggish processor.  Don’t expect to be running newer games at full speed on this tablet, though older and less demanding games should be okay.Even the non-cellular versions of this tablet have a GPS which works pretty well, so you can use this tablet for offline mapping with various offline maps apps from the play store.  Came in handy for a recent Nevada trip."
"For a newer model tablet, I was expecting better performance. I understand for the price, I wasn't going to get a top-of-the-line model, but I didn't expect it to be so laggy.  When opening chrome, it takes a few seconds to open.  When actually going to web pages, it can spin a couple of seconds before actually pulling up the page. Sometimes the screen isn't very responsive.  You have to hit an icon a couple of times before it opens and, even then, it takes time.  The navigation buttons are also in an awkward place.  It's either the left or right side of the screen, not the middle, like most tablets.  This makes it easy to accidentally hit a button when holding it at the bottom corner, which is where I always hold it.  There is no option to move them to the middle.  Screen rotation is also laggy.  Playing a game (Township) is very laggy and this isn't even a very resource intensive game.  I can't load any other game (SimCity, Monopoly, etc.) as it would be essentially unplayable.This tablet was purchased to replace my 2015 iPad mini 4 which can no longer hold a charge.  The iPad, even though it's 8 years old in physical age and 6 years older than the Samsung (2021 model), still runs circles around it.  In retrospect, I should've just stuck with my gut and spent a little more and went with the new iPad mini.  I will probably give this to one of the kids in the house and just suck it up and buy an Apple.  It's a shame as I really wanted to stick with Android, but I'm very disappointed in Samsung's entry.  It's difficult to find a decent performing tablet in 8-9"" formfactor which, to me, is the perfect size for reading, surfing, and holding for long periods.Main Uses: Light Gaming (Township), Web Surfing, Checking EmailPros:+ Screen size+ Screen Brightness+ Battery LifeCons:- Very laggy- Gaming performance subpar.- Wireless performance very slow. Only about half the speed of similar devices in my home."
"The tablet is just fine. But the setup procedure is so frustrating that I almost sent it back. The problem is that after you go through the setup steps that you encounter when you first turn the device on--and the device tells you that you are all set--they download update after update in the background. If you try to download the app for which you bought the tablet--say, Kindle--the device just appears to hang. The same if you try to download a book to your Kindle. If you pull down the notifications panel you get a hint about what's going on, but nothing to suggest that the process is going to bring your device to its knees. It is this sneaky kind of bandwidth theft that I waists my time trying to figure out that really frustrates me. If they had just said, ""Look, we have to download a bunch of updates. It will take about an hour. So just set the device aside and do something else until we finish,"" I would have been perfectly satisfied. It is the way they mislead you that is unacceptable. It's also unnecessary. Stupid!Now, having struggled with this tablet for six months, I think I'm going to junk it. I use it mostly to read Kindle books and magazines. I turn it off when I'm not reading so I won't have to charge it so often, in the hope that I can extend the battery's life. Samsung updates their interface software quite frequently, so when I turn the tablet on, I frequently have to wait as much as five minutes before I can use it. Even when I can get an app like Kindle to open, it abruptly shuts down. I'm reasonably sure this is because processor cycles are being used to continue the the latest update, even thought the developers want you to think all is ready to go. This kind of thing wasn't a problem with earlier tablets, but Samsung has apparently decided to add a lot of glitz to their interface at the expense of functionality. Too much glitz for what this relatively inexpensive tablet can handle. Android, like Windows, has gotten way to heavy for whatever value the developers think they are adding."
"When I got it in 2022, I loved many things about this tablet. It wasn't fast, but it did the job. And has a great screen and I like the compact size.Fast forward to Android 14 in 2024, and this tablet quite regularly slows down so much it becomes downright unusable. I have tried everything - cache clearing, installing from scratch again... still the same performance issues.As of 2024, I can no longer recommend this tablet. An Amazon Fire 8 HD is cheaper and faster."
"Been using the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite for a bit now. It's a mixed bag for me. The 8.7"" display is a nice size for portability, and 32GB storage is okay to start, but you'll need an SD card for more space.Display's alright for the price, good for casual browsing and watching videos. Battery life's decent, gets me through most of the day. It's lightweight, which is great for travel.However, it struggles with more demanding apps and multitasks, which can be frustrating. Build quality's fine but feels a bit cheap. The speakers are another letdown, just not great quality sound.For those on a budget, it's an okay option for basic tasks and streaming. But if you're expecting high performance or great audio, it might disappoint."
"I mean. How much quality can we really expect from a tablet for this price? I've had mine for about 2 months now, and I immediately removed all non essential apps/games to conserve space and hopefully extend the speed's life, but to no avail. I literally bought this to play ONE specific game on,  and that's really all that's on the tablet at this point. But only 2 months out and it's already extremely laggy, terrible battery life (only about 2 hours of use from full), and painstakingly slow. In hindsight, I'd have been better off just shelling out the extra money for a decent tablet, considering how bad it is within only a couple months I'm sure it's not going to be usable for much longer, so I didn't actually save myself money by going with this ""affordable alternative"". Even fresh out of the box, it was noticeably slower than my 8 year old, has been dropped and struggles if I have more than a few tabs open laptop. So even brand new, it's not a fast or quality device. In short, I got what I paid for, and next time around I know it's not worth it. I'll update when it eventually becomes unusable, to give people a time line."
"I'm a huge Samsung fan, but this product was a huge disappointment. I was looking to upgrade my Samsung Tab S2, which has a 4:3 ratio screen and a sharp AMOLED display, with the A7.  Here are the issues:1. Screen. The screen is a dull, lifeless, non-sharp TFT display like you used to find in laptops.  The screen looks nothing like what you see on the website or on phones such as the S21.  The 16:9 ratio screen only provides for a 6x5 icon layout, which is not even as good as the Tab S2.  That means a lot of wasted space.  I also fail to see the value of the long narrow screen for anything but movies.  It is not good as a book reader.2.  Weight. The tablet feels bulky and heavy.3. No Samsung email app.  For some reason, the Samsung email app is not only not included, but is also not compatible with this device (and notwithstanding that it has been on prior tablets like the Tab S2 and on phones such as the S9 and S21).  This by itself made the device unaccpeable.  The Samsung email app easily interfaced with Exchange servers and other email providers such as Verizon.  Syncing Exchange contact and calendar folders via the Samsung email app meant that the native Android Contacts and Calenadar apps would be immediately populated with data.  No replacement email app will do that.I don't know the target audience for this product, but it is certainly not anyone looking for a high-performance small tablet with a great screen."
It’s a great tablet and all but as I took it out the box and power it on I saw those screen burn and a small dent below the power down button other than that everything work great but I just wish the screen was in a better condition
"By the time you get through all the update installations (which was also a lengthy process) the tablet is so slow to respond and apps time out. Using it is painful. Have factory reset more than once and it gets slower with each update. Also does not have all of the same app availability as iOS so I couldn’t even use it for what I had intended to use it for. Told myself I’d find a use for it, should have just returned it."
"I honestly have no idea how this got such a high review score.  It's laggy and slow as heck.  I had to search and disable a bunch of settings just to get it to stop lagging when opening its own settings page.I got this to try to play roblox incremental games and other non-graphically intensive games while at work instead of using my old phone and on low settings, fancy.  My 3 year old phone runs things much better than this.  But it makes sense in hindsight, this tablet was released 2 years ago and using a low-end processor from 2018.  I should have looked around on the internet instead of taking amazon user reviews at face value.  Lag and speed issues have been posted all over dating back to the day this thing released.It has a TFT touch screen that's low-res and extremely dated.  Touch responsiveness is poor with me having to touch multiple times to get something to register even without a screen protector.Don't bother trying to use this beyond anything more than a basic email/internet browser and E-book reader.  It probably lags with higher res videos.  I'm debating if it's worth the hassle trying to return after already getting a nice case and applying a pricey liquid screen protector to it."
"I bought this tablet after returning my Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet because you couldn't save Kindle or Audible books to the SD Card.  I figured that I wouldn't have that problem with the Samsung.  Was I ever wrong!  I put the SD Card in and the tablet wouldn't recognize it.  So I brought the tablet to my favorite computer store and the technician was able to get the tablet to recognize the SD Card, for $25.00.  All was good.  I started to download my Audible and Kindle books and that evening I checked the memory in settings and NO SD Card was shown.  I took the card out and installed another one with the same result.  I then put the original card back in with no luck.  I then took the card out, reset the tablet to the original setting and took it to Whole Foods to return it.  How hard can it be to have the tablet recognize an SD Card?  Especially a Samsung.  I just bought a third tablet.  Hopefully the third time is the charm!"
"if you like waiting for response, like you have other stuff to do while it boots up and even loading an app. this is the device for you. can't believe anything built in the last couple of years could run this slow. for me its a glorified radio running Bluetooth in my car, for music and youtube. it's ok."
"I was hoping for something a step (however small) above my Kindle tablet, but this was very disappointing. Extremely slow. Takes FOREVER to boot up, and opening apps is very slow, especially Kindle.  I know its not the most expensive tablet, but I expected better than this."
"Software a little slow, color is nice. Screen size decent for toddlers don't mind it."
This tablet is strictly for my kids (toddlers) to watch and play learn games. It can slow and slow to respond but dont need speed since it only for learning apps and youtube kids.
"Likes: build quality, screen clarity, thin profile, touchscreen responsivenessDislikes: Very, very slow!!!!  Playing games is an exercise in patience, while playing videos is nearly impossible.This may be workable as a e-book reader or for some very basic tasks, but it simply cannot handle modern apps and video formats/resolutions."
"I own several Fire Tablets, both 10 inch and 8 inch. So my comments below are all in comparison to those. I felt I had to get a non-Fire tablet to use android apps not available for the Fire (in my case we travel a lot and most airline and cruise ship apps are not available for the Fire. I know there are Google work arounds which I did not want to do.-Even in a case, the Samsung table screen must be manually turned on each time you want to use it, unlike the Fires whose case turns the screen on and off when flipped open and shut.-Battery life is very low compared to that of the Fires.-Some apps, like the DuoLingo which I use a lot, work wonderfully well on the Fires, just as on my PC. However, on the Samsung tablet they do not work correctly all the time, and in fact force the user into additional purchases unless he pays money or ""lose all the work done so far""-One nice thing about the Samsung tablet is at least the case I had fit and functioned properly. The case for my Fire HD 8 (not the HD10) is """"reversed"". Hard to describe - look up reviews on the HD8 for details."
"After working with at least three Samsung ""technical agents"", I was told that the SD card is a ""known issue"" and there was nothing that could be done about it at this time. I evaluated the use of this product without the use of the SD card and decided that it was useless.  Since the best they could do was offer me a higher priced product that would do what this was supposed to do, I decided that getting rid of it was my best option.  Frankly, the limitations created by not being able to use the SD card make this product pretty worthless, and the Amazon Kindle will work much better for much less money. So, I dumped this tab on the last day.  I will be looking at either the iPad Mini if I can get by with my one drive or the Surface pro from Microsoft if I need the SD. I would stay with Kindle, but the software limitations are super irritating and ridiculous.  Samsung really let me down on this one.This product was working well for me, and I was in the store by programs onto my SD card. Then android came along with an update and suddenly nothing worked. All of the programs that I put on my SD card became nonfunctional and I had to reinstall them. Further, I was no longer able to store any programs or memory from programs onto the SD card. That means, the SD card is useless to me. I contacted Samsung and talked to them and they have confirmed there is no update for this and the only thing I can do is take my tablet in and have the old software put back on it. That solves nothing as any time there’s an upgrade I don’t get the benefit of the upgrade and if I do I lose the ability of the SD card. So why provide a tablet with an SD card up to a terabyte if I can’t use it? Samsung tells me they’re aware of the problem but they’re not able to tell me of any plans to fix it.Of course, you can buy one of the more expensive tablets and you won’t be affected by this issue."
"Got this being it was cheaperthan others. Haven't had it for a year quite yet, and will likely need to replace. It is extremely slow. Slow loading apps, and slow response time while tapping/swiping the screen. Now, apps can't be run at all. They open, but nothing happens. The screen freezes while sound continues. Can't turn it off or reset during that time either. I've updated all apps, cleared caches, restarted tablet, freed memory, and nothing helps. Sometimes I get a UI not responding message. I've tried troubleshooting that as well. Too bad I didn't spend the extra $50-100 on a better tablet last year as the money spent on this was a total waste."
"I wanted an 8"" tablet that would mostly be used for reading, but I wanted to read articles and web pages as well as ebooks. I liked my old Galaxy Note 8 tablet and hoped this would be a replacement. However, it's loaded with junk apps, many of which can't be removed, and has a truly obnoxious lag between input and response. It's pretty much okay once I have something open, but the slowness definitely reduces the usefulness of the tablet.Guess I'm done with Samsung now. I'll opt for a company that ships a cleaner UI next time."
"5 months I've had this. It's the wl0orst I've had the misfortune of using. For no reason at all if I restart it, it goes to boot loader. I then factory reset it just to have it go to bootloader again. Then I have to safe mode it. What idiot decided I have to go through all the new device setup just to factory reset it again. Didn't like Samsung before this but now truly hate and loathe it with a passion!"
This has been a nice tablet to travel with or just to have in the kitchen for recipes. The battery was good for almost a year and a half but now it will not hold a charge for five days. This tablet has not had heavy use. I love Samsung products  as a whole but this has been a let down.
"ok , got slow after a year. Had to factory reset"
Overall product falls under average quality ofthe class and style that Samsung has been  manufacturing for decades as the Android and name brand I have been very successful with having my devices networking and feeling confident in the quality of the construction and the Warranty.
Purchased this for my 8 year old niece. Definitely recommend getting a case for this. The battery and storage space make this disappointing even with a micro SD card for more space.This would be ok for reading and light web browsing.
"So I really was looking for a ""small tablet"" so it's easier to handle for primarily texting and checking email with light gaming with non graphic intensive gaming.This tablet can not even handle basic day to day tasks.  Even swiping between different screens was glitchy and not smooth at all. It was an eye sore to be honest with you.  Opening apps gave me the feeling of sitting in traffic. IT JUST TOOK FOREVER!. Also the touch screen I would have to tap 2 or 3 times before it would even register my tap.This is al because the processor in this tablet (MediaTek Helio P22) IS TRASH and extremely slow.  I returned this tablet after 3 days and just bought a Galaxy Tab S7 fe... I researched the different processors and the one in the S7 fe is 5 times as faster.It sad bcuz I really wanted a smaller tablet but it was not worth the ""sitting and traffic"" feeling it gave me.  When I tap something I want it to open ASAP.  Not tap and then I watch TV for a little bit until the app opens.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME on this tablet. You will regret it the 2nd you try and open the text messaging app."
It works but it's really slow
"This is a brand new tablet.  Only had one day, set up unit and added a 32 gig MSD card for additonal storage. Prior to inserting MSD card, it updated to Android 12. Attempted to set MSD card as primary storeage location for pictures and a few other file formats.  Warning said destination is full. The card had been formated on the tablet and was empty. Tested card in other android devices, workded fine.  Testes other cards in the tablet, same results. After research, found several complaints regarding the same issue. Contacted Samsung, no help there. Day 2, I returned the tablet and purchased the 64 gig model as it will hold all I need to hold. Nice tablet, plenty of speed for everyday use but I wouldn't rely on the MSD card."
"It's a good, reliable tablet and it works as it should.  HOWEVER, it is laggy and slow to load apps or switch between them.  Seems to be the Android 13 update that killed it.  I regret purchasing it now.  Kindle 8 is faster than this thing, and if you can stomach Amazon's proprietary OS and being locked into their items (without jailbreaking), then go for that one instead."
"Interacting with this tablet is so laggy, I guess for the price it make sense. I would recommend spend the money and get something better."
"""Also packs more expandable storage than before — up to 1TB, almost 2x as much as the previous model"" - NOT true. While I have been mostly happy with my Tab A7 Lite, as a replacement for Kindle Fire because of all the apps available through Google Play Store, I had depended on the additional storage to supplement the meager 32Gb it comes with. It kinda worked under Android 11, but now under 13 - NOT AT ALL."
"I've had many Galaxy phones and watches,  and decided to add this tablet. First of all the SD card slot was defective and I lost a good SD card to it. I received a replacement and the SD slot worked properly on it.My issue is that it seems really cheap. I was using a 6yo LG tablet that operated much faster than this.  It is very slow and frequently freezes up.It didn't even come with Samsung apps!  It came with Chrome,  and I added Samsung Internet,  but the Samsung Music app is NOT compatible with this tablet! This is what I used my LG tablet for, and this tablet has no integral music app, which is incredibly frustrating.I'm going to have to ditch this thing and try to get my old LG back."
"This device is more trouble than it's worth. It's slow, takes forever to charge, and frèzes. Plus, you have to tap on a link multiple times before connecting."
"Take for ever to boot up.  When in sleep mode and you press the side button to wake it up, it takes forever for the screen to adjust to portrait or landscape.  The thing is just slow.  I should have spent the extra money for the higher model."
"I bought this to replace my 2019 Tab A 8.0 since it is a bit slow. However, this model is very slow as well. In fact, I couldn't notice much difference between this model and my old one as far as speed is concerned. I have yet to add apps to it, and yet it is this slow. Another thing I noticed was the battery life. With only the native apps and barely running anything on the tablet, the battery goes down quickly, and that was a big surprise to me. I will be returning it for sure since there is not much difference between the 2019 Tab A 8.0 model."
"The tablet was only 6 months old, and got the weird mark in the screen. See picture. The tablet is used lightly and in a case that completely covered everything including the screen. The support said the warranty will not cover it so I would have to pay to have it fixed. Gave it some stars because it does work the way inexpected, but low stars for Samsung support."
"This little tablet is decent for the price but that's the thing, it's not very good but for $120 you can't expect much.What I like about it+ Metal frame just feels good+Screen size is just right not too big or too small+Has the widevine L1 necessary to play Netflix in HD+Battery life is pretty goodWhat I don't like- laggy , this is a big problem, all apps seem slow and laggy- screen not very responsive, I am not using a screen protector hoping to increase responsiveness- the screen can get very bright yet colors look washed and not vivid at all-camera is joke-storage is 32gb and you can't put apps on SD card although that's pretty much expectedOverall this is a decent tablet, it's neither fast nor responsive and display is just OKish but for $120 this is all you will get."
"I didn't think ""Lite"" meant slow, unresponsive, and 480p. Websites & apps load for an obnoxious amount of time or simply crash when bothered. Constant glitches in YouTube and other streaming apps. If you thought Disney+ was slow on the PS4, oh boy. The quality is so cheap compared to Samsung phones, which I LOVE. I see why all my coworkers have iPads.Now my real complaint is that I got this for light entertainment, sure. But mostly for work. I use Square for my business and this was supposed to make my life easier and safer because I wouldn't keep handing strangers my phone and I could keep my personal files/accounts and work files/accounts separate and on different devices. Unfortunately, this thing is so slow that I feel it's costing me money. It takes 5+ minutes to check out my clients when my phone took about 45 seconds. That's time I need to clear & disinfect my station before my next client. That's a whole military fade. That's a crying break in the bathroom after a 6+ hour color correction. I guess I just didn't expect a Samsung product to fall under ""you get what you pay for"". Unless none of these things bother you, just get the regular tab."
"Very nice small tablet. Very good performance even though it seems to run a little slow. At times it seems to not know exactly how to function. Good for not important functions.. . . .just adding an update. If allowed to sit unused for more than 24 hours, it takes about another 5 minutes to optimize (not sure what's being optimized, but you're stuck waiting until it decides it's ready to run again. Just not the best for any serious use."
"Tablet is slow and unresponsive. And for a new device, the battery life is awful.  The battery life is especially awful when left fully charged with the screen off. The quality of this device is not comparable to the Samsung phones that I have owned. I had previously purchased a Kindle fire, but sent it back because I couldn’t install an app from the play store that I needed for Class. But this device I had full access to the play store, but the tablet was three times slower than that of the Kindle fire."
"I have had this for a while now after my old galaxy was jut too old. I expected this to be a step up but it isn't. My biggest gripe it the overall speed. It's slow and sluggish in everything it does, and that's everything. The internet is absolutely terrible. I get just  over half of what my speed should be and never max speed while my phone get full speed. While moving about the internet it again is slow, sluggish and not the best experience. It wasn't that expensive when I bought this and this is 100% proof you get what you pay for. While updating the device you may as well walk away from it and make lunch because it is that slow. Bad purchase and it has me second guessing Samsung overall if I ever decide to buy another tablet."
"I purchased the ""SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB"" in April 2023.  My goal was to install just one app (Spotify) and make the tablet available to to rental guests to at a vacation rental property.  I wanted a tablet which was not expensive, to discourage theft.From the very first moment that I turned it on I noticed that the performance was very poor. I should have returned it immediately but because I'm an IT specialist I thought that I could keep it and remove the bloatware to fix the performance problems.  Also, that trusted that a flagship manufacturer like Samsung would not be selling garbage.  Unfortunately no about of software adjustments can fix the bad performance problems which are caused by the old CPU hardware.  Note, the non-""LIte"" version of this tablet, the ""Samsung Galaxy Tab A7"", is still recommended by authoritative reviewers such as ""Toms Guide"" - it's probably a good machine.My recommendation - don't buy this ""A7 Lite"" tablet.  It should be a crime to sell something that's so slow that it is basically defective on purchase.  Samsung should be ashamed."
"Bought this to play an alt account for a mobile game. After trying a couple cheap grey market knock offs,  I t thought this would work. It's SAMSUNG  after all.Well, it was just a little better than the knock offs. Feels more solid though, and obviously better built. It just does not have the processing power for some reason. I don't know why.I reset it, and put back in its box, and there it sits until I can find something useful to do with it."
"It works mostly like  you would expect, but if you put it to sleep and come back to it a few days later, it loses about 10% / day.  I've already done all the battery saving setting recommendations I can find on the internet.  I must say this is very disappointing."
Bought the tab lite and let me tell you for being a Samsung it's the slowest tablet I've ever owned. You would think this was a $50 dollar tablet the way it works. Spend the extra 50 or 100 bucks and get a better tablet
The screen gets smudged and dirty very easily. The graphics are fuzzy and brightness comes on and off but most of the time the screen is very dark. Very disappointing. For a Samsung product.
"Needed a bigger screen and its android, so I purchased it to fly my DJI drone, but often lags and even freezes for a second or two. SSD is big enough for what I needed. Screen resolution, brightness and color are good, but 3G ram is just not enough. Doesn't edit photos or video downloaded from drone well either. My Samsung S22U edits great, and never lags, but it has 8G ram. If you just want to use it for social media and watching Hulu, Amazon or Netflix, it is really good. You get what you pay for."
"I bought this to replace my 5+ year old Samsung T350. It still worked but the older Android version wouldn't support new apps.  Alas, another electronic device in the junkyard.  Why can't Samsung and Google allow more updates to the Android OS?Anyway, I'm disappointed with this purchase because the tablet isn't any faster than my old device and still has the same memory management problem when adding a microSD.  I would think that several years later, Samsung would make a better product."
"Start with the immediate, if I had it to do over? No I would not buy this product.I use this daily for drives with my little one and she watches videos all the time. THIS (deep breath to be polite here) product (whew I got through that) HAS THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME CONNECTING TO MY HOTSPOT!I have done everything I can to adjust settings and I still waste 5-10 minutes between turning it on and connecting this EVERY.SINGLE.DAY. I have gotten to hate this thing!It is SLOW to boot!! With the help of YouTube I have found settings to improve things once it boots up but patience is required and a lot of deep breath’s to initiate the drive.I do not recommend this, yes even at the price, I’d rather a 10 year old iPad than this!"
"When you buy this tablet it is a 32G tablet running Android 11 which lets you move apps to the SD card to make up for it's small storage.After you set it up, it will upgrade to Android 12 which DOES NOT SUPPORT MOVING APPS TO THE SD CARD!  This means that your tablet will be very undersized (storage wise).  Now days it takes from 64Mb to 128Mb to have a usable Android device.  So this tablet becomes very limited and obsolete  in how you can use it right after it is set up."
"My 10 year old kindle died on me finally and so I sought an android tablet as a replacement. I was being cheap and so I was looking primarily for a lower price range with a reputable name. This tablet is the biggest purchase disappointment I've made in a very long time. It's so slow. Just surfing regular websites is a headache, I'm from the AOL days and I can't remember the last time I had to wait so long for simple web pages to load. I Literally sit and watch pages and images on websites load. Same is true for  apps. Amazon pages tak3 forever to load in the Amazon app. My Evernote notes have actually been lost because the note will lag so badly while I'm typing it that it can't catch up and save what I've typed fast enough. And yes, I have the latest Android version installed and the device is updated. Just painfully slow. Inexcusable in 2022."
"Our family have used Samsung phones back with the S3. Now all our appliances, TVs, phones, and tablets have been Samsung and have been pleased with the products.  Maybe this is a covid baby tablet but it's a piece of junk.  It takes a good 2-3 minutes just to turn on, then when you think it's loaded it will go through One UI optimizing apps. Every app takes a good 20-40 seconds to load and the lag is worse than when dial up was around.  I purchased the Lenovo M9 with same specs in reguard to memory and it far surpassed Samsung for about the same price point. The Lenovo fully loaded in about 30 secs. When loading a basic word game app, Lenovo fully loaded under 10 secs. Samsung 32 secs. Samsung's constant lag often freezes.  It's just flat out horrible.  Walmart's ONN tablet was twice as fast as Samsung and out performed it as well. The battery life is horrible. Same about of time doing same task, Lenovo was at 98% where Samsung was at 88%. The screen is also finicky responding making everything flat out aggravating. Samsung should be ashamed but I bet they are laughing all the way to the bank."
"I bought this tablet so that I could use it for work, it was working fine for awhile but now it's super slow and it freezes and I've only had it for around 2 months and then it keeps giving me system updates then once it updates it becomes even slower"
"Purchased the tablet primarily to watch movies or play games while traveling or flying. My first impression upon getting it turned on, set up, and logged into all of my apps is that this tablet is so slow. I gave it awhile make sure all software updates were installed and there was zero improvement. I wasn't expecting $600 worth of performance from a $125 tablet but this thing is so painfully slow to respond to taps, keystrokes, opening and running apps, etc. that I am choosing to return it."
"Very frustrated. I bought this device and find it is completely useless. Not interested in using it to play games. Specifically I use Wear OS and InfoWear to connect my smart watches. I use this software to monitor heart rate while exercising, steps walked, etc. and it is required to tap into that functionality. While I think Wear OS is garbage (lack of functionality), it great to install watch faces but that is as far as it goes. Fossil watches require Wear OS, so probably don't buy a fossil watch. When I bought my Fossil Gen 3 watch this was okay but these days smart watches provide more functionality and Google just has not kept up. InfoWear seams really good as it tracks everything I need it to. Watch face select is terrible, but third party apps like Facer fix that. Nope this device is not compatible. Apparently it is not compatible with Samsung's Smart Watch app either. So far I have tried five apps and none of them function. Either they install and won't run, or the Google store says they are not compatible. What use is a device that is not compatible with any apps? Complete waste of money. I will certainly never buy or recommend a Samsung product."
Every time it dies when I charge it and it turns on it shows this takes about 20 min to completely load then it shows another loading screen which takes about another 15 min 🤦🏼‍♀️! I have a child with severe autism who needs his tablet especially on long drives just for this to always happen! As long as YouTube works I’m good and he is good!
"S-Pen does not work on this.  I was not aware of this important feature (to me) when I purchased it, wish I could return it for this fact alone.  I don't like the large capacitance stylus pens, might as well use your finger.  I found an active stylus pen that sort of works, but it has a very hard tip and is very unresponsive, like using a ball point pen on paper that is nearly out of ink."
"This runs great if you don’t link a Google account and disable everything Google. Otherwise, Google slows the tablet down. Makes it clunky.Also, it’s older now, so the most recent version of android won’t run on it. Which in turn, doesn’t allow you to install all apps.However, this runs great if you’re just using it for websites and streaming videos. Don’t keep multiple things open at once or it will bog down."
Item looks great but didn't have anything to charge it with.
"So far it's been a great tablet and I'm happy with it, except for the RAM size. For those wondering, the RAM size is 3gb and nowhere on the listing is that mentioned. To say I wasn't a little mad and disappointed would be untrue.Over it's good but the RAM size is just more to be desired."
Had it plugged in for 24 hours since I received it. Screen still shows charge at 85%.
"Compared to ipad, this is slow and dim. It gets the job done, and if you've never used an ipad, you'll be disappointed."
"I purchased this to view my drone camera while in flight. Outside, the screen is nearly impossible to view, inside the screen is fine. I manually turned the screen to full brightness... not good enough for my purpose. The second problem, this tablet is slower than molasses... slower than my cell phone, slower than my Kendal. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
"So many things I don't like:. Touch screen works intermittently. Keyboard does not provide consistent audible feedback when typing.  Buttons do not make a click noise when pushed.  Lock screen disappears in a couple seconds, not enough time to swipe to get to home page.  Samsung needs to bring back the mechanical home button!!  Annoying product, returning for refund"
"Maybe I’m just accustomed to my iPhone, but one of the main reasons I ordered this tablet was to watch movies, and this tablet just doesn’t cut it. The picture quality isn’t nearly as good as the one on my phone. It was hard to maneuver around on it. Again maybe I’m just a custom to Apple, but I disliked this tablet so badly that I sent it back for a refund. The one good thing that I can say about it…the  battery life was exceptionally good."
"I was shocked to find out that this tablet has absolutely NO capability of output to TV or monitors. I was all set with my USB-C to HDMI adapter and Bluetooth keyboard just to realize it was a no go. It doesn't even have Screen Mirroring or Smart View. Literally no way to get the display on a bigger screen. Which is crazy because even the bottom of the barrel tablet I used for college in 2013 had the capability of throwing the display onto my monitor. I hadn't even considered that this highly rated tablet wasn't going to have this standard feature.Other than that, I did like it okay. I suggest getting the one with more memory or a micro SD considering a good chunk is taken up by system applications that cannot be removed. The battery life seemed good and it was easy to use. However, useless to me without being able to display on TV/monitor. Returned only a couple days after receiving it."
Battery does not hold charge long enough...
I didn't realize I was getting the lite version of the a7 and wish I would have done a little more homework. I'm finding that just even turning up the speed of a YouTube video this thing can't handle and drops frames left and right and it looks very choppy. For the money I would not buy this again.
"I wanted a lean tablet just for streaming shows and movies but this tablet is just too slow, it's video quality leaves a lot to be desired and it weighs more than I expected.  I wish I had spent a little more and bought a different brand."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The only thing we use this tablet for is so my toddler can watch Bluey for 1-2 hours a day. No other apps are on it besides Disney plus and the ones that came on it and there are no pictures or videos taking up space. Yet after 2 months it started acting even slower than it did when we got it (didn’t think that was possible) and now after 4 months I have to turn it off and on at least 2 - 6 times every time I try to turn it on because it freezes. I have had phones that last 3 years being used all day every day filled with pictures, videos, and apps before they start to act a little slower. This tablet is a piece of crap do not get it!"
"I used it twice with my DJI drone, out it up for 4 months, and it never turned on again. It was stored inside case with power off in air condition home. I tried all troublshooting steps and nothing."
"Many apps can not be moved from the internal storage to the microSSD.  The few that can be migrated are moved back to the internal storage when they are patched.  After patching they may or may not be able to be moved back to the external microSSD.To many Samsung Apps ""require"" ""permission"" to stupid things.  i.e. ""Galazy Store"" requires access to your phone to operate, WHY?  Ok, there isn't a phone in this device. You can't turn this feature off."
Somtimes when you do a blind buy you win. Not this one!I compare this with my Samsung S 10. My S 10 is way better. This one is low res tablet. I bought this one simply for X box  Ultimate Game Pass. The game Lag so much. This device cant keep up. I even did some mobile games on it. It can only use the minimum graphics setting (It wont let me do high res. it said this device is not supported)Because of its low res. I did not enjoy playing My movies and games on it. it said it release 2021 but seem 2001. Others might enjoy this. But now me. Ill be returning mine. Ill stick with my S10 for a while.
"This tablet is decent once it starts but it takes so long to boot up. Every time I shut it down and turn it back on, it goes through the update process again (even though it hasn't updated). It takes at least three minutes to get to the main screen. Once I'm in it's so slow - forget about running multiple apps at the same time.  Or even multiple tabs on a browser - it just can't handle it. Had to return.  The screen is nice but I just can't stand the lag.  Battery life isn't great either.  Very disappointing product from Samsung"
I love the look and how it protects the phone.  But tge front cracked easily at first drop along the bottom .  Bought a second one and same thing happened about the same location.  Center area above charging hole.
To be honest this product shouldn't have the Samsung brand on it.It supposed to be a product for Internet navigation and watching YouTube channelThe quality of the display it's really badYouTube videos and web look bad quality and also slow... Not find nothing good except the good looking exteriorAt least should be HD screen quality for be a useful device next time will go for the Lenovo P11 a little more money but worth it. I feel scammed
Very slow and cheap but dose basic stuff I bought it to emulate n64 games was not good for that
"This is my fourth Samsung tablet, and it will be my last. My oldest model from back in 2016 - out performs this latest version by leaps and bounds.Slow and sluggish is giving this thing too much credit. Can't watch anything without it buffering every 4 seconds. Tap the screen, and wait for the thing to respond. Total junk!Samsung took a great tablet platform and trashed it. It's hard to believe they actually released such a terrible product considering their previous models were so much better than this POS.Surf the web and read about the issues this model has before you make the mistake of buying such a non-responsive device."
"Was used to the Samsung 9.1 Tab E. Thought I'd save some money replacing the Tab E with this, but it was too small to operate and see for my uses."
"This was a great tablet. I bought it 14 months ago.  Now two months after the manufacturer's warranty ran out the tablet died.  These things, like most crap from China, are designed to die after the warranty expires."
"I did buy it ""used"" from Amazon. At first, it was OK, but after a few weeks, it started to slow down. Searching Google or viewing web pages is very slow. Much slower than it should be. I have owned Tablets in the past and this one is not very much fun to use."
"We bought this tablet for my 8 year old son to use as a gaming tablet, reading and watching videos. This was 11/26/2021 and was a Christmas present. It wasn’t used until 12/26/21. On 1/30/2023 (Just over one year later) after the most recent update, the tablet is now completely bricked. It won’t turn on and won’t indicate a charge. We’ve gone through all troubleshooting with Samsung. Since it’s out of the 1 year warranty period it will cost us $180 to fix per the Samsung tech. Nothing I can do about it other than write this review and hope you steer clear of Samsung altogether. We are a household full of Samsung tech including TV, Refrigerator, watch and 4 tablets. You should also note, Samsung began making it impossible to put anything other than media (videos/photos) on the external memory (SD Card). This makes the internal memory fill up with the apps/games and you can’t put them on the SD card to free up space. Altogether a miserable experience with this tablet. Do yourself a favor and move on."
The touch screen on this tablet doesn't work very well. For that reason I had to return.
I have amazing wifi I only downloaded a couple of apps I was trying watch twitch you can hear sound but it's a black screen video don't move same thing with YouTube and I was using my 5g WiFi sorry I'm sending back
Can I use a sim card in this? I have no idea how to insert it.
My first experience with tablets.The only issue I have is holding the tablet. The edges are touch-sensitive & I have big fingers.So much to learn/leverage!
"I see this tablet getting good reviews and I understand for this price it could be a lot worse, but this thing is weak. My battery is constantly dead. If I don't use my tablet for a day it dies. I turn on low power mode and close all my apps and it still dies. I don't get it. It connects and stays connected to my WiFi fairly well. I bought it to do more, but I now just use it to watch streaming services while I cook. And it does do that really well. It's slow to open my apps, but once I'm in I do get to enjoy them and for that I'm thankful. If I could go back in time I wouldn't have bought this tablet."
"The display is nice but the unit rakes a long time to boot up, and the touch screen is quirky. I use it only for streaming. Once there it's ok. But navigating from app to app. is really difficult"
"We purchased and download movies from Playstore and also from Prime Video to watch while traveling on vacation in April and again in May.  For the Playstore movies we received the error of ""Couldn't Fetch License"".  That was on two separate movies.  We then tried Prime Video and received and error on two other movies.  So disappointed."
"This is my first android device, and it leaves me with a glaring question: are all budget android devices almost unusably slow? I didn't expect much for the low price that I paid, but I did expect to be able to navigate around the tablet without five or more full seconds of lag before a swipe translated into some movement or navigation on the screen. It's more of a $15 experience not a $100 experience. It's so slow that activity frustrating to attempt to use for literally any purpose. I can't believe someone at samsung tested this out and thought it would be acceptable to sell it."
"The videos are always blurry. To be honest, I expected more from an established name like Samsung. I will definitely not be purchasing any more of their products ☹️"
"The tablet is horribly unresponsive - and that's without a screen protector. It has been since day 1, but I left it way too late to return it. I have given up with it to be honest. Don't waste your money."
"If you are planning on buying box sets like the lord of the rings, eragon, wheel of time, discworld, hyperion, mistborn, foundation series, robot series, or other sets, you should know that the sets are not available on kindle, meaning you WILL have to buy paperback books for those sets (which is cheaper) Or spend MORE money on the kindle versions. Some of them don't even have the whole series available on kindle as singles. So if your main strategy was to move completely to digital reading, look into the books you're planning to buy before you buy a kindle Fire and make sure you even can buy kindle versions. If those are your first book purchases you'll be making, wait to buy a kindle because they are not available on unlimited or as kindle purchases for a set for a cheaper price. Wheel of time specifically is not available on kindle as singles, and is much more expensive than the box sets. Found this out after I returned the paperbacks when I bought a kindle thinking I could buy the sets at the same price on kindle, no such luck so ill be returning my kindle fire until I have read the books I want to that do not cost more to own a kindle just to read or can't read at all."
"You have to pay to remove ads on a product you bought, which is... just WILD to me. Welcome to dystopia.Even after paying for that, it still advertizes to you on the tablet itself and you can't get rid of it. Pretty sad."
"Even though I paid $15 extra, the ADS are everywhere !!  Apparently, it is only on the HOME SCREEN  in the ""Discover"" section on top, that you won't see ads.  Ridiculous extra cost."
"They did not explain what the lock-screen ads/no lock-screen ads means.  VERY misleading.  You have to pay them more to not get even more ads.  OMG!  Got it as a gift for my mom because of the larger screen.  Not worth it and really hate the so called ""Deal"" when it was not."
"Seems to be loaded with a worm that takes over the tablet, very difficult to get rid of."
I purchased this Kindle Fire 10 a while ago and now it started to randomly shutting off out of nowhere.I called Amazon support and they rudely told me to buy another and throw this one away.I’m in shock.
"I like the look of the watch. The look of the displays of the functions is very pleasant and offers different ways to view. There are many faces to choose from. The only thing I have issues with is the sleep function doesn’t work correctly. It is only recording part of my sleep. I will go to bed at say 7 and wake up at 3 am and it won’t record all of it. It recorded correctly once. It said I slept from 22 o clock to 4:30 am. I had already been up for an hour when it stopped recording my sleep and I know I was sleeping long before 22(10pm) o’clock. And sometimes the app is different from the watch. I think the app is very cheesy. Not a lot of thought went into it.  The app’s rating is really low. I purchased a smartwatch to record my sleep patterns. I guess I chose the wrong watch. One other thing. If you have small wrists, which I do, the bands are too big.I am updating since I hadn’t used the watch for very long. The sleep function is still wonky. It seems like it is set for a certain time frame internally. It is always starting to record my sleep always around the 22 hour(10pm). I go to sleep 2-3 hours prior to that time and continues to record even when I have been up for about 1-2 hours. Unless there is a function I am not aware of that corrects this. I am not finding one."
It broke where the pins go to attach the bands.  The watch itself is amazing and I love it.  I got it on the 7th of November and  the 16th of December it's broke so buy at your own risk.
It's a basic smart watch.. so far it works. However I am displeased to not receive 3 bands like it says. Only got 2 silicone bands.
"I have wanted to purchase a watch for some time, and unfortunately I settled on lower price instead of quality. Although the watch is very nice looking, the app seemed too invasive. I was never able to set it up properly. Sent it back and purchased a Samsung."
It's very cute But I have alot of trouble with the ap. It don't keep track of anything. I will be looking for a new watch soon
"I kept the watch for close to a month because it seemed like it would be ok when I first started using it. But it gradually became more and more flakey as time went on. Step and sleep tracking weren’t consistent, sometimes leaving out whole blocks of time. Bluetooth frequently lost connection when you walked out of the room that the phone was in and you’d get a warning that you’d run out of charge by the end of the day if you didn’t turn off Bluetooth. The watch face was supposed to come on when you raised your arm, but that only worked intermittently when you did it intentionally to make it come on.  However it came on with full brightness every time you moved around in the middle of the night, disturbing the wearer’s sleep and that of anyone else in the room. And the duration of the battery charge was inconsistent, sometimes lasting for several days and sometimes only one without any intentional changes in usage."
Loses it charge too fast.  Have to hook it up daily
Limited access to information
"The raise to wake does not work and even when you press the wake button there is a delay. So I normally press it, nothing, go to press it again and then it turns on then off again. Then I press it again to finally see the time. 🙃"
"The watch may be fine, but I ordered this and received the wrong model. Requested a replacement and they sent the same wrong model. So my rating reflects the poor description. I would say the delivery time on both watches was outstanding."
Was hoping to use this to monitor steps; the “watch face” is too big and instructions are ridiculous to figure out.
I purchased this watch to monitor my steps and the app keeps crashing were I lose the steps on my tracker and it resets back to zero.
After initial setup the app would not open and continuously crashes on a fully updated Samsung Galaxy S21.
"It is very difficult to get it to do what you bought it for.  It won't even maintain the correct time!  I would ABSOLUTELY recommend you look at Fossil before considering this one.  Very user friendly and does what it advertises.  I kept thinking it would get resolved but, after waiting more than 10 days for an answer to my question, I can no longer return it.  Run away!!"
"Got this for step counting and calorie count.  Although it was easy to set up and battery life seems decent, this, like many of other ch eap watch es  seem to have insent ive reviews.  Does not count steps at all some of the time and then at other times count reverts back to zero."
"The watch itself is great, but the app closes constantly. When I was able to set it up, it didn't even pull over my contact list for the phone. Now the phone, etc. doesn't work at all. I'm sending it back. Not worth the money I paid."
Disappointed. Not sure what happened. But the screen remains blank even though the watch is fully charged and connected very easily/quickly to the phone. Reordering for a new hopefully I just got a defective one. Will updating the next one is better.
"This watch is plain and simple garbage. The weird ringer will not go off and rings everytime my phone rings, even though my phone is on silent. I’ve reached out and heard nothing back. Don’t buy it. Spend the money and buy an Apple Watch."
"The watch looked great upon arrival but after several attempts,  i can't get the watch to pair to my phone and the app closes out continuously. I am returning"
It's great for a fitness tracker. Bluetooth disconnected if I crossed the room let alone left the room.
Was excited to try this. Very dissapointed. QR code did not work and the charging adapter was not even for this watch.
Not worth full price.  Not any better than cheaper versions of smart watches.
Poor app. Crashes all the time and very limited on what it can do.
Could not pair it to my iphone!
Can’t get it to power on even after being on charger all night
Health tracking m mostly works but though it claims to check blood pressure it does not.
"Unfortunately you cannot send texts, only receive them. Also, if someone calls from your contacts it only shows the number, not their name. I finally was able to receive texts after watching the YouTube video. Not straightforward. There are lots of faces to choose from which is fun, but my primary need was texting and it does not have that capability."
"I did put on a different band that wasn’t included. It is 20mm. The watch looks nice and the face is actually smaller than I was expecting. I think I’m more of a fan of the rectangle shaped ones bc I feel content looks better on it. It is very light and comfortable though.The display is very bright and colorful, which is nice! Even on low brightness, it’s quite bright. You can make a custom wallpaper or download more in the app. However, you can only keep one extra on the watch itself. I’m guessing it’s bc there isn’t much storage.I have such an issue with the Bluetooth though bc if the watch is connected to your phone, then any sound it makes will come from the watch speakers…unless you keep clicking “iPhone” instead of the watch on your phone’s music player settings. This is bc Bluetooth treats this watch as if it is speakers. So when I use my phone I have to keep choosing I want the audio from my phone and not the watch. I don’t have this issue with any other inexpensive smart watches I’ve bought on here. Speaker quality is great though.Also I find that this watch is filled with many useless things that don’t serve a purpose like meditation and a mood tracker. The mood tracker tells you your mood I believe based on how high or low your heart rate is.The Bluetooth on this has less of a range than my other smartwatches and disconnects at a shorter distance. It also never tracked my sleep which was one of the main reasons why I wanted it. The battery drains much faster than others too."
Just not what I expected but I can make calls and monitor my steps and everything else and listen to my music but the volume on it is not as loud as I thought. You can barely hand me through the phone when I make calls. So like I said it's compatible. It does what it needs to do for the time that I need it. But pretty soon I'm just going to go get me the pixel watch for my phone but it's good for kids if you're not ready to get them a cell phone yet
"I bought this watch on sale for around $28 because I just needed the most basic step counter/hr tracking watch and this was the nicest looking one. Turns out it can’t even do that. There are chunks of time and data that just get deleted throughout the day randomly. Today for example, it deleted my activity from 3-4pm and 10-11pm. After showing me 100% goal completion is back to 79%. When I get on the treadmill and start the sport mode walking to track and I record it, it just deletes it when it’s over. lol. Like, what is this?And yesterday I went to bed at 9pm, it started recording sleep data at 12:30am.Save your money, it’s dumb and frustrating."
"The average 5-star review deceived me into thinking this was an outstanding watch, but it's not. The battery does not last more than a day and a half of regular use. The features are just basic. The faces are not cute, and accessibility is odd.I would not recommend it or repurchase it. In fact, I bought it a week ago, and I'm already looking for a better replacement."
I will be returning this watch but want to offer my review. I've had the watch for 4 days and already have to recharge. If I leave my phone in one room of my house and walk into another it disconnects.It is a very cute watch and I love the different screens but nothing else on it works as it says.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The watch looks nice and does the basic functions okay but it’s just that: very basic.Battery life is good, it has a lot of different watch faces which is fun, and tracks sleep and steps okay.A few things it doesn’t do and are reasons I won’t continue using the watch:1) Anytime I get more than 10 feet from my phone, the watch repeatedly notifies me every 30 seconds that Bluetooth isn’t connected anymore. It’s a bit obnoxious and you can’t turn it off.2) The “Psychological cycle” is only predictive and you can’t update it with the actual date your period starts. Not really great for accurate tracking…3) you can’t customize the menu options on the watch so you have to scroll through extra options anytime I go into the menu and there are a handful of features I won’t use. For instance, I don’t want the Stress, Mood, Breath Rate and UV Index, but they’re all in the menu I have to scroll through to get to Settings or Functions.4) you can’t respond to texts from the watch.5) I never could get the Bluetooth to show both watch names in my Bluetooth settings like the instructions say.  I tried everything multiple times, including resetting the watch, my phone and then repairing. Still never showed both devices in my Bluetooth settings.Overall, decent watch. Just not very customizable."
I'm coming from using Fitbit watches...versa lite and charge 2...and I switched from an iPhone to a Motorola stylus....maybe I'm just unhappy because I'm used to higher end tech..But my husband got me this for my birthday and I hate to say it but I hate this watch. The feel is good. The bands are good. But the install and app...the watch operation is horrible. It's so cheap. It doesn't pair well with my phone. The install was horrid. You have to scan QR codes for a video that doesn't even have sound.I'm just not happy.Im hoping the return goes well and we can just fork out the extra $50 for a Fitbit.
It doesn't stay connected I go away from my phone and disconnects right away. It's a horrible watch. I shouldn't have to reset it all the time and restart my phone.
Not what I expected
"It was nice while it worked, but unfortunately once it needed to be charged again it wouldn't take.  Had to return it.  I guess for $30, I got $30 worth of smart watch."
"Seems like a nice watch, but the app that goes along with it is trash. Setup is very difficult and can't get the notifications to work. As soon as I allowed the app permissions on my phone, the app just started crashing. Can't even open it anymore"
Uses the limited Gloryfit App to communicate. Can't use an app like faces to make your own watch face because the apps can't recognize this watch. This watch is advertised as using Wear OS 2.9 but it doesn't want to communicate as it should. It will take several hours to select each possible watch in the app lists to see if any of them will allow the apps to connect... all this just to make a custom face. The reviews are not worth reading as most state that the watch was a gift for someone else and praise the watch for having the same functions as every other smart watch in the world.I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS WATCH unless you just want a modern junk casio quality toy.
"This watch is terrible. First, it won't stay connected to my phone. Constantly says ""cannot connect. Turn off device"" which I've done a dozen times. This was a waste of money and not close to what it says it is"
"None of the features worked right, steps, sleep and didn't save the information so couldn't look back and see how many step you had the day before"
This was just not something I was comfortable wearing nothing wrong with product
"Lousy,  says swimming is one of the activities but it's not listed"
Won't down load all contacts like it said it would
"I’d caution against purchasing this product. Any problems within the return policy of this company would seem to require anyone in Hawaii to pay for the return and basic box size costs around $24.00 with upwards of $4.00 to insure it because it’s over $200.00. That’s just if you decide you need to return it. The Bose warranty is decent but my experience is that the warranty requires you to return it to Bose first and then they replace it and it all takes about 60days that you won’t have this super pricey headphones. Having said that, here’s my review: the sound quality is average. Even using their Bose app the most you can do is choose presets and adjust the  EQ a bit. The internal ai is difficult to hear, interrupted Siri when phone calls come in. Even though it interrupted and overrode SIRI it didn’t automatically switch from Audible app to the call! It just keeps repeating that you have a call and it tells you that you’re connected to your iPhone. Um, not sure what good that was supposed to be but it’s amazingly irritating and you still have to MANUALLY choose the headphones on the phone app. The voice is robotic and,unlike Siri, doesn’t do anything to help you answer the call. During the time that the headphones are spouting this silliness, the buttons to answer the call DON’T WORK. The noise cancellation is not even as good as my NC25’s and although it has a “modes” setting on the app with a “windy conditions” setting in its “Outdoor” mode, it doesn’t do much to increase or improve sound quality within the headphones because it doesn’t really block outside noise well. When I need noise cancellation I really want the headphones to actually block all noise so I can meditate or listen to books or music without any interference or distractions. This headphones doesn’t do that job. The mic quality is scratching and picks up all the noise around you during the call you finally manually accept because the voice is nattering on unintelligibly and actually ends up amplifying the sounds around you. That’s terrible 😣 the ear size is adjustable upwards or down but the inner ear area isn’t padded at all and the padding on the outer ears is minimal and not very comfortable so that my tiny ears kept rubbing against the inner plastic and ended up being painful after a bit. I couldn’t experience the length of time that it would keep doing something because IT DID NOT HAVE A CHARGER BLOCK and I wasn’t able to get it to work with any adapter I own (6 different ones) so it never could charge and the charger light wouldn’t go on. And after 24 hours it was still at 40% according to the headphones voice… I couldn’t say much about its durability except that the plastic ear parts felt flimsy and it would need delicate handling. The headband squeezed my head very badly (I sincerely have a pretty small head width and I wear a size small hat size to give you an idea of my head size!) and after about 30 minutes it hurts to the point of pain and I took it off until the pain decreased. no matter how I tried to adjust it using the “sizer” parts on the top on both sides, this badness was the usual. The volume control worked but because the app doesn’t do much besides let you adjust the eq a bit, I didn’t get the sound that was clear and bottom heavy. This box didn’t come with ANY startup manual except a bit of info about their app that’s on the box but the app doesn’t really tell you how to do anything besides check battery and use preset settings. the app doesn’t do much so I couldn’t even get sound equal to an NC25 which is a super inexpensive headphone. It’s not worth the price or the bother. In this price range you should get premium service that doesn’t take 60 days turnaround that leaves you without your headset for 2 months and requires you to send your headset first in order to get the replacement. It’s possible that because I’m not rich I just don’t have enough of something in the qualifications department to rate this headphones properly but if Bose is catering to “regular people” like me who wants the best quality sound at the $300.00 price range then maybe they should think a bit about what people they want as customers. I’m sadly disappointed in Bose over this headset. I’ve owned a couple of their clock radios and they are awesomeness incarnate! These headphones just kinda don’t have the same Bose that we’ve all come to expect and deserve. I wish they’d just redesign the thing and move forward."
"First I want to start by putting a disclaimer that I am by no means an expert on headphones but go by a lot of research and personal experience. These headphones were very comfortable and the battery lasts forever. It also charges fast. It’s  build was nice just plastic and kind of cheap feeling. It tended to slip a lot on my head but it didn’t make my ears warm or anything or yank hairs out. It also doesn’t squish your ears/head. So on the comfort aspect 4/5. The sound however is another story. First of all, if you play music above 20% volume everyone can hear it because the sounds leaks. When connected to any Apple product the sound diminishes greatly in quality. You can barely hear whatever you’re playing (again at levels that don’t leak sound) and it sounds very far away and muffled. I commute a lot so this was a deal breaker for me. However on my HP laptop it worked like a dream, bass was great, but it still leaked sounds when playing at half the volume or less. Again, that was super annoying. Connectivity wise everything went smoothly and this far I haven’t had an issue. The aware mode is kind of staticky and windy sounding and not really good like the AirPods Pro. The noise cancellation is decent but you can still hear a lot of things and doesn’t really cancel much out, the AirPods have much better noice cancellation. Overall, it depends on what you’re wanting to use it for. These slip a lot on my head when working out and for commuting just wasn’t what I was looking for. I got them on sale and still don’t feel $200 justifies the cost for what I got. Will be returning giving three starts because of comfort."
"I bought this to upgrade to wireless from my earlier QC model.  First, I found out it won't connect to my computer for Zoom meetings.  Not PC compatible for some reason.  Tried to connect it to Bose Music App, now just Bose, but that app CANNOT send music directly to their own headphones, which is very lame.  You have to pair them with a Bose Soundbar, then mute the soundbar.  I had the soundbar connected to my TV's ARC HDMI port, but it started turning the TV off randomly.  That quit when I disconnected it.  So, you have to have some other WiFi compatible Bose device to send music to your headphones without phone calls or video games interrupting the music.  This info came directly from the Bose help desk.Also, SoundTouch does not work with them and when I went to the Bose Connect app, it told me there was a better app and loaded Bose Music app which doesn't run the headphones directly.  LAME!Finally, the last time I was in a Best Buy, the tech told me to buy Sonos, not Bose.  I should have listened then.  I have three kinds of Bose devices that don't talk to each other.  So LAME!"
"I purchased these headphones for the purpose of working from home in a call center environment for 8hr a day. My main reasons for purchasing were: to go wireless, and increase comfort. I am often in meetings and calls for hours at a time, and the headphones my organization provided were painful.On my first day of use, I noticed a couple issues. First issue is that on Windows and Mac the microphone volume is far too low. Nobody on Microsoft Teams or my call center software could hear me. I needed to install a separate application to artificially boost the microphone by around 20dB. Second issue I noticed is regarding having two devices connected at the same time. Example: If you are actively streaming audio from a Windows computer, and then your iPhone gets a text notification, the headphones will cut the audio from the Windows computer to play the iPhone notification. When this happens, your Bluetooth connection either drops, or the audio quality gets very bad (crackling, stutters, etc) and you need to disconnect/reconnect devices.On my second day of use, I experienced random drops in audio quality and needed to power off/on the headphones 3 times.Bose has many suggestions and troubleshooting steps in their support articles, which I have gone through. That being said, these headphones are fine. I will keep them and enjoy them for my work (when they are working) and enjoy them for traveling. That being said, I do wish I would have gone with a Microsoft Teams certified device instead for my purposes. This product appears to be more intended for casual use as opposed to professional use.The sound quality is very good compared to my Sennheiser HD598. Audio is very clear, especially in the mid to high frequencies. Other reviews mention a lack of bass, but I found the bass to be MORE than enough. The active noise cancellation has a huge impact on music listening; I feel like the sound stage is very wide as I can hear many details in songs I haven't picked up on before.Noise cancellation is insanely good. I don't have a great basis for comparison, but it's almost eerie how silent the world is when you have these on. At most, I can barely hear a super loud fan a few feet away, or I barely hear the faucet when washing dishes. I look forward to using these while doing chores around the house!Comfort and fit is great for only 2 days of use. They are much more comfortable than I expected, as I have a big head and typically need to ""break in"" headphones a little bit longer. I had these headphones on for hours and they didn't give me any issues.Overall, despite the annoying connection issues I have with these things I am going to keep them. I like them enough to where I am willing to work around these issues for now. The next time I need to travel these are going to be a life saver. I can't wait to finally sleep on planes! If you're working from home, I would recommend seeking a Microsoft Teams certified pair of headphones."
"The sound of these headphones is pretty good, but there are a few annoying issues. The first one is, if you don't switch the headphones off, they will kill their own battery overnight, even if there is no other device for them to connect to. This is the only set of headphones that I've ever had with this issue, and it's kind of unacceptable. The second issue is when the battery is low, a very annoying robotic voice will scream that the battery is low every 2-3 minutes until you plug them in. This leads to the third issue: why is the voice for a pair of headphones in 2024 (or even the past few years) so horrible? I can't understand anything the robotic voice is saying, besides ""awah air"" which apparently means aware? And ""BATTERY LEW"". You'd expect much better quality from Bose to be honest, and these little features do make a difference, so be aware."
I use these primarily for working (10+ hours per day). Overall I think they are fine headphones but I wouldn't be as ok with them if I paid full price. They are lightweight which makes them feel cheap if you're used to more hefty headphones. If you're taking a phone call outside the mic picks up the slightest breeze and makes conversations almost impossible. Battery life could be better. My old headphones lasted 2 weeks without a charge but these ones need a charge every other day (again for 10 hour days). Sound quality is fine but sometimes the bass does something funky and the static is really bad.I purchased these for 50% off and they're just good enough for me to not send them back. If I paid full I would probably have returned them for something else.
"So for under 200 I think they're okay. Comfortable, decent battery life, and sound is solid though less bass than others around the pp. Base is still okay depending on what Music app you're using.The app is less interesting than others and very basic. It also forces you to agree to everything or you can't use it which should be illegal. You buy an item then without you're knowledge when buying it, in order to use it with all its features you must agree to all terms of some always changing nonsense.Like other headsets it uses fake leather unfortunately which will peel eventually.The Bluetooth is snappy and seems to be solid. Overall it's a solid headset and all of them have issues imo."
"I think overall, the sound and feel is great for the price. Noise cancellation is some of the best I've used. I paid $200 and am overall happy.The biggest issue is latency. For me it's noticeable for videos, games, and even apps like duo lingo.And that comes down to lack of aptX LL support. It includes aptX Adaptive support which is not the same thing. aptX Adapative only works on a very small amount of phones that are Snapdragon sound certified.If you only use these for music/podcasts, not bothered by latency, have one of the few phones that support aptX adaptive, or just use wired, you'll have a better time."
"These headphones have the best sound quality I've heard for their price range. However, I sent the first pair back for replacement, because I continually had Bluetooth connectivity issues. Either they would not connect, or the connection was bad (tinny sound or static). The second pair started doing the same thing. I solved the issue by making sure that there was only one connection at a time. According to the documentation, these headphones should seamlessly connect to two devices. I made sure that the phone app was forgotten, and only connect to my Roku device. This seems to have solved the issue. Not good, considering these are Bose products. You'd expect better.Update: After using for a month, my solution of only using one connection (connect to one device only) has been rock solid. Connects every time to my Roku device, and the sound quality is excellent."
"I wanted over the ear headphones because I worry the in ear could cause damage. Especially when listening loudly as I do. Here are my pros and cons.Pros: Sound certainly is good.Cons: To large for my head. I’m 5’2”. Not that height necessarily translates to head size, but wanted to give some reference point. Headbands fit me fine, although always slide off. The upper part on the headphones don't even rest on my head in the lowest position.Can hear the music external to the user which doesn’t happen with earbuds.Bose made a huge miss on this one. When resting the headphones around your neck, say like when waiting for your plane, the ear part turns up to rest comfortably against your next or shoulder. But why turn UP. The padded headphone is then facing up. So let’s say something gets spilled nearby or you are running through rain, it exposes the headphone and padding to damage. If the earpieces turned down it would be padded against the neck/shoulder and much more comfortable.This is my first on/over ear headphone purchase. Would not buy these again and would look to another popular brand."
"First one should know that when one gets the apps to actually work (there a new app) and  one finds the equalization one finds it pretty meager.  The noise cancellation is good.  But given the cost of these headphones I cannot say these Bose’s are worth it. The cord for non-Bluetooth applications is proprietary to cost you money down the road.  The wired impedance match to a big screen tv is terrible. You TV has to be up full to hear thru the Bose just modestly. AND noise cancellation doesn’t work when on the wire.  I also find the headphones uncomfortable after a couple hrs.  I would definitely not buy these again knowing what I know now.I found the chat support to be near useless.  The telephone technical support was good, but I really should have needed to call them at all to untangle their apps and get them to actually work.  Then there’s the legalities:You should be aware that Bose is surveilling you. Parts of the agreement is vague enough one really doesn’t know how much the devices is surveiling.  I can say if I read this agreement before buying these phones I never would have selected the Boses product. Before buying this product you should  examine their privacy statement at their website. Unless you agree, their app which you must use to EQ these phones, will not work. These headphones produce far too much base to not use their app for EQ.Their agreement statement is lengthy.  Here are some things you must agree to:Information about your access to and use of Bose websites and emails, such as your IP address, browser language, the state or country from which you accessed the Services, software and hardware attributes (including device IDs, operating system, and browser type), referring and exit URLs, the links you click and files you download, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the terms you use in searches on our websites, the date and time you accessed our websites or opened our emails, and other similar information.Financial and transactional information, such as credit card information, and purchase and transaction history."
"My biggest gripe with these headphones is if you leave them sitting with a full charge , they have no battery retention. Pick them up in a couple days and the battery is 0 again. They charge kind of slowly. You cannot use them while being charged, and the headphones don’t even connect to the app while charging. They go into complete ghost mode. This results in me not being able to use the headphones as often as I’d like to use them, considering how much I paid. Also, this might not be good for a person with big ears. I feel like my ears are on the bigger side and after an hr or so of wearing these, it can start to feel some ear discomfort.  They use like 16 different commands, all through just 2 buttons, and I can’t ever remember the freakin Morse code secret handshake button dots and dashes they want me to remember to be able to take a call or use Siri. Volume is the easiest one, it has its own two dedicated buttons.Pros, they are comfortable, and the sound is good. Music sounds awesome. The noise canceling is good, I’d say it blocks out about 70-80% of ambient noise. I like the case and how they fold up to be pretty slim, so I’ve brought them along on many trips, you’re just SOL if you forgot to charge."
"This was my third Bose noise-canceling set of headphones so I am very familiar with the feel and this set isn't like my others. Thankfully, I bought them as a back-up pair so I don't have to wear them as much. I get a headache every time I put them on. The sound is fine but I wear these headphones up to eight hours at a stretch so I am not happy with the quality."
"I have had sennheiser, beats, sony and now bose! I had to send the bose back. They had crackles when audio wasn't a constent such as using the duo lingo app. Also music quality was not very impressive. Also the noise canceling seemed to be worse then there previous models. I am going to buy Sony Xm4000 they are the same price and have much better noise canceling and sound quality."
"They work like head phones should. I can't see much difference with less expensive headsets. Maybe these have bells and whistles I don't care about. As a pair of plain headphones, though, they do the job. As noise cancellation out of the box, not impressed. I can still hear my neighbors radio and hammering on his house.!!"
"Purchased two Bose QC Headsets. Trying on the first pair and comparing them to our other fleet of headphones I was impressed, all good. The second pair, not so much. The second pair were muffled and had hardly any bass response, So I returned the faulty pair and tuis 3 star review."
"Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling HeadphonesI am part of the Insider community participate; I received the Bose Quiet Comfort Wirelsee Noise Cancelling Headphones as part of a promotion.The set up is very easy, just scan the code in the box and put the headset on to connect through Bluetooth.  I had 70% when I received my Bose headphones.The Bose Quiet Comfort headphones are very comfortable for extended period of time to listening to music. The quality of the Bose headphones is excellent!  The headphone is adjustable to fit comfortably on the head and ears, with or without wearing glasses. I own quite a few sets of brand earbuds and headphones.  WOW!  I must say the Bose Quiet Comfort are the best sounding headsets I've ever owned.  You can easily adjust the SoundTouch to your likings, I like to use the bass booster setting in the Bose app because I like more bass. The music is both crisp and clear. I think Bose has established themselves as the best in sound quality with these.  The Bose headset picks up more music notes and sounds seem to be missed by the Bose competitors. The noise around you disappears but you can still hear some noise in your surroundings unless you blast the music in the headphones.  You definitely will not be disappointed with the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones.Battery life is excellent; however, they do take a bit to fully charge if you let the battery drain all the way. I would recommend charging them when the battery life drops 50% or under if you plan on being away from a plug for a while.The right ear cup has volume controls, forward or backward mode for music selection and can answer phone calls, and the charging port. Also, on the right ear cup you can power off or on. The left ear cup has an AUX port and a button to toggle between ""quiet and aware"" modes. There are different modes to help with the wind cancellation and you can choose no more than 2 at one given time. The other two modes are a permanent fixture, so you can have up to four total modes.I could not use the Bose app on my, Ipod even though I could connect the music on my Ipod to the headphones., it can only be used on my IPHONE or IPADThe case is also nice and makes it easier to transport.They have become my dedicated headphones for listening to my music to walk, travel or just listen to music at home without disturbing others around me.Small glitch:  slight pause in music every now and then.  Bose needs to fix it!But the Bose earbuds are better in noise cancellation.Would I recommend these"
"I’m not sure if it’s just mine or not, but sometimes they make scratching sounds like they’re not getting a good connection or something. When I have my phone on me or my iPad is less than a foot away. It happens a lot. I haven’t had these a week yet and idk what the deal is. Is that common? They feel great on your ears and head. Very light. I love them besides that issue. I honestly have no clue why mine do that. I can’t even return/exchange them because I threw the box away the same day I opened them. So I’m disappointed for the amount of money I spent on them."
"3.5 - 4 ⭐⭐⭐⭐Pros:- Comfortable Fit: These headphones are incredibly comfortable, perfect for long listening sessions.- Great Sound Quality: The audio performance is impressive, offering clear and enjoyable sound.- Stylish Color Options: The variety of color choices is a nice touch, and the green ones I chose look amazing.Cons:- High Price: The cost of these headphones is on the expensive side.- Limited Features: For the price, they don’t offer as many features as you might expect.- Outdated Bluetooth Version: They use Bluetooth 5.1, which is outdated compared to the newer Bluetooth 5.4 available in other models.- No Spatial Audio Support: One noticeable drawback is the lack of spatial audio support. In an era where immersive audio experiences are becoming more common, the absence of this feature feels like a missed opportunity, especially considering the premium price of these headphones. For users who enjoy a 3D soundstage or a more engaging listening experience, this could be a significant downside, since you can get the Beats Studio Pro for about half of the price of these (on sale).Overall: While the comfort, sound quality, and style are strong points, the high price, lack of features, and outdated Bluetooth technology may be a downside for some users."
I really feel like you’re just paying for the brand name here.  My husband wanted these cuz he heard they were good.  They are.  But we compared them to a no-name brand of speakers and they sounded about the same to me.
"Edit: maybe a week later and I’m deducting another star because I can’t even tell that it’s on the noise cancelling setting.  It’s really, really bad.  I’ll check for a firmware update or something but it’s pretty bad.——-My primary headphones are Apple AirPods Max, so that’s the bar I’m measuring by.Cons:- the inner ear fabric is lumpy and shadowy, making it look a bit cheap- there isn’t an auto pause when you take them off (or at least one I haven’t found yet- mediocre noice cancelling in comparison- they’re difficult to pair / discover for some reason- the leather fabric is crinkly and doesn’t look like it will age well- they are light enough to feel a little flimsy; I’m not confident they’ll last yearsI noticed the box was in a little rough shape, but it was a Black Friday deal so I didn’t mind.- the purple just looked weird on my head for some reason.  Not sure why.- the buttons are in a very nonintuitive location unless you want to use your thumb.  Which is fine, but it’s taking getting used to and is a little annoyingPros:- easier to clean than AirPods Max.  You can wipe them down  instead of paying $60 to replace the porous, stained fabric- LIGHTER.  AirPods Max are SO HEAVY it gets old- they actually come with a carrying case that covers them!- the headband is adjustable!  You can make things longer or shorter.  AirPods Max are one size and fit weird on my head.I’m going to switch on and off with them as necessary I suspect.  Not by any means top tier but not terrible either"
"SUPER DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE with the price slash they didnt give me things !!!!This is my 2nd pair of these phones and I payed full price, they have a sale and they come up short with the phone cord extension which is very short and of a lower quality as well as the charger cord, I think its maybe 4 inches, this is BOSE , PEOPLE, I have pride in their products, perhaps someone new is in the front office,yet if there is I......SHALL, GO ELSEWHERE if you dont value me as a customer.Today there is way too much of disrespect to those who have supported you over the years."
"The Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones offer a comfortable and secure fit, making them a solid choice for long listening sessions. I particularly appreciate how they feel on my head; the over-ear design is generally soft and easy to wear. However, as someone who wears stud earrings, I’ve noticed that after about two hours, the pressure starts to cause some discomfort on my earlobes. This can be a bit of a drawback if you’re planning on wearing them for extended periods.I primarily use these headphones for travel, and they do a good job of reducing ambient noise, especially on flights. However, I’ve encountered a recurring issue during takeoff: the headphones produce a lot of static feedback when the plane is ascending. This has happened on all eight flights I’ve taken since purchasing them, which is disappointing for such a premium product.In everyday use, the noise-canceling feature is effective but not perfect. While they significantly reduce background noise, they don’t completely block it out, so you might still hear some external sounds.Overall, the Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones are comfortable and effective for noise reduction, but the static feedback during takeoff and slight discomfort with earrings are worth considering."
"The microphone isn't good, I couldn't take calls while using these headphones. They are very comfortable, but what's the point if I bought them to wear when working."
"I read the reviews before buying and they seemed mixed. Here is my take without writing a thesis. Reasonably easy to setup. The sound quality makes my AirPods sound like garbage by comparison. However, the 1 and 2 star reviews are spot on with the cancellation on, I can hear everything. Noise cancellation is not the most important thing to me so it is not a dealbreaker but if it is, maybe consider something else."
"Overall, they have a nice fit and sound. My only complaint is that they frequently have a crackling sound."
"I have had these for a few months now and they are ok. I bought these to help block out noise primarily when having a migraine. I was hoping they would be a better option than my skull candy headphones, which are very good, but still not good enough for what I needed and was hoping these were better at blocking out outside noises.The reason for my ratings1) The headphones were too big to fit my head, even adding something to take up space they would still not stay on my head, constantly falling forward or backwards.2) The ear muffs were too big and didn't block out near the amount of noise my skull candy headphones do.I am only glad I got these on sale, and currently are sitting on a shelf taking up space. I am sticking to my skull candy headphones for sure.For reference I am a grown woman, with a normal sized head, not a child by any means."
No instructions. The wireless button seems to be the ON OFF button. The USB charging cord is about 6 inches long . No way to know whether the only tiny light I saw means it is charging or fully charged !! That will be a problem if I don’t know if these are even completely charged .  I am disappointed in Bose. Returning them. I will pay the price for a pair of B&O.
"I bought these to upgrade my previous pair of noise cancelling headphones, which were a cheaper pair by Anker. A while back I had a non-ANC pair of Bose that I loved dearly until I updated to ANC, so I assumed these would be great!Well, unfortunately not. Honestly, save your money—there are cheaper pairs that offer mostly the same benefits.I'll start with the good. Bose headphones feel great. They're comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, and they're not so bulky or heavy that it is too noticeable. Truly exceptional in this respect. The sound was a step-up from my previous pair, though not lightyears better. Annoying for the higher price, but it's fine. Battery life is better than I was told to expect. USB-C port is a nice upgrade from older stuff.Now for the down sides. For a long stretch I was getting frequent (like every 2-3 minutes) cut-outs and static sounds. A reddit user suggested I remove the much-praised Bose app from my phone to fix the problem, and it did! But if the app that's supposed to improve the headphone causes them to function worse... seems like a pretty big flaw! Removing the app largely fixed the issue, but there are still plenty of moments where the sound just cuts out for a second. I know this happens with bluetooth headphones, but it happens far more frequently with these fancy Bose than it does with AirPods or the much cheaper Anker Soundcore set I had.The biggest flaw, though, is the microphone. It is borderline unusable, and it's what prompted me to write this review just now. My current pair is actually my second. Sent my first back because the microphone was *literally* unusable. The replacement pair works better, but good luck using it on a phone call without someone regularly saying ""Hello? Are you still there?"" I have not tried the wired microphone—I assume it is better, but the fact that the built-in microphone is this bad at this price point is unforgiveable. I've had two pairs of AirPods and the aforementioned Anker ANC headphones... all of which were at least USABLE for calls. This is truly a joke with these, and I can attest that it is not a one-off issue.I still use these because the sound is fine enough and they're very comfortable. I keep them at my desk and use them only to listen to music while I work... but I bought these with the expectation that they would be at least passable for audio/video calls, and that's just laughable now.Get something cheaper, or save up for the better Sony or Apple pro headphones. I got these on sale so it's fine, but I would never recommend these to anyone else."
"Bought these and thought the quality was really great and they looked fantastic and simple. What I didn't like was that the bluetooth connectivity was pretty glitchy as it tries to switch to multiple devices (something the AirPods do flawlessly, but these don't). They instead kept clicking or stuttering every minute or so of streaming audio from just one device. It's extremely frustrating to be listening to such great audio quality only to have it be interrupted so often. I also hate that Bose now requires you to download a very invasive app (look up just how much access they require of your device just outside of your connectivity and you'd be surprised) just to be able to use them with your phone or tablet. Unless you'll always be wired to them, they are not worth the price point for issues that should've been fixed ages ago. These were dealbreaking points for me and I had to return them."
"I owned the original qc35 since 2016 and they were one of the best purchases I'd ever made. I had to replace the ear pads 3 times before they finally gave out on me after almost 7 years of quality service.I was excited to get a new and improved version of my beloved headphones and expected this edition to be all that the qc35 was and more, with better sound quality, USB-C charging, and a sleek all black look. But i've been extremely dissapointed. At the center of all of it is an infuriating ""crackling"" sound that comes from the headphones frequently when watching video or especially when switching audio sources. I never once had that problem with my old headphones, I tried everything from updates to resetting to re-paring but nothing worked. The crackling was so annoying I ended up just getting rid of the headphones.There is also a much louder white noise sound when no audio is playing that was not present in the old headphones. I also didn't notice any improvement in sound quality at all - for being 8 years newer... really the only improvement for me was USB-C charging and the fact the logo was black.I truly wanted to enjoy these headphones but sadly if you are expecting the same quality as the older headphones you may be let down. I hope others haven't had the same experience."
"Short Version:Long time Bose user, Bought this model to replace ""Bose QuietComfort 35 II"" was excited because of all the high reviews, it seems that if you never experienced the original this one is great but this is a huge step down if you are used to OG Bose quality. Still better than earbuds while sound is playing.Long Version:I have used the ""Bose QuietComfort 35 II"" headphones daily 3-4 hours for many years (Purchased Nov 25th 2018), they were a solid pair of headphones and I only replaced them because they were becoming a bit worn and the battery life has decreased enough to where I had to charge a few times per day. I recently purchased the ""Newer Model"" of these headphones (Bose QuietComfort) as they earned my loyalty throughout the years.Upon opening the box I noticed everything was very well packed and had no worries about damage to the headphones. I was excited to see a similar design and the startup sound filled me with joy as it was seemingly the same Bose sound I have become accustomed to. Sadly had to use a different APP as Bose Connect no longer works but was quick and easy to setup with included instructions. Upon using them my excitement quickly faded when I crushed my bottle to throw away and the sound of the ""noise cancelling"" trying to compensate hurt my ears, no biggie right? Just don't crush bottles or go near loud high pitched noises (mind you these are noise cancelling so the idea is its supposed to block out noise not amplify it but I digress). I enjoy using my headphones for a few more minutes and go to stop my music where there is a ""clicking"" noise when sound is stopped for longer then 5 seconds, okay fine while I am using them they sound great so just have sound playing, I can work with this. The nail in the coffin for me was when I was outside and the wind blew a bit ""to hard"" I guess which then resulted in a constant noise in the right earpiece as if the noise cancelling was trying to compensate even when the wind had stopped (this went away after about 2 HOURS when I heard what seemed to be a small pop in the earpiece). I have never had any of these issues with my previous pair of nearly 6 years and am highly disappointed that they changed what to me was a 5 star product, sadly I will be giving these to family as they are still an upgrade over earbuds and I will be going back to my original pair. Mainly giving 2-stars because I still love my old pair of Bose."
I've have these going on 5 months now. Never dropped them or gotten anywhere near water or anything but last week they started randomly going static and just stop playing. Not even disconnecting since it never pauses my music it just stops and I'm constantly having to turn them off then on to fix it. Feeling like a rip off.
Petite woman found this to be large even with adjustable band.  Too bad.
"The sound and noise cancellation of these headphones is incredible, but I had to return these after less than a month. I can't complain about the sound quality or noise cancellation at all. Call quality was apparently was pretty good too based on the calls I was making.Unfortunately, the headphones dropped connection A LOT. Songs would get buzzy, the mic would stop working. At first I thought it was my work computer, but switching headphones immediately resolved the issues I was having. This problem only continued to get worse, even if I just had the headphones connected to a single device. I would have loved for these headphones to work, but unfortunately, they're being returned.Sound and noise cancellation, they have a chance to be amazing headphones for the price, but the connections problems makes them unusable in certain situations."
Sounds good but hurts the top of my head.
The noise cancellation wasn’t that great clean design tho
"I waited a long time to get a pair of these.  They fit little ears nicely and are very comfortable.  The first thing  I noticed is the lining in the ear hole (which they call scrims) is just a cover over the electronics and these are very uneven and fit poorly.  I opened the cushion to see if it needed to be readjusted and that's not the problem.  These are just cosmetic and thin so the sound comes through.  I have an older pair of Bose corded headphones and they were made much better and the scrim is held firmly in place by the ear cushion.  The next problem was the near impossibility of snapping the cushion back on.  Again, on my older headphones it only requires even pressure and they snap back in place.  I watched the video on ""how to"" but no joy.  The ring around the cushion base is cardboard.  So getting it back under the clips is a difficult process.  At this price point I would have expected better, especially from Bose.  You have to manhandle the cushion by bending it a little and with your fingernail and pressure gently get it back under the tiny clips around the ear piece.  I noticed that on the side I didn't take off- the clips are not engaged all the way around.  These only cost what they do because of the Bose name.  In the design of the ear cushions and scrims they missed the mark."
It does block noise but not 100%.
Static sounds for this higher end product…?
"Even when the volume is turned just slightly past halfway, other people in the room could hear the music.The headphones themselves have a beautiful sound, but the sound isn't insulated at all :("
"I've been buying this brand/model of headphones for 6+ years now. They're very comfortable with great audio quality, and they have the best noise-cancelling around; I used to wear them pretty much every day. But, over the years, Bose QuietComfort has gone from the best to unusably bad. My newest set crackles and cuts out within a minute or two of listening to anything, on every device I own; Windows PC, iPad, Android Phone, Steam Deck, doesn't matter. The issue started less than a week after I bought these headphones too. Nothing I tried, from changing audio codecs to resetting my device list, would fix the issue. My brand-new headphones are pretty, comfortable, and completely useless!This really surprised me after my last pair, which, after a year+ of daily use, ""only"" cut out every once in a while after a long time of listening. My other sets from before that never cut out at all, even after using them all day every day for years. I only replaced them because they got gross and torn up. The padding on the ears, though comfortable, will be torn to shreds within a year or so of wearing the headphones every day. You can replace the pads, but new ones are almost impossible to put in from my experience.I'm disappointed to see how poorly made these headphones are now, despite still being the most expensive headphones I own. I recently bought a cheaper $80 pair from another brand, and it works flawlessly compared to these. Still has decent noise-cancelling too!If you want good noise-cancelling headphones, don't buy these. The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is because they're comfortable; at least when the sound's off."
"These headphones (left) are noticeably cheaper quality than the previous gen Bose Noise Canceling 700s (right). I bought these for my wife for our first anniversary present, and they really let me down.HEADBAND:-The headband cushion is that cheap faux leather that eventually starts to peel over time. The previous gen has a nice thick rubber that is slightly inflated to give a cloud like rest on your head.-The headband frame is a lightweight plastic. Seems like it's prone to breaking. The previous gens were a metal/graphite like compound that make them feel more durable and fancier.EARS:-The earcups now rotate like the old school Skullcandy's that we used to have in 8th grade. Also, if you want to adjust, they extend like them as well. The previous gen has a cleaner and simpler design where if you want to adjust, they rotate and slide up/down the headband frame itself.-The ear cushions are much thinner, and a less cloud-like feel than the previous gen and are also the faux leather fabric that is used in the headband cushion.-There is a weird/obnoxious Bluetooth switch on the external of the right earphone. The previous gens had a slicker button layout and design.I wanted to bring my opinions to light in case anyone else values the manufacturing quality for a 350-dollar pair of headphones. I wish Bose would take a step back and reconsider the amount of craftsmanship they are putting into this new gen. I purchase their products since they usually set themselves apart from the other brands. From a business standpoint, this new model is without a doubt saving them on manufacturing costs, and we are taking the hit with that hefty price-point."
I have come to expect so much more out of Bose over the past 15 years. Sound is decent but the make and build is poor. Very cheap plastic material. Feels flimsy and not at all solid. Not a very tight fit on my smaller head. Light weight could help managing back pack weight I guess but that’s the only benefit. Would love if the cord were longer. I intentionally bought it because it also has a wired option. $349 because of the Bose name but it probably cost $10 to make. At least it’s not made in China. I might send it back.
"The sound quality is impressive, and the noise cancellation works well, though it's not completely effective. My main concern, however, is with the customer support. It’s neither responsive nor user-friendly. Last month, I experienced two separate issues with the microphone that required a factory reset. While needing to reset once could be understandable, having to do it twice within a month points to a potential defect.  During that time, I was unable to reach support or request a replacement, as the product appeared to be defective. The lack of efficient support made resolving the problem frustrating."
Immediately when I opened the case I thought I was sent the wrong color. They're a much lighter/pastel blue than in the product pictures.
"Sounds was ok, nothing terrible, nothing blowing me away.  But what blows me away is the quality of these, they look and feel insanely CHEAP.200 bucks for headphones that look like they're on par with Skullcandy headphones quality.  I refuse to spend money for these headphones, I'd pay like 80 bucks max for these.The buttons feel cheap, volume up clicks nicely with feedback, volume down didn't click at all, it worked but there was no feedback from pressing the button.Spend youroney elsewhere."
"Very pricey but best sound output quality I’ve heard in any headphone. Not sure about its durability but the noise cancelation on this thing will save you in the loudest rooms. It's a need if you have ADHD and need to focus. The cushions are super soft and it’s lightweight, making it ideal for long term use.EDIT: Took off 2 stars because I own an older version of the headphones and the materials for that are a lot sturdier. This one feels plastic. Sound output is incredible but input is garbage. Every person I’ve called using this headphone asked me if I was in a tunnel because of how bad the audio was on their end."
Bose quality has diminished a LOT. The sound quality and the noise cancelling were terrible. There was this constant white noise -  like a shhhhhhhhhh - in the backround. Perhaps if these are only used on a crowded plane they'd do the trick. Outside of the fact that they were too big ( I do have a small head ) these were a huge disappointment. I expected a lot more from Bose. But could not hear a difference between these and say mid level JBL's.
The battery on these is not good. It doesn't even last as long as they claim. For this amount of money i expected so much better. My old pair were a cheap generic pair that cost a quarter of these Bose ones and I only charge once a week or every 2 weeks. These I'm lucky if I can use them for a day.They're reasonably comfortable. But not too much more than my cheap old pair.I love the look. Clean. Smooth.
"The headphones themselves are great - excellent quality and great noise reduction. My problem is that the case that came with them was defective - the zipper broke as I was trying to close them after the first use. I didn’t want to return them because there was nothing wrong with the headphones, so I reached out to Bose to get a replacement for the defective case. On my first call I was told that the cases were on back order and if I hadn’t heard anything within 3-4 weeks to call back. At 4 weeks I still hadn’t heard from them so I called customer service again. This time I was told that they don’t carry inventory to replace cases and that they only deal with issues with electronics. I was given the case model number so I could purchase one from a 3rd party supplier. Uuugh. Alas, my brand new headphones will continue to live in a case held together with a rubber band. Great job, Bose. And with that you’ve lost a customer."
"I needed a pair for flying as my ear buds didn't block out the ambient plane engine noise, these do that very well. When I received my headphones I removed my pair of Mieze Headphones and put on the Quiet Comfort headphones. It was a noticeable drop in music quality. Not as clean and crisp. The Meize cost about 700$ so the sound quality I imagine is what you pay for. Good but not blow you away sound."
Too big for my head!!I got the green ones to replace my broken (earlier model) Bose quiet comfort. The headband of the these new green ones is very loose compared to m last pair. New ones fall off if Iran forward or backward or if I lay down. I’m going to try another set incase this was a one off with the weird sizing. I HOPE they work cause these are wonderful headphones. I absolutely loved my old pair but they broke LITERALLY a couple days after the 2 year warranty and BOSE customer service was NOT helpful. They offered that I could send me a new pair at a discounted price. When I looked on the Bose website they were on sale for cheaper than what I had been offered PLUS they were going to take back my old ones. I’m glad I checked before I got ripped off. One more chance for Bose…Hope I won’t be disappointed because these are really nice.Green color looks awesome!!!
"Replaced an old set of Bose noise cancelling headphones with these.  These are not as good quality as my old headphones.  To top it off, they ship a 10 plus page book of warnings in every language imaginable but can't go to the trouble of including a Quick Start Guide, let alone an owners manual.  Very poor user experience out of the box for the priciest noise REDUCING (not cancelling) headphones."
"Honestly, after years of being an audiophile and having family members that know so much about audio quality I decided to try Bose due to its reputation. I got them on sale for $200. Let me tell you, my $45 headphones have better quality and feel sturdier than these. I'm disappointed. The packaging is nice, and they come with a cable, case, and charger. But the quality, is not all that wonderful. I expected more clarity, more bass, and most importantly —proper noise cancelling. Maybe I'm mistaken? Maybe I haven't figured them out yet. But you don't need a genuis to figure a simple app. The features are not that advanced. They didn't even pass the indoor test. I took them out on my NYC commute, and I can hear a bit of conversations around me, including all the train sounds. Horrible noise cancelling. The only thing I like is their amazing color shade and how lightweight they are. But it's such a shame they feel so cheap. Gonna have to return. Not worth their value, it's just a name at this point."
"Love them when they work well, but the electrical crackling gets very annoying"
"They are comfy. sound is great. the included cord is an absolute joke. it is about 2 fee long. My first time using it with the cord, I have ripped it out of the speaker 3 times. I need to purchase a bluetooth adapter to get these to work with mu puter. if the hardwire is selling point for you. move on or buy an extension."
"I bought these as a cheaper alternative to my Airpods Max when they died (multiple times, but finally my AppleCare plan expired and I had to buy a new headset). I figured I'd save $150+ or so by buying these, since Bose is so well known for their noise cancelling technology and I see people wearing them on planes and stuff. On the first night, sleeping next to my loudly snoring husband, I found them to be too uncomfortable to sleep in, with insufficient noise cancelling. I couldn't sleep, so I got up after an hour or so, carefully put them back in their packaging, requested a return, and bought another set of AirPods Max so that they'd be at my house the following night. So much for saving $150+... not worth it. Better to pay more and get really solid noise cancelling and better comfort."
"The sound isn't that great compared to the Sony's. Even worst if you have to plug them directly into your laptop. The automatic Spotify controls are pure annoying. Example) I have the headphones hooked up to my work computer and cell phone. Whenever a notification sound plays on the laptop the Bose headphones start playing Spotify even if Spotify is off. And if Spotify is on and a notification pops up it will play a different song. I have turn all permissions off of Spotify to try and stop this. Uninstalled and reinstalled as well. But it keeps doing that. Also, in just about every Teams meeting I try to use these after about 20 minutes you can hear interference and then I have to plug them into the laptop. None of this happens with my Beats headphones, but those are my small running headphones. Not noise canceling expensive ones bought for work. Oh and I'm over needing to use my email address for everything. You can't make preference adjustments without giving them your email address.

"So I bought these on prime day on sale along with Beast Studio pro. They were also on sale. Their starting price points are the same $350. Bose sound quality is far superior. Bass is immersive, highs have serious resonance. Listening to all kinds of music is seriously enjoyable And Bluetooth sync is great.  Beats sound quality is subpar. Bass is low, highs are loud, and trying to use them to watch Netflix is a no go due to the unsynced audio.  I will be returning both of them due to the fact the Bose is made of plastic that feels like it won’t last more than a year. They already feel loose on my head. The Beats are sturdier. They will last over a year without completely losing their shape."
I bought these headphones 3 months ago and used them at most 5 times. The foam cushions are already frayed and breaking up.  I have not abused or misused them so I don't understand why this has happened. They were expensive and Bose quality should be better than this.
"I've decided to return the lilac headphones and stick with my trusty QC 35IIs.For $200, they don't do anything better than my older ones did, and they do have annoying interference from the induction stove. I tested the older phones, and they don't have that at all."
These are crackly for whatever reason randomly when switching between songs or apps.The sound dampening is OK.I owned a pair of these years ago but broken them over about 1 year of use. Purchased this pair because of prime day sale and honestly I feel the quality has gone down.The buttons aren’t in great places in my opinion and are hard to remember.These head phones charge pretty quickly.I don’t think they are worth the money when there are other better options that don’t require an additional app.The carrying case is bulky but secure.Would not buy again $200+ head phones should not crackleThe base is these hits like a fly against a window. (Weak asf)Truly debating on returning them.
Either I have not completely understood how to set these to provide optimal results or they are defective.  I’ve owned Bose before that were excellent in cancelling background noise on an airplane. These are far inferior. Clearly not worth the price I paid.
"Don't buy these if you are planning on using them with an Android phone.  The only Bluetooth codecs that the new Bose QC headphones support are AAC and SBC.  The HD audio is only available through AAC which is an Apple system.  Android systems can run it but do so very poorly.  When I connect them using HD Audio through the AAC codec sound is poppy and scratchy and goes quiet frequently this is because Android can't run the AAC codec well.  It works great just using SBC but that is not HD audio and if you are paying over 200 bucks for headphones you should get amazing sound quality that SBC just can't deliver.  I'm sure they sound great on an iOS system.  The Noise Cancelling is amazing.  I will be returning these.  I got the Sony WH-100XM4 for slightly less than I got these Bose for and they work amazing using the LDAC codec for HD Audio and my Android phone has no issue with it.  The noise canceling on them is also great.  Not as good as the Bose but it's still amazing and Sound Quality is paramount.  So if you have an Apple phone go for these, if you have an Android go for the Sony.Oh and contrary to what other reviewers have said you CAN use the noise canceling while in wired connection mode.  You DO NOT have to use bluetooth to get noise canceling."
"I've hade a QC35II for over 5 years, and have replaced the muffs, battery, and a hinge on that pair, and have loved them.  I hate inductive buttons used on many other top end headphones, so when it came time for a new set of headphones, The new Bose QuietComforts seemed like the perfect fit.On the plus, the pass through mode is an improvement, though I honestly preferred the old 'high, low, off' noise level settings. The new modes are less intuitive as to what the differences actually are - though the noise cancelling is great.The real kicker that knocked them down was that, while the physical buttons are the same, the actual functionality has taken a step back.  Previously, with the QC35IIs, you could Double or Tripple press to skip forward or back. Holding the button at the end of these sequences woulld fast forward or rewind.  This does not work with the new model. It only skips forward or back to the end/start of current media.  You may be able to change this in your media ap settings, but you can't have both.  As a main point of headphones is to NOT be tied to your phone, but a cable or controls, this is a huge backstep. Until I figured out how to at least change the default I as about to return them.  Switching it was a compromise, but really, they should have kept the full control capability of the earlier model.If you don't care about the control functionality, they are otherwise awesome headphones. Super comfortable and great sound."
I wish these fit me. I really like these. Feedback said the background noise was pretty high on meeting calls but mostly I bought these for the gym. I kept adjusting them thruMy whole workout and for leg presses I actually had to put the headband on my forehead or they would fall off. I did some research for other small headed people to see if anyone has come up with a solution- but it doesn’t seem like it which is a real bummer.  I got these for a great price so I’m just gonna give them to my bf who has the older version of these (35s). The green is gorgeous btw.
"I had a QC35 which I used from 2016 to 2024 without any major problems and unfortunately got it stolen due to a break in my car. I ordered this right away since I was pretty happy with the product / brand, its value proposition, quality, and properties. However, the current pair is the second one after using another pair for a week. Both have the same problems so far: Connectivity issues; cracking sounds every 7-8 minutes, and loss of sound for a couple of seconds frequently, regardless of the source, laptop, or phone. I am not sure if this discount is related to these standing problems for this model or not. I am considering returning this pair too since this is not a product that I can use in the long term. Because, at the end of the day, this is not the service that I can accept after spending close to $250."
"After reading multiple reviews and tests on you tube, I decided to pull the trigger choosing these over Sony XM4 or 5. My reasoning was that Bose had always offered a superior sound to my ear in real life regardless of what mixed reviews said. The reviews where mixed, noting the same strong points and poor points. The absolute most important thing I wanted in my purchase was sound quality. I was willing to sacrifice the best noise cancelling for just good, and 24 hours of battery life to about 12 (still happy with this). Noise cancelling is noticeably slightly worse than the Sony XM2s that I replaced, although quite close. Sound quality, voice clarity, average bass tones, overall clarity, was not as good as the Sony headphones that I had had for years. The EQ adjustments were new and slightly helpful in getting the tones that I wanted to pop, but ... not as good as out of the box sound from my last headphones.I would not purchase these headphones again. It is hard to find something in this price point, the over the ear headphones are either higher in price or lower in price and not as good. I will however continue to consider Bose products in my future purchases as this is the first ever poor experience I have had with them."
"First let me start by saying these headphones are about 99% perfect. If you are using these for general every day use, gym use, or short haul travel they are fantastic.The huge design flaw is the microphone placement on the ear cups (used for ANC). The location of the microphones is too far back and will rub on travel pillows, neck rests (on long haul planes), or improvised pillows (think folded hoodie/jacket). When anything rubs against the microphone when trying to get comfortable on a flight - the noise this produces in the headphones is AWFUL! This happens when the “aware” mode is on or off, and I tried desperately to find a solution to this.  As a result, these headphones can only be used when the sides do not make contact with any fabrics or materials, which left me sat bolt upright for a 9 1/2 hour international flight and was very frustrating. My wife used Beats Studio Pro’s and they do not have this issue when the “transparency” mode is not active, so I will probably end up purchasing a pair of those instead. Very sad to be sending these back as they are so comfortable (more comfortable than the Beats), but they do not suit my intended use due to this huge design flaw."
"First. What do you mean I cannot charge and listen. Even with the 3mm head phone jack plugged in, there was never a way to charge and listen. I can charge and listen with headphones I got for my daughter that costs 20 dollars. .Shame. Beats cost around the same much as these, they have better sound quality and if the charging cord is connected to the pc, it plays sound through the usb-c plug. For all others I can plug in the charger and the 3mm headphone jack at the same time and it will play sound and charge. Don't see how this cannot do that. Technological capabilities are lacking here.My set was defective though. Didn't always connect. I would have to clear the known list of devices every time I wanted to use these. Then When it connected, it dropped the connection at random. I could be in the middle of watching a movie for example and it would completly go silent. I would look up and the movie wasn't paused. The headphones just decided to stop playing sound. There was never a connected/disconnected warning and this happened at random intervals so there's no way to accurately reproduce this error.  Sometimes when I try to connect, it would drop the connection within seconds and refuse to connect back to the same device unless the entire connected devices list is cleared. Even though I only ever paired these to 1 thing(my computer) It was sheer madness. Just trying to use these was counter productive. I shouldn't have to have random blips in my work or entertainment because of headphones and I certainly shouldn't have to stop working until they are charged up again. Buy anything but these and your workflow and entertainment will not be constantly interrupted.I really think it was just a defective model, I was going to exchange them, but they started squeezing my head in a way that made my ears ring so I had to switch back to the old pair I was using and completely refund these."
I broke down and bought what I was was a top end product and it’s just okay.  Sound is fine - nothing bad but not exceptional.  Noise cancelling better than nothing but not what I expected at this price point.  I do love that I can connect 2 devices at once and easily switch between them.  Riding in my diesel truck - other end of the call couldn’t tell though my end still had a bunch of background.Nothing bad but nothing exceptional overall and therefore only 3 stars
"I got a pair of these a month ago, and I've really been enjoying using them. However, the first set I got skipped audio at a random rate around every 5 mins, which can get really annoying. I got them replaced, but the second set that I got also does the same thing. I think it's a fault with this supplier or maybe the product in general, either way I would love these headphones more if they worked like they were supposed to. Pretty disappointing that getting them replaced once didn't work."
"This is my first pair of high end headphones and I was not impressed by the sound quality. Not bad, just not great. Too much bass while also not enough bass. Hard to explain. Also the noise canceling / aware mode has no option to be turned off and it causes a pressure in my ears like you’re on a plane or something. They are light, comfortable, and sound ok, but I feel like they should sound a lot better at this price point. I returned them and ordered AirPod max"
"I hate these so much. Worst purchase I made because it was ""on sale."" Sound quality is nice, noice cancellation is nice, stopping playing and making scratchy sounds when it stops playing - not nice. Not nice at all. You know what isn't fun? Falling asleep to some nice music and then *SCRATCH*CRINKLE* nothing, then a moment later *SCRATCH*KRINKLE* thing you were listening to comes back...a minute goes by, repeat..and so on and so forth.And, because it took so long to ship, I ended up on a business trip when it was delivered and by the time I experienced the issue, on a different trip, I ended up missing the return window.I've had issues with Bose before, looks like things haven't changed. Wish I stuck with Sony."
"I heard great things about these headphones but unfortunately I ended up returning.Pros: very light, good noise cancelling, and I like the buttons for control settings.Cons: kept disconnecting from my computer, short range for Bluetooth, not for people with big ears.Overall they are not bad but I expected more from a $300 pair of headphones. They would occasionally cut out/ glitch during use which can become annoying. I did find them comfortable but too loose if you use them to jog."
I wanted to get some high-end (superior quality) headphones for work. The Bose name is easily recognisable and so I did my due diligence and picked this product.I expected the noise cancellation feature to be wickedly grand. And the overall quality of the product to be solid.I received a med grade product which failed in a variety of ways. Design wise - it’s cheap hard plastic for the body.  Simple and rather wack buttons. I could have moved past all of that and then experienced the sound. The noise cancellation feature is … mediocre. I have a sound core maker Q20 model (mid-level price) and its noise cancellation feature was superior.I won’t be looking to Bose for any of their products.
"I can't comment on the sound quality as I never got going with these. They were just too big for my head. I am not a large person, but I'm not tiny either. I ride motorcycles and my helmet size is a consistent medium whatever brand helmet I try on. As for the Bose headphones, I  would think for the price, they could offer them in various sizes such as small, medium, and  large."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The product works and does what it needs too but for over 150$ headphones gthe case Bose made for them is trash. Sadly it cross threads and un-hooks it is overall a terrible design of the case. If you purchase these expect to buy a case for them that actually works.. i open and closed it very little and it just doesnt work anymore. Sadly my return window closed so I have to deal with a poor case or just buy another case..
"Even when I'm close to my Bluetooth device the sound keeps cutting out, or I'll hear crackling noises. No update is needed, I've tried all the troubleshooting I could find and nothing has worked. I've never had this much trouble with my $30 noise canceling headphones, which also have a much further Bluetooth connection reach. Too late for me to return. I had high hopes for these given the price. Very disappointed 😞"
"These headphones have been on my wishlist for awhile. Sadly, the sound kept cutting out even when my iPhone was right next to me. I looked up solutions online and nothing worked. It's a shame, I was enjoying them in cafes working remote and I can see how great they would be for travel. The gym would be a no go - too sweaty. Overall, decided to keep looking for a better option."
"Wanted to love these Had great reviews. Idk if I got a faulty pair but I cwn charge for a few and go to use them and they are perpetually at 80 or 90%. Probably less than 10% it goes to 100%.Of I remove the charger in the off position and put them in their case, I can go to use them a few days later and they are ALWAYS dead!Super disappointing for the price. I do the love the color. They aren't that comfortable as well. I always use the ""L"" on my left ear and ""R"" on my right ear but after awhile they hurt. Unhappy all around..."
"The sound was good and they were very comfortable. The problem I had was the connection would drop randomly. It would come back after a second. It was so frequent that I just had to return them. I wanted to keep them but it was just so disruptive. If you are spending hundreds of dollars on an item, this should not be a regular occurrence."
"I think I may have a faulty product. It was skipping sound when I first got it, but I use them in the gym so I thought it was my wifi connection.  However, at home where my connection is perfect, the the sound was still skipping. I cannot use these for meetings because I cannot afford to miss audio/communications shared."
"I needed noise cancelling headphones for a long Atlantic flight. I bought these because I figured Bose headsets had the best noise cancelling reviews and cyber Monday deal was a steal.  Definitely not the case.  This pair muffles some sound but you can definitely still hear babies scream and people talking when you’re watching a movie or something on the plane. Didn’t need to take the headphones off when the flight attendant came through asking “chicken or beef” because I could hear them.  Yes they were turned on.  They were also too big and would slide off my head.  Can’t adjust to smaller, only bigger. Not really sure it was worth the money…"
"For a pair of 350$ ish headphones (that I got on sale for around 180$) they could be better. Especially the ladies voice when you turn them on, sounds like a temu factory worker recorded it, it just feels cheap. Overall, if you covered the logo and had to guess what they cost, I’d say 75$."
"Reason for the 2 stars: sound quality and the software.I have used a non-NC Sony for years, and I must say the sound quality on the Sony was way better than Bose. Sure it may not be fair to compare a NC headphone w/ one that is meant for enjoying music, but expected more from Bose.I can still live w/ the sub-optimal sound quality, but what really bothers is the buggy software. I have my MAC and iPhone paired to the Bose, and some times it is able to switch correctly but more often the Bose gets stuck paired w/ my MAC and I have to manually disable the pairing for the Bose to pair w/ my iPhone. Happens at least 2-3 times in a week. Hopefully Bose is able to fix their software nad make it less painful to own this Bose.What it does do well, is NC (Noise Cancellation)."
"**Update** (July 30,2024)I've had these headphones for several months. Not even a year yet and they disconnect randomly.The biggest peeve is being on a phone call and that person on the other end says they cannot hear me or I am breaking up. Mind you, I do have the phone right next to me most times. For these being expensive headphones the quality hasn't been the best so far for me when it comes to phone calls. I must say that I do like these headphones. I've never owned anything Bose. So this is my first purchase.I look into these headphones because I could not get any kind of earbuds to fit inside my ear. I did have a pair I really liked but one of the earbuds ended up going out within 3 months. I got frustrated and decided to go with over the head headphones. Going old school I should say! LOLI love the color and they are pretty decent at noise cancellation. I wore them the whole time in the airport and on the plane. They are very comfortable and did not irritate me in any way giving a kind of headache or bothering of the ears.Con:My only issue that I get really annoyed about is that even though I have it connected to my phone and I am currently listening to music, it disconnects and connects to my iPad. I don't know how or why it does that but that's the only thing that frustrates me. I'm not sure if maybe I have to play with my iPad settings but even though I turn the Bluetooth off my iPad it'll still turn on and then my headphones connect. So that is my only frustration is when I'm listening to music it will randomly disconnect from my phone and connect to my iPad instead. Phone calls are great and the buttons are easy to access. I do like how the button I'm able to hold it and use voice to do whatever command I need. I have an Android and it works fairly well.Overall, I really like these headphones"
"I loved everything about this headset the moment I got it from the noise cancellation and sound quality to the design and build until I had to take a phone call. Unfortunately, from the moment they came out the box, the microphone was garbage. I would try and talk wireless and people on other end shared that it muffled and sounds like I was under water. I chalked this up as just interference but after recording a video so I cold hear myself, it was utterly disastrous.Now they are just really expensive headphones where I have to hold my phone to my ear to take calls instead of being able to use a primary function.Microphone -248904239084308/10"
"These seem like great quality headphones but I just can’t get them to stay connected to anything or maintain audio after pausing, let alone use the multipoint connection feature. This is really disappointing considering that the multipoint connection was a huge selling point for me on these when I was researching headphones.Even when only using singlepoint connection, if I pause my audio to get it to play again I have to completely re connect the headphones to whatever device I was using. Even though it says it’s playing and that the volume is turned up, after pressing play I can’t hear anything. I check on the app, the device, and the headphones themselves to make sure they’re still connected and that the volume is turned up. Multipoint connection working is just out of the question :(I’ve tried fixing it through the settings and have deleted and reset all the connections through all of my devices’ bluetooths. I even redownloaded the Bose app, reset my account, and redid all the initial connecting that you do when you first get the headphones. I can’t seem to get them to work again, and now I can’t even connect to one device with singlepoint connection and pause my audio without having to turn the headphones off and on and reconnecting. It’s a huge waste of time when trying to watch lecture videos (I thought these would be a nice investment to use while I finish my undergrad and begin grad school) and I’m starting to feel like these were a huge waste of money!! I’m outside of the warranty window and wish this began sooner so I could’ve at least tried another pair."
"Did not like that head phone a bit large for my head. They are set for smallest head size, but still slide off. I like color and sound. Not as noise blocking as I expected."
"Super disappointed. Noise cancelling and transparency mode are -impossible- to turn off simultaneously. Don't want any noise cancelling? You're stuck with transparency mode on full blast so you can hear EVERYTHING around you loudly. Don't want any transparency mode? You're stuck with full-blast noise cancelling that makes you feel like your ears are plugged on an airplane. The best you can do is 50% ANC and 50% transparency, so it's only half as annoying in two different ways!And to top it all off, these features they don't allow you the freedom to disable will only drain the battery significantly faster than any other headphones that have them turned off. Great design! I can't fathom how anyone saw this glaring flaw as acceptable.Too bad I can't properly enjoy the quality of the audio or comfort of the headphones themselves when the manufacturer apparently doesn't trust you with the smallest amount of freedom with how you use them. For the price, this is absolutely unacceptable. If you love ANC and transparency mode 24/7, -literally-, have fun.If you live in a construction site or only use these when you're walking around bustling New York City streets, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. They feel like solid quality mechanically. If however you would actually like the choice when and how you use these features and don't appreciate them forced on you, don't even consider buying these for a moment.Returning them, and probably won't bother buying another pair of overpriced Bose headphones ever again. Physical quality means nothing if the software is so terribly half-baked I can't enjoy them how I would like to."
"I have always loved Bose products, I also just recently purchased the open ear buds and was super excited to score this over the ear set during prime days. I wanted something that could isolate me, could give me that nice calm silence and add wonderful sounding music.BUT when I received it today the right earphone did not work at all. I was setting the headphones up on my phone and no sound came out no matter what. Reconnected, updated and reinstalled the app even, troubleshoot it for a while before giving I'm that they are defective.This was extremely disappointing especially because I have been scoping these out for so long and with the sale I finally decided to do it and now I'm upset I got excited just to be let down. Plus it's all made so much worse by the fact that they will not iist offere a replacement.  It's like what was the point of the sale if the were broken.I have tried to contact Amazon but it just takes me in circles through self help guides and suggestions for troubleshooting,  all things I have already tried.Again it is very disheartening that after watching these for so long and the time I decide to go for it, they don't even work and the only option I was to get a refund so it didn't matter that I bought it on sale.  Definitely going to change who I purchase more expensive products and do it with a big box store."
"This review is for Bose NEW QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones,... Amazon is crap about mixing reviews, so folks please label your review like this.Read the other reviews... there will be dropouts once you connect multiple things... I don't hear them on phone calls, but watching YT videos on my Dell laptop I'll have audio dropouts every so often.  Bose will just want you to send them in for replacement... they all do this, so just learn to live with it.  My Plantronics never did this, great 50$ bluetooth headset, but no noise cancelling.  It might be that replacing the BT transmitter (like getting a new chiclet dongle) could help... I don't seem to have this problem at work using a brand new TPLink BT5.2 nubbin.I do intellectual work in an industrial environment so these have come in as life-savers.  When the heat exchanger near me turns on, I tune out!One critique I have is that the onboard voice is crap... you can barely understand it, and it spells out everything except 'iphone'.  I guess we're lucky it can talk at all."
"I had QC35's that I wanted to hand down and get a pair of new headphones with USB-C, so the QC headphones seemed to be the newest, with the same style of the QC35's that I loved so much. Unfortunately, they are plagued by a Bluetooth issue with multipoint enabled, where you get sound hiccups/interruptions and additional static noises when short sounds play, like notifications or chimes from Mac. I would return them if I could."
I’ve had them for a few months now and while I love the quality of sound and everything the microphone is simply not working. I have tried all the troubleshooting tips I found online and it just won’t work. I am tired of people on being able to hear me or videos I have to rerecord because the microphone wasn’t picking up a single sound.I wish I had returned them when I first noticed.
"11/16 update: I finally have a working headset in my possession. It is the wrong color, and the item is well outside of Amazon's return window, so I can't even exchange this for the color I originally purchased.11/8 update: It has been 2 months since I started the support ticket for this item. I still do not have a working headset nor do I have the headset in my possession. If you ever take the risk of buying these headsets and there's a defect, just return/replace it through Amazon and do not go through this same terrible experience I did with Bose's support.The good: The actual sound quality (when the headphones worked) was amazing, and the transparency mode worked wonderfully. It's also a VERY comfortable headset, both on the ears and even for someone with a wide head that usually gets pinched by standard headset sizes.The bad: The headphones only worked properly for about one month before it would just start dropping audio randomly. It wasn't disconnecting from any of my devices or turning off, either, as I could still hear everything around me in transparency mode. It just stopped transmitting any sounds from my connected computer and phone for minutes at a time.The really bad: Service requests are extremely slow. The headphones have been with Bose and out of my hands for longer than I've actually been able to use the headphones at all. They also do not have the same color options on the service website as they have for sale here, so you will not be able to get anything but black or white headphones to replace whatever you send to them."
"I bought these to replace my aging pair of Bose over ear headphones from 2017. I will say the sounds quality is absolutely amazing. The base the fidelity, just wow. But the quality of materials and the fit feel cheap, and too tight. Also makes my ears overheat which never happened with my previous pair. I'm going to return and try the higher end version and hope it's better."
"Android phones have issues connecting the QC45 headphones to the Bose Music App.For a $200+ product you'd expect all features to work properly. The App on the Google Play store was last updated Jan 2023. Yeah 2 years ago. Which is likely why no one can connect their headphones to the app. The good news is the headphones do connect to my Android phone and laptops via bluetooth no problem. The factory settings are good enough for me, but it would of been nice to have access to the app to dial in the EQ some more. But for me they sound good without having to tinker. The Active Noise cancelling works great. The only other issue which is fairly common on bluetooth is latency issues with watching music videos on youtube. The sound is about half a second behind the singer. But if your just watching a youtuber doing a podcast it's not as noticeable. But for audio books and listening to regular music playlists they do the trick. But forget about the app. If the app's features are important to you,  don't get these with any android device. Garbage app. A ton of bad reviews on the App store regarding the ""Bose"" App. I should of done a better job of researching these, but amazon has them rated very high. Oh well. Good luck."
"The audio is fantastic! I love how sound proof it really is. And it’s soooo comfortable !So why 3 starts? The connection is a bitch. It can’t just be Bluetooth, you have to download an app that only works about half the time to connect your headphones to your phone... actually I take that back, even the app can’t connect the device to my phone. I have to go through BT settings (which is fine!) but, Every time I go to connect, I have to forget the device and reconnect to it. Very frustrating compared to the easy set up of other audio devices the beats to JBL. I should just be able to select the device and it connects without whatever is happening. And yes, I keep my iOS up to date along with the app."
"I don't know a whole lot about music quality. I'll go ahead and put that out there. However, I love listening to music, it is a large part of my life, just don't expect any technical terms here.I'll also start by saying that the only listening device I had before this was my AirPod Pros, so this is mostly compared to them.Pros:I think the sound quality is nice. At least as an average music-listener, ie someone who uses them almost every day and just enjoys hearing music while doing daily tasks or working out, I enjoy the quality. I don't think they dim my playlists or make any song less enjoyable. Every song comes through just how I expect it.I care a whole lot about Noise Cancellation. When I was looking into a headset to buy I turned some very nice seeming ones down solely because I saw a couple reviews upset about noise cancellation. I feel very good about the quality of NC I've gotten with these. They drown most everything out as long as something is playing and have satisfied me when trying to drown out others' conversations and other background noise.They are comfy! I could wear these all day if feel like. I've never had my ears or head hurt while wearing them, even after a couple hours.They fold up nicely into their case. I was intent on finding a pair that I could fold up and this pair fulfills that.Cons:My biggest con is that you can't hold them on the sides while listening to music. Maybe this is just a me thing, but when I'm super into a song, I press on the sides to make it louder and more prominent in my ears. You can't touch the sides without it going into transparency mode. And it announces, ""Transparency Mode"" which ruins the whole thing. Probably a niche complaint but something that has definitely irritated me.Transparency mode is no good. It plays a loud fan noise no matter the background noise that ruins the song or video you might be watching. Completely ruined a call I had been waiting on because the other side answered and I couldn't hear them because of this fan noise, and didn't realize it was the headphones (I was outside so thought it was the busses going by) until it was too late.Can't say ""Hey Siri..."". I like using my AirPods when working out so that I can say ""Hey Siri, skip this song"" without pausing what I'm doing. That's a No-Go with these.If I'm doing workouts lying down, they slide off my ears, so I have to hold them which as previously mentioned turns them into ""Transparency Mode!""The buttons click cheaply. I'm not exactly sure how to explain this but when you click them they feel cheap and echo through the whole headseat.Overall/Long story short...I think this is a good pair for someone on a budget (as I am). All of these cons I can get over because I don't have the money to upgrade, and in my stage of life I feel good about what these bring me. The sound quality keeps me enjoying my favorite songs and allows me to wear them while working out, or to wear them for along time, so I feel good about my purchase. If you care about the perfect fit, or the perfect quality, you probably need to look into some higher price points. ( appreciate the comfort and quality but have had issues with the mechanics (falling off when laying down, transparency mode happening when I don't want it). Would not recommend the quality over AirPod Pros but have enjoyed them as my headphone option."
"Let me preface this by saying that I bought these mainly for the noise cancelling, to use both to focus when working/watching media on my PC and to mitigate external sound when sleeping. I actually don't really listen to music that often and can't say much about the audio quality beyond ""it's acceptable"". I do have many things to say about the other two use cases though.When using it on the PC :As long as you plan to use it by BT you should be fine. I had some trouble getting it to connect at first but I blame that on my PC being old (Win 7), I made it work somehow by using a newer BT dongle, the fact that it somehow works at all on such an old setup is a plus to me, whether this was intentional or not. There's two inconveniences though :1.- Even though you can connect by 3.5mm, the product listing doesn't tell you anywhere that NC or EQ features are not supported during this mode. What's worse, apparently the feature WAS supported a few years ago, but it got disabled by a firmware update somewhere down the line because of some bogus reason (the fact that more expensive models that came after this still support the feature is kinda fishy too). If you were an old user, this was a choice, whether you wanted to update or not, but new buyers will find that the product now ships with the latest firmware when you buy it, so you're stuck with it. I wouldn't blame you if you just assumed NC should work over 3.5mm, as it is a normally a standard feature in this price range, even worse, a lot of the reviews out there on the product are from the time when the feature was available, so people deciding to buy without doing research or based on old information are in for a bad surprise. As it is now, when you use 3.5mm the logic part of the headphones is completely turned off and only the speakers work, so you're left with the regular unfiltered sound, and to put it frankly, the audio quality like this is terrible and not worth it, do not buy these if you plan to use 3.5mm at all, you'll be sorely disappointed.2.- Speaking of NC and EQ, those features have several options that can be adjusted to your liking through a phone app. This is a good thing as the default config may not suit everybody's use case, what's not so good is tying these adjustments to a phone app only. Why do I have to switch over to my phone when I want to adjust a setting on the fly instead of being able to do it directly from my computer? What if something happens to my phone or the app stops working/gets pulled from the store sometime in the future? A PC app would have been a great alternative, and being able to modify some of the options just by using buttons would have been even better.When using as a sleep aid :This is gonna be a very picky and niche use case, but sometimes, I may be woken by unexpected noise in the middle of the night, at that point I like to be able to grab my NC headphones and put them on as soon as possible, without having to think too much about it or turn on the lights, to be able to go back to sleep. This product fails in that regard in several ways.First, the case that they ship with : The headphones only fit in when you fold them inwards a specific way, taking them out and unfolding them is a bit cumbersome and I wish they would have given you a bigger case in which the headphones fit normally without doing this. I think the idea is to make it so it takes less space when packing them or something, but the case is fairly big as it is, so if you want to save space you're probably gonna take them out of it anyways. Should keep the folding ability but make the case itself bigger so you don't need to store them folded.Turning on the thing is also unnecessarily complicated, the power button is same size and shape as every other button, and you have to hold it for 3 secs to turn it on, again, not the fastest or easiest thing to do in the dark. My generic brand headphones from similar price range but much older have a single slide toggle switch, it's size and shape are different from the other buttons and turning it on just takes a flick, I would much have preferred something like that.Once the thing is actually on, turns out it will turn itself off after a few minutes if it's not paired to anything. So if you want to just use the NC by itself, though luck, you better have your phone nearby with BT turned on so you can connect to it, even if you don't play anything on it. Again, not the fastest thing to do when you're on bed.Lastly, and this is a minor gripe, the device has an LED status light to indicate whether it's ON, in pairing mode, etc. For some reason the thing is perpetually blinking regardless of state. I can understand for pairing mode, but why not just make it solid when it's actually connected? If I take off the headphones and lie them around on my desk and forget about it, I can't tell from a quick glance if they're ON or OFF, I have to stare carefully for a few seconds to see if the blinking comes on and what color it is to know what's going on. Annoying.""Better sleep"" function :This is a feature of the app, it is not highlighted that often but a few reviews mention it, as one of the few people that could make use of it, I will give my thoughts on it : It's basically a white noise machine, you have a few white noise loops to choose from and you can adjust the volume of each one individually so you can mix and match to your liking, so for example, you can have loud rain with faint sounds of birds in the background or vice versa. You can also set a timer for how long this will play for. It's a handy feature but nothing exceptional, the stock noises are limited and may not be of everybody's liking, the loops also feel kinda short. I find myself using mostly the rain only. If you're into this, chances are you probably already have your own long white noise loops saved on your phone anyways, which would work just as well.Good things :Putting all that negativity aside, I do think the hardware itself is very good at this price range. The NC has 3 different settings and is worth trying them all out to see which one works better for your environment, it won't silence everything a 100%, but it works much better than my previous cheapy headphones, and I doubt you can get much better NC at this price range. The headphones are comfortable and I have no problem sleeping with them or wearing them for hours. Is hard to tell how well the build will hold over time, but after a month of usage, nothing has broken yet. The battery is LONG and I only have to charge it once a week if anything. Although it's not something I was even aware when I bought the product, turns out it has a built in mic and it's surprisingly good quality, I have been able to do many long voice calls with it with no complains about the quality from the other party so far.Overall, despite the poor user experience and having to adapt to its many quirks, I do find this product useful and plan to keep using it in the future. I just hope when/if I upgrade sometime in the future, that the newer products on the line don't suffer from the same usability problems."
"The noise canceling feature and the ability to toggle it is fantastic, but putting it's mode toggle as a tap and hold on the earphone is a stupid novelty gimmick. It adds no value or convenience, I just activate it by accident taking them on or off. This ""feature"" is something I predict is just more likely to break than if it had just been a toggle switch where all the rest of the control buttons are.The headset can get a little uncomfortable if you have a big head and wear it a LONG period of time, but I don't hold this against it. I recognize I just have a big head.The battery life is great, and I hope it holds up. They claim it can get a 4 hour charge with only 5 minutes of charging time. I have not had a chance to test the veracity of this claim, but it feels a little dubious. Not every USB is the same, not every USB slot has the same electrical output. I had it plugged into my computer for an hour or so and the headset was still dead. I had to plug it into a cellphone usb power brick that goes directly into an electrical outlet. It's a HUGE bummer if you can't charge, even if slowly, through a PC USB. I did not take the time to try other USB ports to see if its just a difference between USB 1/2/3, but if it HAS to be through a USB power brick this should have 100% been included with the product.The USB charging cable it comes with is only 6-8ish inches. It would have been nice if the cable was 3 feet and you could use the headset as a wired headset in a bind, but using while charging is apparently not an option at all. What a shame.Sound quality is fine but not great. About what I expect for wireless and at this price point. This is not a complaint, but just don't purchase expecting to be wow'd the second you put them on.It comes with a stupid app to unlock some settings/features. I know this is basically standard, but it's still annoying. I don't want another app or software for every single piece of technology I own and having all its features available on the device, out of the box would be a big value add for me.It took nearly 2 weeks of the order just sitting in the system before it was processed/sent out. This isn't some niche product, there's no reason I can fathom it should take this long. What's the point in offering different delivery priorities if they all amount to ""no time particularly soon."""
"I’m giving these headphones a 3-star rating based on my personal preferences and what I was specifically looking for. They’re not bad, but they fell short of my expectations for true noise isolation/cancellation without audio.What I Was Looking For:I wanted headphones that could effectively block out background noise (e.g., a TV on low volume) without needing to play music or sound. Unfortunately, these didn’t meet that standard.Testing & Observations:1. Noise Cancellation Without Audio:Straight out of the box, I put them on and tested with the TV playing at a low volume. I could still hear everything clearly.2. Noise Cancellation With Audio:Low Volume: Even with music playing softly, I could still hear the TV clearly.Medium Volume: While the volume level increased (indicator light turned red), the TV was still audible about 10 feet away.Full Volume: This muted the TV significantly, but faint sounds still came through.3. Ambient Noise Mode via App:I loved the option to play ambient sounds like rain or thunder. This could be great for relaxing or reading.However, the feature didn’t block out surrounding noise effectively, even for its intended purpose (e.g., sleep).Positives:Comfort: These headphones are extremely comfortable, which is a huge plus for long-term wear.App Features: The variety of soundscapes in the app is a nice touch, especially for creating a calming environment.Why I Returned Them:While the comfort and app features were tempting, the primary purpose of these headphones (noise cancellation) didn’t match what I was seeking. I already own a pair of headphones that block noise better, so I couldn’t justify keeping these despite their comfort.Final Thoughts:If you prioritize comfort and enjoy added app features like ambient sounds, these might be a great fit. However, for those looking for serious noise isolation/cancellation, especially without audio, these may not meet your expectations."
"After rocking the Soundcore Q20 vs Q30 on a side by side test, it turns out the SoundCore Q20 are the better headphones. The Soundcore Q20 are easier on the ears and doesn't fall off of your head easily from bending over or shaking your head. The Q30 fall off after a light shake and I have a big head. Trust me. The soundcore Q20 surprisingly has a better sound quality but the Q30 can play music with a larger range of frequencies. There are in no way Bose Headphones (Q20) but they do hold their own and worth the money. I am sadded because I chose the q30 due to many YouTube reviewers reviews and honestly thought the upgrade would have been worth it. So here it is...The Sound Core Q30 has okay sound. the q20 sounds better overall and i don't need an app to adjust the sound. I find that the app helps but I don't like going back to the app just to adjust to the type of music i listen too. It becomes more annoying to keep going back and forth. The bass in the q30 when adjusted is amazing! However, as I said, you are going to have to keep going back and forth to adjust to the sound which gets annoying.  The SoundCore Q30 are a cool looking set of headphones but they hurt my ears. I am not sure why they hurt my lower ears so much but they do. i think i might need them to wear in because they are to tight at the bottom of my ear lobs but not tight in the middle so that they don't fall off of my head. Not a good choice of materials unfortunately. I also didn't like the noise canceling feature since it was on and I could still hear everything like the AC running in the background. Something that doesn't happen with the Q20. The headphones will need some getting used to but I think that with the price being twice of the q20 then it's not worth the upgrade and to just stick with the q20 w/hard case instead of the q30. I DO like how to SoundCore Q30 has a hard case. Very nice and a plus. Adds a touch of elegance for a budget headset. Anyways, I did also upgrade the firmware and it didn't help to much. I think the q20s are the way to go and just save the rest of your money. I'll update if it gets better over time or if I hate it enough to return.Update***I ended up buying another pair of Q30's to see if my first one was defective and it could have been. Reached out to Sound core but no one ever responded so I just purchased another pair and returned the old pairs.Do I think the upgrade is worth the money? No. It's not worth the money from the Q20's. I gave the Q20's a better review and should have kept them vs these but that's okay. The noise cancellation is not really noise cancellation. It's more like noise isolation. My ac runs and it doesn't make much noise and I can still hear it  with the noise cancellation on and the music playing. I swear I am not kidding. The noise cancellation was way better on the Q20 then they are on the Q30s. I think (am not sure) that the reason why there is noise still coming in is because the padding around the ear is thinner than the q20. I think that's the reason but noise cancellation is on (as I type) and I can still hear the air blowing. If I can hear the air blowing now in my house as I work from home then I know I am going to need another pair of headphones for flights and stuff to block out the noise which kinda negates the purpose of these because I was hoping they would cover all my bases. That's okay.Anyways, I wear these for work about 9 hours a day 4 days a week and then 2 hours a day at the gym three times a week and another 2 hours a day studying for school about 6 times a week. I have music playing in the background for school so i get to know headphone pretty quickly. First thing is first is that they still hurt my ears. Mostly towards the top of the ears after and hour or two I have to take them off to not make my ears to sore. The Q20s were comfortable AF and comfort wise the Q20's were better. However, the Q30s do not cause a lot of sweating around the ears, something the Q20's is known for. Like the Q20's makes me sweat big time around the ears and I don't sweat easily. The Q30's win there but they could have kept the memory foam like the q20s but just used a different material instead of the faux leather is they were trying to address the issues. maybe the q40s will have it down the road who knows.The factory setting is not as good as the q20s and I hate going back to the app to adjust everything for every song. I still haven't figured out the custom settings in the app and it is what it is. However, once adjusted the Q30's do take off and sound awesome but i just personally don't like changing settings all the time so for now I am just keeping them at factory settings.I like the part where you can put your hand over you right ear and it changes the settings. That's the best feature of these head phones to be honest! Love it ! I play with it sometimes and IDK, I personally like the feature. Overall, soundcore does make good products and i've watched all the youtube videos and read a lot of the reviews and I think the youtube videos are full of crap because I think a lot of what they touched base on was more of a selling point then actual feature but I get the game. If you review the headphones in a positive light and you'll get more views and more request to do more videos. Anyways, the headphones are not bad. They are okay at best and at worst. I think a solid 3 stars is appropriate. If you want to get them go for it but you might need to lower your expectations from what the youtubers are Reddit Forums are saying. They are okay and the case is a nice touch. If you want to save money then go with the Q20's and save $40. If you want the hard case , like me, then just get the q30's because that's the best feature of this product. Case is cool and very sturdy and included with the purchase!*Update,The noise cancellation is non existent. I have to blast the music to shut down the noise. Id say, just get some AirPods Pro's and save your money. Doesn't work well on airplanes either."
"I’ve had these guys for at least 7 months now, and I absolutely loved them when I first got them. They were comfortable, had great sound, connected to my devices easily, were portable, and most importantly, had a pretty good price. The MAIN problem I have with them, is that they are unfortunately not durable. Within the first 3 or 4 months of having them, one side of the headphones cracked in half, and I had to superglue it (I know, “Why don’t you just throw them out and buy a new pair?”, I’m a broke college student.) Then, a few weeks later, it broke, this time chipping off some pieces of the black plastic. Again, superglue, despite the missing pieces. Now, just today, the end—where it had already cracked—completely broke off (randomly! I gave it the slightest tug!) AND the complete other end of the headphone (with the OTHER speaker) cracked in half, just as it had done the first time (mind you—that end was perfectly fine for months!) At this point, I have to buy a new pair of headphones, but it’s ridiculous that this pair couldn’t even last a year. Please make these more durable, because they’re really great headphones in every other way, and I really love them, I just can’t handle constantly having to superglue the pieces together when I haven’t been handling them roughly in any way, shape, or form. The images attached are both the left and right side of the headphones."
"***To clarify I did try getting help for the issue much earlier but the headphones were just out of warranty. The issues started popping up and getting worse a few months into having these, however.So before getting into the problem I wanna say that these ARE a wonderfully well-rounded set.Sound feels actually decently alive for bluetooth standards, like I wouldn't say there's any aspect where these headphones are amazing but I just liked the balance.Now, the issue: about a year into use the noise cancelling started really melting down.Weird popping noises...a weird, metallic tinny noise that has only gotten worse with time.At least ""normal"" mode seems to work right and transparency also sorta still works so not all is lost, though it's a bit awkward as I can't justify getting another pair just  for the NC feature and well that's actually half the reason why I got these to begin with!"
"I love my soundcore motion boom/plus. Love them and soundcore app. So, the Q30 looked like a winner. Great price and reviews, and my previous experience with soundcore has been great. I really want to love these headphones, I was so excited to get them. They are awesome in every way...except, do they size these for basketballs? Seriously, I'm a big guy and I've never had headphones, winter knit hats, or ball caps be too big. These absolutely do sound great, cover my ears nice, and feel very comfortable. Indoors they hugged my head okay but not snug. Certainly not snug enough for exercising or working out. But, I bought these mostly to wear while on my loud tractors mowing and plowing snow. The noise cancelling feature sealed the deal. I had chores outside and repairs to do on my truck, so I put them on and went outside. Now, it's pretty cold here in January, so it was nice to have tunes and my ears covered. But, once outside in the cold I was constantly sliding them back in place because they're not snug enough. The headband doesn't have enough tension, I cannot imagine smaller guys or women not having issues with these slipping off their head, also. When leaning over my truck engine they would almost fall off if not for grabbing them. I think they have less tension in the cold because I was constantly repositioning them while outside. Very frustrating. They do sound great, super bass, the app just dials your preferences in, and battery life is incredible. The noise cancellation worked great outside, it was very windy and my air compressor is very loud. Both were drowned out well. The transparency mode is nice and works better than expected. The noise cancellation does not do nearly as well with voices on indoor mode. With noise cancellation on any setting, it doesn't work well blocking people talking, like TV background or I suppose an office or similar environment. It just wasn't very good at that. I was surprised because if worked so well at wind and much louder compressor noise. Inside my aquariums and heat register noises virtually disappeared. I haven't worn then using my tractors yet, but honestly I worry they'd fall off if I tilted my head down and I'd drive over them. The control buttons aren't as intuitive as I'd like, but I guess more time wearing them this really wouldn't be an issue. Phones calls worked great, also. People I spoke to while wearing these said I was clear and sounded good. The hard case is nice, not available with the Q20/20+ or Q10 models. I'm not sure if I got a pair with a bad headband or if anker makes these specifically for melonheads and volleyballs. Most people don't have a bigger noggin than I do. They definitely got more loose in the cold. So, i am concerned how much metal, if any, is in the headband, and how durable the plastic will be, especially in the cold. I really want to love these and they have features not found in other headphones that don't cost hundreds. Returning these will be a difficult decision because they dound great, their price, features, and soundcore's reputation. But, if they won't stay snug on my head what's the point, right? Real bummed, I spent so many hours deciding on these. If soundcore sees this and believes a different set will stay put like they should I'd be very happy. I'll update this review if that happens because I  won't find another over ear anc headphone in this price with these features. Now with that said, if you're looking for portable BT speakers that play LOUD with SUPER bass and forever battery, buy their moton boom, or get the smaller motion plus for indoors. Both awesome, you will not regret that."
"For the money, you can't beat these headphones. The sound is great and the battery on these last forever.- Type C charging- button controls on right side- noise canceling works great. I don't use any other setting.- hardcase is nice but feels like a puzzle sometimes.- comfortableThe reason for 3 stars is mainly the ear cup on the left side is ripped and the foam is starting to pop out. I use these everyday so they do take a beating but I was expecting a little longer than a year of use.The only other thing that annoys me is the touch sensitive ""button"" for transparency mode. I don't use transparent mode that much to need it and gets to be a hassle.I'd buy another pair for this price."
"Other reviewers have praised the same things I love about this headset; the thing that I love the most is the battery life and charge speed. Coming from Anker this isn't surprising, but these things can go all day, let you play music all night when you fall asleep with them on, then still have power for the next day.The audio may sound off if you're an audiophile kind of person, but if that's enough to bother you then you should already know how to apply an equalizer (per app is best for me; my music app applies one equalizer, a different one for podcasts. The included app is okay but applies profiles to all sound from your phone.) If you WANT to drop into thicc bass land for a little trap or dubstep you have that ability, but for most applications I find myself cutting a little bass.Now lets talk about why you should be SURE these are the headphones you want before buying them.Do you wear glasses? Be careful.As I mentioned, these are comfortable enough to sleep in. But once you put your glasses on two things happen: first, you break the noise canceling seal. My frames aren't huge or thick in any way, but the noise canceling is significantly worse when I'm wearing my glasses. Second: they'll squeeze the frames into your head. I don't know what it is about this design, but my Bose and Astro headsets don't suffer from it. It was tight enough to give me a headache after a few hours. Does that mean the headset at least won't slide around on your head? No. I still wear a hat to keep it in place.Do you tilt your head? Be careful.Another review mentioned that the voice when changing modes is robotic and jarring and that's pretty accurate. Switching between modes means losing your audio for a second and a half and suddenly getting a full volume robot woman announcing ""TRANSPARENCY"" ""NOISE CANCELLING"" in the middle of your podcast you're trying to focus in on. Furthermore, while wearing a t-shirt (or none), making contact between the right earcup and your shoulder will also change modes. This might be a plus for some people but it only serves to annoy me.Do you intend to use these with multiple devices? Be careful.A big selling point on these was the idea of using it with my phone and computer seamlessly to hand audio off when I step away from my desk. What I got was a hacky, frustrating guessing game of what the headphones FEEL like doing. For instance, if paired to my Windows 10 computer, in order to play audio from my phone, I have to change the output device on the computer to something else and ensure nothing is playing audio to the headset. And that's IF I was able to connect it to both devices. It seems like I HAVE to power everything on, then explicitly connect with my phone, then my computer. Of course, half the time the headset automatically connects to my computer first and requires me to go into the settings to disconnect it before I can connect with my phone.This feature basically doesn't exist. Don't count on it working and let yourself be surprised when it does.I've been in contact with customer support and was told this is all intended behavior and some of it may be addressed in future firmware updates, so it's not a faulty model. I've had these and used them daily for about the last two months and while I obviously didn't return them, I wish I had spent more up front for a better product.Edit: with the release of firmware 2.1 for these headsets the voice is now quieter. Now I notice exactly how long it cuts audio to talk for no reason. Pause your podcast before switching modes. Some gentle beeps with the audio changing would be ideal; this trend of speakers using heavily compressed voices needs to go on mute."
"These sound great, a 5-star in my opinion, but the noise cancelling is just a 3-star at best in my opinion. But here are the things that earn these cans an overall 2-star rating.First, they are designed horribly! Obviously nobody at Anker Life tried using these while lying back on a pillow or with their arms up & their hands behind their head. If they had they would have realized in a few short moments just how easy it is to accidentally press the buttons on the back edge of each ear ""can"" with the pillow or their hands, especially if they turn their head even slightly. The only solution is to turn them around so the left can is on the right ear & the right can is on the left ear - of course all stereo-tuned movies & tv shows will be ruined because sounds that are coming from the left side of the show will play in your right ear & sounds from the right will play in your left ear! That is a terrible option & payoff when you want to lie back & chill to your tunes or tv so minus one star.The next design flaw is the 'touch the right for two seconds' feature to change between normal/noise cancelling & transparancy. That has the exact same issue as the buttons on the back of the cans because every time you're lying back & need to turn your head to the right your pillow covers the right can & two seconds later it changes your noise cancelling settings! Same thing if you leave your hands behind your head as you look to the right for a few seconds - or it happens if you are wearing them backwards so none of the buttons are being pressed & you look to the left for a few seconds. Trust me, it happens waaay more often than you might think it will & it become infuriating very quickly - so minus a second star.Third is the most disappointing design flaw I've experienced with any pair of cans I've owned in years: they won't work while charging! My last three pair of cans I've owned over the last decade ALL still played WHILE they were charging - even the four pairs I've returned because they sounded like absolute garbage still worked while charging! It's lucky these charge in 5 minutes for roughly 4 hours of play time or I would have given these only one star before returning them! As it is I've still had them run out too many times during a long day of writing while zoning to my tunes & NOTHING ruins my train of thought or writing sesh more than my headphones interrupting by saying, ""Battery Low"", every minute even though they could probably keep playing more than fifteen minutes longer which was the longest I could ever take hearing them tell me the battery was low over & over every freaking minute! These are the most bone-headed design flaws I've ever seen & because there was no mention of them being forcably off while charging anywhere before or after buying them or mentioning the horribly annoying battery off announcement even single minute before buying them I nearly gave them a one-star rating here. But instead I'm only giving them their third star off.So you might ask why did I give them two stars? First is the app that allows you to change the EQ between something like twenty presets or to your own custom EQ settings. That's definitely a huge sound plus especially for the greatly improved bass compared to the bass setting out of the box so the app is a must & is worth one star.Next is the bluetooth functionally. I can go anywhere on the same floor of my house as the device they are paired with & to many points one floor up or down without losing any sound or sound quality at all! I can literally be at complete opposite ends of my home from my paired device on the same floor & the connection stays solid - & my house is a fairly decent sized dwelling. They pair with two devices with ease & then dump one to connect to a third like butter! That's great when you've got it BTed to your phone for controlling with the app as well as BTed to your TV, then you wanna jump onto say, your computer for some gaming & need to BT to it while keeping it BTed to your phone. It's easy-peasy, so yeah, the excellent Bluetooth capabilities earn it a second star in my book.In quick conclusion: three stars off for terribly bone-headed design flaws that will really disappoint if not ruin your listening experience versus two stars for an EQ app & great BT? That adds up to finding another pair of cans to buy in my opinion because I honestly wish I had bought the other pair I was looking at instead of these.I hope these opinions of mine help."
"I have had almost exactly two years of using these at work, M-F daily, 4-8 hours, in an open office. to give them fair credit they sounded fine, noise cancelling was better than listening to an open office, but no where near as good as my BOSE QC35.  You can still hear people and talking in the background, and traffic, but if you turn the volume up a fair bit you can cut that noise (outside of a 20' range) out and just hear music. Positive -that  works out because when your colleagues call you over the desk, even with a little bit of music you can still hear and respond them, Negative - if one of your colleagues are having a meeting within 10' you can hear every word without turning the music volume up quite high, on that note the noise cancelling is mediocre.  but better than an open office - JUST.noise cancelling: 60%.  not in the same league as the big players, but its o.k for $60.  battery:  90%  they have a good battery life, more than adequate for 8hrs listening daily.comfort:  70%  tend to clamp a little bit hard on the head for prolonged use, but are very light. When i first started using i would be sore after a days use, but they broke in after a year.Durability: 65%  after 19 months the skin came unglued from the foam pad, as pictured.functionality: 50%  after 20 months the left ear speaker has dramatically reduced volume shifting the listening balance to my right ear.Overall- you get what you pay for, these are not no where near as good in quality or product life as the big players,  I have had my bose QC35 for 5+years still functioning perfect except for the ear pads which need replacement every now and then.  anyone that has reviewed these inside of 2 years is reviewing too quickly.  these are mediocre at best and faults develop.would i buy again? probably not , for open office I will invest in a new pair of higher quality headphones to cut more meeting noise out, it will be worth the money both in quality and durability.how ever, if you are not wanting to spend more than $60 these might 'get you by'"
"I admit to not wanting to spend a hot fortune on some decent noise canceling BT headphones (former owner of the OG Bose pink travel 'phones that lasted 8 years RIP) but this is definitely a case of you get what you pay for. Sound quality is ""meh"" and comes nowhere near my earbuds. And using them with a PC is typically terrible (not the fault of the manufacturer but definitely a PC bluetooth issue); Apple devices works fine but the sound quality is still not great. My biggest issue is the overall build quality. It’s quite cheap feeling, which you notice right out of the box, specifically around the ear pieces, which are made of insubstantial plastic. The metal headpiece is decent but again, the general materials feel subpar. I'm comparing them to higher end 'phones that I have (LogiG, SteelSeries, Audio-Technica) so that's probably unfair, but I did hope that they would be just slightly better quality than they are; especially at the initial price point of $85.99. Makes sense that they're dropping the price to $61. Even so, that's not a small chunk of change for a noise canceling headset and I'd hope to get something of more substantial quality for that. YMMV."
"Follow up review:  Look at the photo.  The fabric that holds the foam ear cushions failed completely.  It's not repairable.  The fabric started tearing more than a year ago.  Bit by bit , the tear grew until it got to the condition you see in the photo.  The headphones are completely unusable now.This isn't acceptable.  Fabric doesn't cost a lot.  They should use a better quality fabric that will last longer.  This is no longer a set of headphones.  It is now a piece of electronic waste - because of Anker using the cheapest fabric they could find.My original review is below the dashed line----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The main reason I bought the Life Q30 headphones is to listen to the TV news each evening while I'm preparing and eating dinner.  The TV is in the living room, and the kitchen/dining area is around a corner from the TV in the living room.  I had to turn the TV volume up pretty loud so I can hear it in the kitchen over the noise of the stove fan, the microwave oven, etc.After repeated complaints from my wife and daughter about how loud the TV was, I started using a pair of bluetooth ear buds that I bought a couple of years ago for less than $20 - pretty cheap, but they worked OK.  Instead of blasting the TV, I heard it through the earbuds.  They are a bit on the quiet side - and the don't have noise cancelling.  So I decided that I would splurge on a better quality over-the-ear headset for listening to the evening news while making/eating dinner, and I bought the Life Q30s.I have used them in the kitchen and also connected to my phone and my computer for phone calls and Zoom calls.  Here is what I have experienced:Pros:•  Sound quality is good, especially for this price point.  Bass is a bit too strong for me on the default settings but...•  The phone app lets you adjust the equalizer.  I set it to Flat, which reduced the bass and it sounds better.  I think the UI of the app could be less cluttered and a bit more intuitive, but it's not terrible.•  It's comfortable.  I have a pretty big head.  The longest I have worn the Q30 for a single stretch is about 90 minutes.  During that period, I'm aware that the earphones are pressing on my ears with a bit of pressure, but it's not bad.  The ear cups are big and soft - and any over-the-ear headphones need to put pressure on your ears to stay on your head and make a tight acoustic seal.•  Noise cancellation is good.  With NC set to ""Indoor"" mode, it is very effective at cancelling out the stove fan noise in the kitchen and the noise of cars outside my window during Zoom calls.  I'm very happy with the noise cancellation.•  Microphone quality is good.  People hear me loud and clear on Zoom calls.Cons:•  Every time you change modes (for example if you switch the noise cancellation mode, or turn transparency on and off), a voice that is much louder than it needs to be announces the change you just made.  It's pretty jarring.  I recommend a firmware change that let's you set the volume of that voice, or turn it off altogether if you don't want it.  I would turn it off if I could.  When you change modes, the difference in audio quality is very apparent, which is plenty of indication to you that you've changed modes.  You really don't need a loud voice telling you what you just did.•  When you turn on Transparency mode, the microphone pics up your voice and plays your voice back to you through the earphones.  It's pretty unnerving.  Maybe they had to make the microphones active in Transparency mode to achieve the Transparency effect, but I really wish there were a way to not have my voice play back to me.  I have stopped using Transparency mode because of this.  (I just ask my wife to speak louder!)•  Microwave oven interference.  When the microwave is humming, the Q30s start clicking.  The closer I am to the microwave, the more they click.  The $20 earbuds had much less interference from the microwave oven than the Q30 does.  So there must be a way to design headphones to be less susceptible to microwave noise.So, these aren't perfect, but overall I'm happy with them.  I will continue to use them.  And I really hope there will be a firmware update soon that lets me reduce or eliminate the voice that announces to me every time I change modes of operation.  If that ever happens, this review will change to 4 stars!And if they can modify Transparency mode so that you don't hear your own voice playing back directly into your ears, I would change my review to 5 stars!!!"
"I bought these as my first noise cancelling headphones in early February. I was initially drawn to these because of their lower price, and the people that wrote reviews for this seemed to really enjoy them.I don't know if there was something wrong with these specific headphones in the first place, or if this is a general problem for all headphones of this model, but after the first month, I started having connectivity issues, where the connection would randomly drop out. As time passed, more issues arose; buttons wouldn't work properly, modes would switch without me touching the button, and connectivity problems got worse. I've been treating these headphones very gently, being careful to not drop them or anything, not letting them get wet, etc., so I don't understand why these things would start happening. About three months after I bought these, I stopped using them. (Elaboration below)Button issues:Holding the volume up or down button for one second wasn't always guaranteed to switch tracks, it would sometimes just change the volume.Holding the power button for three seconds wouldn't always turn the headphones off/on, which I found annoying when someone tried to speak to me and I would miss what they said/need them to repeat it.Buttons just straight-up wouldn't work at times as well.Mode switching issue:I'd set the headphone's down (not on the side with the buttons) while they were on noise cancelling mode, and when I picked them back up, they'd be in transparency mode, which was a shock every time.Whenever I tried to adjust volume with my left hand instead of my right, it caused the headphones to switch back from noise cancelling mode into transparency mode. I know this doesn't seem to make any sense, but I'm guessing that there's some kind of wiring issue where the slight twisting motion caused whatever mechanism that switches modes to activate. Except, I didn't think that the modes were supposed to be able to cycle backwards, unless you were using the app.As someone who has sensory issues, having the world suddenly blasted in your ears, especially when all you need is quiet, is really not fun. This mode switching issue has also happened while I was running the air compressor in our dive locker, and if anyone knows how loud a compressor is, imagine having your headphones suddenly blast that noise into your ears. (For anyone else, the best comparison I can make is if you decided to put your ear right next to a large lawn mower engine, and then make it about five times louder).Connectivity issues:I'd turn the headphones on, and they'd refuse to connect to my phone, or they wouldn't automatically connect to my phone. This may have been user error on my part though, I don't know.Randomly dropping connection was another issue. I'd be walking to class and suddenly my music would stop, and when I checked my phone, it said my headphones were no longer connected. Then I'd have to turn them off and back on again, which was annoying because of the issues mentioned previously.Other comments: (positive first, then negative)Comfort level: actually very comfortable, I really like the ear cups (very squishy and comfortable), and the headband is pretty flexible, so the headphones don't squeeze my head even after wearing them for long periods of time. They're also not too bulky, and I could put string bag and purse straps over my head and across my body without having them catch on the headphonesButton organization: easy to find and distinguish from one another, I like how they're spaced out so you don't accidentally press one button instead of another. I also like how the play/pause button is not in between the volume button, so it's not a guessing game of will I change the volume or will I press play/pauseOverall sound quality: pretty good, not the best, but the other headphones I'm comparing these to were much more expensive (I'd look at other reviews if you want better descriptions on sound quality)Noise cancelling quality: decent, it does the job, but again, there's better. I did enjoy that there were multiple modes of noise cancelling, so I would be able to change how much I could cancel out.Mode switching: I wish I didn't have to pass through transparency mode every time I wanted to get to noise cancelling mode, I know you can just switch directly to it if you use the app, but again, annoyingI'm giving these an overall two stars because I don't know if these were just problems specific to my headphones or if anyone else is having these issues, but I did find them really comfortable to wear and I liked the button arrangement."
"Summary: Has a good sound & battery life but noise cancelling mode only muffles, transparency mode has issues, and they have a poor user design experience across the board. They’re not bad for the price point, but I probably wouldn’t repurchase.Pros:- Comfortable- Good sound- Excellent battery life- No connectivity issues- Switches between multiple devices easily- Easy to adjust to your headCons:- Noise cancelling mode is certainly not noise cancelling, but it does muffle a lot. Not bad for the price point, but not accurately advertised- Transparency mode has a weird whooshing sound- L/R symbols poorly placed. The L/R symbols are inside of the ear pieces, so you don’t really see them unless you go out of your way to check.  Putting them on the right way matters a lot since each side has different controls. I wish there was a tactile or at least more obvious externally visible way to distinguish between the left and right side. I want to be able to put them on without having to thinking about it. I also want to be able to put them on the right way in the dark.- Their tap to switch to transparency feature isn’t well designed. The feature is supposed to make it quick and convenient to hear someone talking to you, but I don’t think they fully followed through on that logic since switching to transparency mode via tap does not also pause what you’re listening. That kind of defeats the point of the feature in my opinion. Might as well take your headphones all the way off at that point.- The tap to switch to transparency feature is SO easy to accidentally activate when you’re just adjusting your headphones/taking them on or off. The placement wasn’t well thought through.- They have 5 rectangle buttons that all feel essentially the same, so it can be hard to keep straight which button does what. I would have loved to see some of the buttons be different shapes to help further distinguish them from each other.- I wish there was some kind of visible cue when they power on/off. Something like a brief light flash that is common in so many devices like these. The only way to confirm that you held the button long enough for it to actually turn off is by putting them back on to listen."
"Used these for both work and pleasure.  Plastic is cheap quality.  Bought in August, the are broke easily from normal use.  Also had lots of connection probelms with my laptop.  I would have to reboot the computer just to get them to stay connected during meetings.  They would be fully charged and would drop during Zoom calls.The noise canceling was good. But leaving on a trip tommorrow and now have no headphones for the trip. When they worked, they worked well, but seem to be more of a hassle than with easier use."
"I thought I could use these headphones as a gaming headset, but the mic stops working every time I plug in the aux cable.Aux is plug-in from the right side, which means the cable tickles my right arm every time I am playing the video game while holding the mouse. Also, the aux cable is too short, I have to buy another one for this.Decent Noise Cancelling, is better than Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, although it's still far from perfect, and I don't think it's active noise canceling, but rather physically blocking the sound outside. However, the noise canceling is not strong enough to block out my roommate's screaming, which is why I bought these headphones with active noise canceling.The neck gets sore and the ear gets hot after wearing it for hours, uncomfortable when wearing it while lying down on the pillow. Moreover, every time I adjust the headphones, I accidentally switch the mode and hear it say loudly ""Transparency  mode"""
"First of all, my review might not be fair so please read this with a grain of salt. I do consider myself an ""audiophile"" which frankly isn't a status symbol of my knowledge on audio, it's simply that I have hole in my pockets from spending on audio gear. I do own several high end TOTL IEMs and Headphones from the likes of Empire Ears, Unique Melody, Meze, Hifiman and Audeze, but I am also trying to be as fair as possible in my review here as I can't compare any of these brands to Soundcore. But on the other hand, I do other ""consumer"" headphones from Sony and JBL, so I'm trying to frame this review around that as a comparison.I was looking for something simple that I can occasionally take with me to the gym, for walks, at an airplane, etc., where I wouldn't be absolutely paranoid about dropping, scratching or breaking them in the process. From the reviews, seemed like a no brainer, but unfortunately after receiving them it was a bit of a disappointment.On the build quality... Plastic""ky"" is the best word to describe these. They feel brittle like its one drop and done, $79 bucks down the drain. The controls on the headphone are also very cheap and finnicky. Even putting them in the case makes me nervous as it crackles just by folding them together. On that note, the case is just way too small, some wiggle room would be nice to make sure there isn't so much pressure on the frame when closing the case.The app is decent, Bluetooth connection is solid just note that it maxes out at AAC so you don't get LDAC (not expected at this price point), but overall solid connection with no issues.Now to the sound. Simply put, EQ can't fix how broken the sound is. Everything sounds muddled up, and when I say everything, it seems like it's the entire frequency range, and not matter how much you cut either the bass or high frequencies it seems like everything is just blended together with very little instrument separation. I tried everything including going to the extreme of building custom profiles in Squig.link against the Harman target and loading them up in Wavelet (Android app) and there's no way to fix it. The only plus to the sound is that it's loud and rarely clips - even with EQ profiles in the +7 to +10 db range for certain frequencies which didn't require any global negative gain adjustments.So to wrap this up, how do these compare to other consumer headsets I own? It can't hold a candle to Sony WH1000XM5 in either sound quality or ANC, but that's still a $400 USD headphone. Now if I compare these with something within a similar price range like the JBL Live 660NC that goes for $99... Unfortunately the Soundcore Q30 can't compete with the exception of ANC, which I think is on par with the 660NC if not slightly better. But in terms of sound quality for an extra $20 it's the 660NC any day of the week, with a much better build quality (sturdy frame, solid build, feels ""premium"") and much better sound quality that is extremely responsive to EQ, with a strong bass that can ""rumble"" if pushed, without muddying the entire mix."
"I had these headphones for about two months and I love them. Fully charged them one time since I had them and use them almost every day at the gym. Great noise, cancellation. The color is cute, but it gets a little dirty lightweight. But the Bluetooth connectivity and mic quality suck. The headphones completely stopped working and now I won’t connect to my phone at all and yes, I have deleted it from my Bluetooth and tried to add back several times."
"I bought these to provide noise cancellation for when I do woodworking in my garage.  The dust collection systems and various tools can be pretty loud.  I've been using shooting ear protectors, which are rated at -37db.  These headphones are no better, and I tried all 3 modes.  The only advantages to them are that I can still hear my music while attenuating the noise, and turn noise cancellation on and off at the touch of a button."
"I loved these headphones and have been using them for about six months. I take good care of them, and have had zero complaints until a little piece of the plastic suddenly fell off today, leaving this big crack. Obviously you're not paying as much for these headphones as some of the high-end, $300++ headphones out there, but I figured I'd at least get a year out of them. They've been really nice, but I guess the material is pretty cheap."
"This is the 1st ANC headphone I've owned and I've been somewhat disappointed with them. The main reason I bought these was because of noisy neighbors and barking dogs from 10pm on. From reading reviews here and other sites I knew that for the price to not expect a miracle but in ANC mode I can very clearly hear the neighbors talking; the barking from the dogs is ever so slightly muffled. And that is with the volume of whatever I'm listening to turned way up.Other issues that make no sense or are annoying concern the headphones, case, and app.1) The headphones apparently don't have an auto-off feature. I've fallen asleep while listening to music and waking up hours after the music has stopped the headphones are still on. I know this because if I turn the music back on it comes through on the headphones. I don't know how much this drains the battery; I assume no signal means no speaker movement, so little battery drain. But if ANC is on then the headphones keep processing any exterior sounds.2) The feature for turning on transparency mode by touching the right ear cup is ridiculous in that it cannot be shut off. You have no idea how many times transparency mode has been turned on because my arm touches the cup when I want to rest my arm over my head when reclining, or reached over to scratch the left side of my head with my right hand.3) The ear cups get unbelievably hot if wearing for more than a half hour. Maybe provide an optional set of gel-filled cups for users in tropical climes.4) The battery indicator, whether it be the voice when the headphones are turned on or the app icon, does not adequately relate to either a percentage or estimated time remaining. Battery ""medium"" means nothing when I hear it over several uses. Medium could mean minutes away from low which gives a false sense of usage remaining.5) When the headphones are turned on there is nothing indicating they are connected to anything. My old headphones would say ""Bluetooth connected successfully."" I've turned on music on my tablet, not realizing the Bluetooth had been shut off, and woken my wife when music started blasting out the speakers. I had assumed the headphones had connected; verbal confirmation would have been nice.6) I wish the drawstring bag with the cables was instead a pouch attached to the underside of the case cover. They'd be less chance of a lost bag of cables or damn drawstrings constantly getting caught in the zipper.7) The 1st time I tried putting the headphones back in the case I was unsure how they went. I realized after almost a week I was putting them in wrong and easily could have ended up with broken headphones. Instructions on this? None.8) The app is entirely useless for users with less than perfect eyesight. Even with all the empty space available the developers see fit to make icons and text so small that a magnifying glass is needed. The icons on the sounds for creating your own ambient ""white noise"" in most cases make no sense. I also can't figure out why some sounds, like a person chewing food, are even there when there are plenty of other natural sounds that could be used, e.g., tree frogs, cicadas, shore birds, channel buoys, etc.The sound quality is nice with a somewhat effective bass boost. But to me the extra money for ANC could have been saved by getting a just-as-effective pair of passive NC headphones."
"I've been a longtime user of the Anker (now Soundcore) Q20 headphones, which I considered to be the perfect blend of price and performance in the realm of noise cancelling wireless over the ear headphones.  I've liked them so much that I've bought several pairs for family members over the years and everyone's always been happy.  So, when my current pair began to show signs of old age (split ear cushion, a battery that doesn't last as long as normal) I decided to purchase these newer Soundcore Q30 headphones as an updated, upgraded replacement.Unfortunately, they're a rare disappointment from this Anker sub-brand.  Whereas the Q20s punched way above their weight class — with noise cancelling and overall sound quality that was shockingly close to the high end products from Bose and Sony — these seem like they would be better suited at a price half of what they're charging.The main attraction to these kinds of headphones, the noise cancelling part, is the biggest letdown.  Despite now offering three different modes (indoor, outdoor, and transport), none of them come anywhere close to the abilities of the one mode on those old Q20s.The second biggest issue, for me, was comfort. The headband is thinner and has less padding than competing headphones.  The earcups are also thinner and lighter, so they don't seal out exterior noise nearly as well as the Q20s do.  Despite being lighter than the older model, they put pressure points on the top of my head and on my ears that made them uncomfortable to wear for more than a half hour.  This lightness also meant they slid around if I turned my head side to side, which caused a lot of noise in noise cancelling mode.I could mitigate the poor noise cancelling performance a little by gently pressing the earcups against my head, but that just made them even more uncomfortable.  This is not an issue with the older, heavier and more padded Q20s.That's not to say that these are all bad, however.  If you mostly listen to music, the addition of multiple EQ modes accessible through the Soundcore app is a welcome way to tweak the sound to your preference.  The ambient sound mode that can be activated by tapping the right earcup is a nice little bonus at this price point, and other than an annoying vocal interruption to the music, it works well.  These headphones will play for hours even with noise cancelling active, and charge over USB-C.  Also, the three noise cancelling modes really do behave differently depending on your needs, it's just none of them work well enough to be useful.Sadly, those few good points are just not enough to overcome the poor noise isolation/cancelling, poor fit and poor comfort issues I experienced.  So, back to my old Q20s I go.One other good thing I will say not specific to these headphones, but to Anker in general is their great customer service.  When I first paired these headphones to my devices, the audio quality was weirdly bad and their support helped me ""factory reset"" them, which fixed the odd hollow sound they had.  And they also sent me free replacement earcups for the old Q20s so I can eke out a few more months of life from them.  So a big thumbs up to Anker customer support, but a big thumbs down to this rare disappointment from their audio brand."
"I’ve owned (and loved) the Soundcore Life Q20’s for several years now. Thought I’d upgrade to Soundcore’s Q30’s for better noise cancellation! And indeed they are awesome at noise cancelling (and battery life!!). HOWEVER, they are also a LOT less comfortable on the ears compared to the Q20. Should not be a trade off between comfort and tight-fitting noise cancellation."
"Finally a product that I felt extremely obligated to leave a review about! As a lifetime audiophile (musician and producer) on a budget, that just wanted some over the ear wireless headphones for occasional times I wanted the freedom to listen to music while tasking where I didn't need to worry about a cord catching on things, but am absolutely not willing to sacrifice sound quality, I was extremely impressed with these. I have owned a variety of amazing headphones over the years spanning a variety of price points from reputable brand names for different purposes (DJing, studio mastering, general listening) and these held up to my high standards. I also spent months shopping around for over the ear BT headphones before I finally purchased these, which included testing as many demos as I could access, as well as purchasing and returning some brand name sets that met my spec requirements and stayed in my budget that ended up being complete disappointments.I was stoked when I found these from doing even more extensive research online and lots of time spent reading reviews. I've even been recommending them to loads of people over the past 10 months since I've purchased a long with a window of time for me to gather experience with using them.I would rate 5 stars if it weren't for the flimsyness of the design and material these are made out of, which I wouldn't expect to hold up to heavy usage over a year's time, but I'm extremely disappointed these already have a HUGE stress crack considering I honestly have not used these a whole lot. (I'm a single mom single handedly raising a child, so I don't have the luxury of being able to listen to music in noise cancelling headphones rarely ever. They've mostly been worn in the summer when I'm gardening. My opportunities that I am able to have my hearing blocked out by music are all used up for producing music and practicing my instruments, which I have completely different playback gear for)Like, if I had to estimate my usage of these thus far measured by how many times I've killed the battery and had to recharge, I think I've charged them no more than 10 times since I got they brand new, and I've ONLY ever used them wirelessly.On that note, the battery life is extremely impressive. I'm just extremely bummed I already have to deal with a broken pair of headphones, when I previously had nothing but amazing things to say about them, cause I can't afford to replace these and shouldn't have to when it hasn't even been a year and I've been trying to take extra care when handling these because of how flimsy they felt right away. I definitely regret not adding on the protection plan, but every single other pair of headphones and earbuds I own I have had for an average of 7 years with no damage, even less expensive pairs. (like, I STILL use all my other headphones that are that old)Sound quality blows every other pair of WIRELESS over the ear headphones out of the water at this price point though. Too bad durability was compromised."
"These are great headphones overall. The battery life is amazing, the sound quality is pretty good, and they fit entirely, and comfortably, over my small ears.The only nagging issue is the touch sensitivity on the right ear cup. Even the slightest touch will change the sound mode and it happens constantly. Even leaning your head on your shoulder will trigger it. It's extremely annoying and there's no way to turn that feature off. I had to disassemble the right cup and remove the cable that connects to the motherboard. There's a tutorial online on how to do it properly. After that, no more issues with it.But I would still highly recommend these headphones nonetheless."
"Love the sound, noise cancelling, fit, comfort, and look off these headphones. However, after just 2 years of very light use at my desk at home the thin vinyl fabric that covers the padding of the left ear has split at the seam so that the foam shows. It's not visible while I'm wearing them but it's still disappointing and reminds me of the cheap headphones that came with walkman cassette playerrs that this would inevitably happen to. Sadly I don't see a way to repair it without gluing my fingers together.  I guess to keep the price down they are going to cut corners somewhere but 2 starts removed because they cheaped out."
I have been using these headphones for more than a year and have never had a problem with the sound quality. They are super poorly made though. Both sides of the headphones have cracked and I have to have them taped up to be usable.
"The box it came in was stained, slightly damaged and sticky for some reason. Other than that it was a pretty good purchase. Colour is just as pretty as the pictures. It’s light and comfortable to wear and the Bluetooth connection was super easy."
"[10 month / ~3 month Update]I gotta lower my rating to a three. I mean, I'd be upsetti spaghetti and put One-Star. But like. I feel like that's reserved for Actively Hating something. And I don't. I love these headphones. They've been a real game changer in how I listen to music and create a personal space. The first pair, the left side just Stopped working three months in. BUT- as you may read below, they were really good about taking care of me and sent me a new pair no problem.My Second pair now, after like 5 or so months? has started pausing every 5 seconds which really puts a damper on music, yanno? So like? I'm not.. MAD or anything I spent $60 almost a year ago, the headphones showed me a good time! But now they're kaput for tunes. Hopefully they still function with my switch/computer as pc headphones. :)I think I'm still within the warranty period, but I don't want to sound like I'm trying to weasel them outta anything so I'll just enjoy my music some other way? S'all good. I still think Anker stuff is pretty good for folks like me who can't afford fanciful things.[Post Customer Service Update]I decided to keep trying to make them work to no avail, but saw Anker provides an 18 month warranty! So I reached out with all the details to their customer service email and within two days! BOOM! They're sending a new set. :) Very happy! And still set on buying a pair for my wife! pobody's nerfect! But these headphones are great![3.5 Month Update]These were great and perfect~! Until last night. They were working fine until I put them to charge for a little bit and the right ear stopped working. The buttons on it still work, and I have to use it 'cos it's all I have now. BUT. Yeah, kinda sucks that randomly after taking care of them for this time that they stop working due to... charging the battery? :( Sad times.  from 5/5 to 3/5 'cos I feel bad doing lower.[Update]So I wore these on a trip across the globe. The noise cancelling function did WONDERS on the plane to drown out the engine and people sounds. It helps when I'm in public spaces, because it cuts down on sensory overload. :) BUT. I was on my trip for 14 days and I didn't need to charge them once. I used them for NC on the plane, with earbuds under them for watching movies. Absolutely worth the price! I'm getting a pair for my fiancee! :)[Original]They not only fit my massive head, but aren't MAX EXTENDED to do it!! There's room to spare!I can blast music and no one else can hear it until i take them off.This is my first intro to noise cancelation and it is really an incredible thing!Uhhhhh... They're good headphones man. Battery life is incredible. I didn't download the app.Aaand it works almost simultaneously on laptop and phone. Though it does bug out a lil. But no biggie to do one at a time. :)"
"My skull candy headphones had broken down and I wasn’t looking for something too special, just a tiny bit of an upgrade. Instead, I fear I might have downgraded in the process.I will say that I’m not an audiophile or anything. I don’t know what a high or low is and I’ll probably never know. Either way, the sound quality in these headphones are truly mediocre. You're not getting anything mind-blowing unless you use the equalizer in the app, and even then, it’s only slightly better than the dingy headphones that high school classrooms had passed around in computer labs. If you’re looking for some bass, definitely do not buy these.This is my first time getting noise cancelling headphones, and I did like how it reduced some of the surrounding noises around me. If you’re using these in the park, it’ll mute out sounds like bugs buzzing and maybe even the engine of a car. Not anything major but it is still a noticeable absence. That being said, I don’t see the point of the transparency mode. Furthermore, it is absolutely infuriating that I can’t switch off the settings for changing ANC modes by holding the right side for a single second. This makes it annoying to use if you prop your head up with your hand. Don’t even try lying on your side with these headphones on. You’ll grow tired of that electronic voice saying “Noise Cancellation Mode” and “Transparency Mode” very quickly.I won’t say I’m the biggest judge in comfort. As long as they fit in my ears, I’m pretty fine with using them. These had a good fit and I didn’t find any problems with it slipping against my head. I will say that the material of the ear pads are similar to those leather couches you would easily peel. Its been about two weeks though and there hasn’t been any damage.Battery life is astonishing. It’s been three days without charging and the battery decreased slightly from high to medium. With the type-C charging, it only takes about an hour to charge them back up.Of course, I would be fine with these headphones if not for the fact that they leak sound. It only takes two volume notches before everyone on campus can hear exactly what music library you listen to. As someone that likes to listen to music in the library, it makes it 1) embarrassing, but 2) completely inappropriate to bring seeing as even playing music in low volumes would still have some sound leaking. My friend has the same headphones and I confirmed it also has the same problem so go figures.If it weren’t for the sound leaking, I would have probably been too lazy to return these. But my irritation is much too high. If you’re using these at home and mostly sitting up on your desk, then these are fine. For me, however, I can’t justify paying $80 for these. I’ll rather take my business elsewhere."
The sound quality is good. Noise cancelling is ok.  Using this for music and movies is good.The microphone is not good. It does not do well for gaming or phone calls
"have had these a year and padding is starting to rip. The sound also leaks, so if you're in a quiet office, people will be able to hear your music."
"I first purchased this product in September of 2023. I won’t lie I’ve gotten 2 pairs of Q30s. The first pair were defective and Amazon did a good job of replacing them so kudos for that. Once I finally got a working pair I loved them. For context I’m a college student I take the bus or scooter to campus a lot. I would also work out in them. I loved these headphones, I loved the app, I loved the customization they were good headphones in my opinion but I’m no audiophile or anything. As long as I could block out the loud rumbling of the bus and the people at the library,  for 80 bucks I was really happy. But then a few months in my headphones would have random and sudden spikes of sound to the point it was painful. For example I would pause my music to send a text or stop listening to talk to someone and when I would play my music again the volume had turned up to the max and I had to quickly turn it down. Crazy thing is when I would click the volume down button the volume quickly went back to the initial volume. I usually listen to music at about 40-50% sometimes a little louder or lower depending on the day. I tried to troubleshoot it but nothing worked. So I had decided to get new ones and suddenly the seam on the left earmuff ripped so it might’ve been a sign lol. Anyways I got some soundcore Space Ones and they’re very nice hopefully I won’t have the same problem with these lol. Anyways hopefully mines were just defective (again lol) and everyone else who decides to buy these!"
The sound on these are great!  I really thought the sound quality was good.  However the head support broke after 5 to 6 months of use.  I used some gorilla glue to fix them but it simply broke again and broke all the way off right above the right ear.  It's a common break point unfortunately.  In addition the ear pads separated too.  The durability was poor.  It's ashame because the sound is really really good.  3 stars because I got these on sale.
"At first I really like the headphone it was exactly like the description. However, I'm writing a review because only after 2 and a half month of use. It's already not working well anymore. The left side doesn't function at all now (no sound) and the right side is starting to break. So the durability and the quality really isn't that good. I'm really disappointed because there were no problem at first and I really liked the headphone. Nevertheless, i contacted the company and they issued a refund so it's a positive thing."
"The Soundcore by Anker Life Q30 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones offer a compelling feature set at a budget-friendly price.  They boast excellent noise cancellation, good sound quality, and long battery life. However, a significant durability issue significantly compromises their overall value.Pros:Impressive Noise Cancellation: The Life Q30's hybrid ANC effectively blocks out low-frequency ambient noise, creating a peaceful listening environment.Rich Audio: These headphones deliver clear, well-balanced sound with good bass response, making them suitable for most music genres.Extended Playtime: With 40 hours of playback on a single charge (advertised), the Life Q30 are perfect for long journeys or extended listening sessions.Multiple Modes: The headphones offer different ANC modes to tailor noise cancellation to your environment.Cons:Durability Concerns: Several user reviews, including my own experience, highlight a concerning issue with the headphones cracking or breaking easily. This can render them unusable and significantly shortens their lifespan.Comfort: While not the worst offenders, some users find the Life Q30 headphones a bit heavy and uncomfortable for extended wear.Overall:The Soundcore Life Q30 headphones offer a great balance of features and affordability, with impressive noise cancellation and good sound quality. However, the major durability issues are a serious drawback. If you're looking for a budget-friendly pair of ANC headphones with a focus on long-term use, you might want to consider other options that offer better build quality."
"I have 2 pair of these headphones and while they work really well - good quality sound and great at noise blocking, the casing falls apart too easily.  The first pair I purchased in July 2023 and broke by October.  I suspected it was just a fluke.  Purchased a second pair at the end of August of this year and they are broken already.  Used by a college student while studying so it isn't like she's treating them roughly.***Wanted to come back and add that I reached out to the company and had a great customer service experience.  Very pleased."
"I really want to love these. The various noise cancelling modes mean that I can adjust the noise cancellation to suit my environment--I, especially, like the transparent mode for when I need to hear what's going on around me. The multi-point connection is also super helpful because I can switch between my work and personal computers, or work and personal cell phones. However, the touch mechanism on the right ear cup for transparency is sensitive and I frequently hit it inadvertently when I'm just trying to reposition the headset. It happens everytime my hand brushes the ear cup. Most importantly, after using these for six months, they've started developing a weird high-pitched tin-like noise during use. I use these for work meetings and this distorts the sound of people's voices. I have to turn them off and turn them back on again (which, when using Zoom, sometimes means you have to readjust your audio settings.) It's disruptive, so 3 stars because I'm now looking for a new pair."
"I bought these headphones one year ago. I do NOT recommend them, mostly because Soundcore is sabotaging itself. Here's how:- The ""TRANSPARENCY!"" touch setting. This is the big one. -Does your hair reach your jaw or lower? Better not let it brush over your right headphone cup! Want to use these headphones while doing housework or exercising? Better not EVER put your arms over your head for any reason! Basically, the second anything brushes your right headphone, you'll hear the blaring ""TRANSPARENCY!"" voice in your ear, and your audio quality will suddenly drop to nil. Sounds like a minor thing, right? Well, imagine that happening multiple times per use over the entire lifespan of your headphones! Literally cannot fathom (1) who is using this setting at all, ever, and (2) why Soundcore thought it would be a good idea to make it so easy to switch on by accident, (3) why the switch is so loud and disruptive, and (4) why you can't turn off the setting at all. Again, I know what you're thinking, because I thought it too: ""No big deal! I'll get over it!"" Listen to me. Seriously, listen to me. There has not been a single day of using these headphones in the past year where I didn't think about how viciously annoyed they make me. If I could get my money back or mentally justify being wasteful enough to throw usable headphones into a landfill, I would.- The quality of the ear cups. (See photos)This is more minor. The fake leather here is actually really great - it shows no signs of wear or peeling, even after frequent use for months, like cheaper headphones sometimes do. HOWEVER, the seam of the right ear cup on mine slowly unraveled about three months in, and I thought it was just a fluke. Nothing a needle and thread can't fix. (In the photo, you can see where I already shoddily repaired the right seaming.) Nine months later, the left ear cup is starting to unravel as well - which is a pattern of quality issues that absolutely shouldn't be happening on $80 headphones.TL;DR: This is a decent product with the single most frustrating issue you will ever encounter with a pair of headphones. Don't buy them. I see you thinking about it! Don't fall into the same trap I did!(P.S. If you HAVE to go with Soundcore, downgrade or upgrade to another headphone model instead - none of the brand's other offerings (to my knowledge) has the ""TRANSPARENCY!"" issue, and I pray every single day that Soundcore realizes the error of its ways, pushes some kind of digital update that kills this stupid audio mode forever and lets me enjoy an otherwise great product.)"
Loved the headset but it stopped charging about 3 weeks after I got it. Now it's limited to being a wired headset
"Have had these for a little over a year, but have not used them aton (I just don't wear headphones alot, bought them for airline travel and ANC). The sound is good and the ANC seems to work pretty well. The tech is sound but about a year in the left ear cup started to come apart and show the foam, now the right has done the same. The seam seems to let go, you can't see it when wearing them though."
"Decent headphones but they are slightly too big, feel a little cheap, but the sound quality is good"
"Tldr: anker good, Amazon sent used product, didnt return cuz gf didnt want to wait again.First of all, these headphones are great for the price. Sound quality is great and NC is pretty good too. I'm currently in my kitchen next to dehumidifier on little less than half volume and I don't hear it at all. I got these for my girlfriend cuz she really liked the color and how they looked.The reason for the 3 stars is that these were obviously returned as there were these clothing tags in the box and the headphones were not placed back into their case properly and on the soundcore app I can see that these were already paired to someone's iPhone. Only reason I didnt return was cuz my gf said she didn't want to wait for them again."
"The headphones have a decent sound and the noise canceling works pretty well. Bluetooth disconnects periodically at a distance of only 1-2ft from my tablet. After a year and a half, both air cushions have ripped. I realize these are inexpensive headphones compared to Bose or other high end ones. Hopefully I can find replacement ear cushions and do it myself."
"The sound quality is very middle of the road, nothing great and nothing terribly wrong. I even tried to adjust the EQ within the app without much success. The balance of the sound just isn't quite right and really sticks out when compared to my other headphones that were cheaper. I ultimately returned them since sound quality is absolutely #1 priority.The noise cancellation/ transparency is a great feature and very effective (transparency mode is bit sensitive, over-boosts the sound). When activated, it doesn't distort the music like some other headphones. I would definitely recommend this for the office/travel (aside from sound quality).The dual device connectivity works but you have to go into the second device to connect to it, some other headphones will automatically connect to both once they've been paired. Minor thing but can get annoying doing it every day.A major item for me, other than sound, is the microphone won't work for the second device. Since I use these during work and various meetings, I have to set up my phone with Teams to get the audio to work. Even changing the computer settings to use the headphone as a headset doesn't work. Might be an issue with the dual connectivity, but I have other headphones that do this without a hitch."
Controls are tiny and hard to read.
"I really liked my Q20 headphones, but after lots of use they finally broke. Before ordering the q30, I wanted to ensure they had the 3.5mm jack, as I often use that with Noise Cancelling on long-haul flights. After seeing it had that, I purchased them and was excited to try them for the next trip. Unfortunately, I found out on my first trip that the Noise Canceling turns off as soon as you plug in the cord. I researched this online to find out that the new version apparently doesn't support Noise Cancellation while using the 3.5mm jack. While I like the fit and the fact that it came with its own case, this is very disappointing."
"Update 9/11/24: Soundcore confirmed the headphones are defective and need to be replaced. They provided me with a return mailing label and will send a replacement pair when they see that the headphones are in the process of being returned.Pros:Delivery was greatProduct has very good sound for the price. The Soundcore app enables a lot of options to adjust the sound based on personal preferenceStorage case is sturdy and fairly compactHeadphones are comfortable after wearing for hoursBattery life seems to be very goodConsThe voice prompts for battery life and ambient sound don’t playTapping the right earphone doesn’t change the Transparency modeI am working with Soundcore to resolve these issues and will update my review based on the outcome of my inquiry. Overall I like the headphones and, if properly handled and stored, I think they will hold up well."
"I like the design, sound is great, but….girls with smaller heads might have issues. Working out laying on a bench these slide and fall off my head on the tightest setting. Its annoying, if it werent for that id give them 5 stars"
"I have had this specific set for over a year now, and they are fantastic! I use them daily, and I have never really had an issue with them until recently. They are by far my favorite and most comfortable headphone set. They're great for filtering noise while I do homework. They provide great sound quality, allowing you to appreciate the little nuances of music and sound effects, and I couldn't be happier. They're also great sound buffers when I am working with loud dogs.The speakers work just as well as the day I got them. However, the fabric over the foam of the ear covers has recently started to come apart, leaving the foam exposed. I'm not rough with the headphones, so I am not sure why this is happening. I may look into getting another Anker pair soon, but I am a broke college student so I will be wearing these until they are completely unwearable.Would have been five stars had the glue held up (like I said, these are so comfortable and fantastic). Sad they have worn out so quickly. I wish there was a way to have them fixed."
"I have two pair of the soundcore q20's and they are awesome but they only have a micro usb to charge and that is one more cable to keep track of around the house and while traveling so I bought these which cost a bit more but have a now industry standard USB C port.  They work, but they work less effectively than the cheaper model in every way but one.  The one way they are better is that they have an actual case vs the bag the 20's come in.  The sound on these is okay, including the noise canceling but they let in a lot more ambient noise than the cheaper headphones. The headband is also shaped differently so it takes up more space and doesnt hold the headphones on nearly as well.  So leaning your head against the side of a plane doesnt work as well for instance.  If I look up there is a 50/50 chance the headphones will slide off. Finally the interface is finicky. Turning them on or off requires a really long button push, it claims it is something like 3 or 5 seconds but it is longer than whatever they claim.  The tranparency function works well with a quick touch to the earphone and they look ""nicer"" than the cheaper model but functionally they are not."
"I am an average sized/ slightly petite woman and even on the smallest setting these slide right off my face if I look down. The sound quality is pretty nice (sometimes I find myself wishing they got a little louder, but I guess that would be bad for my ears!) but they really are too big for my head. It’s a shame because they are good quality headphones and music sounds incredible through them, but I find myself avoiding moving my head so much when wearing them.The active noise canceling and then transparent mode would be great for walking around in public or grocery shopping while still hearing what’s going on around you, but they slip off so easily I can’t wear them while walking around or bending down to pick things up at the store. Kind of a shame they made these so large.I tried my partners audio technica headphones and they don’t have this problem so it’s not like I have an abnormally small head (I wear a medium size adult helmet!)  a friend of mine recommended these to me and mentioned they fit her a little big but I thought since I have kind of a bigger head for a small lady I wouldn’t have the same issue, but..too badIf you have a really large head I would recommend these though"
"I really love these headphones and even have thought about repurchasing them, but after realizing it's only been about 3 months and they are already broken due to breaking at the joints I'm not sure I can. I am not rough with these or anything, but the plastic just cracked around where the joints are and now the headphones are no longer attached to headband. The features are great minus the fact that if you have two devices connected you randomly get this very loud, very high pitched frequency blasted into your ears so I made sure to never actually have two devices connected at once. I love the pink color too. It's the perfect baby pink color. I also love being able to tap the side and have noise cancelling mode toggled on and off quickly. I really wish they hadn't had broken so quickly. It's really a shame. I love the sound quality and I did wear these everyday, but I can't understand why they broke. I never write reviews so it's sad that I am having to write this. Maybe they'll work out for you, but sadly they fell a part on me."
"Long battery life! Love the color. Controls make sense and are easy to use, however, if my right hand inadvertently bumps the right earpiece, it will randomly change between “transparency “ mode and “noise cancellation” mode. I have also experienced this short happening constantly when my hair is damp after a shower, just by putting the headphones on my head. The range is very good. I the weight is a bit heavy. They tend to slide off my head a lot. Oftentimes slipping off the back of my head while I’m just sitting in a chair. The sound quality is very good."
"So I've had these about three months now and I've used them almost daily since then.The good:The sound quality is great and the ANC is impressive - especially at the price point. The audio is clean and the pads on the ears and quite comfortable for me. The battery also really gives you very good playing time. The weight of the earphones are fine to me, you notice that they're there but they aren't painful or difficult to wear.The bad:I, however, was a little worried about the plastic body and today my worry turned to reality. The plastic around the right stalk cracked (almost all the way across) and I have no idea how/when/why. I've included pictures of the crack and a few more centimeters and I think the earphones will no longer be wearable. That's really annoying to me for a 3-month-old item that's kept in its case when not being used.Item informationItem: Soundcore Life Q30Purchase date: April 27, 2024Purchase price: $69.99Item shipped: May 12, 2024Delivery date: May 14, 2024"
"This is my usual experience of using these headphones:Open laptopput on headphonespress and hold power button for 3 seconds1...2...3...headphones play ""turning off"" chime""they were already on""press and hold power button for 3 seconds1...2...3...4...5...6...nothing is happening...""I pressed the button too early, they where still turning off or something""press and hold button for 3 seconds1...2...3...headphones play ""turn on"" chimedeal with bluetooth settings until they connectheadphones finally workwhy not just have a power switch?turn on switchconnectdonecons:can't use while chargingcan only use noise canceling and transparency mode with bluetooth, not while wiredtouch controls that can't be turned off. I opened up the headphones and cut the wire to the touch surface. I don't care if this voids my warranty. If disabling the feature is an improvement, it is not a feature.cycling between 3 modes instead of two is a little clunky. If you're in normal mode and want to switch to noise canceling, you have to go through transparency mode first. You can't double press to cycle throw two modes either because a double press counts as a different kind of input, even though double pressing the mode switch button does nothing. Why not press and hold or double press the mode button to enter transparency mode instead and let single presses toggle between normal and noise canceling?no earplug mode where the headphones stay on and noise canceling stays on even if they're not connected to something. Although, I'd much rather they turn off automatically because I'll never remember to turn them off myself so unless they can tell that you're wearing them and use that to decide to stay on, ignore this one.no way to force headphones into pairing mode while connected to a device besides disconnecting from within the device's settings or turning the headphones off and on again, which takes at least 10 seconds.as far as I know, there's no way to check the battery level without turning the headphones off and on again, which takes at least 6 seconds. Or by checking in your devices setting, if it shows you that kind of information. Windows 11 does, I can't remember if android does."
"After purchasing about four pairs of their earbuds (a spare and a couple for my dad), I decided to try the over ear headphones. Like the buds, the sound quality and features (transparency, noise cancellation, eq, pairing to two devices simultaneously, etc) are great value for money.Unfortunately, after owning them for a couple months they broke right above the right speaker. I dropped them and the flimsy plastic cracked and broke so easily that I was obviously annoyed and disappointed. Having a metal headband is almost pointless if the parts that are constantly moving or prone to stress break so easily. You can call me clumsy, but I take care of my things, fold and put them away regularly.A few years ago, I’d found some cheesy headphones my dad had laying around that he’d bought from Chinatown for probably $20 or $30 that had more metal and better construction. If I could replace a few of the parts with metal with less screws, etc. I’d pay $30, $40 extra. But maybe that’s too much to ask."
"I do love these. The ANC is great, the charge lasts forever, and they fold up nicely for my tote. But the frame of these things is so cheap. The stickers came off, and the left earpad ripped almost immediately. According to other folks, this happens super often, not only on the same earpad, but starting in the EXACT SAME SPOT. The ""hold to turn on transparency"" feature also can not be disabled, so good luck laying on your right side. With these two things fixed, I would've found my forever headphones."
"Great quality of sound so far and the feature set is great. Can't give it more than 3 start though. No ANC when using the AUX cable?! WHY? This makes absolutely NO sense whatsoever. Bluetooth isn't reliable with headphones on my PC (where I use them most often), so I can't really use them for my day-to-day making this a MAJOR deal breaker. This is in part my fault for not noticing it in the description, but I find the idea so intolerable that I had to make my point here. If you're going to include ANC and an AUX cable, make the feature work across the board.Was going to replace my old headphones with these since I thought it was a great price point, but not if this is the case. Guess I now know why the price is so low. My kid needs a new pair and doesn't need the ANC feature, otherwise, I would've returned them immediately for a refund."
"So obviously this is not going to effect the majority of people, but if you have ear gouges, these may not be for you. They do not have a very right fit, so anything a little in the way, pushes them off your ears easily and makes they pretty useless as far as the sound reducing function goes. I wear glasses and have 1"" gouges for reference. Again, I knownthis won't effect most people, but something yo consider if you have them"
"Man do I wish this just worked. Apparently earlier models used to work with AUX, but something changed in manufacturing and now these no longer support AUX + Noise Cancelling. Such a waste. It's frustrating because while not technically called out as a feature there's no reason they shouldn't support this and having to pay $35 more for the Q35 just for this feature seems nearly predatory.Overall review:- The top comment about not pairing with iOS is just wrong. They do. They don't support the ""touch to pair"" feature which is what they are referring to. These work just fine with iOS devices although the app UX leaves a lot to be desired.- The noise cancelling is good, not great. It definitely cuts ambient noise down a TON, and allows non-ambient noises through in a way that's nice. You can still hear things that aren't ""drone-y""  which is nice.- Transparency mode is useless. Everything sounds weird and amplified and drone-y noises sounds awful. It picks up way more things than it should. Seems like its just amplifying ALL noise around you.- They are very comfortable. I have a sensitive head to headphones and these feel amazing. I don't get sore after extended use which is basically unheard of for me.- Sound quality is.. fine. Not distractingly bad but even as someone who is not an audiophile I wish it was better quality audio. My Steelseries 7's sound way better. Podcasts especially sound a little off. Fortunately you have an EQ in the app to use, but even after finding 'ideal' settings and applying them the sound was just ok.- Headphone controls are fine. The power and ANC buttons are easy enough to learn where they are. I have yet to really learn the volume controls cause its just three indistinguishable buttons on the right side so I've never been able to use them without taking the headphones off. You can activate Transparency mode (mostly on accident) by ""cupping"" the right headphone. This ends up mostly being an annoyance because transparency mode sucks so you're better off just lifting the cup off your ear.. which then accidentally triggers transparency mode.. Ugh.Overall, just shy of being a great budget set of over ear ANC headphones. If the AUX issue wasn't there, I'd be keeping them and living with the other issues but man, I just want to be able to watch an in-flight movie with ANC. That doesn't seem like too much to ask especially since these headphones USED TO SUPPORT THIS FEATURE.In the end, Soundcore support was helpful, got me a refund for my old set when I shipped them back and I've since purchased a set of Q35s. While more than I originally wanted to spend, the sound quality improvement and the AUX/ANC capability makes the upgrade more than worthwhile for me."
"A tear appeared inside the right earcup lining — after 14 months of intermittent (3x per week), gentle use. Deterioration like this might be expected within 2-3 years of daily use, as I’ve experienced with decent over-ear headphones in the past.Thankfully, with Soundcore’s generous 18-month warranty, they replaced the earcup promptly and without charge.I just hope this defect is a one-off and not larger quality issue.The replacement earcups did not come with instructions. Nothing on their site. Chat couldn’t help either.Thankfully, one can find instructions in Amazon ratings. (!!!)Such basic info should not be difficult to obtain. Come on Soundcore/Anker — you can do better, especially if you’re, um, SELLING replacement earcups.Otherwise, I genuinely LOVE these headphones. Everything about them -- sound, comfort, flexibility.Anker: you lost one star for durability and another for making the replacement instructions so hard to find."
"I grabbed these over the ear headphones based on a number of reviews and YouTube videos when comparing these to some more expensive headphones. I am coming over from a pair of apple AirPods pros, and cant handle the in the ear thing anymore.My use is for walks for a mile or 5 ....theme parks, gym weight work out.... nothing to crazy.The headphones arrived within 12 hours and were shipped in there product box( warning to others with porch pirate problems)When arrived they seemed to be charged, but still plugged them in to fully charge before using.The directions are MINIMAL.....and id took me a few interpretations to figure out how to skip songs, and get the bluetooth detection to activate.The ANC is good, being your ear is inside the cup, it should be.I used these for a 45 minute weight workout and here is why ill be returning them for a more expensive pair...Right away I coldn't get the bluetooth to connect, like the headphones wouldn't go into pairing mode, it would just power off and on. These headphones use the same buttons for multi uses with long or short hold durations. (Strike 1)Once connected I started my play list and thought, thats it? I had them turned all the way up and felt I was still needing more volume. (Strike 2) or 1 1/2 if you like soft low volume music.Once I figured it out I went to ask Siri to skip to next track, Siri did so but I could not hear Siri at all in headphones? No ""what can I do for you"" or anything . (Strike 3)When I tried to manually skip tracks I did take a few tries to have my finger on the proper button. ... That's a learning thing not a set back, just been a long time since I have had an actual button to push for functions as opposed to touching.The integration seems extremely limited with my iPhone and the sound was subpar for over the ear headphones. Makes me wonder about all the other reviews?!After my 45 minute work out I did notice ear fatigue and with that, I have decided to return them."
"It was nice while it lasted and these were well cared for, but audio completely cut out from the right ear. I contacted support over it but it looks like they're pretty strict on the warranty period. For the price though, these sounded amazing and were pretty comfortable and the build quality was there. It makes you feel like a victim of planned obsolescence when something dies directly after the warranty period."
"These are okay headphones. They do not get very loud. The music quality is fine, but not great (even after playing with the eq levels in the app). I get better quality from my $30 earbuds. The volume is probably fine for someone just trying to do some computer work or listening to something around the house, but they are incredibly disappointing for times where I want the volume of my music to drown out the thoughts in my head. I tried wearing them in the gym, but they are just not tight enough against my head to stay put. (Note that I might have a smaller head than most others.) They're just very ""meh,"" (unfortunately) reflective of their affordability. Better than Tozo's, but I'm still on the hunt for over the ear noise cancelling headphones that fit tightly to my head, provide powerful bass tones, and simply get loud enough."
"I brought these a couple of months ago very good pair of headsets for the price noise canceling is very good , battery life very good , however there is a design flaw my wife brought similar pair and the headphones cracked in the same spot as mine. I am very upset because these are decent headphones but that plastic  they are using will not hold up ."
"First purchased the new Space One's which were just way too heavy. Started experiencing some strain in my neck if worn for more than 90m. I like to take a break every 2h. The ANC was really very good and the cushions over the ears were of great quality...so I downgraded to the Navy colored Q-30's. Although the weight issue was resolved, the interface with the tap for ANC, Normal and Transparency was just too inconvenient and interrupted my focus way too many times. Just pick them up or brush your hand by and modes change.They do charge quickly and hold a charge steadily.Anker headphones are really decent for the price point and better than SkullCandy. I went back for Gen 1  Latte Cream colored Space One's because of the controls and comfort. *Finger's crossed!*"
Sound quality is not as shown in description.But keeping in view price it’s okay
I got a pretty good deal for prime day but will be looking at something else. The sound is very good for the price. Everything else makes them difficult and annoying. See below.CONSIssue 1: Buttons - The button placement makes it very easy to turn off noise cancelling. Simply removing and putting them back on you can end up in transparency mode. Placing them on my neck for a quick second my chest presses the buttons. I find myself constantly checking to make sure i am in noise cancelling mode. There are other sets out there for whichIssue 2: Commuting - I found that when walking fast on a call it was randomly switching to transparency mode and back. Nothing was touching the buttons. It was the stress of my steps. I ended switching them off to complete my calls.Issue 3: Mic - Even in my quiet office people had trouble hearing me. I ended up switching to the laptop mic which people said was much better.PROSPro 1: App - It is pretty cool to be able to control the functions with the app widget.Pro 2: Sound Quality - The sound quality when in noise cancelling mode is surprisingly good for the price point. That brings it to two stars.
It's ok sound... not of great construction.  But not bad for the price.
I did my research on this item and the claim is sweat resistance... Idk but it's starting to just shut down out of nowhere... So I'm not as happy with it but the sound quality is great! Noise cancelation canceled the kids nagging honey.  If you want to get some beats but don't have beats money this is a great alternative!
"I wanted to love these so much, I primarily bought them for the gym and doing house work with the hopes that I could use them for work or taking any phone call hands-free. However, these pick up so much background noise that it is virtually impossible to carry on a conversation with anyone (work or not) due to how much background noise it picks up.My other complaint it that I wish I could make these smaller. I have never been known to have a small head yet i often find myself wishing these would fit a bit tighter to stay on my head when moving around.Originally I gave these 5 stars but after about 2 months, I wish I would have found something better."
"Just got these delivered and this is my first experience with Anker headphones though I do also have a small portable speaker that has worked great for the price.This headset feels very well built and you can tell just by the general feel of the device- headband, cups, swivel points all feel hefty enough to last, nothing creaky, buttons have good tactile feedback and the controls are very easy to get used to coming from an older Sony model. The included case also feels very nice, I'm glad I got this over the lower model as the case alone is worth the upgrade.Paired via NFC to my Pixel 6 which worked perfectly (Love my Pixel but sometimes the NFC causes fits). Also paired up via BT to my computer which also was a painless operation.Sound- I have only about 2 hours of listening and my current daily is a Senn HD598 so it's a very different type just because of the closed vs open aspect. Having said that I really didn't take long to get accustomed to these and while I would never confuse them I thoroughly enjoy them at this point...just different due to design. I would say the Senns has a superior soundstage and they are more comfortable (not as warm sitting on my ears) where the Q30 is actually more comfortable at first it does get warm with the closed / leather cups vs open / velour on the Senn.Noise Cancelling- I am very new to the technology and you can run the headphones in Transparent, Normal and Active NC. I picked these up after trying on a Bose Quitecomfort in Costco and was impressed with it. Is this as effective? Doesn't seem like it but if you have any reasonable volume playing with NC on I barely hear any traffic which unfortunately is just outside my balcony even with the windows open. Since this is new to me the closest thing I can compare it to is using my Pixel Buds in ear monitors- The Q30 definitely blocks more than those (they do not have active NC just the passive effect of being IEM). It's enough that I can no longer hear my neighbors kids playing with their VR headset in the stairwell between our units...which is a big reason I decided to retire my Senn for now lol.I haven't had these long to say how the battery life is or charging times but I used it right out of the box and was playing around with NC on it's own and then listened to some of my favorite tracks for about an hour and it's fine. When you power them on the headphones will say its battery level. When I first turned it on it said ""medium"" and after playing around with it for about 2 hours it's still at ""medium"".UPDATE - Cushion has failed about u months in. So I guess I'll have to order a replacement. Pretty disappointing as I really use them gently at home. If you travel and bump them around they're gonna break even sooner."
Quality is ok but don’t understand why tearing apart
"Headphones work great, easy to setup & use. Only complaint is build quality. I have a crack on one side & the foam cover on the other side has separated. I've never thrown or done anything to damage so no idea how/why this has occurred for normal use."
I didn't find Noise cancelling feature very effective. I used the headphones with my electric lawn mower (Ryobi which makes a lot less noise than gas powered ones) and seemed it only stopped about 80% of noise. not what I wanted so returned it. Sorry. Price was good though.
"Just received and this review is based on initial thoughts. Will update after more extensive use.Had trouble figuring out switching between bluetooth and hardwired to device  such as an I-phone or in-air entertainment on the plane.As soon as the headphones recognize the wire is connected, it will play a tone to let you know it has changed. At that point, you cannot control the volume or play/pause/previous/next-- you will have to use the device's controls. (Even if you disconnect from phone/airplane but the wire is still in the headphone jack, the headphones remain in ""wired"" mode)Additionally, after removing the wire from the headphone jack, it does not automatically go back to bluetooth -- you have have to hold the on/off button to reconnect via bluetooth. (The website/instructions are not clear on this.)I made the mistake of disconnecting from the plane so I could listen to music on my I Phone, but I didn't realize the wire was still in the jack. Once I unplugged and reset the headphones as described above it worked.Since I just received, I am not sure how battery life compares to manufacture's stated times. (if significantly different I will update this review and let you know.) However, make sure you plan ahead and have them fully charged before a long flight because they will not work while charging. (I tried both connected to plane USB and portable battery pack.)The app is interesting... it has 11 different sounds e.g. rain, wind, river, ticking clock, etc that can be selected to help you sleep. It also has a timer so you can have it automatically turn-off.I didn't want to spend $300+ for other brand name noise cancelling headphones. Overall, this headphone seems to be a good value for the $$$.If things change in the coming months after I've had more time to use it, I will update the review."
"design of product has issues. It was for my kids, but it will be broken next day. not robust enough, tiny cheap plastic holding whole speaker. I went for Q20, even if it has less powerful ANC, but seams more robust."
"This is probably the most disappointing electronics item I've bought on Amazon. Not even sure where I should begin, so I'll just go down the list.My main reason for buying this pair, over the $20 cheaper model they make, was for the advertised dual connectivity. That is, it can be connected to two bluetooth devices at the same time. This feature just does not work. I'm constantly having to disconnect and reconnect to my two devices. I'm at the point, functionally, where I was before buying these with my old headphones. My previous headphones (Beats Solo3) functioned the way these do...buy they didn't have dual connectivity! I bought these mainly for that feature, so I wouldn't have to constantly connect and reconnect, but here I am, doing that multiple times a day.In comparison, I have a Plantronics headset that has dual connectivity, and its as smooth as butter. I seamlessly transition between my laptop and phone and NEVER have to manually connect. So, I know what's possible. These Soundcores are TERRIBLE in this dept. Not to mention, if I DO have two devices connected I sometimes get crackling interference that hurts my ears. WOW, Soundcore, just WOW.Speaking of hurting my eardrums, when I connect to my laptop it defaults to 100% volume! Why is this even a thing?! I connect and my music is deafening. Then good luck using the volume buttons on the right ear piece to lower the volume, bc they do not work either. They work on my phone, but only work on my laptop like 20% of the time, tops! Terrible!Also, the product's listing boasts a 15 meter range. HA! I'll walk 12 feet away and sometimes it'll start cutting out. Terrible!Noise cancelling is good I guess. I haven't had a lot of experience with ANC, so yeah. But I have to mention this! The ""seal"" on the ears is very poorly designed. Noise and wind EASILY comes in, thus defeating the purpose of the Noise cancelling. Let's put it this way. My previous headphones, with no ANC, cut out outside noise when outdoors about as good as these. They had a really good seal on my ears, so zero wind came in and very little ambient noise. But these let SOO much noise in, so the ANC can only do so much. In fact, I NEVER use these without using ANC on. That's how much noise they let in. Terrible!I might as well comment on the sound quality. I've never been a audio snob. Tbh, I can barely tell a difference between good and high end audio quality. These tho, I can tell are ""eh"". They are serviceable, not bad, but nothing great.Here's another REALLY ANNOYING feature you'll want to watch out for. They have three modes: Normal, Noise Cancelling and Transparency. You would think that when you select a mode they would just stay in that mode. Nope. Every time I stop and start with them, they cycle to the next mode. E.g. listen to some music, put the headphones down for 20 min (they're still on), put them back on and they're in a different mode. (And no I'm not accidently triggering the right side hand touch feature). They just cycle without asking. And its not even that they always reset to ""normal"" or something, they literally cycle to another random mode. SOO annoying. Its like using them is so tedious. Every time I want to listen to music I'm disconnecting from one device, connecting to another, lowering the volume to preserve my hearing, selecting the mode, and then making sure I don't step too far away. Who the heck wants to do all that?! Terrible!Finally, I have one last complaint. This won't effect most people, but its does me. So, these things are too big. If I bend over or look too far up they start sliding off. Now, I admit, my head is a bit on the smaller side. But, I'm also male and 6'1""...my head isn't THAT small. I think they just wanted to save on costs and created a product with a relatively small range of adjustability. Again, my previous headphones didn't give me this problem. Just terrible!TL:DR Every advertised feature is either subpar or bad. Don't buy."
"So, these headphones mostly appealed to me because they are a very adorable shade of pink, and I trust Anker's Soundcore series + like my  earbuds by them. To put it simply: I would not be keeping these if I paid the price they normally are  (85$). I got these on sale during Black Friday, and they serve me decently for having paid what I did.They sound good, not great -- but, there's  not a lot of depth to the sound (even by my basic standards), and I find that I always have to turn my audio up quite high to really hear and enjoy them.The noise cancellation/transparency modes work alright - the latter helps me out for those times my roommate talks to me suddenly. You can switch the modes without having to hunt for a button as well, which is nice. The sensor on the right headphone makes the function convenient enough to switch between.Overall, certainly not bad! They are comfortable, attractive, and decent-sounding headphones. It's just that you could definitely put your money toward better quality (albeit less cute) headphones, if that matters more to you.[Minor update 10/20/2023]: Reaffirming my stance that thee are not worth the usual price; get them on sale or look elsewhere. The top band of the headsets are becoming misaligned and worn little by little, and it's bad enough that I have to wear a satin bonnet over my hair so that it does not get ripped out by the plastic protrusions that anchor the top cushioning down. (Ouch.)Same qualms about middling sound quality as before. I am unsure if the right ear cup is suffering a quieting effect, or if I've just encountered numerous videos with poor audio balancing. Hard to say.I will still enjoy these until they stop working, but in another ~year or so I will sadly not look to Soundcore to replace these. I will stick to their earbuds for now."
"At the time I bought these I had been in need of decent sound cancelling headphones, because much of my travel is  by public transportation, and they require headphones with electronics by state law.The headset offered decent, but not great noise canceling, transparency, normal, and Noise canceling, are the three settings. The application for soundcore offers a few adjustable features with noise canceling, from indoor, outdoor, and transport, which was why I bought them to filter out background noise from being on the bus.However, little did I realize that the faux leather/plastic flakes will fade away as you wear them and they literally do not have any way to replace the muffin pads.The overall quality of life of battery is decent for a full days use or a week use if you only use them when on public transportation. You can expect them to break really easily, because it is plastic the ear pieces are a foldable design, with elongated headband that can stretch for bigger heads like mine.They are decent for playing music, but I recommend you have a decent mp3 player/flac/mp4 whatever format.Hoewver, the connection by Bluetooth can  make the connection for phone calls seem very hit and miss and does not filter out background noise when walking and talking, or when trying to answer your phone with Bluetooth headphones on.There needs to be a better noise canceling Mike for the speaker because most all of my calls notice that I can barely be heard when taking on them, because of poor filtering of background noise and car noise.So as I said you get what you pay for.Hope this helps."
"Overall good noise cancelling headphones. The one issue I have with them is the touch panel on the right side, which I have never once activated intentionally. Every time something brushes up against it, the headphones enter ""aware mode"", interrupting whatever you were listening to. There's already a button on the left side for switching between modes, so this feature is completely useless. I've seen posts online from people who have unsoldered or severed the connection to the touch panel in order to disable it. If you have the skill set to confidently do this mod, then consider it."
"The noise cancellation on these is great! But these are destroyed after only 1 year of use. The pads on the ears are ripped and I had to tape the headband part together because it cracked. I wear these at night and I fall asleep watching YouTube - so the touch function on the outside of the headphone switching between transparency and noise cancellation was annoying and overly sensitive. Every night I did it by accident. I think these are good headphones for most, but if you lay down at all with them, it won't work for you."
"I’ve bought two of these and both have broke. My first one was the Q20 so I decided to upgrade after a few months. I also gifted a Q30 to my cousin and his headphones broke after a few months as well This one is my current and its broken again after a year of use. The cushion started to tear, but I didn’t mind honestly. I rarely drop it, and one day when I put it on, I noticed a large crack. The first two days was ok, but now that side is much looser and won’t tighten.This is something I cannot fix either. Imo, these headphones are poorly made as far as the material and it’s not sturdy. I would just invest in better made headphones! its better for the long run. Very disappointed since all three became broken."
"These work well and sound great. There are three different sound settings: normal, transparency, and noise-cancelling. Transparency allows you to hear the sound in your headphones AND environmental sounds equally.I exclusively use noise-cancelling, but the button that toggles between the sound settings  is very sensitive and changes the sound setting at the even *slightest hint* of a touch. Sometimes the sound setting changes when I'm pretty sure nothing touched the button at all. This is annoying because it's very jarring when the sound setting goes from ""noise-cancelling"" to ""transparency""."
"These are the worst headphones I've ever used, had them less for a year and they are already falling apart, I had to duck tape them to keep them from fully breaking apart and even then as you can see they're barely holding together. The cushion is now breaking as well which of course it is, I expect nothing less.Starting from the beginning: almost immediately if pressure is put on them in certain ways you'll get an absurd high pitched squeal, I had ignored this because at the time it wasn't as big of an issue and I don't sleep with them so I didn't mind (unsurprisingly, it does not stay a minor issue for long. I had also noticed that no matter how I fixed up the equalizer, the audio quality (though sharp in that aspect) stayed terrible, bass sucks in these so don't bother if you like that type of stuff. The noise canceling is decent if you're not anywhere loud, and the transparency is okay as long as you don't want to actually hear voices and instead want to hear literally anything else.The mic quality has steadily been getting worse and worse to the point where I have been told I'm incomprehensible and garbledThe Bluetooth has also been getting worse, forcing me to disconnect and reconnect constantly while on calls.As seen, they are virtually shattering on the arm, which is crazy because any time I take them out of the house they are kept in the case and secure in my bag, but that just shows how poor quality the case is as wellI even got the warranty and I'm STILL trying to see about getting a refund or a new pair because this is frankly ridiculousLiterally the only thing these have going for them is being comfortable and they're easy to connect with Bluetooth and that's about itDon't bother getting these, you'll have better luck finding a 20$ headset at Walmart made of better quality instead of the 80+ dollars pieces of junk they are"
"I am a huge fan of Anker and Soundcore. This was the 2nd pair of over ear headphones I have bought from them. The sound is awesome. Battery life is awesome. However, after 6 months of use, all the plastic on the headband started to crack. After a year of use, the headphones are not wearable as they are too fragile to put on now. This happened with an earlier model of over the ear headphones as well. I don't think the plastic is as good of quality as other brands."
"pros!- pink color is VERY cute, pale pink!- noise cancellation is better than my airpods pro- foam earpads go around ears = more comfortable (comfy when wearing earrings too)- ability to adjust sound output/type of noise cancellation in app- works well with apple products (all buttons work, etc!)- aesthetically pleasing design- great price for the quality of the product- long, LONG battery life (used for 3 weeks for about 3-4 hours a day, only needed to charge after 3rd week)- nice protective carrying casecons!- when you accidentally brush the right earcup for too long, it turns on transparency mode. useful in some situations, but kind of an annoyance for me! definitely not a dealbreaker though.- the phrase ""active noise cancellation"" is written on both sides of the headband. this isn't a huge issue, just something to note aestheticallyAnother reviewer said all of the above and I couldn’t agree more, but I need to add one glaring con that may change your mind.As many others have said they don’t last long. My daughter had them about 3 months before one of the sides started breaking just above the ear piece. We epoxied it and it still broke again. Then the other piece started breaking last month. She absolutely loves them but I’m definitely looking for a replacement approx 6 months after purchasing.overall!They don’t last long, but work great while they last."
"I was interested in these due to the high praise they received (particularly the rtings review). If I was really looking forward to using these as intended, I'd be disappointed. Personally, I'm not a fan of noise cancellation on any headphones. So my comments on that feature are probably not worth much. However, I did try using the headphones wireless in the ""normal"" mode (meant to be ANC off). As some others have mentioned, there is an issue of intermittent popping followed by a white noise hissing sound. My theory is that the ANC is integrated in a way that it can't actually be turned off, but rather only adjusted down to a bare minimum setting. So if you want to use these wireless without ANC, that might annoy you.The good news is the Q30s can be used passively with a 3.5mm jack. They worked perfectly fine for me this way on a 7 hour plane ride. I had no issues with comfort over many hours, though my ears are small so perhaps it is people with bigger ears complaining about part of their ear being caught by the pads.So if you want good passive over-ears for travel or home, these will do. Travel in particular comes to mind with the included carry case, and even a small bag that fits inside said case for the included 3.5mm jack and usb charge cable. However, it would not surprise me if you could find something comparable or slightly better for that purpose at a lower price."
"The good:Good passive noise insulation.Decent active noise cancellation (but not the best I’ve encountered). It’s good enough. Not like I’m trying to drown out power tools or anything.Good transparency feature (though not super necessary—I can just, y’know, remove the headphones if I need to hear something else).Good battery life (out of the box, anyway—we’ll see how long it holds up).Tells you “battery high/medium/low” every time you turn the headphones on, which is useful as a reminder to charge them.Bluetooth connection seems to have good range, and wall/solid object penetration—I was able to leave my phone downstairs and do something on the upper floor without any choppiness.They haven’t started hurting my ears or anything.The bad:The voice says “normal”, “noise cancelling”, or “transparency” every time you switch modes, and talks over whatever you’ve got playing, without pausing. It’s annoying. I can figure the modes out without that, thanks; the fact that I bought this product should imply that I have functioning ears.The audio stutters every so often, whether I’m playing music, streaming a video, or listening to text-to-speech. It’s a minor but frequent irritation (at least once a day, I’d say).Recently, the headphones have begun to emit noise when not playing anything; there’s a quiet sort of click, then about four seconds of also-quiet static, then about six seconds of silence. Then it repeats. They didn’t do this right out of the box, but I’ve only had them a week or two. I don’t know what this is or how to stop it (or if I even can).There’s nothing too terribly wrong with these headphones, but…I don’t know. Personally, I find the few minor problems hard to ignore. You might not have the same problem, or at least not to the same degree."
"TL;DR: Good headphones out of box, excellent headphones for the price and good ANC. A bit of tinkering with app settings makes the experience better. Logistical nightmare from Amazon however.Firstly, let me say that these headphones are phenomenal for the price you pay. The multi device outing was a feature I didn’t think I’d need, but it’s pretty seamless (it is hierarchal, so if the first device you paired plays something, it will ignore the second device completely). The ANC works pretty well (I couldn’t hear a loud air conditioner while sitting right in front of it). Out of box, the sound quality is alright, but you can use the Soundcore app to adjust the EQ manually or using one of their presets, and it sounds way better. There’s even an included AUX cable, but just know that you CANNOT use ANC on AUX. The only big problem is that the headphones makes your ears hot after long sessions, especially in the summer. A bit bulky, which isn’t a problem for me, but I know it’s a turn-off for some people.However, I can’t give this a 5 or even a 4 star rating because of the atrocious customer service from Amazon. I received the product a full 2 WERKS after the original delivery date, and I was trying to closely monitor the package to see what the issue was. Customer Service was a joke and sent us in circles, and even after multiple guarantees and escalations, I came to find out that the product was incorrectly placed on the wrong truck and travelled halfway up the coast before coming back to the same fulfillment center it originated from (mind you this was AFTER I reached out multiple times for an update. Bottom line, I love the headphones, but I can’t help but feel sour when I use them because of the horrible logistics from Amazon."
"I got this because of Tik Tok 😂 but the buttons would work when they wanted to. No matter how I pressed the buttons, how long or from which angle. And just adjusting the earphones will activate transparency mode and it was annoying because I had to constantly put it back to normal or noise cancelling. They felt a tad bit too large for my head. I wanted to tighten them a little more since I felt like it was a little too low on my ears. I returned them. Not for me.-Noise cancelling is pretty good for the price-Sound quality is good for music. And I think it’s okay for calls-The transparency mode on the left earphone is too sensitive. Turns on when you’re just adjusting the headphones-a little too big for my head. Constantly had to adjust-Buttons did not work well"
"I bought these headphones for a series of international flights I had to take, but now I use them in my office whenever it gets loud. The sound and noise cancellation are both pretty good. The ANC doesn't block out sounds 100% of sounds, but it blocks out most and I'll usually put on relaxing sounds of rain or waves at a low volume to help me focus.This would have been 5 stars, but after a year and a half of occasional use, the plastic on the headband broke. I tried to baby these headphones to get them to last as long as I could. (always traveling in it's included case), but unfortunately that's all I was able to get out of them. I can tape them up and keep using them, but it's a little disappointing.In summary, it has good performance for the price but questionable durability can affect its longevity."
"The noise quality is fine, but if you have a noisy workplace, you basically need to deafen yourself in order to tune things out. I work in a busy medical environment and I still, with this on and running white noise, have to close doors in order to not hear the rest of the office. Not enough to justify this price."
"As much as I would like to give 5 stars I can't. I love everything about my headphones except durability. I use them 5 times a week to go to the gym and take good care of them, always put them in the pouch after each use. Unfortunately they broke by just adjusting the size out of nowhere."
You get what you paid for. The microphone doesn't work.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I don't submit reviews often, but I felt that I needed to for this one. This speaker is a piece of junk! My daughter paid for this with her own money after researching small, portable, water-resistant speakers. When we received the speaker, it failed within the first week. It wouldn't turn off. We returned it and requested a replacement. The sound quality... while not amazing, was actually pretty fair. The replacement speaker we received was delivered quickly. The speaker worked for awhile. But now it's doing the same thing. After charging all night, there's a red light along the left side of the speaker that doesn't go away, the speaker won't turn off, and now for the past couple hours it just keeps making this sound about every 20 seconds.Unfortunately, this speaker is just landfill. I sent a message to the seller, so we will see how that goes.UPDATE... Customer Service has been really great so far. They responded quickly. The day after I sent my initial message to them, they gave me a full refund. Thank you, MEGUO!"
"Update:  Seller reached out to remedy my circumstance. I greatly appreciate that. Updated to 3 stars. When it works, sound is very good.  Perhaps I encountered a lemon.Well, it's been a difficult 4 months, but now it's over.  It just won't turn on anymore.  It was good at going to sleep when not in use, then powering down eventually.  But turning it back on has been a nightmare.  Sometimes it comes on in 3-4 seconds.  Sometimes 30 seconds.  Sometimes 60 seconds.  Now, never.  It was a fairly good sale, so not out a ton of money.  Can't believe how much it is now.  Is there anything good?  Sure, the sound quality was pretty good, in this price range.  The LED light ring was nice, about 7 different patterns, many for me were too flashy, but the last one with gradual changes was very neat.  It connects easily by bluetooth.  The speaker was for my desktop, so never really tested the battery life.  The buttons were a bit tough to push.  When it turns on, goes to sleep, powers down, the sound was a bit annoyingly loud.  Now this speaker is annoyingly dead, won't power back up.  So at the higher cost I see it at, it's up to you to risk your money.  I took the risk, and lost.  And the battery life now, well, very poor.  4 months of painful ownership, would not recommend."
"Works terrific the first couple months then battery life gets shorter and shorter and now I could charge it all night and only get an hour out of it. The lights on it worked good till about over a month ago they glitch together now. Very easy to use, bass mode makes for clearer sound."
Let's start with what I like about this speaker. One it's Bluetooth and rechargable. The lights are pretty and changes color. It is light weight and has a string attach for easy carrying. Now u sonetime you get what u paid for and in this case that was just it. It was affordable it durable and you can adjust the volume on the speaker or with your phone. Biggest problem. It doesn't sound that great on a high volume and it doesn't hold a charge but for a few hours. Not something you can take on a all day outing.
Bought this for my son for Christmas in 2023. A couple of months ago it just stopped pairing with his phone. It won’t even show up as a Bluetooth connection option. He can’t use it anymore. Kind of a waste of money.
This speaker is just okay but did not exceed my expectations in the way of loudness. This is not to say it's a bad product or that there was anything wrong with it. It just does not get very loud. If you walk into another room it's barely Audible. If your use case is for a small space or maybe bathroom use it's a good little speaker.
These are nice and work well if plugged in. Lasted about 4 hours turned up pretty loud for a graduation party at a house. Was used for background music. The sync function worked well.
"This speaker has nice sound and just the size I wanted, but the very loud sounds when you turn it on or off are just stupid.  It also has totally unnecessary flashing lights, but fortunately they can be turned off (each time you use it).  I use this in an older car that has no modern Bluetooth capability.  The incredibly loud sounds when I turn it on or off, and the flashing lights are enough of an irritant that I am searching for a similar speaker that just sits there like it should without all the teeny-bopper noises and lights."
"I purchased this speaker on September 24,2024 and today is November 4, 2024 and it has stop working. I can't send it back because warranties only for 30 days. Now I have to buy another. This piss me off."
I bought the device but when it arrived the box said 10W and not 20W as advertised
Stopped recharging after 4 months: too bad  I liked it before then... but as soon as I wrote this review they contacted  me for a replacement or  refund . They obviously care about customer satisfaction.
Broke the bottoms stopped working
"At least twice a week, the connection gets terrible and ruins whatever your listening to."
"Speaker has great sound but doesn’t hold its charge for more then a couple of hours, in order to listen to the speaker you have to keep it plugged in,  I will not buy this one again and I don’t recommend buying it either"
Poor sound quality. Battery would not fully charge.
"This speaker has the worst battery life I have ever seen in a bluetooth speaker speaker.  I'm talking an hour at the most. Sound is fair at best.  I thought most bluetooth devices would cut off automatically if not hooked up, but this one does not.  Don't waste your time with this speaker."
Took the item on a off rd race and it only lasted about 4 hrs so I did not get enough play time.
box was damaged before shipping because the shipping box is perfect condition.
"Stopped working after 3 months.  When it did work, the sound quality was less than optimal."
I bought this in October 2023. Never used it in water or around water even though it is water proof. Quite holding charge back in May 2024. Now at the end of July it will no longer charge or anything. Just now getting to writing this review on it.
"I’m disappointed I thought it would be much louder especially with a bass enhancement button, honestly the sound sucks and the bass button just makes it even quieter :/ the lights on it are super cool they even have different light modes I love them so I gave it a higher rating. A month later and it still works great & great battery time still the sound isn’t as loud as I’d like it to be but overall it’s a decent speaker"
Got the speaker in October 2023 And on November 1 of 2024 Power button would no longer turn on speaker would not recommend
"It is quiet, and already will not hold a charge. Went back to my old reliable one that is held together by duct tape but is still better than yours!!!! Very disappointed"
"THIS IS NOT 20 WATTS, MAX VOLUME IS WEAK . PACKAGE MISSING CARABINER. NOW I GOT TO GO OUT OF MY WAY TO BRING THEIR MISLEADING PRODUCT BACK."
Sound it not good it has no bass colors are nice with the beat to ur music.
Brought it to work and turned it on at around 8:15am and it died at 1pm. Had a quiet afternoon at work. Definitely disappointed with this purchase.
Purchased 6 months ago & have used at least a dozen times. I liked the sound from the speaker but nowthe power button (located under rubber casing) no longerworks.
Sound sucks size is okay takes forever to connect to phone IT DOES NOT CHARGE AT ALL everything about this item is bad.
tiny and not very loud. no way it’s 20watts. ok maybe for a child’s toy.
Had to return it and get a different one
"Only lasted a few months before dying even while plugged in, not buying another one."
"I love this speaker. Great sound, but suddenly now I can’t get it to connect to my phone. ????"
Horrible sound quality. Sounds choppy and interrupted. Barely holds charge. Honestly not worth even $5.
"Battery doesn't last even for an hour. Very disappointing. Sound quality is poor, with no bass. I can barely hear it when it's turned all the way up. Sadly I'm already back on the market shopping for a better one."
I should have read the reviews before purchasing. This thing died within the first month. I'm a teacher and it's important for us to have music while playing outside. Just a few uses and it stopped charging altogether. What a waste.
"First speaker failed after a few weeks, a replacement speaker was sent, it also failed but because it lasted just beyond the timeframe for returns, I'm now stuck. Sad, very sad when a manufacturer is aware and chooses not to do the right thing. Obviously I cannot recommend this product."
"First, not loud at all. Second, I'm not 100% sure as I'm not going to go look but when I was buying it a few months back, I could have swore one of the reason I bought it because it was 20Watts but when I got it, it was only 15watts. Sound was mediocre at best. Not loud at all which is why I got it to replace my less loud Bluetooth speaker so I just sent it back immediately. Cheap chinese garbage."
"This item was great at first but unfortunately it stopped working shortly after getting it, my return window is closed, I’m very disappointed and wished I could have saved my money !"
The speaker is okay overall but there are some issues I have with it. It has a “bass mode” but it doesn’t really seem to change much. There is hardly ever any bass no matter what mode it’s in. The light modes are nice. The speaker also doesn’t last very long but it does allow you to charge it while using it.Update: it says it’s charging when I plug it in but it will not turn on.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                The speakers I received was highly defective. The first time I tested it out, it worked perfectly fine. It connected to each other and even had pretty decent sound coming out of it. The second time I turned it on, it won’t connect to Bluetooth, it won’t turn off, none of the buttons would respond, and I can’t even turn off its lights. I mainly bought it so I can have some form of surround sound but it was pretty disappointing. I just left it in the closet after trying to turn it off for 30 mins."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Haven't even had the speaker a full week and it won't charge anymore it will not cut on or play any music at all I do not recommend buying it.
"Dissatisfied because it's sound is pretty low, and battery doesn't last that long."
It doesn't last the charge long time The battery gets drained real fast it's not a good choice to buy this it's not a good choice to buy this
"Speaker broke after a few weeks of light use, tried contacting the company with no reply. I would not recommend this speaker to anyone."
wouldnt hold a charge unable to use
It paird but NO SOUND WHATSOEVER EVEN plugged in and bluetooth.
"I bought this mid May (2023), it stopped working after less than 2 months. When it did work it was great."
I bought this to use at my vacation home! It worked great the first time but will not charge after battery ran down! A red light came on and remains on and speaker will not work! I do not recommend this speaker
Sounds quality was fine jus upset it broke when I tried tuning it off it'll just glow red
Not as loud as it appears or advertised imo and it def has power consumption issues...literally cant runnit forb20 mins wo low battery warni g chimes very annoying
It dies after a few hours of use and it is so quiet. The only nice part is the lights. I never write reviews but I’m so mad I bought this stupid thing I had to let the people know. Don’t waste your money!!!
"purchased this product twice, both times the power button failed inside of 3 months. Used everyday for purposes of nap time in child care center. don't have time to chase down warranties or returns. 3 months of use is still outlandish for the price. will not recommend this headache to anyone."
Worked well for a month BUT now it won't turn on or charge. Buttons are unresponsive. Buy a different speaker and save your money. I thought I was getting a deal but I guess you get what you pay for.
"I purchased this because I wanted some music while I painted and figured a speaker would be a cost-effective way to do that. I saw the good reviews and was sold-- but unfortunately was disappointed. This speaker never even turned on with the rainbow LED lights---just the red charging light. It never charged nor did it connect to any device. I've had products that worked for a few months then stop, but never have I ever had a product that didn't work right out the box!"
"We purchased this as a Christmas gift, and it only worked about one month. Then the power button broke, and it will not turn on."
I bought this speaker in 3 months ago and it stopped working smh...Don't buy
"Speaker never worked at all after full charge right out of the box ... then have to wait to get refund for 7 days after the speaker gets back  to the company . Witch could take over 2 weeks since it is an over seas company ,if it even makes it there .. atleast it was cheap and not much of a loss ...lol"
Sound quality BAD
I charged the speaker as soon as it arrived for about 4 hours. When I tried to turn it on it wouldn’t do so. I tried charging it for a few more hours and attempted to power it on again. Long story short I tried everything but couldn’t ever get it to even power on. Very disappointed. Won’t be recommending.
Arrived with zero battery life and an hour of charge still wouldn’t bring it to life or perhaps it was just dead on arrival period … so I sent it back… item was a bust for me.  To be fair I had somewhat decided I didn’t want it anyways … lack of battery life just sealed the deal.
"The speaker looks great but does not work. The turn on/off button would not respond. The device started to randomly start and stop, playing the annoying sound randomly and continuously. I never got to use it, so I cannot speak of the sound quality or the battery life. I returned it and ordered a similar product from another brand."
Malfunctioned after 2 months. Makes crackling sound when turned on and won’t pair.
"The speaker worked one time and then would not hold a charge after that initial use.  It would work for a few minutes and then die. The provided power cord appears to be fine, so we are unsure what the issue is.Very disappointing."
claims 24 hour battery.  didnt last one round. will return.
"After getting it, I was excited to use this speaker!However, after getting it unboxed, it wouldn't turn on.  We even let it charge...and it still won't turn on.Don't waste your money.  Get a better speaker ."
"After less than a year the device will turn on by itself and you can’t shut it off again , went to the garbage."
It was interfering with my tv antenna signal
Button on top broke it in two days
"There are a lot of great reviews, but also a lot about the product not turning on. It seems like there's a 50/50 chance you'll either get a defective product, or you'll get a great speaker. Mine was defective"
Sound quality not the best.
"This product was a massive fail! It wouldn’t even turn on. After doing extensive research on how to troubleshoot, still Nothing. When I attempted to return it for a refund, this product was not eligible for one."
It should be loud !!!It sucks
"It wouldn’t even turn on. I’ve already begun the return process. I ordered a replacement to see if I get a better one, if not I’ll just be getting my money back."
It was working good. Put after two months it stopped working.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This product is a fraud! It doesn’t keep charge and sound is not at all average! The bass is not even basing!!! Don’t get it waste of money and such a disappointment
"I'm  not happy with this speaker , it will not take a charge,so I can not rate the sound  or LED's."
This thing couldn't pair to any of my bluetooth-enabled devices. No drivers available online. Returning this one and suggest you look elsewhere
"I have this to someone as a Christmas gift who lives in another city, she used it , and told me it doesn’t work."
"Didn't work on arrival.....followed poor instructions and tried everything possible,  still nothing.Returned."
No Worth the money stop working don’t waste your money only had it for 3 months not worth it
Wouldn't charge up and couldn't even be turned on. Total fail on every level. Will return it ASAP.
Speaker never turned on even after a full charge over 2 days. Will buy a different brand.
It's broken. Kid threw box away while at wrk. We got it yesterday. So sad
Only worked about a week. Stopped playing.
Plugged it in for 24 hours and didn't work 😪
"I got this last spring to use in the shower and when I'm out by the pool.  Within about 6-9 months, it didn't work anymore.  It charges just fine but there is so much static that I can't hear the music.  I know it's under $20 but I was hoping it would last longer."
I need to know how to contact seller. The red light is on it won't charge or turn off
Only lasts 45 minutes to an hour on a full charge. The lights are cool though.
I have had this speaker for less than a year and already it will not charge. I have only used it a few times and it quit charging. Very disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone nor would I buy another one.
"If you have never used a Bluetooth speaker, and expect only light rain/water this will likely work well for you. The speaker sounds great, the battery lasts and the lights work well and can be shut off entirely.If you have used a Bluetooth speaker, you are likely used to the play button acting as both play and pause possibly even play/pause/answer. Unfortunately, on this speaker pressing Play twice will dial the last person you spoke with. While this is expected per the documentation, it is so jarring and to me useless that I have to take away a full star and a half.The water resistance works but is not as good as some other speakers. I noticed in a medium amount of rain the sound became distorted while other speakers did not. It did continue to work, but with such distortion that I shut it off."
"Lights are pretty nice looking and it comes with many options for the lights. The sound is pretty good ,and it comes with a bass mode which just makes it sound a but fussy with little bass. The sound is also pretty one directional and not as loud as I wanted it to be."
"I expected bigger sound from this small speaker, but it did not quite hold up to expectations. The sound is small (not very loud and does not fill the space) and it is a bit hollow sounding. The bass is not very strong. In general this is an OK speaker but not for the given price, it should sound better."
there is a battery inside. where would i buy new battery for it? it doesn't look like battery sell anywhere in place i lived
When I contacted online how to fix I was told it can’t be fixed after 3 uses. I notice other items on reviews with the same problem. I ordered again before I realized the problem and will send another review.I had the same problem with two purchases. Only lights no sound
"as you can imagine after spending hundreds of dollars on a system one would like to play it to its full ability. well upon receiving my order i was sent the wrong cable, i was sent the european cable...which is so odd because my address was in not europe last i checked. and that awful experience still haunts me. so the system is amazing but don't get it on amazon or at least be careful."
"the AC adapter that was in the box is for UK,Oman will need to order a USA one, even though it states it came with it"
I was expecting a brand new in the box switch. Not what was sent. It was received too late to return and reorder before Christmas
"This review is for someone on the fence about a handheld gaming system... if you intend to use this mostly docked... move on to another review.The screen is small for me. I grew up with the original GameBoy, GameBoy Color, GameBoy Advanced, and finally the GameBoy Advanced SP. That should give you some idea of my age. Even wearing glasses, the 7"" screen is too small for most text. I like RPG's and story based games, and the text is often not optimized for the smaller Switch screen.Finding cases is about impossible. Maybe there are more now, but in 2022 I had to improvise because there were almost no cases that the OLED would fit in. I purchased a padded sling bag and added extra foam to prevent damage if dropped.The battery dies VERY fast. You pretty much have to be next to an outlet if you're gaming longer than 2hrs... maybe if you sat in the dark and turned the screen brightness down.The screen scratches about as easily as an old school CD or DVD. I had to wait for my screen protector to be delivered and played the Switch for a few days, kept it in a padded case when not in use, AND it got a small scratch on the screen.It struggles with ports. Games made by Nintendo work great on the switch. Ports of games made for beefier hardware struggle on the Switch.FYI, I sold my Switch and purchased a gaming laptop."
"Really? for this price ?  no instructions in English !  everything in the box was written in a foreign language. No set up guide. no tips, thanks a lot , next time I'd just buy one locally with someone to assist me . and the first purchase I made for a game was made out of Singapore ! Don't purchase online , just buy them from a local store"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                First time writing a review bc I feel people need to know this about third-party sellers. Just a disclaimer, I didn’t know that this product had multiple third party sellers. I thought it was shipping from Nintendo (my fault for not verifying). The switch seems new but the packaging was roughed up. Look at the other video/photo reviews, mine looked something similar. My packaging was also in Japanese not even English. No seal/tape on anything within the package. I'm a very weary and anxious person when it comes to ordering expensive items. I paid full price for this Switch OLED, but I'm afraid I have received a used item. After careful consideration, I decided to return the product due to all the suspicions that popped up due to the packaging and the product itself. Buy it if you don't care about that because it does work great still. I will be ordering an actual NEW one from the Nintendo website."
"Charging doc doesn't work at all since I opened the box. I have had the devices for less than a week. But on the 15th of December was when I wanted to purchase games on my new console I went to go get my device it was at 50 percent when I put it on the charing doc when I go get the device it's at 22% battery I tried different wall outlets same result. Also the right joystick is a bit more losse the the left joystick when attached to the console. I don't know why I'm having these issues when I didn't buy a used device I spent almost 400 dollars on a brand new device just for my stuff not to work properly.Btw for anyone looking to get an Nintendo switch i did some reseach when your charging doc is blinking rapidly when plugging the ac adapter it doesn't work AT ALL!! It's supposed to be a soild green light no blinking.But another thing is that when I was playing my game on the nintendo the background where there was nothing black as it is suppose to be but however when i started to play more i started to notice the black was beginning to be more green and was 3 hours into playing just imagine how it is now and also the device is very slow when loading the shop or anything most definitely a delayed respond and this was before I purchase any games just imagine now and even when I'm playing offline it's lagging on a game that isn't multi-player. Thanks Nintendo....🙄 overall my experience when using the device itself hasn't been the best but the games make up for its short comings alot of short coming might I add...😒😮‍💨Update on May 6th 2023So this is the first time I have ever using the hdmi option because I wanted to play with nintendo with others. But turns of even with a third party device the hdmi doesn't work either. I tried on different tvs  with the same result allow me to mention again this is the first time I ever decided to use the hdmi option so there isn't any reason for it to not work. But btw even with me trying it with original or third party hdmi cables and docs the result is still the same the tvs that I tried recognizes the hdmi cable is plugged in but still there I'd no signal. So this means the problem is with the nintendo, but also guess what ... 🤯😒🙄 others customer are having the same problem. Imma be real honest I 1000% regret buying the nintendo switch I should have returned it but since I've had it for so long it's too late. But also keep in mind I got this device either in January or December but not counting latest time when I tried to play the device which is today and yesterday but the last time I played on this device was in February. This is going to be the last time I do an updated review on this device, but for you Nintendo I'm so disappointed. I've been a fan of nintendo since I was a toddler remember having older nintendo console and either 9 or 10 years old getting the dsixl, great devices with amazing games along side with it. But the nintendo switch worse device you ever made in my opinion so many problems to troubleshoot, and so many issues that can't be fixed so you either get a new device or go to their competition aka steam deck.Things to note:Since I have been a fan of nintendo from when I was young to now. The devices from when I was younger were more durable and more childproof aka the nintendo device could take a beating but with the nintendo switch it doesn't having that feeling of durability so be careful because this device is expensive. I never dropped or damaged the switch in any shape or form but just trying to form an understanding to those reading about how the device feels in my hand and the problems that I stated in my earlier review about the device and also the joysticks."
"I'm an adult who happens to like Nintendo games, but skipped the switch until now. Simply put, this console is designed for kid's hands. It is astoundingly uncomfortable to use for more than very brief (around 5 minute) sessions. Games that require the right stick are basically impossible to play in handheld mode, because you have nothing to hold onto and therefore your right thumb uses the right stick as a sort of handle. If that stick has any function in the game (like angling the camera), hitting the shoulder buttons will cause your thumb to move, moving the camera. That is a very common control scheme in first- and third-person perspective games, so in these games aiming is virtually impossible.You can also play it docked using an included controller harness, but it is very narrow, forcing my wrists into an uncomfortable angle. I can play games that use the right stick though, but not for long. This controller harness gets uncomfortable after around 15 minutes. Everywhere I've read online recommends buying a Pro Controller and a case with handles to alleviate this terrible design. That adds around $100 to this product's price.Is it worth it?Not really. The Switch was underpowered when it was brand new, and now (7 years later?) it is even more out of date with modern gaming standards. As a portable, that's forgiveable, but they really need to chop the price in half or possibly include a few games and the necessary ergonomic accessories that are 100% necessary to enjoy this thing. It has an OLED screen but it's not super impressive. It's a cheap OLED that doesn't support HDR or high refresh rates (not that I imagine any games would take advantage of either), so it's merely decent but nothing incredible.In order to play online games, you must subscribe to an online service, but it's way behind even the now quite ancient Xbox 360's online service. You can't do voice chat. It's laggy. The system itself was designed with online as an afterthought. Most multiplayer games are peer-to-peer, so what exactly are you getting for your money? Some ROMS from earlier console generations. The entire online multiplayer thing should be free, gating this behind any fee given how bad Nintendo's service is, well frankly it's insulting.In short, this is incredibly overpriced for what it is. It's too uncomfortable to use without $100 of accessories, and going online will cost you $20 - $60 per year. Games that came out a decade ago cost $60 (they just keep re-releasing games from the WiiU), and the price point for new games is $70. It's a total waste of money, but the only legal way to play  modern Nintendo games, which are quite fun.I wish Nintendo would just get out of the hardware game and focus on games, like what Sega did in the 90's. They aren't making good hardware products anymore."
"EVERY SINGLE SWITCH GAME I BOUGHT SUCKS! I OWN SIX SWITCH GAMES, THEY'RE ALL MAJOR TITLES, AND THEY ALL SUCK RIDICULOUSLY BAD.... THIS IS HORRIBLE! AND I AM NOT EVEN OVER EXAGGERATING.For example.... The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild makes you cross—dress Link in women's clothing just to enter a town full of women that ""forbid any men from entering the town. The games on this POS have made me want to throw this console at the wall so many times that I have become majorly concerned for my mental health.Trash graphics, uncustomizable system, many games lack the basic options that today's games have like camera invert controls, and wow, their games are basic asf. I am so frustrated with this purchase that I have rage—tweeted to Nintendo with earth-scorching complaints so many times that I'm surprised that they haven't blocked me.Look.... I livestream all the time, and every time I'm gaming on my Livestream with a Nintendo Switch, no one wants to watch. SERIOUSLY, NO ONE GOVES A FLYING CRAP ABOUT A NINTENDO SWITCH LIVESTREAM. I have 0 viewers when streaming with a Switch. I WISH I WAS JOKING.I don't understand how people keep saying this is a great gaming console, because it's not. It's trash and it's getting returned for a refund. I bought a PS5, Xbox Series S, and now this POS Nintendo Switch, and after my experience with all of these systems, I can only recommend that people stay VERY far away from a Nintendo Switch. I can't even stand this thing.I WOULD NEVER LET MY KID OWN A NINTENDO SWITCH, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NUTS. What an overpriced POS. My suggested retail value of a Nintendo Switch is no more than 50 bucks, that's how awful of an experience this console gives its fans.Their controllers are complete trash too. It comes with this joycon handheld gaming controller connector thing, and you can't even plug your headphones into it. If you're a wired headphones user like me, you will be so outraged that your wired headphones absolutely have to be plugged into the Switch itself. Not to mention that the right controller struggles to stay synced to the console when disconnected from the console, and causes uncontrollable stick drift. I like gaming with wired controllers for peak performance, and I'm so unimpressed with the Switch controllers. When you hold the Switch with one hand for a second, you can feel the weight of the console might break the joycon controllers off of the Switch itself, it's that flimsy of a connection.The shipping was fast, but this was a terrible investment. A complete waste of money. And they're charging 60 bucks for these trash games too? I am baffled at how more people aren't complaining about what this company is getting away with. This is highway robbery! I am never buying a Nintendo product ever again. 👎🏻 Did I mention that the games are stupid? 🤢 When you buy this piece of junk, you're basically paying for a touch screen console that still needs the controller to operate the system and games, even though it's touch screen.For the price of the 3 games I bought and system itself, I could have purchased an Xbox Series X instead and not had all these problems. This is a system for kids, not for someone who's trying to take their livestream career seriously. This console is a joke and I do not recommend. 0 stars if I could."
I love the idea of portable gaming and have not played video games in 20 years. I bought  Doom eternal as it used to be one of my favorite games as a kid.1) downloading games : I dont like this idea as its not transferable for another person in your household to just play at their leisure unless they want to completely under your login with their own separate profile form their Nintendo account. This idea is a huge fail to me. your profile and gaming experience/ progress should be completely clouded and seamless.how nice would it be to just log in on any switch and have your stuff ready to go as long as they had the same games. in my opinion they missed big on this.2. The support for these games are lacking. there are software crashes and no one seems to be able to help with logging the crashes and actually patch fixing the bugs. so i have a downloaded game that i spend 3 hours playing a master level that crashes at the end of that level. I have no saved progress and am forced to start all over. what a crappy experience when you play games as an adult to relax.3. the games are extrodinarily expensive. i am unimpressed with the price and once again if you download these games there is almost zero chance everyone in a household with separate consoles can enjoy the game to its fullest. they are going to want to save their progress on their own console. big thumbs down.4. the oled is great for using with a monitor or by standalone with a separate controller. holding it and using joycons is too big imo for someone with even large hands. they are so far away for a heaving controlling game like doom eternal.5. the speed is a little slow for high pace games and would have liked it to handle 120fpsfor the price i can only recommend if you plan on having a mostly mobile gaming experience as the price is not competitive with larger fixed gaming platforms for the reasons listed above.
Started to have issues with the connection. And I also don’t like the fact that it came in a box translated Japanese too.
"Well it worked wondrously for awhile and the Zelda Tears of the Kingdom game was massive and creative. Until the controller started its widely know and widely documented “drift.” In my case it was a nintendo pro controller - the joy cons are too small for my hands and give me repeated stress injury so I use the larger pro controller made by Nintendo for Switch. But all over the internet you can find fix it videos and instructions for the inevitable drift, whether for the joy cons or the pro controller. Seems Nintendo may repair the Joy Cons drift issue for free but not the pro controllers.The fact that it has a commonly known name of “controller drift” tells you something.I have a decades-old PS 3 I still use from time to time and never had a Sony controller with drift. No PC game controller I’ve owned ever drifted.So what’s drift? The character/object you are controlling starts moving on its own with no input on your part. In my case, it was downward on the screen.  Link, standing on a ledge, suddenly just walks off the edge and dies. Forget about precision movements.It worked great for almost a year. But the darn thing is expensive and I’m not buying another just to last awhile till the next one drifts. Fix it and maybe I’ll get another Nintendo someday. But expect me to go to YouTube and take apart my controller for dubious self-repair or buy another controller - nope."
"UPDATE -- So I have had this version for almost a year now. the OLED is very noticeably better in screen quality and graphics than the standard version (in my opinion) and worth the money for the better version. HOWEVER, what is NOT worth more money is that your shiny technologically advanced switch may not last as long as your standard switch.  Our old standard switch became a family switch and aside from a faulty kickstand (child error), it works fine.  The OLED switch, however, no longer charges and is now unplayable rendering all progress in every game also lost. Unfortunate. RIP Pokémon collections.ORIGINAL REVIEW -- The red is not the intense Mario red I was hoping for, more like a orangey red. And the texture of the plastic is very weird. It’s not the smooth feel of normal switch components but a coarse bothersome (to me) gritty feel that I actively notice when playing. Hopefully I will just get used to it. If I had been able to play test it in person I would have bought the white version (which I think is more normal)."
"Getting it from Amazon Distrobution Centers in a Major City Hub Next to your City and Address is what Ship and Sold by Amazon, not much room for logistics errors here and not shipping from overseas saves tons of time and money, and time is money friends, the Consoles not that great which is what imma get into next I'd recommend PS4Pro or Ps5 over it any day. So save your money and just know coming from a hard-core gamer of 42 years with all consoles experience and PC Gaming Experience as well, trust me with what I say...There is so Fanantasy through Nostalgia for Millienials that Nintendo has Mario and Zelda and when nothing else is available (oh I gotsta gets my Switch!) To show off to your friends and fam fams, now if this is the case make sure to buy Tennis Aces, Zelda Skyward Sword, Mario Kart 8, Smash Bros Ultimate, Mario Golf Super Rush, and any and all Licensed by Nintendo Games, which are the most expensive, be sure to by a big Accessories pack and that iVoler case that holds the dock, which this is meant to be Docked up and LANed. Although stronger WiFi signal is OK for most games because Matchmaking is strangely scarce, unless they are all playing Fortnite and other freebies. Mario Kart should always be busy though if it ever isn't Nintendo died. Like so 3rd Party Games like Tony Hawk 1+2 have limited control and lines are way harder to pull off like I remember pulling off million point combos but not on this version, Doom Eternal has the player getting massacred by the dayum baby Spider just cause the controls aren't made for Switch. Small Japanese Thumbs are what original joy-cons are for. NUFF SAID."
Everything was in the package not in original box the system runs great however the volume is low even when on max in handheld... not sure if water damage or something else other than that I am happy with the system.
Even though my item came with two deep scratches which are very noticeable decent handheld and nice seller
"Ordered this for the one day shipping, and despite being on the US ..I somehow landed the non US kit that came with a useless AC adapter.Luckily the Switch OLED works fine as you are able to select any region, but I'm having to wait on a replacement non ASI kit for a useable AC adapter."
"Got 2 of them, returned two, always the same problem, charging issues. I'm keeping this one because I'm tired of returning it,"
"The product works fine, we just got it in a non wrapped damaged box and it had no warranty."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The box doesn't look new.  Looks like it's beentossed around a bit.  Or shipped back and forth a bunch of times.
My son loves it
"The exterior brown box that the OLED shipped in was in perfect condition BUT the actual Nintendo box had a pretty bad bruise on the corner of it which tells me that before the OLED even made it into the brown packaging box it was not handled with care. BUT inside of the Nintendo box, the OLED itself was fine nothing was scratched or damaged or anything of the sort and everything was in the box that's supposed to be in the box. But the listing of the switch does not say anywhere that is it NOT U.S. model. So when I received it I could not connect the OLED to my home wifi or any wifi for that matter and I know that I was trying to connect it correctly because I used the first model switch to connect to my wifi and it worked perfectly and I also used other devices that I had and they connected perfectly. After messing with it for hours I didn't even make it past the setup screen because I needed the OLED to connect to my wifi in order to transfer my game data from the 1st gen switch. So I packaged it back up and the very next day I returned it. This happened on the 24th of March 2023 and I just tracked my return a couple of hours ago and unfortunately, it won't even make it to the warehouse until the 29th...so yea. I was really hoping to get a full refund by the time I go on vacation at the beginning of April but oh well! lesson learned. if your in the U.S please spare yourself the time, and money and DO NOT BUY the OLED from here. as soon as I get the refund I am going to best buy."
"Overall it's a nice console, but has it's issues. One is how it doesn't connect to my wifi from my room. My phone, laptop, and ps4 has no problem connecting to my wifi with full bars, yet for some reason with this switch I need to physically bring it closer to my router to connect it (which then stays connected when I go back to my room). Very strange. Another issue was with my right joycon. I'm not sure if it's the joycon or the right dock of my switch but it doesn't recharge as fast or doesn't recharge at all compared to the right joycon. Or perhaps the battery life indicator of that joycon is not synced correctly. May be a manufacturing defect but it wasn't a huge issue for me so I didn't bother returning. Still a little disappointing when thinking about having paid 350usd for this."
Apparently when you want to buy a new switch Amazon wants to send you their dirty hand me down consoles instead... always fun touching strangers dirty controllers.  After cleanining the console some I noticed a bunch of scratches on the back and one on the screen itself which isn't terrible but enough to be noticable.  Battery was dead so I had to wait awhile to get an initial charge on the switch to even try and do anything with it... fine whatever... finally get it to turn on and find someone's old account on here with my favorite thing ever... parental controls!  *smh*  Now I get to figure out how to reset a pin on a device that should have been new.  Yay for learning I guess.  Cost me .50 more and a bit of a headache but I finally got the pin reset and can now do something with the console.  I thought about playing some of the games left on the system but decided against it seeing as I don't want these people getting credit for my hard work.  Found the system restore and now I'm waiting another half an hour to clean off everyones garbage so I can put my own on there.... Honestly if I wanted a headache and someone else's hand me down switch I would have paid the $50.50 smaller price tag to get one... but at least I learned something I suppose and the system seems to work... if you can get past that scratch in the screen.
"So hey it works great out the box no damage no problems, except the screen smudges easily but it's also super durable, battery drains rather fast in handheld and while many AAA games are ported over and on discounts, they are really watered down and don't draw you in as much as PS5 OR Hardcore PC, It's greatest benefits are its portability, it's motion controlled games, and it's Officially Licensed Titles, the 3rd party developers did a fine job porting over their titles BUT matchmaking isn't that great, you'll think you know a great online game but then no one's playing sometimes, but 95% of the time people are Bowling on Switch Sports, that's a great title, and No Man's Sky is being released on Oct. 7th, now that's nice for a mobile gaming platform, but titles like Doom Eternal are very meal and mild looking and feeling with far less intensity as they were on their original platforms, some of the titles you'll think are new are actually remakes. But Square/Enix is on board real strong, and if your a F@rtnite Tard well that's available for your wanky ass too. So basically it's not bad but it's not great either."
"Yea, I'd rather stick with my good old original Nintendo switch than upgrade to this one... returned it. There just aren't enough added pros to warrant the switch to oled... yes, the screen is bit bigger, a bit brighter, the sound is also a bit better... and I stress , A BIT.  and then the con: the game card slot.  You can't even get it open!!! I literally cut my nails and left one long... no, it isn't my coke nail.  It's my oled nail.  Because you need either that or a razor blade to pop the thing open if you wanna switch the game you're playing! Ridiculous . What would possess them to get rid of that notch? I see no good reason to get rid of it.  And it's the entire reason why I returned the oled and went back to my original switch. Call me when you fix your game slot nintendo!"
"So the last console I owned was the Game Cube. I have played on other people's newer consoles and I have a few games on my PC. I haven't gamed that much in awhile though. When I purchased the Switch, it was because I played some Breath of The Wild at a friend's like a year or two prior and I was itching for more. So I got it, played it, and it was amazing. I then got a few more games (Fenyx, Odyssey, Mario Kart, etc) and plowed through those only to realize that after 6 years or so of being out, the amount of games available that are not platformers that look like they came out when I was born, are super limited. That and the Switch can't really run most of the new games unless you want to call new games that look old new, then sure I guess. So really, the only advantage of owning a switch is that you can play it on a plane and that it has Zelda and Mario... I mean I know lots of people like to jump from platform to platform, but what's really left for everyone else? I don't know. I think after I play Tears of the Kingdom I'm just going to sell it. Maybe it's time to move to a Playstation."
"Decently fun in the car. Kind of mediocre any other time. It's ridiculous how expensive games are on this console. I really only wanted Smash Bros and the new Zelda game. To unlock everyone in Smash Bros you have to buy like 3 $25 fighter packs beyond the $50-$60 you paid for the game. The new zelda is now going to be $70 likely plus $30-$40 more for the expansion packs. With any games that aren't nintendo only you can usually get the same game on PC for like half the price with better controls.I can honestly say I prefer our Wii U over our Switch on the TV. The Wii U is a blast and was a lot cheaper. The switch does however have some pros in portability and the OLED screen looks pretty good for handheld mode, but I'd say it's not really worth getting one until Nintendo releases their new console and the price for a used one goes down in a year or two.Fairly unimpressive yet plenty expensive games, super expensive accessories, unimpressive hardware, we've had ours for what? A month or two and it's already showing some wear on the back from where our hands rested while playing. It's a cool idea and I'd wanted one for a long time, but I can honestly say I've been pretty disappointed. It's pretty much a wonky DS that everything is overpriced on."
I’m returning this because I think the ps5 maybe a better buy. This gaming system is probably best for younger child. My daughter is four and I don’t think she will get it.
I love my system but mine did arrived scratched. It is a great system besides that. It does get hot easily though.
"Nowhere did it state id get a japanese console. Not only that, I cant even plug it in. A bit misleading but it was cheaper."
"I bought this unit because I own a Nintendo WII from years ago.  I saw an ad for a sports game that looked like a similar experience the WII used to provide.  Sadly the software engineers decided not to mirror game play that WII owners are used to, opting for slightly different trigger management making it hugely frustrating playing if you have a history with the older WII games.  Bad idea. I had hoped that other titles would be better but the general design of the system REQUIRES you manipulate the micro-sized controllers - either as attached to the tablet or held in a funky grip gadget, or as independent controllers.  If you have lived with any of the X-Box or PS systems you will immediately feel the lack of mass and claustrophobic button placement on the Nintendo controllers.  My adult fingers are squeezed against the right joy stick and the “B” button, the left controller has even less real estate.  I expect that devoting lots of time to a specific game would eventually train you to use the tiny controllers, but why would you.  Just put the money into a real system with normal hand sets.  I will be returning my Nintendo Switch OLED mainly because it is scaled and focused on children.  The system itself seems well made and performs as expected, it’s just too small."
It should come with at least one game.
"Seller labeled it as great condition. It is fair at best. Chemical and food stains, scratches on screen, busted speaker screen, what looks like chew marks from a dog and marks from it being dropped. It plays fine and still works as intended but beware seller."
"A wonderful syatem with to many skeevy monotization mechanics. I thought the switch would be a good alternative to something like a gameing laptop and its good for that but with everything you purchase between games or joycons or cases or controllers this system quickly becomes well over $500-$800 really quickly. The worst part is the nintendo ""membership"" now its nice if you want to play all the old games nintendo has ever released but im not into that i want to play the few games i want to enjoy. But unlike any other newer console ever release  nintendo can not and will not back up save data without this ""membership"" which is just really bad form. I put a old sd card into my switch just in case i needed the room later but little did i know switch automatically saved game files to the sd card with no option to change until after downloading to the sd card which i did not want. And one of my fears came true that the sd card is bad so it ended up corrupting all the game data on the switch and so far i have spent 4 hours download and moving and fixing and i font even think i will get my save data back.Edit: i yook another star away because i just discovered im not allowed to play online with friends unless i buy nintendos membership. Not very happy with nintendo right now"
"I REALLY wanted to like the switch. I grew up with a Nintendo and a Super Nintendo and it was nostalgic for me. My son begged for it so we chalked up the money for Christmas. Just a warning, you have to pay for EVERYTHING for this thing. There's very minimal free games. In my opinion, when you pay for a system that's over $300, it should come with more than just the handheld. It's also very fragile. I was terrified my son would drop it so we bought a case for it, but you have to take it out of the case to put in on the base. There's so many things that are negative. On top of all that, it wasn't my son that dropped it but I did and the joy con broke it half. It wasn't even dropped from very high, just hit perfectly I guess. Now I have to chalk up $80 for new joy cons. Nothing about this thing is ""cheap"". Next time my son requests a gaming system, I will go for a console and buy him a cheap tablet for on the go."
"The box had a hole in it, but product looks ok."
"Do not waste your money. I bought this for my husband and his Switch is the only one out of all of ours that won’t stay connected to the internet no matter what. I’ve tried restarting the router, restarting the switch, resetting the WiFi settings, even manually entering the DNS code and that only works for a short time before it disconnects again.Can’t even return it or use the warranty as it was never emailed to me when I purchased the switch so the warranty was refunded back to me. 400 dollars down the drain."
"Two things:1. I thought I was buying from Amazon directly, but it must’ve switched to a fulfilled by Amazon third party seller when I changed to the “pickup” option. I don’t trust third party sellers, even with FBA, so tried to cancel once I noticed a couple of hours later but I was unable to.2. Lo and behold, received the switch, console box in rough condition that just said “OLED model” (no Spanish or French translation of “model” like North American version box has/ what’s pictured), and a little “for sale and use in Singapore” on the side… this version does not have a warranty or AC adapter that works in the US. The product pictured on the website is clearly the North American version.I should’ve read other reviews first, seems this has happened before. Lack of quality control and total waste of my time having to return this.Beware! Bad experience."
"The product looks great, has great audio and visuals, but it's really too heavy to use in anything other than TV mode and then the OLED screen is irrelevant. It's much too heavy to hold unsupported for long. Using it in tabletop mode is an option but isn't practical if your game has text to read. The screen is too small to read text at that distance, even with zoom. Even putting it on laptop desk or pillow in your lap gives neck or shoulder pain after 15 or 20 minutes.Really, I'd recommend either the Lite or regular Switch, depending on how you want to use it."
"Bought this as a gift for my 10 year old step son for his birthday.  After he used it twice, it would no longer charge. Return window closed two days before we realized it was broken. Contacted Nintendo and they wanted us to box it a specific way, including purchasing bubble wrap to mail it to them where they will have it at least three weeks. Contacted Amazon for a new system since it broke immediately and they refused to honor since it was passed the return window. I paid $350 for a new device and it immediately breaks. I don’t feel like I should be the one having to jump through the hoops with the manufacturer and be without the use of the product during that time. Amazon should send a new one and they should deal with Nintendo to get the other one fixed. I could understand if we were several months after purchase but it literally broke within two weeks. Amazon customer service would not allow me to speak to a supervisor and said the supervisor will contact me back. I have lots of meetings at work and don’t have time to just sit around waiting for a return phone call. They would not allow me to hold for the supervisor. Again, why am I the one having to waste my time to get a functional product that I have already paid for? I also will not purchase gifts early anymore if Amazon isn’t going to honor situations like this. I received it August 25th but his birthday wasn’t until September 13th. We realized it wouldn’t charge on September 27th."
"As the title says, I received this not in the original box, but loose in a generic brown box. I contacted Nintendo support to figure out what I was dealing with and they informed me that not only did I not get it in the box, but that it wasn't even a US model. It was a Asian model. While the unit may or may not have been fine otherwise, I paid for something brand new. In my book, brand new means inside the original packaging, not just inside some random box. Nintendo themselves advised I return it if I could, so I took their advise. I would not purchase from this seller unless you want to gamble with what you get."
The backend account setup and settings is incredibly confusing and not intuitive.
"I ordered my Switch on August 31, 2024. It took 16 days to get it. When I opened the box someone stole the Switch console, the controllers, & the a/c adapter. After getting a replacement sent out, 9 days later, I've received my Switch again, today, September 24, 2024. The a/c adapter used to charge it is for European outlets, no U.S. outlets. So now I've had to order a new adapter to plug in the docking station which cost me an additional $13. I was offered to return the Switch for a 3rd replacement, or a refund. I opted for ordering the adapter I needed because 3+ weeks is too long as it is when I'm paying for Prime."
Switch advertised as brand new official Nintendo sealed box picture is American switch long story short it gets here it's a Japanese American switch not a big deal because they aren't region locked all the same but I paid full price to get a brand new American switch not to mention this one was refurbished and had a beat up box look at the edges Anyone who has bought any brand new electronic knows that they come sealed with a sticker Box had none mismatch wrapping if you have ever bought a brand new switch you know what to look for loose sticks nightmare stay away!!!
"My original 2 Switch still work as well as the day I bought them. This thing died on me once while under warranty, so Nintendo fixed it for free, as they should. Then it stopped charging a second time only 2 months later, which, of course, was now out of warranty. Which makes me very suspicious of their repair process in general.Instead of spending 150$ for a repair I have zero faith will actually solve the problem, I think I'll just get a Steam Deck.Nintendo have become an incredibly sleazy company in general, and I am glad to be getting off the ride."
"I have a lot invested in my downloaded games for the Nintendo Switch. I would rate the value for hardware at five stars, but their idiotic draconian software restrictions are designed to punish owners who buy digital games, even though 99% of Switch games are digital-only. Even though I OWN and PERSONALLY PAID FOR all my downloaded games, and Nintendo has records of those purchases, I can't use them (not even exclusively) on this new OLED Switch unless it can find a wifi connection to verify ""if the game can be played"". If I have legitimately downloaded a game onto my own system, and it already verified it, why can't it believe that five minutes later I still have the rights to that game? It's idiotic and an unnecessary hassle that serves no purpose except to coerce people into buying multiple copies of a game they already paid for. For that, minus two stars, Nintendo."
"The OLED is a nice upgrade if you spend most the time in handheld mode. However, when it comes to TV mode, the Nintendo Dock is a big failure in its design which awkwardly covers the whole console when it's docked.What is worse than the previous switch model, Nintendo is proving their anti-consumer way by changing the firmware for the OLED so that third-party docks won't work or usually max at 480p. There is not any reason to cap it at such resolution in the name of OLED. The third-party docks I have ( from bestbuy) work fine with the regular model but not the OLED. What's more interesting, using the OEM dock from the regular switch and OLED console has no problem at all. This proves that Nintendo intentionally prevents the users to move with another less bulky cheaper alternatives...We don't have much freedom with what we own, hat down Nintendo."
"I just received this Switch today and from what I can tell the Switch itself works fine! I won't know until I get a new AC power adapter, however. I attempted to contact Nintendo Customer Support online. ALL of the links are broken, including one for a chat agent, and they don't respond on the number to text. I end up calling the customer support and they informed me that since I was speaking with Nintendo America and this was a Japanese-made model they won't be able to replace just the power adapter, but instead I will have to ship in the entire switch and adapter and have the entire unit replaced to accept any warranty. They also have no record of my receipt of purchase available on their end. I'm going to have to purchase another adapter and /hopefully/ it works.The adapter won't charge the switch and will say ""unable to charge"" when plugging in, even after performing a reset. The switch is currently dead so I'm not even 100% sure that the switch is truly the issue.Good job Nintendo."
"This switch is not a USA model, mines was from Singapore. I contacted seller about it but they never gave me a straight answer I found out later by checking the box and serial number, the switch works perfect and functions properly. The oled model is very nice and the screen quality is good, only con is since it’s not from USA the power plug is weird but it does come with a adapter but looks a little suspect and I asked seller since if it’s not a USA model will Nintendo still honor warranty but they never got back to me."
"I have a V2, and I wanted to upgrade to an oled model. I play 99% of the time in handheld mode.Received mine yesterday, very happy. Started to play some games (Metro, BOTW, Metroid Dread, Diablo 2, etc..) to see the improvement. The screen (size, color, remanence) and the general feels in-hand feel prenium compared to the V2!The display has a greenish tint overall, but I also noticed big stains on both sides of the screen (in real life, it really looks like in the pictures). Even after fiddling with the brightness, auto ON/OFF and vivid/standard settings, still had the green stains. The image had also a ""sandy"" kind of look.Maybe some of these ""properties"" are inherent to OLED screens, but in my case it was too heavy to not notice. I could clearly see the difference in colors between the sides and the center. I liked this model, the size, the colors, the dock, the 64gb memory, but I am sad & disappointed because I wasn't expecting to receive a damaged product.I decided to return it and not order another one because I don't want to waste my time testing/returning devices.We'll see what will be released in 2023..."
The unit is meant for non US use the power cord will not plug in in the US.
Our Joy Con controllers stopped working after a week.  Troubleshooting didn’t work.  Sending them for repair.  Bummer.
"It’s a good device with nice games. The battery is a huge drawback. At best, it lasts 4 hours of use or about a week off without charging. This limits its use outside the home more than I had hoped."
"Don’t get me wrong, I love Nintendo and this console but after some troubleshooting I was able to get it up and running after some frustration. First, it shipped (brand new) with a faulty HDMI cable. Which took some swapping out of other HDMI cables to finally figure it out. Second, after being stuck in 480dpi mode for a while I finally figured out how to get 1080 dpi set properly. Once everything was setup I was able to enjoy it. All that aside, this is a fun and versatile console with a great library of games."
"Nintendo has fallen. I got this switch oled and as a new user I'm greatly disappointed. Regular corrupted data issues even with physical game cartridges, overpriced games, laughable storage capacity/performance for the cost of the device, and slow app performance. There is potential here, but considering the age and experience of the company,  I expect far more as a customer. The continuous re-downloads due to corrupted data are very time consuming with some taking over 30 minutes only to have to delete and start over in some cases. This should be resolved. Also, the console should offer far more to customers at this price. There is no justification for charging this much for a console that offers so little. I was originally excited to see how far Nintendo gaming had progressed over the years,  but sadly, I feel they've gone backwards. The saddest part is they have some decent games. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone I know at this price neither would I repurchase. There is no reason in my mind this console should cost over $200 all things considered."
I love this Switch but Joycon drift has just started and have tried multiple fixes without success.
"I clearly received the Japanese model, and one of the joy-cons is obviously a cheap fake (no motion sensor.) Upon opening the box, it was clear that someone had gone through the box before it was sent to me. I was told I would have to wait up to 30 days for a refund (and I also purchased device protection with the Switch) so I opted to exchange it. Let'see if I have better luck with the next one.**I decided on a refund, instead of an exchange.*"""
"I am very angry because I was scammed😡😡😡😡.In the publication they do not specify that this product is an used Nintendo. They say it’s new but it is not! When I received it, it didn't even come in its original box, it came in a simple cardboard box. When I turned it on, it worked until its battery ran out. I put it on charge and it never turned on again.So, I asked for a refund and they didn't even give me back the full money I paid.Amazon definitely sucks, not reliable at all and they steal your money with damaged stuff."
"improvement:larger OLED screenwired dockbetter kickstandstagnation:included Joy-Con Grip still doesn't chargewhich means if you use it you're constantly removing joycons to charge.this leads to additional avoidable wear and tear to the point that you just buy a dedicated pro controllerthis in turn means that the included Joy-Con Grip is not really used and is basically landfill trash.detriment:the game cart slot cover has been unnecessarily changed making it harder for older people or for gamers with some wrist dexterity difficulties to open it to replace cartridges.this is possibly intentional to steer people to ""lease"" digital games instead of buying to own physical copies.i bought this for a grandmother that already had a collection of carts from the original Switch that she would no longer be able to swap out. so i returned this and got her another present instead.looks like on its own Nintendo just doesn't learn about user experience and building/maintaining customer love.as long as it feels it that satisfies the critical mass it will gladly throw others under the bus.hopefully other products like Steam Deck will help it wake up and reevaluate its actions"
"Upon receiving the nintendo, I was alarmed when I seen an error code when setting it up. And to my surprise when I called Nintendo themselves, they informed me that the device was banned from any online services and was advised to return it!!!"
"I have had no end of issues with joycons with this model. I’ve gone through two pair and a pro controller. Yes, it took a tumble but the regular Switch I had was bumped about more regularly and I didn’t have the issues I’ve had with this one. At this point I think the hardware must have been damaged by the bump. I can’t honestly recommend this Oled model."
"So first issue when I got this, it was a Japanese model not American it come with a adapter soo not meant for American docs second of all it come with a small Crack I did not see till the display broke on me. Short story would not buy off Amazon but from store instead could been shipping could been the fact it was a Japanese model and not American no idea."
"To keep it short and sweet:A) Bigger and brighter is always better (even if it's only a couple cm).B) Joycon started drifting after 1 week.C) If you transfer your games from previous Switch, all saved files will be automatically deleted.D) More storage is always nice, but you can get a 512 GB SD for 10 bucks on Wish like I did 2 years ago.E) If this is your first time getting a switch, by all means, shell out the extra 50 bucks because only in that way is it worth it. If your old switch is fine, you're not missing out.Cheers!"
"I got my items on time and I'm everything seems to work fine which I'm happy with, however... you didn't get 4 or 5 stars because you didn't include the most important piece. The AC ADAPTER which allows me to play from my home TV screen. When I tried contacting help, they immediately told me they COULD NOT help me get my missing part. I spent all this money just to get screwed out of having the entire package???This is how you guys treat Amazon prime members?"
"I have a serious question on the pictures. It says Nintendo switch OLED on the box.But when I received the box, it didn’t say OLED it said Nintendo switch, and some Chinese riding all over the"
"As with a previous version of this console, if the Nintendo supplied and manufactured HDMI cable is used, the issues range from strange red lines on the screen to flickering, considering the fact that this console costs more than three hundred dollars, Nintendo should have supplied a better HDMI cable.  Also, although the reason isn't clear, on very rare occasions, the video signal flickers, even when a different HDMI cable is used. Considering the fact that this is also one of the latest versions of this console, this one in particular was first available in October of 2023 in fact, it should be free of all defects, and it certainly is not.  This would be a great console if it weren't for the mentioned issues."
"Received this piece of garbage for my wife as a present. Shows up with crap all over the box. Either way, she was so excited she cried. Turn it on… Works for a day. We play for 8 hours straight having fun on Animal Crossing, she’s obsessed. Suddenly, it slows down. Next thing you know, it shuts down. Won’t even turn back on. Been trying to figure out why for a day. Nothing. We got a dud. Whoever the supplier is is sending busted Switches, in boxes with unknown substances on them, that may or may not work. My wife cried, again. This time it wasn’t happy tears. I am so frustrated with whoever the supplier is. Shouldn’t have trusted Amazon on this one. So lame."
"The switch will not charge or connect to the dock after just 5 months of owning. Even better yet, since it was bought from Amazon the warranty is invalid and they want $140 to repair it. If you’re looking at buying a switch I recommend buying directly from Nintendo so you don’t have the same issues we are having."
"Disappointed with missing joy-con holder and the manual having no English. Also received a universal charger, which was different from what I expected.However, I do really like the white switch and the super clear graphics."
"The shipping time was pushed back multiple times, but that’s on usps. The back panel on the doc was missing but still functional. Mild connective issues with detached joy cons but still works after a few minutes"
"It would have been a better ask from Nintendo to release a more updated hardware at this point. Not only for the demands of todays games but also for better framerates and overall performance. The lags and stutters are still annoying both in games and on eshop, AAA games still either skip the Switch or it gets inferior cloud ports(as the hardware isnt strong enough to play most AAA 3rd party titles) which you cannot play portably which kills the purpose of a portable game console. All the Oled model is is a better screen, kickstand and dock."
I noticed almost three out of 10 times when I go to put my joy-cons onto the switch rails what happens is sometimes the controller instead of charging will just turn on and deplete battery life when the switch is plugged into the dock. That's a major 2 star reduction from this coming from a top gaming company.. unacceptable
"I waited for months to get this and had alerts set up on Honey when it was back in stock. We were waiting out for the 4K system but decided to cave on the OLED to play Bayonetta 3 and Pokemon games. Finally was able to order one at the retail price in early December as a late Christmas gift to the family. It was a massive mistake. Once the item arrived, it was in a damaged box (not Amazon but Switch itself). No big deal, it seemed fine. At first, I was having a hard time getting on our network. Then it started having issues playing Let's Go Eevee. I was ready to give up on it and said to start a return in mid-January.Feeling guilty and not wanting to get out during bad weather, I thought I would give it another try. About halfway through playing Lets Go Eevee, the joycons started to stop working randomly. It would do basic up and down, but not right and left, and some of the other buttons were randomly not working.I was about to start a warranty claim until I noticed on the website that part of its 'subscriber' features also takes your saves hostage. You have to pay to send your saves to a new system through their 'cloud' feature. Never had we had a game system do this. We decided to give up and start the return process again between the hardware issues and this. After this, I don't think I will ever buy a Nintendo system again."
Delivered and left in the open where it was stolen ended up getting back after 2 weeks. Product itself is good and fun
"The switch is fine, but having to pay $25 at a Gamestop to buy an American ac charger is unforgivable. One of the other reviews has a picture of the same issue I had, which is that they sent me a UAE / Saudi Arabia AC charger and an adaptor for American sockets that A. sparks BRIGHTLY when you plug it in and B. falls right out of the socket like its the wrong size."
"Was excited to have this and started playing games and it was cool at first but at least 2 different times the whole screen went orange and I had to power off the switch completely for a while so that it could work again. Did some googling and it said this could happen after some time so I can understand that, but this was brand new so there is something clearly faulty with this switch and had to return it. Since it happened on at least 2 separate occasions I have to return it, very disappointed."
I selected new system but when it arrived everything looked good on the outside. When the console was started up it had an account already on it. I’ve never known a switch to come with a pre loaded account. Also the unit came with an overseas wall unit and adapter.
"power cord does not work at all. Visually it looks fine, no obvious damage, but no power going through. Even tried using the cord with my switch Lite, nothing. no power, no charge.Luckily, the AC Adaptor (power cord) for my switch Lite worked just fine so I’m using that with the OLED console. Works perfectly fine.Still, shameful to spend $400 and have one of the major components as a bin-filler.Get it together, Nintendo/Amazon!"
"Came with a broken battery port, had to spend another $150 to get it fixed, but lesson learned buying used, I guess."
We were so excited to receive the switch. But they never indicated anywhere in the description that it was European not very happy. So we had to find an adapter. Nothing in English on the inside of box.
The issue is it does not allow you to transfer all games from the original switch to the new one. So far it's been 6 months and it is still working which is great because I was replacing joycons every 3 months with the old system.I would rate the review higher but the fact that I couldn't transfer all of my son's games was very frustrating to both of us.
"Everyone knows why the switch oled is great. I have two problems that shouldn't be a problem for a new $350 device.1. The gap between the switch and the right joy con. It wobbles.2. My left analog button has this spring noise.Both of these things really deplete the enjoyment of gameplay, especially after paying so much for it. Nintendo, this is unacceptable."
"I purchased the white color, for which I waited many days. White is what I like, but I was sent a red and blue color scheme. Very disappointing."
"everything was thrown into a box with bubble wrap, missing items that would come with a switch, like controllers!! battery wont charge, wrong colours, ....its filthy..shady bait and switch. just go to target."
"I ordered this for my daughter as a birthday gift. She is away at college across the country so I had it delivered to her there. The item was “Amazon’s Choice” and supposedly sold and shipped by Amazon, but was fulfilled by a company called PandaVida.  It arrived today and the box had clearly been opened. Upon inspection, the print on the package was in English, but the box said “Middle East/Southeast Asia.”  The owner’s manual was missing and the power cord was for a foreign country. In the box was an aftermarket adapter, but it was not for US outlets.  This was discovered when my daughter attempted to plug the device in and sparks came from the outlet. I attempted to initiate the return through the app and was forced into a chat box. I spoke to six different customer service representatives over the course of an hour in order to obtain a return shipping label. Paid full retail for a useless console, lost an hour of my life dealing with the return, and will undoubtedly wait weeks for my refund. Will NOT buy again. If you live in the USA stay away from this one."
"No issues with the console itself. However, the box I received says it was made to be sold in Singapore. I live in the US. The charger won’t work because it’s the wrong style plug. Will need to buy a charger that will work on the plugs in the US.."
It does not come with a standard US plug in. It didn't state in the description that it is meant for sale in Singapore. So it's fine if you live in Japan. I had to buy a separate charger because the adapter is not stable.
"Product arrived promptly, was well-packaged, and works well right out of the box. Unfortunately, it came with a previous owner's games and parental controls, which were registered through the smartphone app. Currently discussing with Nintendo how to fix it. Can't recommend unless this isn't a problem."
It was great other than it had one major issue where it wouldn't connect to wifi
"The Switch worked perfectly, but I had to go onto YouTube to figure out how to set it up, since it came with no English instructions.  (The Switch did start up with English language, however.)  Also, the power adapter is clearly not made for American outlets.  (See picture.)  This should have been made clear in the ad, but it wasn't.  It did include a bulky adapter for the adapter for American outlets, but it wouldn't fit onto my power strip.  Fortunately, I have plenty of other adapters to use.  Gotta knock it down to 2 stars since it came very close to being unusable without a separate purchase of an adapter."
"They really should disclose that these are used devices in the description. I received mine and there was an account already linked to it and storage used from their games…It even still had their credit card info still stored in the device. (Everything was deleted immediately, of course). I feel this is false advertising by omission. Gets 3 stars because it’s a functional device, but there’s been hundreds of hours clocked on this thing already. I’d recommend spending the extra 50-100 bucks for brand new."
"Giving three stars because the seller “Amazon” is awesome. However, the console wouldn’t recognize my games. I tried three different games, updated the system and followed the other troubleshooting advice from Nintendo but nothing worked. Inserted the games in my original Switch and they worked flawlessly.Probably just bad luck and got a defective console. The bummer is now I have to wait until I can find one in stock. Oh and I sold my original Switch to my older daughter lol"
"Its a nice product when it works. But inevitably some part will break. In my case the dock, and being 6 months after purchase is outside the 3 month ""accessory"" warranty. Even if considered in the 1 year warranty of the switch they can simply decide it is not manufacturers fault. Buyer beware."
"The controller that came with mine works poorly, the x button has to be pressed much harder than the other buttons to register and the right trigger will stop registering even when I'm still pressing it. Just be aware you may need to spend extra to get a different controller. I bought a highly rated 3rd party controller and it's far better than the joy cons. All things considered $350 is a steep price for a console that comes with a low quality controller that may or may not work properly."
"My package arrived with a Nintendo Switch Oled box with just the sleeves and manual inside. Underneath the sleeves were the shipping air bags that I am assuming were used to make it look like there was something inside the box itself. The shipping box was not damaged and completely sealed.I am ONLY giving two stars only because the lovely customer service associate I spoke with after my package arrived was able to send a replacement that actually included the switch console, dock, joycons, adapter, etc.Product review:The console itself has an amazing image, high speeds and has all the amazing bells and ringers a switch tends to have. It’s a lot bigger than the original and the colors are incredibly vibrant. If you are thinking about an upgrade definitely go for it!"
"The box containing the consolecame unsealed, the box also came a little bit teared. I am wondering if this is how this console is usually sold or I am getting s previous opened console."
"I love that this device allows me to play some retro games, but it keeps blacking out on me, causing me to die in the games."
"Caveat emptor! Let the buyer beware! This is cheap crap. The four small screws that would hold this are positioned 8” x apart, and roughly square. So, four screws as far apart as your hand are supposed to hold up a 50lbs tv?? I bought an expensive full motion mount, which would not adapt to this TV. You need a table 5’ long just to hold it, since the “legs” supplied are mounted more than 4’ apart, even though the weight is centered in the middle. The screen flexes a few mm just moving it around. Furthermore!! The screws weren’t even all there!!!! Two were missing! The mounting system suggests that there should be other bolt holes diagonal to the ones in the TV, much further up on the tv and to the sides from which the weight would be distributed, but this tv has NONE.The expensive “dream mount” full motion wall mount couldn’t adapt to this TV; there aren’t enough screws in the TV to position the “arms” to stabilize the TCL tv, despite the reviews saying it works well. Additionally, the TCL mounting bolt holes are positioned so low on the TV that the entire weight of the TV would be supported by only the bottom 1/3 of the plastic case.I was so upset I boxed back up before taking a picture, but the screen had a giant bulge in the middle which could move around a few mm back and forth, causing visible distortion.And…..the very first thing that pops up on the screen is a licensing agreement that doesn’t let you read the full agreement on the screen, but rather gives a link to it. Sorry, call me crazy, but after seeing what poor quality the mounting system is, and the idea of 50lbs hanging from the poor quality support, I will -never- purchase another TCL product, let alone a TV from Amazon. This isn’t a product support issue or user error. This is a cheaply made crummy TV that flexes enough to be scary.Furthermore, Amazon holds up your return for 30 full days. I will never buy a piece of electronics equipment again without doing a lot more homework. I’m especially disappointed in Amazon. They offered me a partial refund, to keep the item. If they give me a partial refund, I’ll never buy anything from Amazon again, there are plenty of online outlets besides Amazon. This is ridiculous.TCL stands for “ the crummiest largescreen “.I now own a Samsung CU7000 series, with a lot sturdier feel, better tech support, and tried and true performance. Yes it was a little bit more expensive but the other Samsung TV I have is 12 years old and still going strong."
"Mostly a very nice tv, good quality, decent sound, and seems pretty well built. However constantly I have HDMI issues where it won’t work to unplug and tell if in the HDMI cords, I’ll have to completely unplug the tv, plug it back in and then usually that does it. There is a very small amount of settings you can mess with on this tv. I keep looking for ways to set an input as like primary because I’m tired of it starting up and playing random loud ads all the time, like I spent how much money and I’m still seeing ads? Really? Also tv can be slow from time to time, and occasionally my inputs won’t even load at all unless I restart it 2-3 times. But overall it’s a good budget tv and with not being able to afford much more than this, I can recommend it."
"I have 3 other TCL tvs and love them! The other TVs I have are Roku and this is the first FireTV I have purchased. I figured it wouldn’t make much difference even though I love the Roku functionality. I was very wrong.I don’t like the remote and much prefer the Roku remote which has the volume co trolls and mute on the side of the remote. However, my biggest beef is not being able to switch the audio to my AirPods so I can watch tV and not bother my wife. Tried to do something similar with the ForeTV to no avail. Researched on the internet and looks like this is a weakness compared to Roku. Some reported being able to pair their AirPods directly but I haven’t been successful. Had I known that I wouldn’t have bought this TV. Picture is good and price is right like all TCL  TVs"
"I like the tv a lot, great product for the price, not extremely heavy got great color and clarity screen is bright all the quality’s you look for in a tv. My problem is the wall Mount, there is only one brand wall Mount that will work for this tv and had to hunt and hunt to find it , I have had LG and Samsung tvs that will work with about any wall Mount no problem, just make this tv work with universal wall mounts and you would have the perfect tv."
"The tv is getting three star because it has clear picture, lots of functionality and was very light and easy to install on my mount. If it wasn’t for that I’d give it a one star. However, it needs to be reset at least once daily (usually more) because it is very laggy, sometimes it gets so bad that you can’t watch a show without it buffering literally ever 3 seconds. It has a hardwired internet connection and it’s not my internet connection because when I switch to my ps5 to watch the same streaming service and show it works just fine. Often in the middle of the show the streaming service will just shut down. Then when you go back to the show you were watching, it won’t load just keeps going back to the Home Screen. The picture gets pixelated often when streaming. Again when my ps5 does not. The sound quality on the tv is meh could be better. I did not return because I do not want to deal with the return process as restarting it only takes about 30 seconds. I’ll deal with it until I have to buy a new tv as I game on it more than stream shows. I would recommend a different brand television. Spend the extra $60 to get something a little higher quality. Good picture quality for gaming and the gaming mode is pretty awesome."
"TV looks and works great out of the box. I have a number of TCLs and they're all fine. In setting this one up, I noticed two things that I can't stand:- In using Amazon's FireTV app, they force you to allow notifications from the app. That's a no from me, dog. The point of Apple forcing apps to request that rather than force it is to allow me to have control over my notifications. It's predatory design to not allow me to use the app without first turning notifications on for promotions, etc.- I have ethernet plugged into my TV, and unlike literally everything else I plug ethernet into, this doesn't automatically configure. It asks for a lot of information that isn't available on my router config screen. After 20 mins of Google searching I set it all up only to have the TV reset to the Wifi connect screen, losing all the info I just put in.I have two Fire TVs in my house but didn't have the Fire TV app installed on my phone. Now I know why."
I just installed it and found that the side is broken. It must have been damaged during transportation. What should I do? The object is too big and I don't want to move it. I'm going to return it.
"You can 3/4 of the way sync the TV and remote to the TV/Satellite.Everything works except the volume.I have to use the TCL remote to use the volume.This is after calling Direct TV support, and TCL support, and spending half a day looking for a solution on the internet reading articles and watching videos.Support said maybe it was too new thinking it was a 2024 and the right sync codes weren't available yet.It's a 2023!!!The TV picture quality is good but not excellent.The price was too good for a 55-inch TV.That should have been a red flag.There are 13 codes available to sync the remotes and none work for the volume to work on Direct TV remote.I learned my lesson. I have a Sony, LG, and Vizio that synced immediately.Perhaps Dish or Cox Cable would have worked fine.But I'm not switching providers for one TV."
"You get what you pay for! Picture seems good. TV is lightweight and thin. But, and this is a very big but… the OS is slow. This TV takes forever to load on fast internet, can’t imagine it in slow WiFi. Be prepared to sit there for a couple minutes every you turn it on. I have a Westinghouse and a Vizio in separate rooms further away from the WiFi that turn on and load up instantly. This FireTV has been a headache because of this. It also powers off all of the time, even though I turned off the sleep timer. The sleep timer resets and the tv turns off by itself. Super annoying. I would not recommend this tv."
"The connectivity is terrible and the picture often freezes and then plays super fast- it’s not my internet speed or anything like that.  I read the reviews and thought it didn’t sound terrible but now that we have it- I reeeeeeally wish I had spent the extra money to get something nicer =(  I have a feeling this isn’t going to last long.  Also, there isn’t much for settings (ie. picture and audio settings etc) they are very basic and limited.  The actual apps frequently close 2 or 3 times before they will open up and stay open so you can watch something- it’s very frustrating.  They are very slow to load as well.  Overall, if you can’t afford to spend more then I guess you’ll get by with loads of frustration, but if you can spend the extra $100 or so to upgrade- I would highly recommend doing that instead of wasting your money on this one!"
"We love our Sony Bravia with built in Google/Android TV, but that TV cost us 4x as much as this one. So with that in mind:+Picture is pretty good, just lacks the HDR of the other one+Sound is pretty good+Was still able to install Jellyfin and Plex to watch our own content locally, does a decent job of streaming+Great price, ~$400 for a 65"" good looking TV-By default, the TV auto-plays video ads with sound at the home screen every time you turn the TV on-By default, the TV collects your usage data and targets personalized ads at you+Currently you can turn these off in the settings, but it's quite a trip to find them---There is no way to fully turn off ads on the TV. You can make it stop screaming at you when you turn it on, but you can't stop it showing you pictures of ads when you turn it on."
"The picture is definitely not what I was expecting. It replaced a 7 year old 65"" Vizio TV. The Vizio still had better picture quality, even with a LED going out and a small cloud on the screen. I researched quite a bit before buying and with all of that said I was very disappointed. On some shows and movies it looks like it is overcast, greyish and on some it's very bright, no consistency. I have tried adjusting the settings and the settings for picture, Natural, Movie, Custom, etc . With football season coming up I guess it will be a little less anticipated. I suggest spending a little more and getting a major brand, although this wasn't a option for me being on a fixed income."
"All the HDMI ports stopped working 1 month and 2 weeks after purchase.  I do NOT recommend this television.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I got this for my elderly father when his TV stopped working.  I picked this TV because it has Alexa built in.  My father uses a bunch of Alexa devices so this TV felt familiar to him from the start.  He can hold the Alexa button on the remote and say ""HDMI 1"" or ""Go to antenna"" and completely bypass the menus.  He can even say ""show me the front door"" and it will pull up a live feed from the Ring doorbell camera.  Pretty sweet!Now for my normal review:4K SDR and HDR content look pretty good.  I expected worse from a TV at this price point.  I am pleased with how it performs.Reflections from the screen's coating aren't too bad during the day time.The speakers aren't great, but that's normal with all TV's these days.  They're too thin to be able to put good sounding speakers in.  If you're on a budget, just get a cheap sound bar as that will be a huge upgrade to the sound.Has VESA 200x200 wall mount holes on the back. Works great with the generic TV stand I got off Amazon.  Speaking of TV stand, make sure you have space on your entertainment center or where ever you're putting it.  Our entertainment center is only 50 inches wide and this TV's feet are wider than 50 inches.The TV without the feet is pretty light.  It looks like it should heavier than it really is.For those that still watch over the air TV, the built in channel guide is awesome.  All of our local channels were found and the guide had information for every channel and show."
The TV arrived damaged with no visible damage to the packaging so I assume it was damaged prior to being put in the box.
"This is my second tlc,and I must say I am very  disappointed. My first had a tuner that didn't work. This one has a channel that doesn't work."
"I liked the price. But operation is more confusing then my older Samsung and the picture is not as crisp as the Samsung, but I also payed more then double the cost for the Samsung.So this TV is a good buy."
"Update. It is getting sluggish, images not as clear. Other tvs in home work good, but this one seems to be always unloading or uploading something in the background.The TV is not friendly to seamless interaction with ROKU or Spectrum. I bought a ROKU stick so I can bypass the contact sales push from Prime and Amazon. From the moment you turn TV it is a constan advertisement machine. Pushing sales of video, stream, programming, channels, prime stuff ..The ROKU stick is a way around that.You know how ROKU lets you leave it untouched and you choose when to interact or not. This is NOT the case with the FIRE TV. If you don't even touch the remote, it's default is to start advertising, laud video clips,I tried to set preferences and there is no way around it.I regret having bought this TV. I should have stuck with ROKU.Also, it lags with YouTube. It keeps returning to previous videos and interrupts playback. It's like the App is competing with the mobile device. Again, I am bypassing that with the ROKU stick. So I use YouTube on the Roku."
"The picture is lovely but for some reason, it keeps booting me out of HULU"
"I have the 50 inch Roku version of this TV in my office and love it, so I bought this one for my bedroom. The picture is bright and beautiful. The sound is loud and clear.The new TV has fireTV installed and that part is utter trash. Don't waste your money, spend a bit extra and get the Roku model.I can't rate this TV above 2 stars due to how bad the fireTV is.  The smart Homekit integration doesn't work at all. It connects but provides zero functionality. You can't ever turn the TV off and on remotely, let alone something useful like changing the video source/app or pausing playback.Turning the TV on with the power button on the remote automatically resumes whatever way playing when the power was turned off. It doesn't take you to the home screen unless you power it on and then hit the home button twice.  The home screen is 90% ads.It refuses to use the DNS address provided by my DHCP server, so it can't connect to anything on the local network.The buttons on the remote aren't where I expect them to be from my other remotes, so I find myself constantly turning it off when I mean to hit the back buttonThe listing doesn't mention the microphone in the remote. It has one and I hate it. There is no way to disable it, and the TV is unusable with out it.  Of course the TV is going to remind you every 10 seconds to use voice for searching and you can't turn that off either.Unless you intend to run this as a dumb screen and connect a media device, I would pass on this. The fireTV ruins an otherwise pleasant experience."
"At first, I was happy to have this TV but now for some reason every time I leave my house and come home somebody is trying to control my Amazon TV by trying to log into my Amazon account and I keep calling them to let them know that someone is remotely using my TV and they trying to make it seem like I’m crazy when now every day so far I come home and my Amazon account is up and I don’t use my Amazon account on my TV"
"Let me start out by saying, there's nothing inherently wrong with this TV, it functions as intended. But if you value your privacy, ease of use, and not having ads shoved in your face every time you turn your TV on, skip this one.At every moment of time since I got this TV it has asked me to setup Alexa voice which I have no intention of doing. Apps that you download that are not Amazon properties are intentionally buried in menus to make it a pain to find. But don't worry, the TV knows this and bugs you every time you are digging through the menu to find the app you want that it is easier with Alexa. Personally I do not like a passive listening system built into my remote to a device that is always online, but maybe this does not bother you. There is also no way to turn these prompts or Alexa off as expected.My BIGGEST complaint with this TV by far, is EVERY TIME you turn it on, it will autoscroll to an ad. If you do not change your settings, it will automatically play video ads with sound on startup. Even if you change these settings it will still show you static ads. For something I paid $400 for I do not want irrelevant cr*p ads I have absolutely no interest in shown to me at every moment that I do not instantly scroll with my remote.Amazon has made it very clear with their products they do not care about the consumer experience, only extracting as much profit as they possibly can from you in the most annoying ways possible. If you are similar to me in that you value your privacy, ease of use, functional UI/UX, and not being shown ads every time you turn your TV on, I would definitely shop a different brand."
"Bought this for my dad who is 90 years old. His tv seemed to be going out and I’ve heard good things about TCL tvs. Out of the box the picture was not clear, cloudy even when I selected dynamic. Could not get Spectrum remote to program even with 10+ codes provided from Spectrum. Now he has to use 2 remotes, TCL for power and volume and his Spectrum remote to change channels. Very frustrated!"
I thought it would break just looking at it
I have noticed if I pause a program and come back to the TV it has powered by itself if I am pause a program and leave it paused for more than about 15 minutes.  I cannot find anything in the documentation about this and have spoken to TCL and they did not have any idea other that suggesting I delete and re-install all of the aps and logins.  It seems like it is a software problem because it only happens when it is paused and not while actively watching a program.
"I have to use a fire stick in my fire tv, because the tv won't stay connected to wifi. Luckily I mainly use a Roku, so not a big problem. And it only cost 350.00"
"My 4 year old tapped the screen like it was a tablet, and it broke.  Never thought a screen tap would make it break.  It happened 10 feet from me before I had a chance to grab him.  I’ve had kids tap the screen on a tv before and never had this cheap of a screen.  Will add pic when I get home.  Come on though, I just bought it for Christmas, super disappointed in the quality.  Picture quality was good though, sound was better than previous tv (phillips)"
"I am not sure where to start. I seen the thousands of reviews. I thought it’s a decent price for at $300 to arrive in a few days with an easy Amazon sign in set up. I liked the idea of using Amazon Alexa to assist with the tv. The biggest issue was my remote did not work. The app remote with my iphone also did not work. Not sure if there was a Bluetooth issue but I could not access any functions for the TV because it did not get past the set up stage without the remote working. The TV did cut on. It just did not get past the pair the remote setting. Which was worse. I would have preferred an obviously broken tv because I spent hours trying to resolve the problem.I contacted Amazon. I went through the step by step process to reset tv, remote. Change batteries brought new batteries. I was then referred to TCL.I repeated process.I did not work. They offered to send me a new remote. Without the Bluetooth remote I guess the tv is just a paperweight? I was then told to just return the tv through Amazon.I then returned the tv and bought a tried and true Roku tv the same day at Best Buy.So it is nearly 30 DAYS later on July 31 when they said my refund will be issued. They updated the refund today for 8/2.It has been a very frustrating experience. I’m happy for everyone that received a good tv with a functioning remote. I would warn anyone that has never used TCL the deal was not worth the trouble at all. Also still have not been refunded."
"Hoping someone has a solution.  The power on/off button does not work.  I can turn on TV with Alex, but can’t turn it off.  I have to unplug the tv to get it off.  The remote works fine for everything else.  I have contacted the company. They sent me a new remote, nothing works on it.  I am currently waiting to hear from them again."
"I truly like the look of the tv and was very excited to use it in our main living space. That said, the operating system is very temperamental. Often fails to load selected applications, sound does not work frequently, slow frame rate, requires a hard restart approximately every week. I would recommend looking elsewhere for a tv if you are in the market."
Can’t say much as it didn’t come with a remote.  It’s like getting a bike for Christmas in the middle of winter…you can’t use it.
"The picture quality and sound are passable.  The user interface sucks.  It's a challenge to navigate the menus,  several setup options like app selection did not allow me to save my choices.  It is very difficult to find and navigate menu options.  I prefer the Roku interface much better... the Amazon Fire interface needs to go back to development school."
"It’s a great tv for the price. It’s pretty thin, and almost bezel less. The picture isn’t bad out of the box but you cannot open the display settings. You should be able to hit the gear logo on the remote to open the sidebar options list, but it doesn’t work. The settings button on remote does nothing. Also if you go into the display settings on the fire tv and click display and sound, it goes into an empty menu screen and freezes the tv. You have to hit home button on remote to get it out of that setting. Amazon or TCL needs to fix this issue before selling anymore of these with this issue. I gave it 3 stars because it is a good tv for the price. The picture isn’t too bad out of box. Knocked down a couple stars because you can’t adjust any picture settings."
TV stopped working after 3 months. Tv was stuck in a power cycle. Had the fire tv logo displayed with three dots under it for 20 hours until I called support.
"Although this TCL advertises “Fire TV” and “Alexa Built-in”, it is NOT compatible with the Echo Studio home theater.  After speaking with Amazon tech support, he confirmed that most Fire TVs from 3rd party manufacturers will not work with the Echo Studio group. He recommended using a newer Fire Stick and pairing it to the speaker set. My audio setup includes (2) Echo Studios and the Echo sub. The system sounds amazing, but this “Fire” TV will not pair without an inconvenient workaround. If TCL updates the firmware or software, I will update the review and rating. To pair the Echo Studio home theater, I bought an Amazon Firestick 4k Max. It works, but talk about redundancy. I have to use a Fire Stick in HDMI 1 on a Fire TV. Face palm.The picture quality is nice. One thing to note if you mount this TV… the mounting points are near the bottom of the TV, not the top. I bought a new TV mount, removed the old one, and did some drywall repair and painting yesterday. Happy with how it looks in our parlor room. Because of the large size of the TV, the bottom mounting points work well by allowing more tilt than other TVs with mounting points in the center of the TV."
"For $265 I am pleased with this 55” tv.  The picture is surprisingly decent for the price, but only if viewed from directly in front.  The picture drastically deteriorates when viewed from an angle.  That’s what you really need to know.  It also only has 2.4 ghz WiFi connectivity and does not recognize 5.0 ghz WiFi.  3 stars because of the value, but it is a 2 star TV in quality.  It satisfies my needs at the price."
"I got a very good price on this tv but I am so disappointed. I like  the tlc brand and have more than one in my home. My other ones are the tcl Roku. This recent purchase is Amazon fire  by  tcl. What a difference. It is so tedious just to get your needed apps for like Max, Fox Nation , ESPN+and others. In addition I expected a really nice clear and colorful picture. No luck on that either. If I didn’t have house guests coming this week I would send it back. My recommendation is not to buy this - it’s a real pain compared to my other sets. The Roku model has the apps ready for you to sign into."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I’m not happy. As soon as I put a movie on. It’s dark and kind of hazy. This is not what I was looking for in 55” in entertainment. I would rather pay a little more with better movie experience. Regular shows are fine with color.
"Bought this due to friend of a friend positive referral. Watching football- the field looks more grey than my other tvs (yes I played around with picture modes (vivid, etc).  The main reason I wrote this review is tvs communication with HULU. Every single time I turn Hulu on, I have to go to app, force quit, relaunch and basically rest Hulu. I don’t have to do that with any other tv I ever bought.  So all in all, price is great but quality seems to go down. (You get what you pay for)?"
"I recently bought this TV at Costco because it was a good deal for the price. My main complaint is that there are ads everywhere on the TV. I paid for this TV with cash and it is not a subscription, so why am I getting Ads ON MY TV. I'd understand if the circumstances were different, but I did not borrow this from Amazon and I am not leasing it. There should not be any ads on my screen if I don't want them to be there. All things considered the TV performs well and looks good so two stars."
"If you want to combine a nice TV with the features of a firestick, then you landed in the WRONG place. The TV itself is fine. The features of the internal Fire TV and Alexa are lacking versus the Firestick alone. I cannot use the Home theater setting via Alexa and Amazon support would give me a 15% discount on a new stick only after I bought it and showed the chat I had as proof of the discount. Oh, and the discount would be given to me as an Amazon credit. GTFOH..."
"I've been on with amazon support through 12 support representatives now. The ""factory reset"" that leads to infinite ""cannot update your fireTV"" screen, then when you soft power off it goes to an infinite can't login loop. The experience here has been so bad. It was an awesome price for this unit, and they delivered fast. However when I spent over half of my Sunday trying to setup, troubleshoot, and ultimately have to explain the situation 12 times I've gotten so far beyond frustrated. I'm not sure if it’s TCL, or fireTV software, or what. This has been by far, the worst experience I've ever had with any amazon order.Update: Amazon picked up the tv (too big for walk in to Amazon returns). They picked this up 2 weeks ago, and trucked it to phoenix, will be another 2 weeks before they issue the refund and then another 2 weeks before it gets credited according to Amazon. Buyer beware that even though this is prime eligible if something goes wrong they’ll keep your money for a month or more."
Set up not a good experience!Kept Bringing me to an Account or Service other than my Home Network...In Another words trying to sell me something I don't need right now 🤔What a Surprise 😁
"Too soon to review. Spectrum, they said it was in there somewhere. Great new deal, tho. Good service. Saved $$$ at Spectrum? Hard to believe"
"CANT OPERATE WITHOUT REMOTE, which is frustrating because I lost mine, so ill have to go to Walmart and buy a universal remote that will probably work with every TV model, but this one...Picture is decent, but I wish I would've paid up and bought a nicer one"
"I got it and it was damaged, called customer service and immediately replace it with a new one. Very happy with my purchase good quality, nice resolution and audio. My only issue was that is not properly packaged and that might be the cause the damage ."
TV processor is not fast enough to handel programing on Internet. It is more concerned about loading commercials and other programs. I have never been able to watch Youtube with out buffering or picture freezing while sound continues. I bought soundbar for this from Amazon as well. I was told buy a more exspensive TV by my friend. You get what you pay for . AT&T blamed TV. I upgraded speed on internet. It did not help.
"like a glitch in the video of my unit, back and fore... with all the software updates? went happens? watching movies in amazon prime, any and is constant. Consider this part of a formal complaint for guarantee! I will add videos ""IF"" necessary. Thank You!"
I love this tv but it does not get very good receeption on local stations from my antenna.
"The TV works, but the audio has a delay that you can't get rid of even by turning off all of the audio processing. Also the picture looks like hot garbage with backlight blead and either overly crushed blacks from image processing or a zero contrast hazy mess with the image processing disabled. TV prices have dropped so much that getting a slightly nicer TV is not too much money. I should have done that, and I regret purchasing this TV even if it is going to be used in a spare room."
The mounting pattern for this TV is at the very bottom of the TV. When you put this on a bracket it's almost impossible to not see the bottom of the bracket without cutting it off.
Pay 4 what you get. Nice price however poor quality of picture on shows.
"The fire TV software is buggy and extremely slow. Glitches, crashes and returns to the Home Screen in the middle of your show/movie. I’ll have to get a Roku stick to plug into this fire tv because it’s aknots unusable. The tv is great when a source is plugged in and you’re not using the built in streaming software. The ‘smart’ part of this tv is not so smart."
I have had the television for less than 5 months and it has already broken as of last Monday. I called the customer support team and they said they would schedule a tech to repair it. Here it is a week later and no tech has contacted me at all. Tech support is rude and unhelpful. They made me jump through all kinds of hurdles on a 1.5 hour phone call. Just don't do it. I miss the days of the 300 pound tv on the tv tray. It was sketchy and dangerous but the tv worked.  I have not found a good brand of television yet.
Color and sound are even worse than hisense.
"Really disappointed with this TV. We got a great price, but you get what you pay for on this one. There are clearly software issues, as simply streaming or accessing videos on apps like YouTube often prove very difficult. For example, we will often access YouTube, search a video, select a video, and then get kicked back to the Home Screen. That is just one example of several issues we’ve encountered. Additionally, there is a defect that developed quickly, but probably still outside the return window. There is a blue splotch on the upper portion of the screen that is noticeable and distracting at all times, but especially when the screen is dark. Not an enjoyable viewing experience. I could say more, but in the end, not pleased at all with this TV, and I will not purchase a TCL again."
When i bought it they left it outside in the snow in the box and didnt knock on the door so it got damaged and now i have a straight line on the bottom of the screen that looks like colorful rainbow static that comes and goes but it flickers a lot
"Do not hook up a soundbar to this and use the built in FireTv. Sound constantly cuts out when changing volume. Ended up biting the bullet and adding a FireTV cube to one of the soundbar HDMI ports and waaalaa problem solved.Other than that, good picture. Built in FireTV is trash. Buyer"
"I use  several TCL TV for the company I work for, they work great, but the TV I got for home is the FireTV and not ruko.  The screen display is slow when you turn on the TV."
"We bought this TCL 55-Inch Class S4 4K LED Smart TV with Fire TV model 55S450F from Amazon in Feb 2024, during setup, it sees only 2.4Ghz wifi and speed is just under 80 mbps barely ok for 4k video. Our iphone, ipad, windows PC, and Chromebook all see 5Ghz and speed test about 450 mbps. Called support and they tell me the spec is correct that this TV has dual bands, we tried trouble shooting yet the TV cannot even see the name of any 5Ghz band, TCL support suggest checking router setting, I did that and  still same. Now I use long ethernet cable to get just < 100 mbps, (that port is slow, too) works ok but disappointed!"
"Big, shiny and not that great picture quality. I mean  it functions, but you get what you pay for. Ended u making this a guest room tv."
Picture too dark.Adjustments do not help much.
Not what I needed.
"I have purchased this television twice. The second one is doing exactly what the first did (returned). After about 2 months the fire tv starts being glitchy, It starts when you loose sound when switching apps. At first it is 3rd party apps (youtube). Soon it starts happening when changing from say silk to hulu. A restart makes it work until you change apps again - another reset. This is very common with firesticks. All 6 I have purchased over the years has done this same thing - usually at about a year - when they stop working. I can not help but think I have spent 10+ times the money for the same problem. The only difference is with the last firestick I bought the extended warrenty so I can replace them every year. I am not real impressed with replacing a tv every 3 months"
I would not recommend using the built in apps. If you are looking for a tv to just use the hdmi ports this will work. I have to sign in on my phone everytime the tv is turned off. And the amazon app does not see me as having prime membership even though I am signed in to the same account that purchased this tv with. The picture quality is good but i would recommend buying a roku and using that for streaming with it.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            After reading negative reviews about the tv stopped working after a few months I went ahead and ordered anyway. My Tv worked for three months and then did this. After calling Amazon they said I had to call TCL. I called them and after sending pictures of serial number and video of problem. Multiple emails, 2 weeks go by and I received an email stating that once they process the refund, it will be 25-30 business days to receive the check in the mail!! I went to my local BJs and bought a Philips! With a protection plan. I will never buy another TCL and I will never order something like this from Amazon again!"
"This is the worst TV that I’ve owned. Delayed reaction from the tv when remote buttons are pushed, poor picture quality and fps, bad home screen layout. This is my first Amazon TV and it will definitely be my last. I wish I could return it and get a different product."
Every is great about it except for the sound quality. At first I thought forgot to peel the plastic film that was on the tv. No matter how much I play with it the sound quality is horrible. Expect to buy a high quality sound bar
It could be the way I have to use it…but I have to turn off Closed caption every time I turn it on.  Annoying.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I like that TV no doubt it’s one of  best tv  you can see  frankly it has meet my expectations
"Carefully unpacked the TV and installed the legs on the bottom of the TV.  Ran through the set up and then removed the plastic film on the screen.  Then I noticed all the damaged areas at the top of the screen.  So, repacked the TV and started the return process.  Delivered the TV to a UPS Store which is a problem as it wouldn't fit in our car.  Had to use a utility trailer.  probably not ever going to order something during the ""Prime Days"" again.Update...8/20/2024. Still waiting for refund for the returned TV.  Status initially indicated refund would be issued on the 17th then changed to the 20th (today).  Now status indicates refund will be issued on the 25th. Don't understand why it's taking  almost a month to get processed."
"Pros: TV works as a TV should.Picture is fine.Cons: all of the Amazon bloatware crapAmazon ads built inThe TV itself is RIDICULOUSLY slow to navigate and it constantly hangs up in menus BECAUSE of all of the Amazon loaded bloat crap.I wish I would've gone the roku route, they're not as packed full of crap trying to get you to spend more money.It'd be great if there were an option to disable all of the ads and garbage and have it display ONLY my apps."
Absolutely terrible. Bought tv in July and by the beginning of October the screen stopped working. Still covered under manufacture warranty and they make you jump through hoops. Sent out one of their technicians a couple weeks ago and he even agreed that the screen isn't fixable to no fault of us. STILL NOTHING IS RESOLVED. Email after email afyer email of info they need that was sent to them and NOTHING!
The lag from the remote to the tv is very bad . Sometimes takes 5-6 seconds before it will react.Picture wise it’s gorgeous could have just got unlucky.
"TV box and packing was in perfect condition. When the TV was removed from the styrofoam packaging, we could see the back of the tv had a large dent in it. It had to have been dented prior to boxing or damaged and repackaged as my delivery was delayed."
"Soon after I got it, I stopped being able to mirror from my IPhone. The troubleshooting tips I’ve seen online haven’t helped."
"Was fine for 5 months, now zero picture.Will not restart.  Will not reset.  Will not do anything.  Remote or otherwise.Fine for a few months.DO NOT BUY"
"I bought this to replace my TCL Roku and this is much worse. It crashes regularly, requiring me to unplug the power cord to fix it. The Fire TV shows tons of ads ibstead of my streaming channels, and I am unable to screen share fro. my phone without first turning the tv on and entrring a special mode - on the roku version i could just start sharing on my phone any time I wanted. I urge you to buy the roku version!"
Great tv easy set up. Quality good. Only note I have is that some of my apps have distorted sound and others just don’t work.
For starters it wasn't shown anywhere in the description of the tv that it was android based os and had thatbeen advertised up front i wouldn't have purchased this tv. Secondly it didn't even work properly the first timeI used it. It wouldn't connect to the remote. Afterwards I managed to get it to work. But now I find that I'm irritated by the fact thatI have to literally select screen mirroring every time that's retarded. Thirdly it for no reason at all will stop mirroring. Then I have to still disconnect it from the phone because it still thinks it's connected when it's not that is retarded.Four there's no option to turn the Bluetooth off which is really aggravating to say the least.  Five the company tcl itself doesn't have live chat to get any kind of immediate response for assistance so they suck. Would not under any circumstance recommend that anybody buy an android based tv. Unless your into having to repeat stupid things and functions that are useless than an android tv will be perfect for you. But I hate them
"Got the TV and hooked it up. It was adequate, but no better than adequate. The picture was acceptable for the price, but left a lot to be desired. Sound was lousy, but we use a soundbar, anyway. About two or three days after we got it, the power button on the remote stopped working. Two or three days later the HDMI ports all went from functioning to green screen. Amazon has now had the return back for two and a half weeks and they say we will get our refund issued a little over a week from now. Of course, that's because they keep changing the date. The first date passed several days ago, and they changed it just before that happened. The next date was supposed to be tomorrow, but today they changed it again. Don't buy this TV. It is a sub-par product and the return process on it is even worse. I tried to submit this review with zero stars, but they won't let me do that. So, it should be a zero. It's a one because that's the lowest they allow you to do. UPDATE: 12/06 - After two contacts with Amazon support we DID get our refund."
"I had this TV for  about four months, and it was great. It didn’t give me any issues at the time. However, just about a month ago the TV had an update. The update made it, so time you turn on the television it just shows an ad which is the most frustrating thing about this TV. When the first thing you do after turning it on is that you to watch an ad or remember to exit out of it, before you be able to access the Home Screen on your television. I went to call customer support to ask if there’s a way to turn off the in the settings and they said that there is no option to turn off the ads the only way to avoid this is by opting out after factory resetting the TV. It wasn’t a big deal at first, but after a month, it’s becoming extremely annoying. I’ve just decided on get another one at this point. I don’t recommend buying ANY of the TCL products. Definitely don’t connect your prime account with it."
"The TV has shown a very dark screen on startup which lasts for up to 30 minutes and during watching a program.Also I have trouble Turing the TV off at times, using the remote. Last night 3/30, the remote would not turn off the TV. I tried for more than 10 minutes to get it to shutdown. I finally just pull the plug!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The ""game mode"" was causing outputs to lag. While playing ""MLB The Show 23"", pitches/swings would skip a frame or two causing my timing to be off. The picture isn't as vibrant as my previous TV, either. I'm really disappointed with its performance and will be returning it."
"So my teething puppy chewed my remote. I thought no big deal it'll be an easy fix. Welp Amazon doesn't have replacement remotes for this tv the only ones I did find are close to 50$ and take a week to arrive, TCL is no help at all and actually gave me a number they said was to a distributor that sells remotes ended up being a scam number, they then put me through to another person who said she found one on Amazon but she didn't have the right model number so that wouldn't work. I've been 5 hours now and 2 trips to Best Buy trying to find a replacement remote for this cause my Pluto TV is stuck playing legally blonde movies and im going insane"
"This set is garbage. You need to ""update"" the software before it starts communicating with any devices, and then you'll get a message ""cannot update at this time, try later or call Amazon customer service"". After 30-45 minutes of wasting your life on the phone with them, you will be directed to call TCL directly. They will waste more of your time. They will tell you this is a ""new"" TV and ask you to be patient as they look to ""isolate"" the problem. By then you will realize that they know nothing, and will wish to move on with life. They will insist that you must go on trying to ""update"" the new TV and proceed with the warranty claim to do so; i.e. waste more time. You will hang up, and curse them for false advertising including the fact that this is not a neutral brand TV set ""with fire TV"", but actually an Amazon Fire TV, which means it will never work with Apple products and will have issues with other non-Amazon products."
"can't beat the price, like the optical output too. picture quality is crappy, blacks are grey and whites aren't white, colors are skewed like you cannot get tint right.  it has hard restrictions against installing any & all 3rd party software onto the TV (none, zero), it becomes useless for those who bought it wanting to do just that."
I don't recommend this TV to anybody that has Comcast cable because you have to use both for most that come with the television plus the one from Comcast in order to work it it will not work with the remote from Comcast you have to use both of them I give it a two.
Worked great from middle of March until beginning of July (now). Now it consistently doesn’t load the app channels and the remote stops responding. Disconnects from the internet often and has to be reset.
"Our tv came defective, it took almost a week to deliver and being in the phone with Amazon support realized our tv arrived broken. They are refunding us our money once they pick up the tv from our home in a week from now. So we’ll see how it goes then. Overall this whole endeavor will be over a 2 week process to get our other tv once we have been refunded."
picture quality is just OK. nothing standout about it function prly and is low cost.
Inferior AudioTV speakers SOUND CHEAP. But the TV Amazon Fire System DOES NOT support any wireless speaker pairing.  And it also DOES NOT have any audio output connect plugs.
Shortly after I got the TV it just keeps cutting on and off on and off you know you can't do nothing and it just does it all the time I just hate it
"I never imagined my TV’s home screen could lag, but here we are. They stuff so many ads into the Home Screen I can’t even navigate easily to the apps I want to use because the ads literally make my Home Screen lag."
"I recently purchased the TCL 75-inch TV with high hopes, given its impressive specifications and numerous positive reviews. However, my experience was far from satisfactory.Upon unboxing the TV, I immediately noticed a significant crack on the top right side of the screen. It was clear that the product had been damaged either during shipping or prior to being packaged. This was extremely disappointing, as I was eagerly anticipating setting up and enjoying my new TV.I understand that sometimes defects and damage can occur, but this experience has left me quite frustrated."
The power supply cord keeps falling out from the back of the tv.
dislike tv was damaged right out of box  now round two
Decent TV for watching media - unplayble due to microstuttering on any HDMI input no matter the device or television settings.  Quality TV for media consumption.
"The cameras themselves seem to work well enough. They were easy to setup in the app. Just scan the QR code and go.  The cameras are small and discreet and mounting was straightforward and easy to do.After a few tweaks they pick up motion and clarity is good and notices are timely.I haven’t had them long enough to comment on battery life but so far that’s seems pretty good.That’s about where the good ends.  The app and cameras are pretty lacking in options and functionality.On the surface it looks like it has everything you need. Ability to configure motion zones and delay to avoid repetitive triggering of motion alerts.  Modes for disarm, home, and away. Geofencing to toggle modes. Schedules for modes. Notifications for motion detection and ability to get priority notifications on iOS. The ability to go live.  Two way communication in live mode and a built in siren.  Ability to connect to external chime.But in reality three modes is basically 1 too many.  The only options you can configure in the modes are motion detection and motion alerts.  So basically on and off for my purposes.  I would prefer to be able to control the priority of alerts as well so I can still be alerted during the day without it being a priority alert.  I would also prefer the ability to change motion detection frequency settings as well. So in the middle of the day when I walk by it doesn’t trigger again in 10 seconds vs at night or when I’m away having the ability to configure a shorter motion detection delay in case of intruders etcFrom the device screen or the live screen you can turn on the siren. But it lacks the ability to turn on the siren when motion is detected. This basically makes it useless as a deterrent for intruders or thieves if you’re away from your phone or if  you’re asleep.  Capturing someone on camera is great after the fact. But scarring them away when they’re in the act would be even better.  The Ring community forums have many requests this which is something that seems like a basic feature and something the cameras already have the ability to do. But the requests appear to have gone unanswered. I suspect at least part of the lack of the feature has to do with the fact that they want to sell external sirens / chimes.  This would also be something great to be able to configure in a mode if it existed so your could have it sound at night or when your away vs being disabled when at home.As far as chimes go, despite what you might find on the internet you cannot directly connect a google home speaker from the Ring app and it doesn’t appear to be natively supported.  I understand the two companies may be competing in this space and that’s understandable but I wish I knew that I couldn’t use my Google home speaker as a chime.Overall the cameras seem fine but if some of these functionality concerns aren’t addressed I may end up returning them and going with another brand."
"It's a pretty big camera with a big battery.  I have it on for 3 weeks and still has 86% battery capacity.  If it is monitoring light/minimal traffic area, I expect the battery to last at least 5-6 months.  The app tells you the percentage of battery capacity remaining so you can plan ahead.  It will take 6-8 hrs to fully charge the ~21.45Wh battery from empty.  Wish it can be faster otherwise one may need an additional battery to minimize down time.  There is a siren built into the camera but don't expect any ear piercing sound.  I like the dwell time between two consecutive motion detected videos is just 2-3 seconds instead of the more typical 10s.  Though I wish it's zero.  I also like the maximum record length is 2 minutes.  For whatever reason, I got random notification without accompanying any video cases.  The notification is correct but not sure why no video to go along.  The camera is fairly close to the wifi signal.  Don't know if this camera is just more honest relative to my other cameras and/or it doesn't work well with my wifi.  I also wish there is an option to turn off the blue light when it starts recording a motion.  I also don't like the two very visible red lights when infra red is on plus the click sound (not sure if that's the sound of a mechanical relay or something else).  There are cases where you don't want the subject to be aware of being recorded.  I also wish access to the battery is a little harder instead of just a twist of the base.  I also wish the detection sensitivity sliding bar has a digital readout.  I probably will need to try another camera and/or with another wifi."
"I have two Ring Doorbells and one Stick up Cam.  The quality of the product is excellent.  For the product I give 4.5 stars.  I am still not happy with the accuracy of the motion zones but after much tweaking it is acceptable.I just dropped the Ring Cloud service.  When I installed the doorbells on the front and back of the house in 2021, the service ran $60/year.  I could live with $5 per month.  Then, in 2023 if went up to $80/year.  A 25% increase.  Now, in 2024 it is going to $100/year.  Another 25% increase.  Enough is enough.  I dropped the cloud service and bought TP-Link Tapo which allows you to store on a micro sd card, no cloud service needed.  Ring should take the hint."
"When you fix your view for it to record motion unless something is close to the actual camera it picks up nothing. I have sittings as high as they can go. I have 8 cameras and none will reach the view if a few feet away unless movement is with in a few feet from actual camera. But live view picks up the complete view. I wish the cameras would pick up full view motion like live view. And I have solar panels up but still having to change batteries like 2 or 3 times a month. They are more work than I thought because I have to pay to get someone to change the batteries. I wish now I had went with my wired cameras Like I had for years. Different brand, Swann! I have put so much money into Ring Cameras now. I love the Ring doorbell though! But disappointed with cameras. I'm about 50% liking the cameras! You can't read tags on cars or see them either! Another disappointment!"
"Before you take the plunge and invest in a Ring doorbell and camera system, there are a few limitations.  First, their choice of outdoor cameras is limited and does not include any real PTZ options. I don’t think they allow other camera manufacturers to link into their system. Second, when you want to add something as simple as a compatible smoke detector, they make you buy their “alarm system”, which you probably don’t otherwise want or need… that is why you bought cameras with motion detectors  in the first place!"
"I really wanted this camera to work. I have two Ring door bell cameras and subscribe to their plan. So it was natural to add outdoor security cams. Setup was easy and it interface d with my Alexa easily. The software is very easy to configure and motion detection worked well. Now for the bad and the reason I returned it. It would not stay connected. I like to monitor my cameras on my PC and I could not get this to stay connected. I have a very fast  and stable Internet connection.  I even tried disconnecting all my other cameras and e placed this Ring camera right beside my router. It still would not stay connected. I packed it up and requested a return, which was approved. I promptly ordered two cameras from a different brand and they have been connected continuously for over a week.. From my experience if you're looking for a security camera that is constantly connected, this isn't the one for you."
"We have an Amazon Echo Show and our Ring Doorbell works great with it, automatically showing the live view on the Echo once there is movement or a person detected. I assumed it would be the same for the Stick Up Camera, but was very disappointed to learn that the live view doesn’t automatically appear with motion and person announcements. The Echo alerts you, but only through the Announcement feature (gray screen and audio stating there’s motion/person detected). If you want to see the live view, you have to set up a routine which is very cumbersome and doesn’t work well, or ask Alexa to show live view.I’ve contacted Ring and Amazon support about this a few times without any success so I’m assuming it is a feature not available on the Camera but is available on the Doorbell. I’d be delighted if anyone has any advice on how they resolved this issue if they have encountered it as well."
"Connecting to the app was very easy and the camera is clear. However, the motion activation is useless for anything beyond a few feet. I bought it to mount on the side of my garage (25 feet from my house) to cover my driveway which is then another 25-30 feet from the mount location. Not only does it not pick up motion at that distance as advertised, if I move it closer to the driveway and further from my house it then weakens the wi-fi signal. If I mount it to my house to maintain strong wi-fi signal it doesn't catch car motion in my driveway. It's distance motion detection is no better than my Ring doorbell camera. And yes, I've adjusted all the motion detection settings extensively. If you want something to mount on the sides of your house, it works great. But for my use it's highly disappointing."
"I have several ring cameras, and just bought two more.It took me quite a while to get one of them to connect, and then it was in and out for about a week. And now it will not reconnect at all.I even tried to reset it with the button on the bottom and it still will not connect.It drives me crazy, that on the ring app, there is not a button that just says ""reconnect"".So if one of the cameras goes offline, you just have to wait for it to automatically reconnect. There's like not a physical button, or button in the app that you can press to try to reconnect it.Regardless, one of these cameras is junk, and already threw the box away. So I will be contacting ring to try to get a replacement somehow."
"This is a nice camera, and the Ring software is pretty good.  I didn’t buy the battery, intending to use the supplied power supply.  Unfortunately, whoever designed the cable didn’t stop to think about how one could thread it from the camera (outdoors) to the power outlet (indoors). The cable has a small coaxial plug on the end, which could be threaded through a drilled hole — except that the plug has a 90° design, so one would need a roughly 1” hole.  Maybe the other end of the cable could be unscrewed from the transformer?  No, it seems to be welded in place.  So I had to cut the cable, thread it through a 1/4” hole, and then splice it together again.  All this made for a lot of unnecessary work."
"I work with cameras, WiFi, mesh gear, microwave technology, 4G, etc.  I stream audio and video and work with complex systems.  Every time I read a Ring forum person write in about a Ring issue, Ring never accepts blame.  My Ring doorbell signal is less than my stick up cam and it works great.  I am on my second stick up cam, and it has serious flaws. Let’s just say, I can push WiFi down my street, but a stick up cam in the same room, as my router, doesn’t get a decent signal!  Folks, we have here a company that has failed to get the bugs out of their firmware.  The doorbell works fine, the indoor cam mounted in the garage works fine, all my other cams works fine, but a simple stick up cam doesn’t.  No Ring, there are not too many devices on my network, I turned them off just to see if your excuse was even viable.  Bottom line is your firmware needs work, a lot of work, even your motion detection has issues, video playback has issues and it’s only on the stick up cam.  How do I knows this?  Let’s just say, when you try one cam, and it doesn’t work at all, you call Ring and talk real tech, they say send it back and get another, that tells me it’s an issue with the devices, especially when the second one starts up fine then begins to have issues.  I even borrowed another indoor cam, and tried it, it worked fine.Stop pointing the finger at people who buy this and blame them for its issues.  It appears your older generation device stick up cams work better.  There is a flaw somewhere in the string of code and every new one going out and getting updates will have these issues.  I would have bought several of these, but they don’t work.  Thankfully I can fall back on other competitor devices in the mean time till you get it right.  Don’t be ashamed to stand up and say you made a mistake, stop saying it’s people’s internet or WiFi strength, maybe your WiFi  receiver or antenna in the stick up cams has the issue.  I can stream some serious bandwidth at 30fps, and not even lose a frame, but yet a $99 camera can’t even stream 5’ from router with serious upload and download speeds.  Like I said before my doorbell works perfect, maybe I should mount a few of them around the house, flush them into a concealment, and disable the button.  I bet no one has used multiple door bell and small hidden cams yet.  They seem to work great!  Why is it I can walk down to my mailbox with a streaming WiFi camera I have, and your stick up cam, and the stick up cam drops out, yet my other camera doesn’t?  No it’s not arlo, it’s a simple WiFi based camera.  Go figure, I bet you got a deal on some second rate WiFi receivers and board antennas hoping 50% or more worked, just look at the amazon feedback, that should support my argument.  That’s all.....After my review was written, Ring tech support reached out to me.  Jason, and I spoke for an hour and he gave me a few options.  One of the options was to replace my Stick up Cam with the POE Stick up Cam Elite.  I was hesitant because I didn’t want to run a Cat6 cable where I had the stick up cam at.  He talked to me and asked me to try it.  He sent me the Elite version and I tested it.  To my surprise it worked flawlessly, so I did the full install. The Elite version allows for much better motion zone control, and since it’s wired to a switch with a POE injector, the activation response is super fast.  Because most of the ring cameras are a bit grainy without ambient light or the assistance of additional lighting, I opted to add a dual 500 lumen motion light on my back patio. Walking anywhere near it not only activates the light for a few minutes, but allows the elite stick up cam to get a clear picture.  This not only solves my problem, but serves a purpose with the additional lighting.  The Elite stick up cam, is the only POE version they make, but if the Ring flood or spot cane POE, I would go with them.My sincere appreciation goes out to Jason, from Ring.  He is fast to respond to emails and gets involved problem solving.  I appreciate his help and his concern.  I will continue my use of the Elite versions as they work for my applications.  I still will return the original stick up cam as it didn’t work for me."
"The camera has great clarity,easy to install.The battery life is the downside .It  only last for 12hrs.This is the wireless version"
"We replaced a brand of security cameras that leaned towards commercial quality with Ring cameras.  Our system was 10 years old and had a limit of 6 cameras, but we wanted to go to 7, and we had a number of batteries that needed replacing so we were considering where to spend our money and decided on an “upgrade.”We needed a lot of cameras because we have a farm with several outbuildings and we wanted to cover all entrances.  What we didn't appreciate at the time was that the brand had high quality images.  When reviewing video, things looked close and crystal clear.  I assumed that a replacement with any leading brand would be as good or better just based on advancements in technology.We are quite unimpressed with Ring.  While their application features are extensive, the quality is poorer.  When reviewing video, everything looks much farther away and is blurrier for moving objects.  We have a camera right alongside our driveway where cars pass literally within a few feet, and most of the time you can't even read the license plate.  Also, because the coverage is much poorer (can't see other doors on the same side of the building with clarity), we had to buy more cameras to cover the same area so we went up to 9 cameras.  Aside from video quality issues, we are having technical problems.  Solar charging is terribly flaky.  The cameras will report that solar is disconnected and it stops charging.  Technical articles suggest that the error can happen when there isn't enough sunlight.  That is not our problem because 2 of them that frequently get the error have the best exposure, and we have others that are in low light areas and don't have the problem.  It appears to happen much more frequently with the Spotlight Cam and larger solar panels than the Stick Up Cam and smaller solar panels, but we have had it happen to both.  Unplugging solar and replugging solves the problem for the moment but it comes back eventually.  We also ad a frustrating incident where our wifi went down due to  a power outage that lasted for several hours.  When power and wifi came back up, none of our cameras reconnected.  I had to get a ladder out and go around unplug solar and remove and reinsert batteries to reset all of them one by one.From a general quality perspective, all of the mounts and the camera housings are very lightweight and cheap.If we weren't so far into this with so many cameras and the time of mounting them all we probably would go back to our old system.  We definitely have buyer's remorse."
I like the size of it and that it's black. You also have the 2 way speaker. I don't know if it's this model or if I got one that's damaged but the motion sensor even when turned to the highest sensitivity isn't as good as the doorbell camera I have or my other stick up camera that's a different model. I decided just to use this one inside to check on my dog when I'm not home. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Also the bottom comes off and the battery is easily accessible and rechargeable which I like.
"First I realized even tho can see far in the camera view, it won’t detect motion far. I moved camera down the yard closer to driveway. Very pleased that it picks up my wifi quite far from the house. Picked up all driveway motion fine. Seems weatherproof as well!***But I did Not know that I have to Pay Ring to view any motion!  You literally have to have phone in your hand and immediately click on ring when alerted to motion, or you miss it.  I cannot see who has been up or down driveway because it will Not Store Any Video of motion…Unless you Pay their subscription!  Apparently after a couple weeks of ‘free protect’, or whatever, it quit storing video clips on my phone. Even my starred motions I wanted to save went away and now I can’t see any motion except in real time. I don’t have my phone in my hand every minute to respond to a motion alert. I do not remember reading must pay to use it. Lesson Learned…read the fine print!  At least can still see a ‘live view’, but miss most motion because I’m not on phone when an alert happens."
"It was easy to set up and is a great companion to my Ring doorbell on the front of the house. It has an excellent field of view and the image itself is very good.Now for the bad: it lost all WiFi connectivity overnight and I have a strong WiFi signal where the camera is located. When I set it up again, it downloaded updates again. This would seem to suggest there were new updates today, even though it grabbed updates when installed yesterday.I gave it three stars because I like what is potentially capable of, and I am realistic about a brand new product on day one. It may take a little time to work out all the bugs so patience is required for the first few months.I should also add that the support rep spoke very poor English and it really got to the point I just wanted to get her off the call. I probably understood about two out of three words from the representative. This was more disappointing to me than the actual failure, but she was able to help me get it resolved - with various request to repeat things.Update day 2: Camera has disconnected from network again, which means I have to go out and push the setup button again and reconnect it to the network. I don't really want to call their support number again because that was such a painful experience. I really want this to work so I am going to have to think about how much patience I have versus my frustration and desire to return it.End of day 2 update: after connecting to the network again this morning at 10:30, it had dropped off WiFi by my return at 5:00 pm. I also noted the battery is down to 75% after two days of “not working”. This is stretching even my patience.Despite the issues I have experienced with this device, I remain a fan of Ring products. I did receive a nice note from Ring customer support offering additional assistance, but he only works on weekdays so I cannot pursue the issue until next Monday. In defense of Ring, they were extremely helpful with my doorbell last spring so I have high confidence this will be resolved - if I can handle the shorter than expected battery life.Beginning of day 3: I placed the camera on my desk, about 3 feet from the wireless access point as a test to see if wifi signal strength is the culprit. Reconnected it to the WiFi network. Battery strength on this beginning of day 3 at 61%. Even if I get this working correctly, I don't believe the battery life will satisfy my expectations.End of day 3. Disconnected from WiFi after a few hours, sitting right beside access point. Discounts signal strength issue. I will work with with support next week to figure this out.FINAL UPDATE: After working with Ring support, they assessed the camera as faulty and had me return it for replacement. Sadly, the replacement worked exactly the same way. This suggests a problem on my network (even though two other Ring cameras are working fine) or a faulty batch of cameras. After working with Ring support again, they forwarded me to a second tier support rep. During our efforts, it stopped responding to the setup button so I was no longer able to work with  this camera. At this point we returned the unit. I was disappointed with the battery life and since they couldn't product a unit that would work on my network I decided it was time to fold. I remain a fan of Ring products in general, but this second example of the ""Stick up cam"" failed before we could do any extensive diagnostics so we will never really know what the problem was. (oh - for you networking folks out there, I did set the camera's mac address to a reserved IP address in my DHCP server. Worked fine for the usual 5ish hours and then lost the network again.)"
"I bought this Ring camera to get my Amazon Key service working after 3 years of pandemic interruption and then Amazon discontinuance of the cloud cam service which Amazon’s epic failure to resolve enabling key service for Blink cameras which Amazon provided to replace the Amazon Cloud Cam when they decided to discontinue the service.  Like buying a car so that you can drive on the highway to get to work and they discontinue the car and shut it down remotely then they give you roller skates to get to work on the highway.  Well, the quality of the Ring camera is far superior to Blink.  The image is somewhat fisheye, but you can zoom in and get pretty good quality. Where is the Blink has a very narrow image, and may not work in most situations where the people you want to detect, and camera are too close to the camera. At Issue and the two star deduction is the battery life make this camera unusable - it lasts for 48 hours. Wow that’s better than Apple Watch. It’s super impractical for a camera that you have to get up on the ladder every two days, to take down charge for five hours and get back up the ladder put it back in place.  Who has time to do this? I’ve tried all the software manipulations to reduce the events that I need to record to secure my property, I live on a busy street and there is just now getting around recording everything.; even at minimal motion detection i need to just record people hanging at my gate as they steal packages by reaching through bars when Amazon drivers don’t follow instructions to toss small further away from the gate on the landing out of sight and reach. So I have to wade through  50 plus videos to see what happened to my  Missing delivery. To ensure the camera stays properly charged you must remove it from the camera and charge it. It takes about five hours so basically the camera is out of service as delivered every 5 of 48 hours. To resolve this unacceptable duty cycle you must pay $39 for a ring charger - a simple 5 volt, 1 amp USB charger and old round AC to DC adapter style plug. It seems this camera will not detect other chargers. I don’t mind paying a little extra for proprietary equipment as companies do need to ensure quality control especially when they provide a charger with a USB cable for free, but you can only use it when the battery is out of the housing of the camera.  A simple engineering change could have allowed ring customers to simply use a standard, and provided micro USB cable and charger instead of a standard, DC round connector  and USB plug and a charger PROPRIETARY circuitry  and charger to shake you down for another $40 to make their $100 camera work.  A tiresome, tiresome old bait and switch tactic that I find repulsive and dishonest. Once again, I feel ripped off by Amazon and now Ring after investing thousands of dollars in the iron work, it took to retrofit my gate for the Schlage Amazon key electronic Wi-Fi lock, labor to install their camera and locks so that I could receive their precious little Amazon packages without being stolen in a busy city where this service was offered advertised as the SOLUTION to eliminate the package delivery theft.  Why should I have Amazon prime? Why should I have Amazon key if everything gets stolen. Amazon literally created the stolen package industry and continues to participate in the stolen package industry themselves. So Amazon I hope you actually read this and fix your issues. You make it very difficult for me to be a customer."
"January 2024 update:Knocking it down from 4 to 3 stars and dropping prior approximation of motion capture percentage from 90% to 60% after having these cameras for a couple of years.Ring cams are okay. They are not reliable and do not catch all motion.  Also, live view is not always  available when most needed. Connectivity is not a factor. Internet and wifi signals are strong and reliable. We upgraded to faster internet speeds and our router is new. Batteries are charged and cameras are within close range with strong signals as well.Many motions that should be detected easily are not. Whether it be garbage pick up, deliveries, pets, etc. these cameras miss too many events they should be capturing.What prompted this update is our frustration that an entire family of 7 deer walked within 10 feet in front of a Ring stick up camera and nothing was recorded. That was a lot of motion and they were lingering out there for a while. Attempts were made to pull up live views and nothing happened until the deer family were long gone. Most often when attempting live view, it just takes too long to load.Needless to say, this is disappointing. It is especially disappointing after investing in a number of cams, path lights, light bulbs, etc. Might have to start all over with a more reliable system.They're good and perform pretty reliably. Video quality is okay, but wish it was more sharp. The motion detection can be annoying but it is more ""the nature of the beast"", where the sun, shadows and wind will be an annoyance, giving motion alerts when you don't want them. You can't really say ""false detection"" because they are detecting shadows or movement from wind. Also, getting a little tired of charging batteries. It's not bad though. Probably charge every couple of weeks, depending on usage. Might purchase solar panels for a couple of them.There are times that there was motion not recorded when it should have been. Not all the time, but unpleasantly surprised when people came and went without recording at all. To place a percentage of successful recording, it would be about 90% of the time."
Not sure if this is a user error but it doesn't start to record til WAY after someone is in front of camera. I walked in front of camera and completely around my car and it doesn't start recording til I'm walking away...
"Zero Integration with Ring AlarmI have a much better security camera system for my home's exterior but thought I might try one of these cams indoors since I have the Ring alarm system and a Ring Doorbell already. I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't. None. Not a single thing.It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways. I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed. Nope.I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house. Nope. There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not. They are not location aware in any way. The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording. Nope!The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours. Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room. I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on. This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%. This is with all the 'battery saving options' on. This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording. So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing. I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality. The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind."
I got a 2nd generation indoor cam for like $30 at ring site and the quality is so much better then this thing. at night you can't see anything!  The camera in my window is much clearer.
"Well, outdoor ring camera it Loses juice really fast it’s OK but I really don’t like it. I wish I could’ve tried another situation with the cameras. I don’t like it so really thumbs down."
"I’ve called customer support twice. My connectivity problem between my router and doorbells and Chime has been “escalated”. I really liked the doorbells for the brief moment they worked. For some reason they won’t connect to my Centurylink C4000 almost brand new router. I’m really close to uninstalling everything and returning to Amazon. I’ve also wasted a week of my free Ring trial month of service. Second phone call the person basically said, you’re not the only one with this problem so wait for us to contact you. They did send a new Chime Pro after the first call, but I really don’t think anything was wrong with it. Very frustrating experience. Impatiently waiting for an email from Ring."
"I purchased 2 of these cameras to use outdoors at our new house. One continues to work perfectly, along with about 30 other pieces of Ring equipment, but this one will not connect to my WiFi network. In fact, the blue light (which indicates it's ready to pair when flashing) will not come up, no matter how long I hold the orange button. I am very disappointed that a $99 camera only lasted about 5 months. 😞Edited to add: After searching for warranty information, I contacted Ring about this camera's failure. I am now waiting for a replacement camera under warranty. I'll update this review once that camera arrives and I've installed it."
"I have wired Rings outside and there is night vision. This Stick Up advertises night vision, but worthless in the dark. Disappointed. Daytime video is fine though.Edit: The Ring customer service contacted me and helped me solve the problem. Seems night vision wasn't automatically turned on in this unit and he took me through the steps to turn it on.  Thanks for the help."
We are having issues capturing motion it’s been frustrating I have the ring doorbell and that’s what we’ve been using for some time now only thing is because of were we have it you can’t capture everything that’s why we ordered the ring stick up we’ve been trying to figure this out since the day we received it my husband was so frustrated he deleted the whole thing off his phone I need the to be more prompt I have no idea what we are doing wrong
Not sure why I received used cameras
"I picked this model because there is no wiring required. I bought 2. The setup was easy but you can't count on them. I've had one set-up for about 2 weeks to see how accurate it is to make sure I want to keep them. It is set to the most sensitive motion setting available. It is outside. It seems to catch the cats most of the time unless they run past. However I can walk right up to it and wave at it and it's about a 65% accuracy.  And by the time the notification hits by phone a person would be inside my house. I got it on sale so for $65 so it's not bad I guess, compared to other prices I've seen. When it does record the clarity and sound is good. The range is also pretty decent. My only complaint really is it doesn't capture actual people walking past it all of the time. And if it has just been set off by a motion it will not immediately catch another motion. It's like it needs to sit for awhile before it works again. I've been looking at other models, have not decided if I will return these or not. I'm still messing with it hoping I can get it to work better."
"I used to recommend Ring to everyone, but that was until Amazon decided to double the prices for their security plans. I will be going back to Amcrest cameras being saved with Blue Iris surveillance software. Buyer beware that Amazon may price you out after you go all-in and buy a bunch of their Ring products."
"The picture and Audio quality is great and the setup is easy as well. The HUGE downside is these do NOT support 24/7 veiwing. You have to reconnect every 10 minutes which is a major disappointment. If it wasnt for that I would give them 5 stars, even considering returning these for the lack of 24/7 veiwing."
Delivered at wrong house
"This camera is extremely user friendly. The app allows you to access every feature quickly and easily. You can reconfigure camera settings in minutes.The motion sensor and alarm, live view option, speaker and microphone features are helpful.You can send a video to share easily as well.The major disappointment is with the night vision. It needs a significant amount of light to actually be able to see what it is recording. The motion detector picks up the movement and the camera records, but the screen is pitch black unless they're is an actual light right on the subject. For example, I have lights on my porch. I can see my porch at night with the camera that is pointed at the porch (photo 2 above); however, I have a camera sitting on the porch, pointing down the stairs, which shows a pitch black screen at night (photo 1 above), even though it is literally sitting in the light and the object is 5 feet away. Very frustrating. Completely useless if intruders come through the yard. I have had to set up motion lights all over my yard, but it is still not very effective. Do not expect to feel secure at night if you are relying on the night vision feature.There security cameras I have had in the past required very little ambient light.They shouldn't advertise night vision. They should claim low light vision at best.As far as daytime, you can't see person's face clear enough for identification at 20 feet. You will only recognize them if you already know them.One other thing that wasn't clear upon purchase is that you must sign up for their subscription service or you will not be able to view any videos at all after the introductory period.I understand requiring the service for saving videos to access over time, but it is a scam to have a product that you can't even use without a further purchase.I would recommend this, as long as you understand the limitations.I would give 5 stars if the night vision didn't need full light to work."
"My stick-up camera went ""off-line"" at 9:30 PM last night.  I am unable to get a live view, nor is it recording any activity.  After a validating my account, JUST TO TALK TO A REPRESENTATIVE, the rep instructed me to dismount the camera from the shed roof where it was installed, to get to the reset button.  I was incredulous, but I hauled out the ladder, in the snow, and drug it to the shed.  Having climbed the ladder, and prying the camera out of its calked installation, there was no reset button.  The rep insisted that this is the only way to reactivate the camera.  I asked to speak to a manager.  She said the manager would call me back between 24 and 48 hours on the cell phone number that I have given her, at the beginning of the call, as my call-back number.  I went outside to try to remount the camera.  When I came back in ten minutes later, a so-called manager had left a message on my LAND LINE, the phone I'd called from, not my cell phone, and did not leave her name.  I was free to call again.  24-48 hours?  Really?  I re-called the help line, validated my account AGAIN, and got to a different rep.  He said I needed to unscrew the base of the unit to access the battery area, NOT completely dismount the unit. (Too late, already dismounted.)  After dropping the screw from the ladder into the snow, the rep walked me through the reset process three times.  It didn't work.  I asked why the camera went offline.  He said there was a software update last night, and that this was a one in fifty chance that my camera would not reactivate.  One in fifty seems high risk to have to repeat this entire process. The reset process didn't work, so the rep asked me to unplug my router.  As my connections are under my TV table, he said to disconnect the power to the router.  As I did so, I also lost the land line phone connection with the rep.  He opted not to call me back on the ""call-back"" number he'd solicited at the beginning of the call.  This whole experience has left me very disappointed in Ring.  The first rep. gave me the wrong instructions.  And this reset process is ridiculous for a camera that is mounted out of reach, which is where most cameras are mounted.  If I were inside the Amazon return window, I'd return this camera.  I will advise friends and family to buy another manufacturer.  This is what I call an epic customer service fail."
"Product is fine. Quality is good but customer service is a joke.I have 6 cameras for my house and my separate garage. All good but one.I have one faulty camera that the motion sensor only works 10% of the time (It happens I'm not annoyed over this)Call cause I guess you have too. customer service is so foreign they don't know anything except what is in their guide. She telling me I have to have the notifications on my phone for it to work (my other 5 work like this). I don't want to hear my phone chime every time I grab a 10mm socket and then think its 11mm and then realize it's American (it's more annoying than reading this).No solution, I'm probably out the $70 and have to buy a new one.I wish they used amazons customer service (same company owned) amazons customer service always fix's it and makes my day better even if I'm in a good mood to begin with."
"This will be a long post:Bought at Christmas and didn't set it up until recently due to our weather in our state. Right off the bat, trial period was over, but I didn't think that was a big deal. Because I bought it for my husband, he set it up on his phone instead of me doing it on mine: BIG mistake. I'm the one who always has a phone on me, I'm the light sleeper, I'm the worrier and camera checker. Because he set it up, he is ""primary"" and I am guest ""secondary."" Primary is the only one who can adjust settings like motion sensitivity or delete unwanted videos that were taken (for example) installation, or range of detection. In order for this to be done, I have to get my husband's phone and do the settings. Because our trial was over, videos are not saved. It was literally impossible for us to install during December or January or February. So because our trial is over, here's what happens: As a secondary, I am holding my phone and get an alert there is motion. I immediately click on the alert bar on my phone and go to the app and click on LIVE view. What happens is -- scrolling-- and waiting. We get critters on our deck so this was one reason for getting the camera, to see the wildlife. The scrolling and waiting will last 3-4 minutes and you finally get a live view that many minutes later. I asked my husband who also had his phonoe in his hand and got an alert (it was a cat on the deck by the way) and he too immediately clicked on the app to see live view. He too got scrolling and waiting. NO live view allowed. This is apparently because the app is trying to save video and can't because our trial is over. Ring people told me I could pay $30 for the year for this device - OR $100 for the year and have many more devices added. Problem is, I am the one inquiring about all this and would like to purchase the $30 package but no.... because I am not primary, husband has to. I created an account on Ring but you cannot transfer ownership from ""primary account"" to another account even if it is the same IP address and street location/household. If we were to add more devices under MY account, I could absolutely have the $100 package to cover all of those but the single camera set up by my husband on HIS account would not be on it. That's one issue. To solve this, he would have to delete the camera from his account and I would ""add"" that camera to my account but was told by Ring the warranty would be voided. At this point I don't even care about warranty.  I spoke with a family member who bout the same camera and they too had the ""scrolling to view Live stream"" until they bought a plan. Not being a Ring tech, I am presuming it is because the camera is trying to save the video (which it can't because we didn't buy the plan) so thus the scrolling. It seems once you ""buy in"" the scrolling goes away. I'd happily do this except for: (1) lack of ability to access motion and video deletion and range of view as a secondary user. (2) lack of transferability to another account without blowing the warranty. Just as an FYI, other cameras allow full access to another user if you so choose. So what to do? We are gifting this $150 purchase (camera and solar charger) to a family member who is ""all in"" with Ring. We will stick with the cameras we have and just add more. Honestly was going to give Ring a big thumbs up and be all-in as well but after this test with just one camera we changed our minds. As it stands now... this camera is good for ""seeing the back deck"" at any time UNLESS there is an alert. Then we have to wait 5 minutes to see the live view. Range and viewing gets 5 stars. Clarity gets 5 stars. Having to pay for a package just to be able to see who is on the deck in an immediate alert - zero stars."
"I have 12 Ring Cams inside and outside my residence. For all indoor cams I have the end-to-end encryption feature turned on for privacy purposes. Has been working as expected for several years. I bought 3 stick-up cams for indoor use. In late July 2024. Set up with end-to-end video encryption on.Worked as expected for a few days. Then with no notice all 3 stick-up cams with the end-to-end encryption stopped recording video on the same day 8/2/2024. Called Ring Tech Support on 8/3/24 to report issue and seek solution. They were unable to help. The tech escalated the issue to next level support then to Advanced level support, with a promise of ‘response in 24-72 hours. Still no response as of review date. Called tech support twice more but have no idea when a fix will happen. Now I'm having to return these devices since they no longer function as advertised and Ring refuses or is unable to correct the problem they created. I would like the cameras to work as advertised but they simply don't. Please save yourself the frustration and avoid stick-up cams if you intend to utilize them the end-tio-end encryption feature .Sun 8/18 Ring Tech Support has twice let the 'We will respond by date' pass with no attempt at communication with me. I will call again and let you know."
"Worked intermintly, then got a ring doorbell to pair the porch, now 98% success at the front door. The over the phone tech help is excellent so far. The only downside imo is the vertical coverage is very small. Disappointed. But I made it work."
Video quality it ok.Motion sensor is adequateAngle of view left and right is averageAngle of view top to bottom is narrow.Audio from the camera speaker is quiet. Hard to hear anyone talking to the person standing in front of the camera.
"Don’t know what the solar panel is there for… it doesn’t seem to charge the battery as I’m constantly replacing the batteries on my multiple cameras.If I have outdoor plugs, I’d buy the plugins but I don’t."
"I've had the Ring security system for quite awhile, but it wasn't until Prime Day in July that I decided to swap out by Blink cameras with Ring stick up cams (both companies now owned by Amazon). I initially purchased 5 cameras and they seemed great. My old 3rd party mounts I got for my Blink cameras still worked on these, and the setup was pretty easy and straight forward. I feel like the picture quality does leave a little to be desired. Even with the best connection available, the picture can be a little pixelated and grainy during sunlight.That said, about 5 days ago, one of the cameras failed. All 5 cameras have the same settings, primarily where they only turn on at night to conserve battery (I have Ring spotlight cams that are hardwired, as well as a Ring doorbell, and those I keep on 24/7). I thought maybe the battery somehow died, even though the other 4 cameras showed 80-85% battery life remaining after about 40 days. I took down the camera and charged the battery full, but still no life in the camera. Great...I contacted Amazon support, and was extremely disappointed to find out they don't really stand behind these products. Even though Amazon owns Ring, they're treated like any other random seller on Amazon where you have 30 days for issues/returns and that's it. Upon finding out that my camera died after 40 days, the CSR said all they could do was process a refund as a ""one-time exception."" And they couldn't/wouldn't send out a replacement. I bought it on Prime Day when it was half off, so the refund barely covered half the cost of a replacement... Maybe reaching out to Ring separately would yield better results, but you would think you wouldn't have to if Amazon owns the product/company.I bought a replacement anyway, which came yesterday, and it's completely dead on arrival. No lights or anything, even with a full battery. So now I have to send that back and order replacement #2. We'll see how that goes....Overall, a pretty disappointing experience all around. I don't like issues when it comes to my home security. I want the peace of mind that comes with having something reliable that the company stands behind. I've never had issues with my Ring doorbell and 2 spotlight cams, and 4 of the cameras that do work work really well. But it's not a good feeling when security cameras fail so quickly, and if/when they do, the company won't even send you a replacement and may not even refund you, even if it's only been 5-6 weeks. FWIW, my Blink cameras lasted for years, even when exposed to the elements outside. Not one failed or arrived DoA."
Worked as expected for what I paid for 3 days. Then quit. But maybe their only redeeming quality is that their customer service seems competent
"Very poor video,  sound works sometimes I have several ring products they all work great but this didn't very poor quality video and audio"
"I have the Arlo wireless camera system for five years and I am comparing them to the Ring cameras that I’ve had 10 months.Although the Ring is supposed to be high definition—it is not visually. The downloaded file is 1920 x 1080 and data rate is about 1350kbps. But the frame rate is usually only 15 frames per second that causes the playback to look jerky. The frame rate should be 24-30 fps for realistic, smooth motion. For some situations it is around 24fps.Often the data rate is a poor 450kbps. I feel it is misleading to advertise the video quality as HD although the downloaded file meets a definition of HD.My screenshots that I posted for this review show when the video is at it clearest and when it is at its poorest quality. The screen shot of the bicycle is in low resolution. The other screen shot of the passing car is when Ring is at its best. The screenshot image of the white truck in the intersection is from the Arlo cam.I have not been able to determine why the data rate is often so bad and frame rate is undesirable at 15fps. (15fps is like the webcam videos from the 1990s). This is why the video recordings are quite awful and others complain about it too. However, it could also be that Ring throttles my account recordings to low resolution when too many videos have been recorded in a short time. A speed test shows my household wired Internet speed at the router is:  PING 18 MS, DOWNLOAD 245 Mbps, UPLOAD 11 Mbps.What is good though is the max sensitivity setting. I can record people and vehicles from about 100 feet away. Night color video is good but I have a streetlight at the front of my house. I also like the easy battery cartridge replacement.Apps:The Ring website is missing most of the features of the smart phone app. It sometimes requires an exasperating four click prompts to logon. Now they enforce the double verification log on which I think is way overboard for recording typical movement outside my house. I don't care if some hacked my Ring account and saw my videos: boring!The smartphone app I rate it poor. It is cumbersome to use. It nags me with prompts about high battery use levels (as if I didn’t know) and to upgrade logon credentials (that I don't need in the first place).The app from the Microsoft store is so basic and poorly designed that is one of the worst apps I’ve ever used!Summary: the Ring system is a slick looking device but over hyped. I don’t plan on renewing my subscription to Ring and will sell my camera. For my situation, Arlo is better designed. It is consistent and overall is the better performing wireless video security cam system. The video is consistently smooth compared to Ring. The Arlo website and smartphone app are both well designed and not overly complex like the Ring’s versions.UPDATE March 3, 2020. The Ring Android app developed issues that weren't resolved by Ring staff. Continued to have instances of poor video quality as described above. Don't think Ring equipment was worthy of spending $100 to keep my annual plan. I canceled my plan and sold my Ring security cams. I added more Arlo cameras (no extra fees or costly plans for them) and I am very happy that I dumped Ring."
Even though the installation instructions ask if you’re mounting it to the ceiling you still can’t invert the picture. Buyer beware.
"Don't waste your money on ring cameras. They all seem to last a handful of months and then they just stop loading the live view and then say that you have low battery even when you put in a fully charged battery. I bought this stupid camera on 10/8 as a replacement for the other one we had that just decided to stop working after 6 months. No matter how many charged battery packs we put it, it still wouldn't allow for live view ""due to low battery."" So barely less than a month of use and this brand of camera AGAIN won't connect to live view and barely catches anything that comes into our yard even when I have the settings to the highest sensitivity."
"Easy to set up, good video quality, app is very good. Only issue, but a major one: terrible battery life."
"Firstly, instructions are vague. I bought this to accompany the Ring battery doorbell so that I could get a wider view of house and yard. After testing in a variety of positions, we realized its limitations when it comes to finding a suitable mounting surface that allows the best viewpoint with its limited angle adjustment. Also, I didn't want to spend more money for a solar power supply as the battery would need to be recharged too often for my liking. We ended up giving it to our son."
"I bought this product on 11/23.  It is now 12/28 and I am getting notification that I need to charge the battery.  Same thing happened on 12/8; took the battery out, charged to full and put it back in.  So basically the battery is lasting 2-3 weeks from full charge.  I have it above my garage and have to get a ladder to change it out it's not an easy process (and then have to charge it, get the ladder, and put it back in).  I was under the impression the battery would last at least several months.  Not just a few weeks.  I also can't seem to find the happy medium of recording.  I either miss things, or get a 10 second clip on the back half of the movement, or get 1 minute of nothing but a tree across the street blowing depending on the different settings.  Also, considering it's called a stick up cam I literally thought it was going to have sticky pads that I could stick it up (think command hooks).  I didn't realize I was going to have to screw it into the location I wanted it, which meant I couldn't easily screw into my concrete block house.  Finally, the location is not that far from the wifi router (less than 30 feet), yet it often does not have enough bars to connect."
"I've had the Ring Alarm system since 2018, and I've relied on their cameras for outdoor footage since. I use the Elites with PoE, but i wanted to cover a less important area with this camera. It set up easily, camera quality is great, very happy with the hardware and performance like my other Ring cameras.The big flaw? This camera doesn't have an option to flip the footage if it's mounted upside down! Other, cheaper Ring indoor cameras have this super high tech capability, but the camera that can be mounted outside, on something like the underside of a roof, can't do it! Absolutely insane such a simple feature isn't implemented on such a 'Flex' camera. But never fear, you can pay them an extra $20, for the luxury of the Elite camera mount to put on this camera. No thanks. This is easily a 5 star product once this ridiculous limitation is fixed. Please add the software video flip option!"
"Cameras work fine with good picture quality for daytime and nighttime infrared. Setup was relatively easy, but beware, camera batteries need to be charged for 6-8 hours before starting setup..Ring calls what they provide geofencing, but it really is not useful. You can set up a geofence around your house and when your phone leaves the geofence it will send you a reminder to change your setting in the app to Away. Not very practical or safe to do when driving. When you return to the geofence area the app will snooze alerts on your cameras and or doorbell for a user selected interval of up to 3 hours after which it starts sending alerts for motion detection on all devices including any indoor cameras. Would be much better if you could have it automatically set your system to Home mode. Note this only works for one phone. It does not work automatically if you have the app on two phones. I guess they expect to you know enough to not change your mode to Away when you leave if your spouse is still home. Since many devices (thermostats and other camera systems) currently allow you to use geofencing to determine when all phones leave the geofence area and automatically change to Away mode and then return to Home mode when one or more phones return home, the techknowloge is it out there, but Ring chooses not to do this even though users have been asking for it for several years.Unfortunately, I was in a hurry and choose the Ring cameras because the house I put them in already had a Ring Doorbell. Had I done my research better, with the current Ring Geofence system, I would have likely gone with a different camera provider and changed out the doorbell also. If Ring were to come up with a better geofence application that works like it should, I would likely change may rating to add a couple stars."
"The camera itself is fine. The video showing how to install it is very unclear and misleading when it comes to the mount. The video shows a white mounting plate that you screw into the wall. In actuality it is a gray piece that looks like rubber. It does not easily slide off like as shown in the video. I had to use a knife to pull it up around the sides in order to remove it. I had actually returned one camera believing that the piece was missing. It is just that the video is incorrect. The mounting part is a huge pain, so don't plan on having to remove it or move it. Interestingly enough the customer service had no idea what I was talking about even though I told them to look at the video while I was on the phone with them!"
"On the plus side Exterior Motion Activated Cameras are easy to set up and pair, BUT to use them, you need “Range Extenders” and not just one or two.  I live in a smaller single story wood frame stucco house, and when the exterior Motion Activated Camera is more than 15 ft away from the base station, the reception is spotty and unreliable.  Nobody wants “unreliable” on their security system.These Cameras are overly sensitive to motion.  Even when set to the lowest possible sensitivity, nary a leaf will fall from a tree nor field mouse trespass on your garden, that your camera will record the event and bright lights will illuminate the scene.  Seriously, I’ve studied the videos and just can’t figure out what moved.  After a while you learn to ignore them, but that defeats the purpose of a Security System, doesn’t it?On the App, it tells you if the motion detected was a ""person"" or just ""motion"".  Since it evidently can discriminate, it should have a setting that ONLY advises you about people moving in the yard. Many complaints to Ring, Inc about this over the years, but no solutions that I am aware of.Mercifully, however, when the system is disarmed, like when you and your guests are home and moving about, the cameras are also disarmed."
"Features are decent, but reliability is TBD and service support is poor.  I installed 3 Stick Up Cams on 4/24 and 1 failed on 5/10.  It wouldn't enter the connecting state (flashing blue LED).  Ring Service walked me through the same things I'd tried and then agreed the cam should be replaced.  Problem: Only black cams were available at the time for service replacements.  I agreed to wait for white even though it meant I had to call back to request it.  I called several times before they said white was available and one was shipped on 6/1.  On Sunday, 6/2 a package was delivered by an Amazon Prime delivery truck.  What the heck!?  Amazon had been selling white Stick Up Cams the whole time I was trying to work a service replacement with Ring.  Even worse, they'd shipped me a black cam even though they'd told me it would be white!  I called Ring Service again and told them again that I didn't want the black camera.  They suggested I install it for short term and call back in 2 weeks to request a white replacement.  They said cams in stock for the Ring.com store or Amazon aren't available for service replacements.  Amazon's replacement policies are generally great, but in this case the replacement is handled by RIng, and they seem pretty messed up."
"I got this to mount upside down under an overhang to watch my driveway. I have other Ring cameras inside, this is the first 'Stick up indoor/outdoor"" I got. Well, unlike the other cameras, if you mount this upside down (for example to keep sheltered from snow accumulation) there is no option in the software to turn the image upside down (to correct from the camera being inverted). It's just software so there's no reason it couldn't be done. To be fair to Ring, it does warn of this limitation in the help doc, if you know to go look for it, so they can always say it's a documented limitation. But uf, like me, your experience is with their other cameras, this might not be expected. I can't think of a good reason why this limit exists since the other cameras support this option. 1 star off for that. The other star reduction is for the small screws to mount the plate. They are not really wood screws as the threads are very small. Mounting outside to a wooden surface without additional support seems likely to fail after a relatively short time. You can't really buy bigger screws without cutting the mounting plate, so your only option is to get longer small screws to hope you have enough bite from the threads as the wood expands and contracts over the seasons. Not really well thought out by the team doing these."
"**Updated on 11/8/2019After two weeks of use, the stickup cam couldn't connect to my wifi extender while all my other devices are perfectly fine, including 3 other security outdoor devices.Tried to reset the stickup cam but it couldn't connect to Ring 53 for setup, called technical support who instructed me to press the orange button for 25 seconds, finally the cam completed update, I was so happy to put it back up outside the garage, however, it lost connection with the wifi extender again, though still can do live view, but no motion alert.At this point, I am disappointed and had spent enough time on this product, pack it up and return.  Hope Ring will improve the product so I will purchase again.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Easy to install and connected to my wifi in no time, the only problem is that the location of this camera is on the outside wall of my garage, far from my Internet modem/router, RSSi reading was 68-77, sometimes is hard to get it online.  With the help of a wifi extender, I can improve the RSSI to 53 and now it works well.There's a few seconds delay in reporting event or bringing it up to live view, but not a big problem for me.This is the 2nd day after installation, so far so good, no problem at all.  Battery during the day with solar panel is about 100%, will drop about 1% or less per hour after sundown, depends on usage I think.This is an update of my review.  On the 3rd day, there are two event recording had a completely black screen, cannot see anything but the letter ‘ring’ on the left side of the screen.  There were also two events that had no alert or recording, that’s when my husband went in and out of the garage, there might be more missed event/alert that I didn’t know of.Called Ring technical support, the technician just kept saying what she wanted to say, may be she was just reading her instruction manual, she didn’t listen closely to what I was trying to tell her.  She asked me to delete and reinstalled the Ring app, unplug and reset my router, there’s nothing wrong with my WiFi signal, all my other devices were working well.  Finally, I ran out of patience and asked for her supervisor, her supervisor asked me to take the camera down from the outside wall and reset it as a new device again, then it’s working, no more missing alert, however, the Motion Snooze function doesn’t work on the app, it says unavailable because Alert was turned off, but the alert was on.  They couldn’t figure out why, this function is not important to me, so I didn’t want to spend more time on this issue.Technical support was not very good, first of all, the back ground was very noisy with many people talking, connection was bad with static noise on and off.  I asked why it’s so noisy at the background, then she did some adjustment and there was less background noise, I think she had her phone on speaker.  The technician was not knowledgeable and not familiar with the product, it was a waste of time talking to her.Today is the 4th day of use, found out that the recorded event footage takes a long time to process, need to wait at least a minute or more before you can view it, kind of inconvenient when you want to see what just happened right away, at least it should show a short preview of the event like other security cameras do.Also, the sensitivity cannot be adjusted, even I move the sensitivity bar and the blue area becomes smaller, but it still alert me of an event when someone is walking outside of the blue area.  Again, I don’t want to waste anymore time talking to their technical support, will give it few more days and see how it is."
"When I first got this it was excellent now it’s been exactly a year and last time I went to change the battery it was damp inside. I let it dry out and some days it works other’s nothing works. It tells me it’s my WiFi but everything else I own Ring Doorbell, My Q and Blink all when fine. Also not at all happy about how Ring keeps removing free options and charging them to paid options. Next outdoor camera will NOT BE A RING."
"I can understand not being continuous video recording when on battery alone but when connected to solar or outlet, the software should allow for continuous video.If I had known there wouldn't be continuous video, I would have just installed my already bought night owl system that is a stand alone and completely enclosed system without fees to pay.The whole point of my desire for battery cameras was so I wouldn't have to run wires everywhere."
"The camera quality itself was pretty good but for you to use it in a wireless sense, the battery lasted 48 hours the most. The first one I got lasted 24 hours. If you get it, prepare to buy a solar panel or hardwire connection. I returned mine and got another doorbell. Battery is really good in the doorbell."
"sadly, this product has 2 weaknesses that may make it useless.1) it only has a weakish 2.4Ghz antenna. I have an Eero signal booster 25 feet from this camera and it is always alerting me to poor signal stregnth. How much closer can I get to it??LOL! Someone needs to tell amazon that it is 2024 and 5ghz iz the norm.2) as noted in many online community complaints, you cannot rotate the video image, which means the camera MUST be installed upright. So, you cannot install under a soffit or other space without using a convoluted mount. Sadly, this is just laziness on amazon's part. It has nothing to do with the camera, since the video is on a server. AWS needs to address that..."
"I have several ring cameras installed already outside my home. It's been a frustrating and dissatisfying experience to say the least. While I won't go into the many, many issues I've had with my system overallI will point out a few very specific ones related to this camera. I'm an IP network engineer with over 25 years experience and fully understand every aspect of how these cameras work and interact with the cloud. So for starters, if you are going to pair this camera with the solar panel for charging, take my advice and install the camera and solar panel first, connect them to each other THEN scan the barcode that came with the camera and add it to your system. If you charge the battery and add the camera before connecting the solar panel, the camera comes up in ""battery"" mode. The alerts are so limited I was literally standing in front of the camera maybe 10 feet away and waving my arms and it wouldn't alert. Think of your phone when it goes into power save mode for low battery. The video quality is reduced. Not sure why anyone would want this. But here is the major problem and why this camera gets one star and a bad review. When I installed it and brought it online and adjusted the settings to my liking, it went off line for about 15 minutes to update it's firmware. So no alerts, no ability to do a live view, when you try the app tells you to wait until it's done updating. OK I get that, updates are release and need to be installed. I've now had this camera working for about 5 days and every single frigging day, it goes off line and updates it's firmware. When I do a health check with app it tells me the firmware is up to date, but despite this, like clock work, it goes off line and updates again the next day. Another issue I don't like... I have serveral other stick up battery camera with solar panels outside, they all have the same settings and status information when I access them through the app. Not this one. The status shows similar but different information. Obviously RING has changed or switched who makes these things for them and they just don't operate the same as ones I installed a year ago. Overall, RING is a cheap and easy alternative to a true professional grade wired system. You get the convenience of a somewhat easier installation and some decent features but the trade off is a quirky, unreliable system that misses events, freezes while recording, and often is totally undependable when you try to do a live view. For example you hear a noise outside and go to access the camera in that area to live view what is happening. More often than not, the system times out and comes back with ""streaming error"" and by the time you actually connect, what ever alerted you is gone. I actually contacted Ring tech support and told them I ran a wireshark capture of my home internet connection and every time the a camera timed out, it was because the RING ""cloud"" system and network failed to respond. Their support didn't know what to say other than give me a bunch of lip service about how they could work with me to fix it. Really, when the problem is your cloud servers failing to respond or even sometimes records videos for hours, how is working with me going to fix that? We are in the process of building a new home and you can bet for sure I will not install a RING system and will go with a true professional grade system that is hard wired."
"Update 8-18-24Useless now. Won't stay connected to wifi. App says camera online, but no live view, says not connected to wifi. From 10pm to 5 am nothing captured on camera, and I have dogs, there is no way not one of them went outside. It's been offline more than online, and I'm sick of rebooting, resetting everything just to have it work for an hour and die again. I will not call Ring Tech support, there is nothing they can tell me to do that I have not already done, they are foreign speaking and difficult to understand. I will do research on a different brand to replace this one.  So frustrating.The one I bought in Feb. Dies in July.  Warranty replacement lasted 6 days and same issue, would not connect to wifi. Brought inside house, unplugged and let sit overnight.  Connect next morning and has been working all day,  inside the house. I'm afraid to put outside until weather cools. Sure, it's Arizona, and stupid hot,  but even in shade all day I except it to work more efficiently.  Love my indoor stick up I've had for couple years, no problems at all."
It's nice to have but it doesn't always pick up movement 10-15 feet in Front of it. What I mean when I say that is I won't get a notification that something is moving and it won't record unless I manually hit the live button. The picture is decently sharp and the mic and speaker work really well. If you need this for security I would look around for something a bit more consistent BUT people do notice the camera and thatight be all you need.
battery  gone  so  qucikly.  Need  a  replacement  of  this  item
"This is truly hard to believe but what was Ring thinking when they designed the way this camera mounts to the wall or ceiling ?Its not adjustable at all ! There is no means of adjusting left, right, up or down.  Who doesn't need to adjust the angle for the camera to fit their own situation ?  They not only don't tell you this in the description they actually show a picture of the camera tilted down on a wall !So now I have to get creative to make their product do what it should have been designed to do. Ring Royally screwed this up and should halt distribution of this product till its fixed or at least warn Amazon shoppers its not adjustable and remove misleading statements like ""versatile mounting options"" and misleading photos. Shame on Ring.11/26/2024  UPDATE  To be fair folks, after I made my own modifications to Rings camera so I could aim it where I wanted, the camera itself does work very well, nice picture day or night, motion activation also works well and you can easily edit the area where motion will be detected. Probably the best part is the Ring operating system app. Its very well done and tells you everything that's going on with the camera. How much battery life is left, how good the WIFI connection is, snippets of video for review when motion is detected. Very satisfied with it otherwise."
"We purchased the Ring Stick Up to see if its motion detection worked better than the one from the Ring Video Doorbell which we purchased first and were disappointed by.Like the Ring Video Doorbell, the picture quality is very good, but the motion detection is terrible. Even at maximum sensitivity, detection of persons more than nine feet away is unreliable.EDIT 01-DEC-2024Further observations after a few months of use. Wi-fi reception is on the weak side. You cannot place the camera too far from your router (or an extender such as the Chime Pro) or the video quality will suffer.On the software side, a big disappointment is that you cannot currently create different rules for different motion zones. For example, you cannot request to always record video whenever a motion is detected but only raise an alert if a person is detected in a specific area. I would like to record whenever someone walks in front of the house, but only raise an alert if someone gets very close. That's not possible."
"Was this meant to be installed by a miniature robot or something? It’s ridiculous. I have dropped five of the screws never to be found again. I ended up installing it without the screws. Picture quality is basic. I expected a lot more. I love the convenience of it, however. There just has to be something better."
"We put this camera over our garage and waited 6 weeks before posting a review in hopes that was long enough to give an accurate analysis. This camera is just OK, not great by any means. The speaker is awful, you can't understand what the person on the other end is saying and it breaks up like a cellphone in a dead zone. Plus, a person walking up is almost to our garage door before the Ring app even notifies us of movement, which is not quick enough in our opinion. And yes, we changed the settings on the App so the motion was more frequent and sensitive in hopes it would notify us sooner of ANY motion, it stayed exactly the same. The camera does stay charged thanks to the solar panel we purchased separately, along with having to purchase, separately, an extra long cable so the camera and solar panel can plug into one another. I just love the way Ring nickle and dimes you until you have all the necessities required to get going.  I guess it's better than not having a camera at all but that's really not saying much. We also bought the Ring doorbell at pretty much the same time and that speaker also sucks. I think we are done purchasing Ring products."
"I purchased the Ring Stick Up Battery Camera two weeks ago and was initially happy with the quality and battery life. Unfortunately, the camera stopped working last night and now won’t connect to any of my Wi-Fi networks. Customer support confirmed it’s a hardware issue, so I have to replace it—disappointing for such a new product."
"I live on a main road in the city and the camera tends to pick and choose when it wants to notify you, meaning a car could go by and it will go off saying “someone is at my front door” or when it doesn’t go off when someone brings a package to my doorstep, it’s a 50/50 chance it cat he’s someone going by. And if it doesn’t “catch” it or if it doesn’t notify you then the footage is not saved."
"This camera claims to provide 1080p video. It looks more like video that was shot with a potato. The video quality is horrendous! If someone breaks into your house there is NO chance of identifying them from the video taken with this cam.**Update** The company contacted me and acknowledged the video quality was poor. They said my internet connection was good and it was probably because the scene was too busy and the camera couldn't process it. They offered a discounted ""upgrade"" to a more expensive camera. Really?"
I bought the camera to watch a bird in its nest.  Set up is very straight forward and works well but over night the battery was depleted.  I charged it to 99% and started using the camera about 5:00 PM but by 6:30 AM the next morning I received a warning that the battery was at 10%.  I'll try it again - maybe I have a defective battery?
"Only seems to pick up motion when I don’t need it to. Lol. Does not seem to be picking up the wild animals in my yard at night while I am sleeping. My settings are correct. I have the night vision on, etc. I have one facing patio area and the other facing my bird feeder area. In the morning when I get up and go outside; my suet feeder is torn down, my fountain in the water dish is messed up, animal fur on my patio furniture, etc. But; the cameras never turn on to capture these things happening????? If I open the door at 10pm to let my dogs out to go potty; it captures that. But it can’t capture anything chilling on my patio furniture at 2am or tearing down my suet feeder? It also keeps capturing my flag’s movement; but not a raccoon or skunk I guess. I’ll be buying a different brand soon. I’ve already purchased a 3rd one of these and on my 2nd doorbell one. Hence why they have so many refurbished ones for sale. Not sure why they have such good ratings. They are far from good. Even my doorbell camera is crap. Only picks up motion 50% of the time even though settings are all good."
"We've had an original Ring doorbell for several years now and had to get thru the various quirks with that product. We had a lot of fun with the initial novelty of it and it was handy to have. It also brought us a good sense of security knowing that the device was there to keep an eye on our home.Ring replaced the first unit once the camera became defective within the first year, so that was nice. But to this day it's still very inconsistent as far as the connectivity. Can never tell if Live View will work. Our brand new router is only about 20 feet from it, we have the fastest internet and a brand new modem. We've been thru several modems and routers over the years as we constantly upgrade to have the best tech. Still, dealing with the same issues.So back to the Stick Up Cam. The motion detection works pretty decent. The picture quality is pretty decent. However, the Live View again on this unit is just come and go. We've tried the other app, the Rapid Ring app, and what's funny is when the Live View on one unit is working, the other typically won't. $30 a year for each unit to use the recording capabilities, wish there was a subscription to make the dang Live View dependable.The setup for these units is also very frustrating. When you have to try several times to connect the unit, even when the connection strength is good, you know there's something going on. No reason it should take 5 times to go thru setup in the same location with the same connection settings before it is willing to complete.We really wanted to like this Ring system but when it comes time to upgrade down the line, if there are better options, we will definitely consider them."
"I enjoyed this camera for a few months but when our wifi got upgraded at home, it stopped working because they are not compatible with 5ghz. I called support and they told me to downgrade my wifi, which I did not thing was helpful."
"My complaint with this camera is the 15fps (frames per second).  For anyone moving faster than a very slow pace walk, facial details will be a blur.  Police were unable to use multiple videos of trespassers coming up to my door and windows because they were walking fast (not running, just walking fast).  All facial details were too blurred to be useful.  I returned these Ring Stick Up cameras and purchased the Ring Stick Up Pro cameras.  I think the Pro cameras are even worse and I will be returning those as well and going with a different brand."
I can only hang it upside down in its current location. I figured I would invert the image in the software like I do with my home theater projector. No such luck. Ring isn’t that sophisticated yet.**Update: A Ring rep reached out to me and told me about a bracket that can be purchased to turn the camera over (right-side up). Not an ideal solution but I bumped my review from 2-star to 3-star because Ring made an effort to help resolve my issue. Ring does offer cameras that allow for image inversion but this model of stick-up cam does not.**
"Have several Ring cameras, doorbell (powered), indoor cameras, and now three of this battery camera with solar panel. The newest one died within 30 days of purchase, and after going through Ring support, they initiated a return/exchange through them. Bad move on my part! I sent the broken camera back as I usually do with Amazon (before receiving the replacement), but am now told it will be at least 6 weeks until the replacement will even ship. So I am out a camera with no recourse for 6 weeks. Lousy warranty support, and apparently this is not a new issue.I'll update this if Ring somehow resolves this in a much more timely manner, but otherwise my review of 3 stars is based on the camera dying so soon and Ring not being able to adequately provide a good customer with a replacement camera in a reasonable time frame."
"The product is packed well, arrived on time, and easy to install. However, the signal strength is not strong even after adding a bridge. But I have other cameras from other vendors that work fine without any signal problem. So, I have to conclude Ring devices are not particularly strong receivers or emitters, beware. No false alarms so far, but will update if there are any issues. Love it so far even though it keeps saying wifi signals are weak, which are not. other vendor cameras are working fine."
This is a very poor camera for outdoors.  1. It does NOT lock on mount.  2.  Unlike the doorbell camera it does not have wider view to scroll to while on live.  I would not recommend.  I wanted an adjustable angle to the camera without a light but i don’t like this for reasons stated above.
I wanted this camera so I could keep check on the exterior of my home but you have to have  paid RING monitoring to use the feature of looking at past events.
"I live out in the country. I purchased this camera to be able to see my back door/back porch, mainly for night time or when I'm away from the house.The ""evolution"" of this purchase:1. Purchased the camera ($100).2. After reading more reviews about poor battery life, I purchased the Ring solar panel charger, also (another $50).3. After getting poor wi-fi connection at multiple locations that I tried on the back porch, a few days later I purchased the Ring Chime Pro wi-fi extender, too (yet another $50).Performance of the camera/solar panel/Chime Pro combo:Camera did not work reliably without the Ring Chime Pro wi-fi extender. Performance is much improved connecting via the Ring Chime Pro. The solar panel - even though it is in the shade for about half the day - has no problem keeping the camera battery fully charged (consistently at 99-100% battery charge).The good:Convenience and easy installation of being wireless;Great quality video;Excellent night vision also;Solar charger works well;Ring Chime Pro works well as wi-fi range extenderThe not so good:Had to purchase the wi-fi extender for this camera to get close to being reliable, even though other wi-fi devices worked just fine at those locations where I have the camera installed;Camera motion triggering not very sensitive and has only very limited adjustment (no ""zone"" setup like other Ring devices). I have to walk within 10 feet of the camera for it to trigger on my movement;LiveView is still only about 50% operational, even with a confirmed strong and fast wi-fi signal at that location - sometimes it will show live view, sometimes it will not.Ring Chime Pro wi-fi extender does work well (after having to be on the phone to the help desk for almost an hour to get it to work initially) , but it is very sensitive to its own location - moving it just a short distance from one electrical outlet to another only a few feet away made a huge difference in performance. Because of that, it ended up having to be in a less than desirable location in the house in order to function properly.Software seems pretty clunkly overall. It has a calendar function so you can enable/disable motion alerts, but only one on/off cycle per day. So I end up having to remember to manually turn alerts on and off so I'm not getting constant alerts when I'm at home and walking directly under the device. Plus, it can take up to a minute to show either LiveVIew (when that works at all) or a recent recording. I imagine that time would seem much longer when you hear that ""bump in the middle of the night.""Oh, and the $3 monthly minimum charge to Ring to be able to see your recorded video. No way to save your own video recording without the subscription.Overall, I'm pretty unimpressed. The two main functions I was looking for are unreliable; It won't detect motion at my back door from about 18 feet away, and LiveView operation only works sometimes.Bottom line: If you're looking for a toy to play with, this works fine. If you want something to help with your security, I'd advise you to look elsewhere."
It was easy to set up. Works fine. But if u don’t buy the subscription it’s only good to view live.  It does notify you as well but u have to look live.  It doesn’t save anything.  Maybe for $50 ok but u get almost nothing for $99. I don’t want to subscribe to everything.
"These are Gen 3 cameras, and the Gen 1 cameras I have do a better job of picking up motion. The camera recording my driveway doesn't slways pick up a vehicle pulling into the garage fron 5 feet away. I have had ring cameras for years so I know how to set and adjust them. Not very impressed with the Gen 3."
I have had this camera for 3 days. I will say the quality is great. The issue I am having the last two days is my battery only last one day. I have had it for 3 days and I have had to charge it twice. Not impressed with the battery option may just stick to wireless.
Have been using ring cams for years.  These new ones batteries have to be changed after about 10 days even with solar panel attached. In the sunny south.  Possibly defective.
"I have had 2 Ring battery operated cameras installed on the exterior of my home since October 2019.  Thankfully I have not had any attempted break-ins at my home, as I only recently discovered the cameras will only record for 30 seconds from the moment it detects motion (20 seconds for cameras activated since March 2020).  And I only detected this when a contractor drive down my driveway, parked and walked to my front door.  The camera did its job and started recording when it detected the vehicle on the driveway, but by the time the contractor exited his vehicle, walked to and rang the door, and my wife walked to and opened the door, Ring had already been recording for 27 seconds.  So, imagine the same scenario and the person, after exchanging pleasentries assaults my wife; there would have no recording, as the 30 seconds of recording would have ended.I jumped on the internet to determine how I could lengthen the recording time, even at the expense of battery life.  After all, I had already bought an extra battery as the promoted battery life is a farce.  I discovered something called a ""Ring Community,"" where Ring consumers can ask product questions and Ring ""Community Managers"" allegedly act as a go-between between the customer and Ring developers.  I discovered that this issue was raised by a number of Ring customers starting back in July 2019, who have since become very unsatisfied Ring customers, and now some are ex-Ring customers.  Despite the Community Managers' standard line of, ""Rest assured that us moderators are reviewing every new post and reply as they come in,  ... and take your feedback seriously,"" they ABSOLUTELY DO NOT CARE about customer satisfaction.  If they did, they would listen and enable the customer to set the record time, certainly well beyond 30 seconds. Instead, Ring spent months modifying their software to do the exact opposite; now customers have the ability to REDUCE the record time.  What break-in occurs within a time period of LESS THAN 30 seconds?  Ring customers who have been victims of break-ins have been among those who have provided feedback to Ring within Ring's ""Ring Community,"" expressing the need for longer recording ability.  But all Ring has done is attempt to pacify with their same propaganda that they take customer feedback seriously, and have achieved nothing but infuriating those who have spent their money on a very inferior product.  Eleven (11) months have passed since the complaints about the inadequate recording time began within the ""Ring Community;"" and Ring has done nothing positive to improve their cameras.If you are in the market for a ""security"" camera that will actually record the full range of activity of a visitors with questionable intentions DO NOT buy a Ring camera.  You may be temporarily satisfied with its abilities, like I was, up to the point where you realize it won't be there for you when you actually need it!  A number of people on the aforementioned ""Ring Community"" thread regarding the recording length have determined that a battery operated camera called ""Arlo"" allows the user to determine the recording length.  I have not yet investigated the ""Arlo"" camera, but plan to.  $230 down the drain, but live and learn.  For safety reasons and terrible customer service I'd give it a ZERO if I could.  So, save your money and your sanity and stay as far away from a Ring camera as possible."
"I love Amazon and Expected So Much Better performance from and Amazon Company Product. I am very disappointed in this Ring product because now I learn that I can’t set up a simple Mode Schedule  to Arm the cameras at Night and disarm in the morning. It explains in Help how to do this very simply - goto Mode Schedule- but that selection does not exist in the Ring App for Cameras. I called customer service and after an hour of searching the poor service rep said that the Mode Schedule feature is Only in the Ring Alarm System. Excuse me but this is a huge ripoff where I now have 3 cameras and numerous Echo’s but I can’t turn ON/OFF or Schedule in a simple direct way using Alexa or the Ring App. I love Amazon but this needs to be fixed.Im adding disappointment to my original negative review. I would like to use Mode Scheduling to turn all three cameras on at night-Home Mode and off in the morning - Disarmed. It explained how to do this in Ring Help But Mode Scheduling choice does not exist on the menu. You can control the motion sensing on each camera but this is very inefficient. I just want to Arm and Disarm the whole system, which I can do manually if/when I think of it But this is something that should be easily automated. I’m very disappointed in the Amazon Product which can and should be fixed with a Ring App update.I’m still trying to figure out how to use my stick up cameras effectively. All I want to do is turn them off and on using Alexa and apparently this function is not supported by Ring or Alexa.Alexa does support Live View, so I have learned which is fine but every time I take the dog out we get an alert which starts to get old. So I can use Alexa to Show me front camera but not to Turn Off or Snooze or Turn On. So I can’t do that with Voice or by creating an Alexa Routine. This is a real disappointment and I hope Amazon will consider programming this feature just like it does for lights, locks (with code) and all other Smart Home devices. Until then it makes the use of these cameras very clunky. As far as using the Ring App to set schedules. That is also pretty clunky. I can set a Schedule on each camera separately by digging down into the menu, then I have to dig down in the menu to view each schedule. This is very inconvenient, hard to update and easy to forget. At the very least the Schedules should be viewable and modifiable on the dashboard.Sadly, I am not very happy with these Ring Stickup battery cameras from Amazon and I Love Everything Amazon so I’m going to keep them and hope for improvements in the programming department."
I have a ring doorbell cam that I love. Purchased a battery stick up cam for back of my home and it worked for 24 hrs then nothing  Disappointed!
"I have 1 wired and 2 battery powered Ring outdoor cameras that I really like. So I thought this stick up camera would be a good idea for indoors facing the patio and garage doors. And it was very easy to set up and recorded great videos. But it requires being recharged every few days, unlike my  other two with rechargeable batteries. After 2 weeks of having to do that I returned it."
"There is no - zero - information on how to contact tech support on my account page.  Only an obscure icon in the lower corner of the web page for a Chat session.  Finally getting a chat going, the person could not help me, referred me to a phone number.  After a half hour of getting nowhere, they hung up on me.  Had to call in again and start over.  After an hour, was told the feature I was looking for (and probably the best feature in the app) had been taking out of the app and was never coming back.Add to this, there is constant overbearing advertising the app.  I understand ads in free apps, but I pay a lot of money for the ring service.  If I hadn't paid so much money for these cameras I would throw them in the trash and start over."
"Bought this to replace my old stick up cam. Ring made so many changes to the Ring cam that it wasn't a simple swap.  The mounting was changed and the new mount is very limited in aiming the cam.  Ring also changed the power cable to the camera.  The new power cable has an angled connector which did not fit through hole that I fed the old power cord, so I had to enlarge it.  The directions were basically hieroglyphics which was hard to understand and so small I had to get a magnifier to see anything.  No indication on the instructions to ""SLIDE"" the mounting bracket off.  So I had to perform an install almost from scratch instead of a simple replacement. Terribly disappointed.  The only advantage with Ring is its lower cost."
"Product is extremely well-made with intuitive application setup and assembly. However my unit probable has a defected battery or expired shelf life. In the process of debugging ... I replaced a larger Ring solar unit (charge much faster), added a wifi extender to bring Ring device wifi status to GREEN. Battery is 46% about 10PM and it's completely dead around 2AM with no alert activities. The next night is the same, I am certain that the battery is not holding charge or the camera itself is draining the power, either way is bad. I had requested the Amazon replacement but the shipping latency is a few weeks indicated by Amazon shipping note which is kind of long for today standard. I hope Ring can step in to rush the replacement, I also have the Ring doorbell installed last year and it works flawlessly from day one, that's the reason I bought Ring cam after reviewing several other products but a little dissappointed this time."
This camera is okay. I only bought it because I didn’t want to pay for another subscription for my arlo camera (which is way better btw) only to find out that in order to keep using this I still had to pay for another subscription outside of the one I already pay for for the doorbell! These companies are so full of it wanting to charge for EVERYTHING! I would’ve kept the other had I known it seeming as it had way better video footage and even picked up when a car was passing by! Take your chances I guess! I gave three stars due to the fact that I now have to pay $80 a year for two dang cameras!
"I logged onto to see my cameras today only to find out that you need a subscription to view past footage without the subscription. You can only see the live footage and it doesn’t save anything.. It’s about $10 we paid it, but then we realized that it deleted all of our past footage. I’m very upset and didn’t know if I knew I would have to pay more for cameras already paid an arm and leg for I wouldn’t have bought these cameras so save yalls money."
"UPDATE 9/13/20What I feared - and predicted - would  happen came to pass. Last Friday, 9/11/20, my landlord called me and asked me to review the footage on my cameras because another tenant had seen someone on the premises behaving suspiciously. I checked my Blink Mini app on my cell phone and sure enough.NOTHING.As usual, the cameras had STOPPED WORKING the night before sometime around midnight. As a result, there was nothing recorded during the day on Friday. Nothing.A few days earlier, I spoke to Amazon who said that, since the 30 day window had passed, there was nothing they could do. They suggested I deal directly with Blink, even though Bling is OWNED BY AMAZON, supposedly. I called Blink ""tech support"" (laughable) at the number the Amazon rep gave me.I wound up wasting 35 minutes with a woman who knew nothing about the Blink system, could barely speak English, and whose background sounded like she was rattling pots and pans in her kitchen. She asked me to hold a few times and, so help me, it sounded like all she was doing was rattling things around to give the appearance that she was actually doing something.As I've mentioned before, the Blink Mini cameras UTTERLY FAIL at their primary, stated, function: to provide you peace of mind relative to home security. Neither Amazon nor Blink will be of any help to you in getting your issue resolved and the only thing you will have accomplished it to waste your money.It's too late for me but if you are considering purchasing this system, I advise you in the strongest possible terms to look elsewhere. You may want to shop at Costco since they have a very liberal return policy.I hope people get to read this review since it appears Amazon has obscured many one-star reviews from site and only a few show up on the Blink Mini page. Do not waste your money on this camera.UPDATE 9/2/20I received an email on 7/28/20 from a Blink employee named Haitham. In part, he wrote:""I would like to clarify that we are fully aware of this issue where the camera will stay on the night mode and not fully recognize that it has to switch to the day mode, and that will mostly happen in the early morning once the sun rises. We are working one the fix and it should come automatically to your camera. In the meantime as a work around, you may need to schedule disarming the system in the early morning and arm it back right after.""As of today, ZERO has happened.I want to be clear that the Blink mini camera can be a genuine hazard to your well being because of this issue. It simply goes off a ledge around midnight and NEVER wakes up unless you remember to wake it. This means you could be away from home and be burglarized. You think you're covered because you have the Blink camera system only to discover that it has recorded absolutely nothing.The worst case scenario is you and your family go out to dinner. While you're out, intruders get into your home. Since the camera stopped working at midnight yesterday, you are completely unaware you have unwelcome guests until you return home and walk in on them.In short, this system poses a danger to your well being because it fails in its stated purpose. Since Blink has done nothing to correct this problem, which is purely software based, you will be taking your chances by purchasing this system.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I purchased a two-pack of the Blink Mini. What attracted me was the low cost of the item. They were $35 each or the two-pack for $65. Turns out I might just as well have taken $65 and thrown it out the window. Of a moving car.I only set up one camera by a window, looking out through the glass. I was very happy to see that the motion sensing worked and it should have since all it's doing is noting changing pixels. I was also happy to see that the microphone was sensitive enough to pick up what was being said on the other side of a dual-paned window.However, for some reason the camera decided to stop working or, more specifically, to stop sensing and recording motion. I first noticed this when I fired up the Blink app and noticed that all the clips were tagged ""Yesterday"" and none from ""Today"".It turns out that, for some reason, the camera seems to decide that its work is done sometime around midnight. Beyond that, it will NOT record ANY video UNLESS I proactively disarm and re-arm the motion sensing on the camera via the app. Alternatively, I can do a ""Live"" view to see what the camera is seeing, also through the app. Both of these actions have the effect of seeming to ""wake"" the camera up to a new day. From that point on, it will continue working as normal. Until midnight. At that point the whole process begins again.Another odd thing is that it records video - when it decides to actually work - only for a specified period of time, between 5 and 30 seconds. It OUGHT to work like motion sensing lights that turn on and remain on for a specified period of time BUT will stay lit if it continues to sense motion. These cameras should continue recording if the motion they detected continues or resumes within the designated video clip length. In other words, if you set a clip length of 15 seconds and 12 seconds into it the motion resumes, it should keep recording until there is no motion.The point of these cameras is to be able to set them up and forget about them until you are notified it senses motion. In this regard, the system is a complete failure. I tried power cycling the camera by physically disconnecting it from the power supply then reconnecting. Nothing. I tried deleting the camera from the app and re-installing it. Nothing. It's got nothing to do with the app because it has no physical connection to the camera. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and all the camera settings I had previously set were still intact, so it ain't the app.As a last resort I did the unthinkable: I called ""tech support"". What I got was a call center somewhere in the Philippines and one of those maddeningly persistently cordial persons who is anything BUT ""tech support"".  I finally just let him believe he actually helped me and ended the call.So here I am without a functional camera system and, of course, well past the return date. The bottom line here is that this system, ostensibly meant to alert you if there is an intrusion into your home, simply CANNOT be relied upon for that purpose. Your home could be broken into and you would be none the wiser. You would be much better off to do your research and purchase a system that, while potentially more expensive, will at least serve its stated purpose. This one does not."
"I bought this to use as a baby monitor, thinking if the quality was good I would end up purchasing an outdoor set as well. I got it in this afternoon, and set up was super easy. The picture quality is excellent for the price point.The main issue for me is that there is no option for continuous viewing. The live view from the app will automatically shut off after 30 seconds if you don't tap the ""continue?"" prompt. If I had known this ahead of time, I would have never purchased a Blink camera. I watch my daughter on a Fire tablet while I work at night, and it's really not feasible to stop typing every 30 seconds to press a button.Maybe it's my fault for not realizing it, but I don't remember reading any information about the length of viewing time, so I assumed it would be like the Foscam I had sought to replace. If Blink ever adds an update for continuous viewing, I would repurchase in a heartbeat, but for now, I'm sending it back."
"I pre-ordered 4 cameras without any reviews having been posted, so I hope that this helps someone.  First off, the cameras are pretty nice, very easy to setup and get connected and the price is just about perfect.  The app is where things start to fall apart.  It clearly was created for the other Blink cameras that are battery dependent, so most of the quirks/problems I found are probably necessary for battery savings on the other Blink cameras.  I have had cameras for well over ten years and have gone through several different apps/programs to access and store the video but I have never had an app that did NOT allow me to view all of my cameras at the same time. This one requires you to select a single camera and activate it individually to view real time video.  I assume that this was designed for battery savings, but since these cameras are always on, it now serves no purpose.  Additionally, not having the ability to view all of my cameras, while activated in a single 4 pane window seems a step in the wrong direction.  For years I have been able to see live feeds in a multi-pane format and select the camera I want to zoom in on that one, not with this app.Second, tech support is, at best, not good.  I contacted them regarding the IR light that apparently can NOT be turned off (although you can turn it off via the app for the other Blink cameras?!) and the support tech actually stated that he did not know anything about these cameras and had to ask someone else.  That was a first for me.  The IR light is probably not a big deal for most, but I have for years had an indoor camera pointed out a window since my front yard is pretty well lit at night and the IR light stuck in the ON position make that impossible.I never review anything, but I wanted to get the word out on this.  I suspect that these cameras were kind of rushed and the app just re-purposed, so it my sincere hope that they will address the live view concerns in future app updates specific to Blink Mini owners.  Soon I hope!!!!  Here's to hoping!Update:  I was contacted by Blink following regarding my review.  They indicated that multiple people had voiced similar concerns about the apps real-time capabilities and they made it sound like they were developing an update to the app to address this.  They also offered to send me an additional camera (an older model) that does allow you to turn off the IR at no charge.  I asked directly if this would be in exchange for changing my review and they specifically did NOT ask me to amend this review.  If nothing else, that is GREAT customer service."
"*I am still in my trial period* I wanted a camera in my lower level apartment for A) piece of mind and B) to make sure my cat is ok when I am gone for a night or two. The camera does what I need it to do...I can check using the live feed to make sure everything is ok.The sound quality is just not there. I have an automatic feeder that talks when it goes off and I can't hear anything because of this loud, continuous humming type sound so I almost never watch my motion clips with sound on, there's just no point. Even setting up the camera you couldn't hear myself or my fiance talking, it was so muffled.The motion activation is horribly frustrating and I have gone through every setting in Blink and Alexa. My fiance has a Ring and his doesn't do any of this. One day my camera will go off each time it switches to day/night mode but the next day it won't. I have left it in ""alarm"" mode and walked into my apartment and up and down my hall, into the kitchen with no notification until I actually just stopped. Then I got a motion notification and it caught the usual amount of time but it was the last few moments of my time in there...not the initial entrance or walking around. So...if this was a security camera, not very helpful. One day my cat can be on the couch and it will notify me when she gets down and moves around...the next day she can be on the couch, hours later I will check in and she will have moved into the bedroom but I never got a notification she was up and walking around. It lags, skips around, or doesn't record anything often. My fiance doesn't ever seem to have any of these issues with his Ring camera so it's just more frustration of usefulness than anything.I didn't expect a whole lot but I expected bare minimum notifications and I don't get that. I don't think I'll be moving forward with a subscription."
"Review updated after 3 months:My original review is below.  I mentioned that these cameras make a nice toy, but are not good if you are looking for a home security camera.  I've had the cameras 3 months now and the motion detection on one of them stopped working. It would either continuously detect motion so it filled up my storage, or it would not detect any at all, making it unusable for anything other than live viewing (which is very glitchy and doesn't always work either).I contacted support via e-mail. I told them I had tried various debugging things: unplugging the camera, moving it, verifying the network could reach it, etc.  They asked me in e-mail to unplug it (which I had already done), and then asked me to do a hard reset, neither of which fixed it.  After a few more e-mails with different support people, they again asked me to do a hard reset. I told them they already asked me to do that, and could they just please replace the unit, and they said ""Well try it again and let's see what happens,"" which I did.  I again re-iterated everything I did told them that resetting it didn't work.  They then replied and asked me to move it to verify the network connectivity. This was after almost 2 weeks of e-mail exchanges back-and-forth, and finally I got frustrated and decided to just stop using the units and find something that works better.Original review--------I got this system primarily to monitor a pet at home while I am at work, which it is good for.  I've deployed and managed professional security video systems at large and small companies, and if you are looking for something to serve as a security camera, you should choose a different system.The Good:  It's a very inexpensive system. The cameras can be moved around very easily they take very little effort to set up and configure.  You could use one to watch a living room one day, and a back yard the next day if you like.  The video quality is pretty good and the wide-angle camera means that you can cover relatively large areas with just a single camera.  If you get the Sync module, you do not need the subscription service so you can operate this with no monthly fees if you like.  That means for roughly $100 you can have a 2-camera system with absolutely no additional costs.  There are a few caveats to using just the blink module which are described below.  The 2-way voice communication is ok, and it is a fun feature for messing with my dog when I'm not home.  (It does make you sound a little bit like Darth Vader though).  The sync module takes any USB memory stick. I have many of those laying around so I didn't need to buy one.  I have an 8GB USB on it and have been using it for almost a month with 2 cameras and it's only 30% full. I do unplug the cameras when I'm at home, though, so they are not used 24x7.The Bad: The system is very slow.  It takes several seconds to start watching a live stream video or to watch video playbacks.  If you do not use the cloud service, it takes even longer to start video that is stored just on the blink module.  The system will only record a maximum of 30 seconds of video and then it has to wait at least 10 seconds before it will start recording again.  Also, several times it's evident that motion continues beyond the 10 second reset, but it doesn't start recording again until several minutes later.  This means that you can miss critical events in your playback.  About 30-40% of the time when trying to view live video, it gives an error message of ""Playback is not available at this time"" or ""System is currently busy"" or something like that. I believe this has to do with it not being able to record and play back live video at the same time, so if it has started recording a motion event and you want to watch the camera, it won't let you.  In addition, it won't let 2 people try to watch live video at the same time, so if you have multiple members of your household want to use the app at the same time, forget it.  If you use the cloud service, the stored clips will have a picture associated with them so you can easily identify what triggered the movement detection. If you use just the sync module without the cloud service, though, you do not get this image preview. This makes it difficult to identify which clip you may want to watch if you are trying to find a specific event amongst the several stored on your device.  Also, the motion sensitivity does not really seem to work too well.  It keeps triggering with slight changes in shadows even though the sensitivity is turned to the minimum level (i.e. if you have changing light intensity coming into a room through a window due to a car driving by or shadows from a tree, even if the car/tree/window is not in view of the camera). Due to the wide-angle lens, you won't get a lot of very good detail (i.e. facial features, text that is written on things, etc) out of images, but they will be good enough to see what is going on.Bottom line: This is a fun system, but it really is a toy compared to some of the other systems out there. If you are looking for something very low-cost for a non-critical type of usage, then this should be ok."
"I have mixed feeling on the mini Blinks. I have the Blink outdoor units as well as the doorbell, all of which work fine and have done so for a couple of years. In fact I have a few that I have never installed. I ordered the mini's for use indoors to monitor the front door and pets. Unfortunately for some reason they occasions disconnect and require being reset (unplug from the AC and plug back in). This works and sometimes it doesn't. I actually replaced one that I could not get to reconnect even after doing a hard reset and reinstalling thru camera in the app. I had to do this twice and on the third time it went out, I assumed it was the camera and bought two more. After less than a month, the new camera started doing the same thing. I replaced the USB cable and the power block thinking that might be the cause but then it happened again. I did not think it might be the sync unit until the other camera located in another area started doing the same thing (both cameras at the same time). I unplugged the Sync unit and waited and they started working again, but I did this previously when the first camera went out before buying a new one. It's not my network or location of the camera (distance from the sync unit) since I am in a small Condo and each camera is less than 30 feet away from where the sync unit is right next to the router.My next step will be to replace the sync unit, but my patience and satisfaction with the Blink mini product is wearing very thin. The App could also use some work, as it is very basic and very disappointing that they have not made many upgrades in terms of features. How difficult would it be to add a feature to allow your cameras to arm automatically at a preset time like even the ridiculously name Chinese branded products that I wouldn't trust.I'm not at a point where I want to abandon the product completely since I have so much invested in it, with many cameras between my house and condo. Like I said the outdoor units have worked flawlessly, despite having given me low battery warnings on occasions, yet they are still operating without any issues after several years of being deployed. I don't arm them that often and they are not designed to be armed all the time, otherwise the battery will be dead after a few days due to movement.  They are great for monitoring door activity where there should be none.With the issues I've experienced with the mini's so far, it is hard for me to recommend them, particularly since I bought new cameras for what appears to be no reason at all. The next time the stop working and the LED starts flashing, I'll replace the sync unit, but after that, the mini's will go in the trash as well as the Blink reputation. They are too unreliable for monitoring activity indoors particularly your front door when it is connected directly to AC and can be used continuously without having to worry about batteries.The image and night vision quality are good, but image rotation is limited. You can flip the image if you mount the camera upside down, but not when the camera is angled. If Blink fixes to connectivity issue between the sync unit and the minis, and includes the ability to for the software to automatic reorient the image so that it always right side up, this would be a great low cost solution for in home monitoring. As it stands, they are unreliable.I'm not going to replace the sync unit pre-emptively, but once the issue reoccurs as it did last week, I'll do so and then wait to see if it happens again. I'll update my review at that time, otherwise I'd suggest using the Blink indoor unit and just connect it to the AC vs. using it indoors on battery power. The mini are small enough not to be an eye sore or immediately noticed. YMMVYMMV"
"Just for a little background info before I give my pros and cons… We have 8 cameras total (3 outdoor and 5 indoor minis). We have them all set up on the same system saving to the sync device that is at a good middle spot in the house by our router and also have the WiFi extended to reach every corner of the 1/2 acre we live on by using an Orbi system. We placed the three cameras in the front of the house and then the inside ones we placed strategically thought the house.Pros: 1. Easy setup: for the most part it was downloading an app and plugging in the indoor cameras and putting batteries in the outdoor ones. Then you scan the QR code and your ready to go.2. Picture quality is pretty good: It automatically switches to night vision when it gets too dark and I can adjust IR intensity to allow the picture quality I want at night. The daytime picture is pretty good up close but you couldn’t use it to see like the license plate of the cars driving by or anything detailed more than a 5-10 feet from the camera.3. You can talk and hear through the cameras: This is a plus but the quality is severely lacking in this area. You can’t talk and hear what they are saying at the same time and when they talk or you talk it seems to cut in and out quite a bit so you miss some of what is said. It is also delayed by at least 3-4 seconds from when it is actually being said to when you hear it on the app.4. The price is good for a starter security system or if you aren’t wanting to pay a lot but still want to catch a burglar or make sure your packages are being delivered properly.5. You can add on cameras if you need more but beware because the sync device doesn’t seem to like to record and save what is happening on more than one camera at a time so if a bird flies by one camera your probably not going to catch the person walking up to your porch on the other camera (or at least not until they are actually on your porch).Cons: 1. Battery life depends on usage which means with heavy winds moving the top of our trees causing the shadows to sway and then the bees and birds that seem to love setting our cameras off we have now replaced the batteries at least once in each of the three outdoor cameras and one of the cameras seems to need replaced each month. You can change the sensitivity setting to help stop some of that but it seems like we didn’t pick up anything including people walking around outside when we went down a setting or two so be prepared to replace a bunch of lithium batteries or not catch what’s happening.2. As I mentioned above the ability to talk to whoever is on the other side of the camera(or just listen in) is lacking quality and consistency!3. The app takes too long to pull up and then you can’t smoothly switch between camera live views(it gives an error message or says the camera is busy) so if you are trying to check in on each camera your either out of luck or will have to close completely out of the app and get back in to try and see the next cameras live view.4. The inconsistent recording is extremely frustrating!! Some days it will alert me to a fly buzzing past or the mailman putting mail in our box, other days though it won’t catch half of what is going on or it will catch it on one camera showing one angle but not on the other one which should have a clearer view of whatever action is happening.5. The Sync module has a spot for a usb memory drive but their blink usb drive filled up way too fast and the other few I tried didn’t seem to record the videos correctly so we couldn’t pull them up on a computer later. Your only other option is to pay each month for the cloud storage that they offer which will allow you to keep unlimited videos for up to 60days.6. Randomly the outdoor cameras will disconnect to my Orbi satellite or router even though they are within feet of them but the indoor cameras will stay connected. I end up having to take the outdoor ones down from where they are mounted and taking the batteries out for a few seconds to get it to reconnect. This is a pain since the cameras are hard to snap back onto the bracket they come with that is permanently attached to the house now.7. Although I put the LED recording status light to off on all the cameras it still comes on whenever it is recording. That’s frustrating when I’m trying to check in on the house and they hear a click and see a red light and know they are being recorded or we are watching.8. Although it has where you can set up a timer for your system to become active or inactive, you have to have all the cameras that are connected to the sync module go with that timer and can’t keep certain ones active all the time with the timer unless you put them on a different system and get another sync module.So basically they are a cheap starter system for someone wanting the basics and not looking for super consistent recording. I wish they were better because we would have added to the cameras we have now but with all the app problems and recording problems we will be finding a different (probably pricier) system to replace these cameras."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            UPDATE - 5/12/20: 3 stars to 2.  The camera cuts out for hours at a time. Essentially half the day there are no activities that trigger the camera. Not sure why the camera is inactive but essentially half the day it is not recording.For instance, Sunday night, the last recorded motion is 11:27 PM. Monday, the first recorded motion is 8:15 PM. Today there’s a lapse between 4:39 AM and 12:17 PM. Someone usually walks by my apartment at least every 10 minutes throughout the day. Very UNRELIABLE for home security. Should be 1 star, but it could be useful to someone as a live view for a 3D printer or something, but no time lapse feature.***** Look elsewhere for home security. I purchased the Yi Dome Cam + and I am extremely happy with that. Plus it has internal MicroSD storage for continuous recording and 360* capability.Note: I have it set to trigger on motion at all times, no scheduled breaks or turn off when I’m home.UPDATE - 4/30/20: 2 stars to 3. The development team has now added an option to turn off the night vision infrared lights. Thank you for being responsive. I still have an issue with the Retrigger time leading to a lapse in event recording, hopefully continuous recording could be an option in the future. Maybe with the combination of the Sync Module 2? Until this feature is added I would not recommend for home security.Original Review - 2 Star:I repeat, DO NOT use for home security. Look elsewhere for a home security solution.This camera is exclusively triggered by motion. While that sounds perfect for a security camera, it is a major downfall of the Blink platform. The camera searches for motion and records at the time it senses motion, and a little before. This is great, however it will only record up to 30 seconds. At this point, the recording stops and the camera has a grace period where it will not trigger due to motion again for a period of time. Blink has a setting for this break period and it can be adjusted, but can go no less than 10 seconds. So if you have an event that is 45 seconds long, you will record the first 30 seconds and the last 5 seconds, leaving you with a 10 second gap in your footage that could be key to solving a break in or similar event.Another issue I have is that the night vision can not be turned off. You can select “on” or “auto”. So if your camera is looking out a glass window at night you will not see anything, even if there is a light outside. The infrared LEDs can not go through the glass so you end up getting a terrible glare in the window and an almost completely black screen. Where if you could turn it off, it would see through the window to the street which is lit by an exterior light.In addition, the live view is ridiculous. You must tap a continue button every 15-30 seconds to keep watching the feed. If you do not tap the button when prompted, it backs out of the live view.As for the picture quality, it’s okay. You can’t read a license plate from 15 feet away though. And if you zoom in on someone’s face it would be hard to tell who they are from any more than 10 feet away. For the price though, it’s not terrible.I don’t care to go into detail, but the app is lacking in so many ways.I have returned this camera in search of a better solution. Next attempt is the Yi Dome Camera X."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            May 2021 Update: unfortunately I have had to downgrade my original review. After a year, Blink should have added the missing features listed below in my original review especially individual camera notification control. If you have more than one camera; this missing feature is a huge annoyance. The Blink forums have been asking for this simple feature for 3 years and Blink has been unresponsive. If these features are ever added, I will update my review and can recommend the Blink system again.I am very happy Blink is expanding their offerings and this little camera surprised me! We own a Blink XT2 system as well as Yi Cameras.This Camera makes a much better baby camera than the Blink XT2 and works perfectly with our existing XT2 system. I did not have to sign up for the cloud subscription and because Mini Recordings are free as part of our XT2 system (XT2 cameras do not require a subscription). This is a huge benefit and reason why people would purchase both the Mini and XT2. Hopefully, the free cloud storage stays for the Mini recordings, especially for people who own a XT2 system. The daily experience is good, the app works well for the features it does have, but the cons listed below are a big issue that Blink should easily resolve for all their cameras. I am still very happy overall.Pros:-Great build quality and design-Great picture quality-Very responsive when connecting to Echo Show (seems better than the XT2)-Small size-Mountable base-Weighted base (weight can be removed)-Long USB/power cord-Two way audio with App-Local storage option if you buy the new Sync 2Reliable AppCons:-No Two Way Audio with Echo Shows; both are Amazon companies, and I am not sure why this is not a feature already.-No individual camera arm/disarm scheduling (you are forced to schedule your entire system)-No individual camera notification control; Blink please also add this feature! This is extremely annoying especially as you add more cameras. I really only want notifications for our front door but want recordings without notifications for the rest of the House. I imagine most people would want the same thing.-Can’t continuously view on the App. This can be annoying especially for this camera in our case (we are using it as a baby monitor). You can continuously view with an Echo Show but it does cut out eventually.-Paid subscription for Cloud recordings; all other Blink cameras have free cloud recordings and it would have been better if this camera followed the same strategy.Overall, this camera would be perfect and get 5 stars once Blink fixes the few App features missing listed above. I have contacted Blink in various forms to inform them of the above missing simple features but the responses have been unimpressive. I plan to modify this review if the features are added, but unfortunately people have been begging Blink for these features for years."
"Update Sept. 4, 2020================I was able to improve the night vision of my Blink Mini at the expense of decreased motion detection reliability during the day. However, I am lowering my rating from a 3 star to a 1 star due to reliability issues with the Blink ecosystem.Several days after further adjusting my settings in an attempt to improve the night vision, my Blink Mini stopped responding altogether. When I went to my APP I noticed that I had been logged out by the app for no apparent reason. I tried logging in several times, but each I was informed by the APP that my credentials were incorrect - they were not! I decided to go the simple route of resetting my password which I thought would resolve the problem - IT DID NOT! Blink sends you a pin that you need to enter to reset your password, it also pretty much wipes all your previous settings according to the notice I received. When I attempted to log into my account with the new password, the app again stated that my credentials were incorrect and would not allow me to log into my account. So I tried again, but still no luck. At this point I was becoming very frustrated that a device that was supposed to be providing security was actually making me less secure. I went to the BLINK website to try and contact technical support. It appears that the only way to do this is to fill out a ticket and wait for them to get back to you.At this point, I have to state that this is the worse security device that I have. It may be cheap, but without any reliability - it is completely worthless. While more costly, I would recommend a RING or ARLO camera instead. I have both RING and ARLO products and both have proven extremely reliable.Original Review============The Blink Mini has a lot of potential in my opinion and overall I like it, but it is not at all reliable in my current (and some would argue not intended for) application. Based on my experiences so far, I would not recommend as a primary source for Home Security. However, the Blink Mini might be a satisfactory or even a great fit in your particular application especially if you use it to augment a more reliable system you already have in place. My review is based on a specific application. It could be that I just need to find the right combination of settings to get it to work for my application. The BLINK APP does offer a fairly nice set of Camera Settings to allow you to customize your camera.I have had the Blink Mini operational for several weeks now. I have it placed inside a window observing activity on one of the entryways into my home. During the day it works really well. However, I find that I typically need to perform a soft reset each day as it seems to go into a sleep mode during the night effectivity becoming non-operational.  I have used a different security camera/motion detector alongside the Blink Mini and it doesn't exhibit the same issues. I may end up repurposing my BLINK MINI for garage duty and swap it with the camera I currently have installed there. I am sure garage duty would be much less demanding for the BLINK MINI’s capabilities.It will work really well in detection and recording during the day and then as it gets dark it seems it enter a state where I either get a completely black screen or a reflection from the window and it effectively puts itself into a USELESS mode until I activate some type of video activity using the BLINK APP.I have had the Blink Mini NIGHT VISION setting on AUTO (which is apparently the default). I tried setting the IR setting to ON to determine if there is any improvements. Having the NIGHT VISION set to ON during the day disables color and results in poor video quality due to window reflection. I have turned NIGHT VISION to OFF and IR Intensity to LOW to see if this results in any improvementNOTES: (1) Turning NIGHT VISION to OFF effectively turns motion detection and video recording off unless there's an external light source. (2) The APP doesn’t allow one to turn IR Intensity to OFF. You can only set to LOW - MED - HIGH. It would be nice if you could turn off completely.CONS:1 - Extremely poor or no night vision or motion detection in my application. It's possible that this can be improved by the right set of camera setting - I am experimenting and will update if things improve.2 - Consistently goes into a SLEEP/Non-operational mode at night requiring a soft RESET the next day to make it operational for day activity.3 - Sometimes unable to connect through the cloud to an Eco Show at a different location - this is random and can usually be cleared by activating the BLINK APP. While not ideal, it does seem to clear the problem.4 - Detection notification is noticeably delayed.5 - While new owners get a free cloud subscription until December 31st, 2020; post that date requires you to pay $3/month per camera or purchase a yet-to-be-released Sync Module.6 - Requires that you plug into an electrical outlet (I would say that this is a SOFT CON and possibly a PRO for some depending on your particular situation).7 - IR Intensity cannot be turned OFF.PROS:1 - Good day-time video quality for the price.2 - Good for non-critical monitoring and detection.3 - Nice low-cost augmentation to existing and primary security system.4 - Easy to setup.5 - BLINK APP offer a nice set of Camera Settings to allow you to customize your camera. One caveat is that you cannot turn IR Intensity to OFF which is an issue in some applications.6 - Good day-time motion detection quality.7 - Well made for the relatively low price.In summary, I would say that the BLINK MINI is a decent and even good product depending on your particular application. It’s especially good if you’re augmenting an existing security system for a non-critical application or area. However, I cannot recommend for primary Home Security or Critical Applications at this time."
12/11/23 the cameras go offline often and don't detect movement well. Today at 4AM I heard a noise in my dining room and my camera wasn’t triggered. I go on my camera to check the live view and it would not load. I closed and reopened the app and got a busy signal….so now I’m up damn near about to booboo on myself not wanting to wake my partner up to check for me because he’s sleep and has work soon. The camera have been unreliable on many occasions & it’s frustrating on top of me paying $10 monthly to view and save my camera footage….now below I’ll post my notes I took on this camera around the time I first purchased it/them(I have 3 total and 1 doorbell camera)Randomly two went offline at two separate times. I have 4 total on the same WiFi. Customer service said it was normal and it was fluctuation in my internet signal….since I got it all my camera have went offline at random times. It’s really no explanation for this because my WiFi is working fine and we have a fast connection. I know this because I work from home and I had Internet requirements to meet.Can’t view live footage sometimes. It will just load and load. Can’t view prerecorded footage sometimes. It will also just load and load. Also when I get notified of motion(I have it set to where I’m notified right as the motion begins) I click the notification and it won’t take me to the live view and if the motion has ended it won’t take me to the recorded video(the recorded videos sometimes take 10 seconds to x amount of time to show up in the history after the motion is recorded)When you try to take a new thumbnail of the room/area the camera is in it will sometimes fail. For me it has done it a lot. When you try to update the motion areas with the squares it will fail saving it multiple times.Random recording times once motion is detected. I have mine set up to were I want it to record and it’ll stop after 10 seconds of no motion detected but the camera will record random time ranges non anymore than 24 seconds. It’ll stop recording even when the motion is still going on. Maybe I need to tweak it more but I have been for a few weeks and still nothing new.Night vision is wonky. It says the setting for where you want motion to be detected can mess this setting up a little. I don’t see how that’s the case with mine because the bright areas(windows and doors) of my home is the areas I set to detect motion….the night vision will be on in a lit room and will flick on and off within the same timeframe. Example: at 4:55 the NV will be on then the next clip at 4:56 will be no NV…this happens in dining area for example and sometimes the shadows from the trees outside will move around from the wind and you can see it on our window. The camera will pick this up on NV….it’s so weird.Microphone/audio lags. When I press hold to talk the person on the other end is already talking before I’m done/before I let go of the mic/ the feedback from their end doesn’t kick back in right away. So I will miss the beginning part of what they said. Also you have to be close to the camera to be heard by the person(s) listening unless they’re screaming or yelling. Meaning the mic doesn’t pick up audio very well. All in all the audio and mic is very inconsistent.Day 2. LR and dining room went offline both a few hours apartDay 7: dining room 11:20pm by 2:30 it was still online. I tried disconnecting the chord and then connecting again and still it was offline. Around 7:30am still off then by 813am it detected motion finally and recorded a video1/7/2024 update! I have my videos to store for 30 days and after that it will delete but I went to try and find some footage from less than 30 days and it’s nowhere to be found actually the videos only went back to 12/27/23 which is definitely not 30 days ago. When I searched unfiltered it went to 12/31/23. I haven’t been able to see any videos recorded before that point and I 100% always keep my cameras rolling. The only one I unarm sometimes is the one in the master bedroom but for example my door camera I never turn it off. I can’t even see the videos recorded in that before 12/31/23. This is giving scam at this point not even gonna lie.
"(*edit* it turns out it wont record at all unless you subscribe) For the price it's hard to complain but I'm gonna do it anyway. I thought the cameras can continously record but that's my bad for not researching better. Just so others know, they record by motion sensor only. In my busy house I get upwards of 600 clips/day. But I like to keep them armed because you never know when someone might break in to your home, or the nanny is doing something that they need to be corrected on. In all fairness you can choose an area specifically in the cameras view that you want to record, but whats the point from a safety perspective if you don't have the whole view. When you're looking at the ""home"" screen, a quick view of all your cameras, there is no live view. Instead there is a thumbnail image. This image can be updated whenever you want by capturing a screenshot, essentially, of whatever is going on in that room at the time. So that sucks. In order to see what is going on with that camera at the time you have to click on it for a live view. To record live view it's kind of confusing. You have to click on the ""saved"" button which will be blue while it's recording, and then click the ""saved"" button again to stop recording. It should just say record, stop recording. The fact that the button says ""saved"" threw me off. A lot of the features I had to figure out by trial and error. You can record up to 5mins of live view at a time, or 90mins if you subscribe to their affordable plans ($3/mo & $10/mo). You can choose how long the camera records when it stops detecting motion. You can get notified immediately when there's motion or notified after the full video has been recorded. The live view is pretty clear both visually and audio, however, the two-way audio sucks. There is a delay in the audio from both ends and then the video begins to get glitchy. You can snooze the camera from being armed, let's say you don't want to record while you're sleeping you can snooze for 8 hours. You can choose when you want the LEDs on, in case you don't want people to know when it's recording. I find this keeps integrity. You can change the motion sensitivity. Expect it to notify you hundreds of times if you have pets. I had to turn the notifications off. You can set the length of the motion detected clip (up to 30 seconds). The fisheye view has pretty good range. You can link it to your Amazon account and Alexa. For example I was getting notifications on my Alexa echo show when the camera detected motion. Good or bad, up to you. If you live alone probably good, if you don't want it publicly known when the camera detects motion, bad. You can access the cameras from the blink app or the Amazon Alexa app. It's easy to add devices to the blink app, you just plug it in, log it in to the wifi and you're good. The cable is pretty long, long enough to mount it about 7 feet above your standard close to the floor wall outlet. Overall I decided to keep them because they were a deal and they serve their basic purpose. I've posted some screenshots of the the apps settings pages. Hope this helps y'all make an informed decision."
"Last year I purchased two YI cameras to be used for a “senior cam”. It was great until I had trouble maintaining connection on one of the cameras. I couldn’t get it to reconnect to the WiFi, so I tried the Blink Mini and I haven’t had issues disconnecting from the WiFi. I find the functionality to be easy, and the installation was a breeze. However, I actually prefer the YI, for the following reasons:- Picture quality isn’t as clear- Although you have the live view on mute, when you go into your clips, the sound is actually on. Causes an issue when I’m at the movies and I want to check out what’s going on at home.- You have to buy an add-on item to get the camera to tilt and rotate.- The most annoying for me is when watching the live view, you need to keep refreshing after a certain time period. I thought I may be able to adjust the timing, but after exploring the settings, I couldn’t find it.So now, I’m continuing to use both brands so I can make sure I always have eyes on my 82-year old Mom. Not ideal, but I’ll do whatever I need to for peace of mind."
"4 Stars - I have 2 Blink Mini’s linked to a Module2.  I have them mounted inside and pointed toward the outside through windows.  The cameras were fairly easy and painless to set up.  I like the small size of the cameras and that they don’t have batteries to maintain or that can swell and fail over time.The picture quality is excellent daytime and low light.  I can’t comment on infrared night time picture quality, as I have disabled the infrared and LEDs to prevent reflection on the window glass.The app needs improvement.It’s good that you are able to block out zones where you don’t want to detect motion, like normal traffic on the street.  However, this doesn’t work at night as it will trigger cars in the zones blocked from monitoring.  Not just some, but all cars at night will trigger recording in the blocked zones.It’s good that you can enable and disable individual cameras easily from the home screen of the app.  However, I wish they would make it so you could silence the notification from individual cameras without disabling the motion detection and recording easily from the home screen.  The only way is to go deep into the app settings to turn off the notifications for all cameras.I tried the Beta test of the instant notification which would be good, however, it negates the ability to delete clips directly from the notification, which I like when the clip is of the mail carrier or the neighbor’s cat that likes to hang out at my house for some damn reason.  When I turned off the instant notification, I noticed that the cameras stopped picking up any motion, so I deleted and re-linked the cameras to the app and this fixed the problem.  I have not turned that function back on since.Update - Now it's 3 stars because I am starting to become frustrated with these cameras.  First of all, with the aforementioned blocking not working at night.  Secondly, it has stopped picking up the mail carrier delivering mail but picks me up walking the very same path to get the mail every time.?  A lot of users complain about having to keep pressing the continue button for live viewing.  In my case, I only use live view when aiming the camera or watching for the pizza delivery and it can become annoying even with my limited use of this function.  Many times there is a noise on the street so I attempt to see what it is, but then the camera doesn’t want to connect to live view and by the time I get it to connect, whatever was there is long gone.  Whenever I have trouble connecting to live view, I can usually get it to connect after I kill the app and restart it so thinking a lot of my issues with the cameras are app related.I am still within the free cloud storage period so don’t know if any of these issues will clear up when I am switched to local storage or if I will start to have more issues.  Only time will tell.Update - 2 stars.  Time told.  I am into day one of local storage and I can't believe how petty Amazon is with the app if you aren't paying the subscription plus a couple of issues I have been dealing with the cameras and waited to mention to see if it would change with local storage.  The dealt with issues I think is with the cameras and not the app.  I have to go into live view every morning in order to get the cameras to record motion for the day.  I don't get it, it's like they go to sleep overnight when not a lot of action is happening.  Another thing I don't understand, is it will record a huge amount of cars driving down the street past the house, even in the block out zones, but will not record me passing in front of my house as I am coming and going or entering and leaving my drive.  Not that I am interested in myself, but makes me wonder what else is happening that doesn't get recorded.  Now for the pettiness of the app that wasn't too hot to begin with.  The dot that tells you if you have already viewed the clip, gone.  The ability to delete groups or all the clips at one time, quickly and easily, gone.  You have to delete them one at a time in the viewer, which closes after you delete the clip and you have to tap the next clip and wait for it to open the viewer and load the clip.  The thumbnails of the clips so you can see what was captured without having to view the clip, gone.  The ability to save live views, gone.I can not recommend these cameras which is a shame, as the cameras are pretty dang good as compared to others that I have had with the exception of a couple of bugs.  But it's the app that keeps me from paying for the plan and recommending this system to anyone.  What was once a mediocre app that caused frustration, has been reduced to a needlessly onerous turd of a chore that causes angst and regret."
"You need a monthly subscription for full functionality. You can engage live view in response to motion detection. Storage of video requires monthly fee. (or purchase of sync module that works with other units too)  You can divide up cameras into separate systems if you desire such as indoor vs outdoor. This feature can be used to use more than 10 cameras if needed. (10 per ""system"" not per module). The limitations placed on the cameras are by design to procure a monthly fee from you and are generally not found on many other cameras. No professional monitoring available as far as I can tell. Would have given 5 stars or better if there were no unnecessary restrictions."
"I got this to monitor our great room. The quality of the night video wasn’t the best. The daytime was spot on. The longer we’ve had it, about a year now, I notice now that it doesn’t trigger to close movement but picks up everything from a distance. A mouse could fart and it would pick it up but not the kids using cymbals right by it. The Blink system itself has issues too. We have a subscription and it doesn’t load fast, won’t deactivate have to try that multiple times, and is frustrating. This is an old version of camera and we’re hoping the new will be better"
"There is so many things you have to play around with to get it to work everyday and every light change. It also won’t show out a window if you don’t shut night mode off when it’s dark (even if it’s well lit outside) but then if it’s daylight and you don’t flip the night mode back on auto it won’t pick up anything at all, inside or out but even if you do that sometimes it switches back off and you miss 12 hours of monitoring if you weren’t paying really close attention that no alerts were coming in. I also have a really hard time getting it to connect to live mode. The first week it worked fine, now it just stops. No reason. Didn’t touch a thing. Just nothing and no matter what you do nothing fixes it until minutes or hours later it’ll just do it. As far as the sensitivity, sometimes a snowflake or a gnat flying by will set it off. Other times, for 8 hours someone moved Next to me and nothing (also while I was on vacation someone came into my house, took 3 delivered Christmas present bags I had put in my bedroom the day before I left for vacation and they used the restroom, left a key lay in the middle of the floor and who knows what else and I didn’t get one single alert!!! I didn’t know about it until I got home and started to wrap the Christmas presents and realized 3 of my grandkids gifts were gone so I started piecing things together (the key, the toilet etc). It feels so violating & that was the main reason I got it! To feel safe!! I also wanted to be able to watch my car and front door from my bedroom, especially if someone were to knock or something so I could see if it was for my door before going and so that I could hear them all the way in my room but this thing will only stay on about 30 seconds without you having to click the continue button that comes up. It stays on longer on Echo Show (not much) but it records it the entire time & you don’t have a whole lot of room to begin with to save videos without having to subscribe to something-that I haven’t figured out yet but what’s the point of it won’t do what it’s supposed to anyway! Not to mention, you can change how long it will save your videos without starting to automatically deleting them. You maximum time you can choose to save them is 60 days! WT..???? Half the time I probably wouldn’t even know I needed to look at something for longer than that! Like if I forgot where I put something on my birthday last year? Maybe I could look at the videos & see if it caught where I put it (like a pair of earrings I only wear on special occasions). Or if someone took something (that is if it actually worked like it should) but it was something like a firestick or game consol you only use when you have guests or the grandkids are over so it might have been 6 months since you used it last. I don’t know what all to say. I mean, overall I like the concept but it just isn’t for me. I’m going to have to send them back and try a different brand all together. Try your luck if you want. I would think I just got a bad one but I got 3 of them and even though I opened them up at the same time, I bought them at different times so they didn’t even come from the same batch! Such a disappointment 😞 I was looking forward to it above everything else and I haven’t even told you the entire list of problems. It really was a crushing disappointment."
"I have a 50% success rate with these cameras. My girlfriend purchased one that, right out of the box, is having some software issues not connecting to my Wi-Fi. I wish I could say something good about customer service but when I submitted a ticket including the troubleshooting solutions I tried, I received a generic email back suggesting I try solutions that, you guessed it, I have already tried! It’s been a few days and I still have yet to get a response yielding any real solutions.It’s not all bad, however. As soon as I realized the first one wasn’t working correctly I remember I had read another review saying they had a similar issue and I purchased a second one myself. It arrived quickly and the setup process was flawless and quick, using the same process as the first non functional one.The camera quality is good. We use it from inside a window looking out around our front door. These cameras are not designed to look THROUGH glass at a dimly lit area because the IR light will just reflect off the glass and back into the sensor resulting in a completely washed out image. If you have an exterior light making the area visible, you have the option of turning off the IR light and the camera has no issue seeing through the glass at that point, just make sure the area you’re trying to view is lit by an alternate source. The motion sensing feature is nifty and the trigger zones can be changed to your preference. Also in the box comes a set of screws so you can mount the camera to a vertical or inverted surface, however there are no physical instructions on how to do so and you will need to scan a QR code on the packaging for those. The included USB-A to Micro USB cable has some decent length to it. I haven’t measured it but if I were to guess it’s probably around 10ft. The Micro USB end has a housing that only fits the Blink camera.In summary, the camera is actually pretty decent if the one you order is working (unlike a handful of reviews I’ve seen) and you use it correctly. Just be prepared to immediately request a replacement/return through Amazon rather than sit around and wait for a legitimate response from customer service like myself. I’m pleased with my working camera. My low review is due to the lack of a pulse from Customer Service."
