"This headset would be just about perfect if there were two separate adjustments:1. Height where the ear cans end up resting2. Angle of the ear cans against the headI think I have a reasonably average sized head (my hat size is 7 3/4 which is near dead center in the Tilley hat sizes for men) and these are too big for me.  The top of the [very large] ear can would press against the top of my ear (if the tilt didn't keep it about 1/2"" from my head!).  The bottom rim presses uncomfortably into my neck over 1"" below my ear lobes.  So, rather than my ears being within the padded ridge, the ridge would crush the top of my ear if it were aligned well, and the bottom is far below my ear.While I might be able to correct the height with some additional padding, the alignment is just bad.  I think these are going back, which is sad because they WORK great and feel quite solidly made.  But that very solidity seems to mean they must be non-adjustable and my head isn't wide or tall enough for the one size that clearly doesn't fit all."
"Nubwo N7. Let's get to it!Let's start with the positives!+- This one is a bit tricky. While the boom mic is adjustable, it feels a little flimsy. Not quite as sturdy feeling as a Turtle Beach or other more expensive headset. Still, it's very nice to have some adjustment to it.+ Long braided cable, perfect for PC or monitor use.+Adapter cable for use with multiple different types of devices.+Chat quality was good. Never had any issues in the time I played with friends.Now let's hit the negatives!-The audio isn't going to knock your socks off. It's definitely better than just using your TV, but don't go in expecting some earth shattering audio difference. Still good for a budget headset.-The headband is a weird one. You go in think the actual plastic piece adjusts how your normally think, but it is in fact the inner strap that stretches to the shape and size of your head which brings me to this…-Due to how the set sits on your head, it's never really ""tight"" fitting. Like it kind of hangs on your head, if that makes sense."
"Within the first week, the headset started acting weird.- Audio was glitchy - it was very “in and out.”- The mic did not work wellI assume it was because of the wire, which if I occasionally fidgeted, would make the entire headset work very well but only for a few minutes.I looked past those things and in 4 months my headset completely broke. No audio, no mic. I tossed it into the trash. I think these would’ve been good had the wire not been messed up"
"i bought these on sale for $17 and pulled the trigger on them since they’re originally $30ish. i was excited at first, but was really disappointed in the build and sound quality. the packaging was literally just the box and the plastic bagged headset. i was like, ok..you get what you pay for. packaging is not a big deal. i put them on and there are no adjustments for the ear muffs, up or down. it’s basically one size due to the elastic piece. but they were so loose that putting them on felt like the whole headset would droop down. the sound quality— mediocre. there’s so much mid that it drowns out the treble and bass. but it’s not like the bass is nonexistent. if you’re an audiophile, you might be disappointed. the worst part is that the sound bleeds out of the headset. like so much that it causes feedback to the mic, and i wasn’t even at max volume. overall, i think 3 stars is fair for the price i paid, but i immediately sent it back regardless. if you’re considering spending $30, reconsider. there are plenty of other choices. OR spend the extra $20 and get a decent corsair or hyper-x."
"This headset is extremely comfortable! I was nervous about the fit, and it's like wearing a cloud. The sound is really good, albeit a bit quiet (even at max) with the PS4. Unfortunately this did not come with the PC Connection, even though in the instructions and the box state it does. I accidentally mistook this version with the version that also includes a 7.1 3D Surround adapter too, but that part is my fault. Sadly Nubwo doesn't sell the 3D Surround separately either! I'm going to look into what Kingston offers, as they have some amp adapters for headsets.I was unable to find a way to contact Nubwo about the missing piece, perhaps because I am really tired at the moment. If they are able to get in contact with me for the PC adapter, that would be wonderful and I'll update this to 4 stars no problem. I am still testing this headset, and will update when I have used this headset for longer than a few days.Thank you for the wonderful product!"
I liked it my first couple of weeks and then all the sudden the whole left side went out when I was playing call of duty and I was confused because I wasn’t able to talk to my friends or I wasn’t able to listen with my left side and it really wasn’t that good
"Overall, this is a very nice headset. The only thing you should take into consideration, is after about 4-6 hours of gaming with these, it really starts to hurt your ears. Hey, maybe i've got big ears. but definitely something to note. The other thing I can think of is the mic on this thing, It's not terribly bad, its console quality for sure. However, its not adjustable whatsoever, it's going to be hanging by your mouth the entire time. The sound quality though, is actually quite nice. It's got decent bass for being cheap headphones. And the volume control is also quite nice. Hopefully you decided to either buy this, or save your money from this jumbled up review, lol. I'd say its a grab."
"I forgot I only paid $25 for these, and was a bit surprised when I just saw that. For that money, I have to say ""Pretty Good"". The more you can spend on a set of gaming headphones, the better product you will generally get. That holds true in this case, however, for what I spent, I can't complain about these at all. Many other reviews I read before I bought these complained that other headset broke fairly quickly. These are still going strong. I bought them to replace another pair that only lasted 6 months or so before my kids tore them up. I use a pair of Logitech G430s at work. With those, for more than twice the money, you get better noise cancellation, better bass response and a more comfortable headset, but I was hesitant to spend that much for something I was pretty sure my kids were just going to tear up, anyway. These are still going strong. For $25 you can do you can do much worse. If this is what you can afford, get them."
"I paid $13 and change for these headphones after an amazon coupon and a $10 amazon gift card I had. I don’t believe these headphones are worth the $25 price tag. First off they look nice but feel a little cheap. Second at least for my head they sit on me a little weird where it feel’s like the bottom of my ear isn’t being fully sealed. The sound is decently crisp but it lacks base/richness. The sound is pretty monotone, with that being said if these headphones were $16.99 or in that area they would be amazing. One annoying little factor that might not matter to most is that on the mic there is a button to shut it on/off which is great but if you plan on using it you can’t use the supplied foam for the mic which would help with clearing up the sound for others. All in all, if you’re looking for a decent pair of gaming headphones these work ok and might be enough for certain people. If you’re an audiophile just skip these."
"Been using this headset for a while now. The sound quality is fine, its not great but its not terrible either- complete lack of bass, but it is what it is. I gave this 3 stars because of the ""noise cancelling"" mic. It does not do that- in fact, it's one the worst mics I've ever used for gaming. I get roasted every time I play something because this mic is shrill and tinny- i sound terrible. but the main issue is that this is actually a noise AMPLIFYING mic. it picks up EVERYTHING. god forbid you forget to mute yourself when you leave the room, or get a gentle breeze blowing into the mic- you're gonna subject your friends and colleagues to utter torture.I wanted to like this headset but the mic is just awful, so beware. I can't in good faith recommend this product. You get what you pay for and I highly recommend paying a bit more to get a better headset with a mic that actually does what its supposed to."
"They look and feel like a quality product on the outside. They actually performed well initially but after a few weeks of use, the volume control wheel started to malfunction. Sometimes I can only hear out of one ear unless I move the wheel back and forth to just the right spot. Sometimes I turn it all the way up and can still barely hear anything. Sometimes the sound is in one ear or the other, it's really tough now to get loud sound out of both ears. It's like this every time I try to use them. Not sure if I just got a bad set, but that is really annoying. The second thing is my cat knocked them off my desk one time and now it feels like the driver is just flopping around in there. When I pick the headset up it makes a loud rattling sound. If I tilt my head at all it makes a clanking sound."
"Everything about these headphones are perfect. The suspension headband, massive ear cups, and lightweight design all lend themselves to a luxury listening experience. But there's a glaring issue- about half a year after your purchase, the headphones will fall to the exact same symptoms (I've owned these twice). Audio in the left ear will stop working, and audio in the right ear will kinda work if you hold the cable right. Something's going on with a bad connection inside the headphones because I've never had a pair last longer than a year. I can't give it a higher rating unless they come with a longer warranty or better yet- longer lifespan."
"Ok, Ive had these for awhile now and they work nicely but they recently started falling apart the soft material on the inside started flaking off everywhere! Its made a total mess of my setup and I don't know what prompted it to start falling apart after being fine for over a year."
"I play PC and PS4, I used to be an audiophile and I would buy very expensive headsets. This headset is surprisingly clearer than most $100 headsets I've had. This is great for immersion as I was hearing little details of the game that I have never heard before in the game.  Volume wise it's a bit low on PS4 but if you can adjust sliders in game you'll be fine. The bass is okay. It could be a lot better for a $40 headset though so I don't recommend for music, gaming however not bad.Update: I ordered this almost 2 months ago and its defective. My teammates are complaining that I sound like im in a wind tunnel or like i am blowing on my mic. I paid $40 and im am saddened. It still sounds fine but the mic is broken now. For $40 get a better headset. Although its comfy and sounds clear, it breaks like a $20 headset. Not a good investment."
"Pretty good headphones, especially for the price.The sound quality is serviceable, but if you're an audiophile type I'd recommend you steer clear from these. They don't have much in the way of surround sound so anybody looking for an amazing listening experience won't find much for them here. The noise cancelling isn't anything to write home about, either; however, that's not something I particularly care about, so I don't mind. The mic works perfectly well and is good for discord calls and the like. They feel a little... delicate? They're quite light, which isn't something I'm used to in regards to headsets. I've been careful with them, so the headphones haven't broken or anything in the month that I've been using these. I might just be being a little paranoid in that respect, but I thought it'd be useful information.Overall, they work pretty well for a pair of 20 dollar headphones. If you're on a budget I'd recommend them as a way to hold yourself over before committing to a more quality product."
"Update:. I have compliants when playing COD on my phone, that people can hear my character as well as themselves sometimes. I have concluded the noise coming through my earpiece is traveling to the microphone, thus everyone can hear it although it's not that loud, but it is irritating for people to hear it. Now I'm going to try to find me another set of headphones. Lowering this to 3 stars.I give these headphones 4 stars total.They are very comfortable.Just has 1 cable coming out of headset to plug in, with two line adapter for computer if needed.Sound is good, but if it had just a little more bass, it would be perfect!I use these for COD Mobile game and they are great.  Much better than the other brand I was using.  Very comfortable.They also work great for phone calls."
"I purchased these mostly because the price was good and they seemed more comfortable than the default work headset. I have to say my initial impression is very positive. The audio quality is probably the best I've experienced (though my previous headphone experience is limited to only Bluetooth connected headphones). Mic quality appears to be good from the feedback my friends have given me. Also, the mic doesn't seem to pick up breathing. I've been wearing these for about an hour continuously and they are pretty comfortable, especially when compared to the on the ear headset I was using for work.Overall really great price for the audio and mic quality. Also good for work since there's no flashy accents or any typical gamer aesthetics.EDIT:After a week of having these headphones, I'm returning them due to a broken mic. I spent hours troubleshooting the issue, thinking I had accidentally changed some setting on my laptop that caused the mic to stop inputting. However, after testing on my phone and another laptop I can confirm there was something wrong with the headset and the mic was done after only one day of using it. There was no physical damage I could see that would have caused the issue. I still maintain the audio is great, but unfortunately, I got what I paid for and I will definitely be dropping a few more bucks on something that'll hopefully last longer."
"Initially I was upset that I misread the product page and purchased because I had thought that they were noise cancelling. The mic is supposedly noise cancelling, but when my kids are in the other room watching TV quietly or talking the mic pics it up as background noise quite clearly. However I use these for music and gaming. The quality of the sound is fine with rich base tones and nice not uncomfortable tweeter. I enjoy the sound, but they are not as good as my noise cancelling headphones that have batteries. There is an adjustment wheel on the ear piece that comes in handy, and these things can get LOUD. I was concerned because they do not ""hug"" my head as others do, but I found that by just resting on your head, and my entire ear fits in the cups, it is EXTREMELY comfortable. I wish that they had better adjustments to fit different head sizes, but it happens to fit my big head just well enough."
"I purchased these headphones for my gaming pc to communicate with my team and also hear enemy footsteps/ults/etc.  What can I say?  They are headphones, and they have a mic.  I cannot say these headphones are great for noise cancelling and have good audio quality.  They meet the bare minimum for what headphones do and they at the very least work properly.  However: my gripe is that the metal band on top that provides structure for the leather (and often uncomfortable) top piece is unadjustable. In fact if you have a unique sized head either quite large or small I think that you may have trouble with these due to that simple shortcoming.  In any case for the price, these headphones will produce audio, and has a working mic, volume and mute in-line as well.  All-in-all middle of the pack and plain."
"The NUBWO Gaming headset features an ultra low price for average performance. The sound quality is nothing to write home about as it's equivalent to standard earbuds, however the mic quality is among the best you could get at this price range and it features a very comfortable fit. (Unfortunately, my microphone stopped working 3 months into using it without any damage at all so it is fair to assume it's extremely delicate.) The noise cancellation is below average as I can still clearly hear things a whole room away, but this could also be due to the headphones not being loud enough either.In conclusion, I would only buy this if you really need something that is cheap and can just about do the job for you until you can afford a better headset. Otherwise save up for 1-2 more weeks and make a better investment."
"Sound quality is actually pretty good for how cheap it is but the mic on the other hand is very quiet and according to my friends over Discord it is very difficult to hear me unless I literally shout into the mic.I have tried to dabble with it messing with sound settings and making sure it was set as mic priority and made sure it was plugged in properly but have made no success in fixing it, fortunately I only really wanted it for its light weight so my head doesn't get sore over long periods of time.The side of the package was a little banged up when it arrived although I doubt that's what the issue is I think it might just be the quality of the product.I would rate this as a 7/10 experience."
"I used to love the NUBWO N7 Gaming Headset. It was my first big headset purchase after weeks of research, and what I got in May of 2019 was my favorite pair of headphones I've ever received. The sound was crisp, the headset fits nicely, and the microphone was absolutely amazing. In every game I'd play, people would assume I was using a $400 mic just because of how high quality the mic was. I recommended this brand to all of my friends, and everyone I knew. A week ago, I decided to repurchase this headset due to the wear and tear on my old headset becoming noticeable, and so I did. What I received was the biggest disappointment of the year.The new NUBWO N7 Gaming Headset has some visual improvements, with the mute button and audio slider being on a control on the wire, this initially had me excited. However, after testing the mic out to see how it compared, my heart sank. The mic is absolutely horrible. The elegance and quality of the old mic were nowhere to be found in this newer model. Though the new model looks improved, it has nothing to show for it tech-wise. I used to love this brand, but now I do not believe I will be purchasing any more from this company or recommending it to friends and strangers I meet in online matches. I'll be using my old mic, as this new version of what the N7 mic has become is nothing but a shadow of what it used to be.I am disappointed."
"I bought these in March '24 and they worked beautifully... until I didn't use them for a while, plugged them in, and the headphone part stopped registering with my computer. As far as I can tell, that is not the fault of my computer. The microphone still works - probably because I'm using the split cords. Either way, quite disappointed as now I have to buy yet another headset."
The mic is not the best part with these headphones but the speakers are good but don’t really have bass in them and I’m surprised these headphones have lasted me more time the others would brake with in a week
"Sound quality is ok. Neither good nor bad. The older gaming headphones (with orange markings, blacked out fox logo and rotating microphone) from Nubwo have far superior sound quality to these, and no stethoscope effect.These are extremely comfortable headphones.By ""360° adjustable microphone"" they must mean ""move it were you want and in 2 minutes it will move back where it was on its own"". Haven't tested the microphone, as it's not a feature I case about.Horrible stethoscope effect. Touch the cable and BOOM. Move your head, it's like a static bomb in your ear. Because of this I would recommend other headphones."
"Given all the positive reviews, I am very disappointed in this headset. After breaking my MPOW gaming headset, I really researched for a replacement. I do not use these for gaming, I am on the phone all day at work, and need something that is noise cancelling, feels comfy, has a great mic, and has wonderful sound quality.  This headset is very comfortable. The sound cancelling is fairly good. The Mike seems to pick up fairly well. But even with my PC sound at 100% and the headset sound at 100%, I can't hear. My mpow headset was wonderful! I could keep it at about 50% and it was plenty loud. Compared to that, 100% on this headset is not even close to what 50% was on mpow. I guess I'm going to have to send this one back, and get another mpow. Too bad, because this one is more comfortable."
"This is a very budget headset.  You can hear the budget sound quality, the microphone is pretty average and the build quality just wreaks of budget.  Budget isn't bad when done right, and it's hard to say that it was done right here.  The band on the headset is nice but the metal on the headphones echoes so much in your ears when wearing when it makes the littlest of noises.I really like how light it is but that's on personal preference.  The sound quality like I said is not that great but it's doable.  If you got this for really cheap at around 20 bucks (like I did), it wouldn't be bad... if the HyperX Cloud Stinger didn't exist.If you're buying brand new, I would say save an extra 10 or so dollars and get the HyperX Cloud Stinger or anything in the 50 dollar range from reputable brands.  They will net you a lot more life in your headset and they just sound better and are built better entirely.I like the black finish on these headphones but they're not enough for me to give it a great rating if no-brainer better options already exist.I am definitely returning these as they did not reach my expectations of what I thought I was getting."
"I bought this headset in late November. It works amazing for the price, I have no complaints about that. The noise cancelling earmuffs didn't do much in terms of actually blocking out noise, but it was soft and cushy enough that it didn't feel uncomfortable while wearing. I wore them for 4 hours straight in a D&D session with no discomfort. What was weird is that my microphone broke a couple weeks ago. While it's plugged in, the little bars bounce up and down like its picking up sound, but not in time to my voice. On voice chat, people say they can't hear anything from my mic, and only hear feedback sounds every once in a while. Reading the reviews today, I think I just had a one off experience. I thought it still needed to be shared."
The mix quality is awful but it doesn’t sound too bad for what it costs. This is my second pair and the only reason I don’t have my first is because I forgot to take them to college. I recommend these if you’re looking for something cheap but not awful. They’re really comfy even with glasses. The sound quality isn’t bad but it also could be better. I like them a lot.
"I needed a new pair of headphones for streaming purposes on my computer (since my old one was nearing it's final days) and so I looked for a cheap upgrade; low and behold I found these. My order arrived two days after being placed which was very quick in relation to previous headphones I have bought. They came in a bag inside of a box but I didn't really care since they were hella cheap headphones. Sound quality is fine, noise cancellation is fine. Everything about these headphones is a perfect ""fine"" except for the mic. The mic is pretty low quality, doesn't stay where you put it, and has weird input lag I can't fix. All in all it wasn't exactly beneficial for what I needed but they're nice headphones that are WAYYY more comfortable than my previous ones. You get what you pay for, folks."
One of the worst sounding headsets i heard in my life. My local store has a cheaper gaming headset smaller $15 but sounds way better almost sounds like a razer headset.This thing sounds like no bass but bad quality audio. I own there higher end headset and it sounds amazing. But this one is a no go. Save the money and just get there higher end one.
"I have been using the headset with my PC for nearly 11 months. It's no Bose, but the mic in front of your mouth really helps during those video conferences. I was teased for a bit about the look during business meetings, but the clarity of voice was starting to help turn the naysayers into believers. Unfortunately, the headset lost sound in the left ear. I plugged it into 2 other devices to make sure it was a headset problem, and not the PC. I also tried it with a splitter, which obviously did not fix the issue. It's a pity. It's still within the 1 year warranty, so I'll wait to see if the seller contacts me about fixing the problem, since sending these to China is obviously out of the question."
"What I need is comfort + sound quality + audio quality. This is a very comfortable headset. It certainly has that going for it. I have a huge head and long ears. It fits my head with room to spare and the muffs engulf my ear entirely so I don't get any pain from it. My issue comes down to quality. The first thing I noticed when I picked it up is that it felt like a cheap plastic toy. It's light but not by design. It's like because the cheapest components went to making this and has absolutely no durability. The audio is horrendous. There is absolutely no bass and I'm pretty sure the sound is mono and not stereo. If you want to use these for music you're better off with those cheap earbuds airlines give you for free. In fact that's what these remind me of. Free airline earbuds with a around-the-ear attachment and mic. The mic cracks and is full of static it's totally unusable. No one understands a word that I say. Look I'm not expecting much for $40 but I am expecting something that's ""good enough"" and these don't fit the bill. trash."
"These are semi-lightweight and have good sound quality. Due to being over the ear, they are good at muting out outside noises. I use mine on an Xbox1 with the newer 3.5mm headphone jack. It works well but the mic is very sensitive. I have the mic settings on the Xbox down as low as it will go and the mic curved up near my check bone with the cover on. If not it picks up breathing noises.  It still will pick up external noises from the other room or tv if it’s not muted. This wasn’t an issue with the original Xbox headset or other Amazon headsets.  I do like the fact I don’t have extra usb wires hanging off like you get with pc specific headsets."
"They were comfortable enough, but you are still going to get a little hot if you wear them for an extended time.Main issue I had with these was the sound quality, from the speakers as well as the mic.Both sounded very muffled on my gaming pc as well as a laptop I tried just to be sure.I tried to adjust audio settings but quality was still poor.Noise cancellation bad, like not working. For a muffled sounding mic it sure picked up the background hum of the fan in my room constantly.I didnt have high expectations for these for the price, they were a fast spare replacement until my others came in. Even then, you can find better for $20"
"I suppose for a $16 headset, a 3 month lifespan is reasonably expected. For the first couple months it was a decent headset, very comfortable, though the build is confusing. The metal strip that connects the two earpieces acts almost like a tuning fork and is incredibly loud whenever it hits anything. Would probably be much quieter if it were plastic. The microphone itself is on an adjustable arm, however you can't really swivel it away from your mouth like on other headphones, you can just sort of bend it away. This makes doing things like adjusting your volume or eating while wearing the headset kind of difficult.But all of these points are kind of moot anyways, considering my headset is now functionally broken. The headphone jack no longer brings sound to both earphones, only the left one. I have to manipulate it very carefully to get sound to both. My voice will cut out randomly as well. If I touch the headset wire at all sound can stop entirely. Kinda dissapointed.For $16 I guess it's not too bad, but still, would have liked it to last longer than 3 months."
"The microphone aspects seem to work well, and the sound is clear enough for conference calls.  The sound quality is not great for music, though, and I have also found that so much sound leaks from the headphone speakers that others can clearly hear the conversations on conference calls as if they had been coming out of a small speaker.  When the cord brushes against clothing or surfaces, I can hear it in the earphones.  I do appreciate that they provide both a microphone/aux cable splitter in addition to the combination mic/aux single cable.  But putting both the microphone and the cable on the L side gives it a weight imbalance and is a pain if the cord has to travel across your body or desktop to reach your computer/device."
"I've purchased several of these for kids to use for PC gaming.  They are comfortable, and sound and microphone performance are great.  First impressions were so good that I bought four sets over time.They last about one year of kid use, and then the speaker cans and/or microphone die out.  This has happened to multiple sets, so poor durability is consistent.I won't be buying any more of these."
"I originally had turtle beaches that ive used for 3 years before breaking them. Ive bought these as a replacement for now, and oh my god these sound really terrible. The quality of the microphone went down like a whole level. It sounds like back in the Xbox 360 era quality of mics compared to my turtle beaches. Other than that, it feels relatively nice to wear, the audio coming from it is actually not too bad either. So if youre looking to talk with your friends on gamechat, dont get them. However, for casual gaming and not talking through the headset is the least of your concern, these would do just fine."
"I got this headset because I wanted to try using a 3.5mm audio jack for my computer and other gaming systems. The headset is very comfortable (even while I wear my glasses) and sound quality is quite nice as well. My only qualm is that the microphone isn't great. The stem that holds the microphone near my mouth/face is very flimsy and doesn't hold its shape too well. Also, when speaking into it, the audio is very garbled and extremely loud. I have tried moving the mic further from my face and adjusting my computer settings, but nothing seemed to do the trick. I think that this is a nice headset if you want to listen to audio and have an external mic for voice comms, but using this for both audio and mic is not great."
"First of all, the headphone sound quality is great, and the headset is very comfortable.  The main issue is the mute switch on the in-line volume control box is apparently loose or has a short in it that causes large amounts of static to be heard by everyone else - ironically only when I am muted.  I cannot hear the static (no mic-monitoring), but everyone else can.  Also, every little conductive sound - eg. tap on the headset, or the braided cord sliding against clothing - will be transmitted through the headset and picked up by the mic as well.So overall great for listening, but not for talking."
"Audio lacks depth and instead has a shrill and piercing sound. It was as if the audio was coming from a small, cheap speaker, rather than a high-quality sound system. The bass frequencies were also non existent and the headphones didn't completely surround my ear. Only positive is the wire itself is high quality but that's about it."
"The headset itself feels good, and the sound quality is okay for the price. Wouldn't expect much more. However; the microphone quality is absolutely horrible. People on the other end said it sounded like I was underwater and just awful. Every single person who I talked to with this headset was so surprised at how bad I sounded. I ended up sending it back. If you need the mic occasionally and don't use it much, then maybe this would be a good purchase.I ended up sending it back and got a logitech on sale for a little bit more and that one sounds wonderful."
The headphones are nice but the cord was broken in less than a week overall the cord was horrible the noise just stopped working and fidgeting with it didn’t help at all
"I have been using this headset for the past 4 months, and they have been working fine until recently. I had to do a presentation, but when I tried to present, they said that they couldn't understand what I was saying. I don't know if this was the headset's problem, or my computer's problem, but either way, it ended up messing up my presentation. The windscreen also has a very loose grip on the mic, which makes it start falling off after a few weeks of use. Although the mic quality could do some reworking, the sound quality was surprisingly good for a 25 dollar headset."
"Use them for gaming and work calls, they're comfortable on my ears though with the huge band and ear phones they get sweaty ( that's on me though, I saw pics of it). Chose this one for the good reviews, but after a month people are complaining that I sound tinny or there's static when I talk, and they can hear everything going on in the background. Of course this all came up after the grace period for returns ended. The sound that I get is good, not sure what's the deal with the microphone"
"These are ridiculously huge on my head. I don’t know why they are so large because the sound they produce is completely devoid of any bass so the form factor has nothing to do with performance. I will say the headband is comfortable for hours, but the material the ear cups are made of makes my ears sweat after a while, kinda gross.The mic works though and setup with my ps4 was seamless so it achieved my only goal for these as I have a couple other nice headphones for music listening. I think there are much better options available but these were cheap and got the job done."
"I purchased these for my son for Christmas of 2019, by the start of April 2020 the inside vinyl has come away from the foam. So it bothers my sons ears. Not even 4 months of use and they are already falling apart. So disappointed I have to find him a different set. He loves them other wise. He says the sound is great and I think they are made great. Just to bad quality glue wasn't used. I would have given a 5 star rating.*** UPDATE*** tried to contact company about the warranty.... no response and very hard to contact so dropped my rating"
"Bought this headset a couple weeks ago for my brother. We were astounded by the build quality of the item, and how smooth and nice to the touch it was. The design was minimal and beautiful.However, when testing the quality of the mic, we were quite disappointed. The sound quality was not up to par with the design and the audio quality was just average.The mic stem also had a bit of a bend, which brings up the worry of the wire wearing down over the years, causing drooping.Build quality is great, it even has braided cordage but personally, the audio quality that I put out is important.. ;-;"
"Seems like a nice quality headset, nice fit and comfortable.  I used the headset for pc gaming.  They never seemed loud enough for me, and the mic stopped working after 10 months of use."
"Everything seems good (comfort, sturdy cord, clear mic), but the sound lacks any bass. I'll keep for a while, but would not buy again."
"So I have been using this headset for 8 months now.  The headphones sound quality is just fine BUT I have recently discovered that the microphone on my headphones does not work and has never worked since day 1.  I have tried the headphones on many devices just in case it was my computer's issue but to no avail.  Highly disappointing, although this is most likely just a singular issue that I am having as I have yet to see other reviews having this same issue."
"The sound is not bad. Kinda wish the bass was stronger.Only real complaint is the mute switch - it's not good. Not good at all. When your mic is muted using the switch, sometimes there are loud crackling noises heard by the people you're communicating with. Verified this with Audacity. I recorded myself with mic muted and heard lots of really loud pops and crackles.No good. I'm looking for a replacement now. I will be keeping these cause they aren't bad per se. And if you just don't use the mute switch, but rather, use a software mute function, they are fully functional."
(UPDATE) I've had three sets of these headphones and they used to be fantastic. Now I've order two new sets and the quality has gone down dramatically. The old sets used to have great tension and stay in place very well. The new ones are flimsy and don't hold tension. The mic doesn't stay in place at all. Both new sets are like this. I don't know if it's a bad batch or this is the new standard.  I might have to move on to a different brand. Sad because I used to love these.Great for canceling out background noise. The sound quality is actually great even listening to music like Panorama over the gaming sound. Decent bass. This is my second pair and prefer this model because the cable seems much more stout but I don't care for the volume on the cable. The previous model had it on the headset and you didn't have to fumble around to find it on the cord in the middle of a game. Definitely worth the price.
"You're not here for high quality headphones. You're on a budget. You are getting exactly what you pay for. The microphone works. The sound works. The sound quality is not great. It's just good enough. But at this price what were you expecting? They are very light - almost too light. They are comfortable enough, not the greatest.Are they bad? No.Are they amazing? No.Are they worth their price? Yes.Is the sound quality good? It's passable but not great at all.Is the mic good? It works fine.For 30 bucks you're getting exactly what you paid for."
"I was expecting so much better from these headsets since ive watched reviews on yt and everyone said they were perfect for gaming. I bought them and tested them out, my voice sounds muffled when i bring the mic a bit close to me, you have to bring it far from you so people wont hear the muffling sounds. Its noise canceling yes, but everything in the background can be heard by the people in my games. So if you have a REALLY noisy family these are not for you. Im kinda disappointed."
"I've had these headphones for almost 1 year and I thought they were great for the price. The headphones are really comfy on my head, but for some reason, the mic started to have problems and my friends online started to complain about static noises. I think the braided cord is to blame...wish they went with a different material on the connection cord. Now, the mic will stop working altogether until I've adjusted the cord like one of those old-school cassettes to phone jack converters."
"The sound quality is okayish and actually pretty good considering how cheap this mic is, the feeling on the head is great and not cumbersome, fits great actually (regular adult head)... but the real issue is the mic, it's made of a flexible material that just stay in front of your mouth with no way to retract it, push it up or even roll it up out of the way, super annoying and i wish I knew how irritating it would be before I bought this. Noise cancellation was pretty bad but I wasn't expecting much in this regard either."
"Just to be clear: I am NOT using these for gaming, but to help ease online meeting fatigue associated with the ability to hear what’s being said and for others to clearly hear me — gaming headsets were recommended.PROS: sound is pretty clear & clear, most of background noise cannot be heard through the headphones & the microphone is the exactly the right position for my faceCONS: ear molding is TOO BIG — covers almost the entire side of my face, headset is barely adjustable and microphone position is not adjustable (so you cannot flip it up/away when not in use)"
"I bought these headphones less than a month ago for work, I figured if they can game good, they can be great for work, well, they suck! Unless you are looking for earmuffs with a microphone jack attached to them, don't waste you money. They pick up EVERYthing in the house...except me. Yelling, screaming, adjusting the boom, moving the handset around, adjusting the cord, doing cartwheels, you name it, the only thing they can't hear...is me. They are comfortable enough to sleep in, and listen to music, that's the 3 star, but as a headset they are absolute garbage."
"I needed a headset with a mic for my xbone. I got these because they were cheap and had good reviews. I have a pair of Logitech G930s for my PC, with excellent surround sound, of course they are $60 more expensive.If you need a headset to communicate and just hear noise these work. If you need quality surround sound without audible gaps in location stay away. It's either sound from the front or back with these puppies, no side to side blending of sounds (if that makes sense).I haven't had the opportunity to test the mic out yet."
"I bought this when I first started playing Warzone and it allowed me to communicate with my teammates, and I thought that was all I needed. But now I realize I need a better headset to hear footsteps and such. My teammates have to tell me when there is a guy running around near me because this headset does not pick it up, until the person is two steps away. Too late!But for the price, it will do the basic job of letting you communicate with your squad. Sound quality is not bad for the sounds it does pick up."
"Used for about one full day and the microphone stopped working completely. Looks like the issue is from the 3.5mm jack side which works if I hold it in. I’m going to give the product three stars as the headset sound and microphone quality is good, the design flaw just lies in the 3.5mm jack side which has poor solder connections. I also got a refund for the product so no issues there. Just beware of this flaw and I hope this can be addressed with a better design."
when i received them and tried to connect them to my controller but it didn't work after trying all adapter i tried another controller in which it started functioning i don't know if its supposed to constantly echo what you say and so  I proceeded to use my headset and when I started to play at a slight movement of the cable the audio would cut off until you readjust it but then again it would cut and it would also alternate between static and no audio which is aggravating because you want to be able to game in my previous headset worked fine at half of the price and the reason why I haven't returned it is because i'm in a lock down currently and it would take a very long time more than average to return then get a new one .also a friend of mine got the same headset and said his worked fine . also i'm bored like really bored on this lock down.
"I ordered these headphones because my previous headset was from Nubwo and I actually really liked them, even though they were $25. They lasted a little over a year (which is decent for that price point) but after I thought they were dying, I ordered a pair of headphones from a different company, and I didn't like (I couldn't turn off ANC which gives me headaches) so I thought I might as well try another Nubwo headset.I tried using them for less than 10 minutes. I mainly play Apex Legends on XBL and the sound quality is very, very tinny. It kind of distorts the audio for gunfire and explosions from far away are not captured while anything up-close is very loud (and tinny). Returned immediately. After using them side-by-side with my year-old headphones, I think they're working just fine. So there's the upside! These headphones were so bad they made me like my old, cheap headset."
I have an infatuation with gaming headphones and wanted to find one that was inexpensive but a solid quality product. I definitely recommend the Nubwo N7. First of all the comfort is really nice you can use them for hours with no issues. The sound quality is quite good everything is clear and has a nice bass response which you need in gaming. And communication between me and teammates is always clear. So for the price of an inexpensive headphones that are comfortable and have good sound I got a good deal.
They are fine for the price but I know there are better headsets for the same or cheaper price. The mic isn't fantastic but I have no complaints for the price. There is however no noise cancellation so people can hear you typing or clacking your controller. Also if you have a deeper voice the top metal bars that don't touch your head vibrate and create an echo only you can hear. I slightly fixed this issue by tying a small ribbon between the two pieces. Overall not a great headset but nonetheless not a bad headset either.
These are super light weight and I loved that about them. They have great sound but unfortunately the mic gave out on me and people were unable to hear me after sometime. I had to replace these twice and as much as I like the design and lightweight frame I am going to have to move onto a different brand.
"I really like these headphones. Great price, fair quality (metal and plastic). The Sound quality and mic quality blew me away for the price it's being sold at. Very lightweight and comfortable. The only gripe I have is that the mic won't stay in place. I would put up to my mount and eventually it would drop to my chin. I would've loved to keep them but will driving in my sim. I need no distractions. So I returned them.Pros:light weightGreat sound/mic quality for priceCons:The mic won't stay in place"
"I didn't like it. The headphones hurt my ears after wearing them for a few hours quite badly. You have to keep the microphone so close to your mouth that if you want to take the headphones off and just use the mic you can't, so you have to wear it around your neck, but that is also uncomfortable to the the huge size of the earphone part. I definitely would not recommend these."
"I bought 2 sets, one for myself and the other for my son. My headset worked great and still does but gis immediately started making a crackling noise in voice chat and would cut out constantly. Got it less than a month ago and ended up replacing it. I got the same model hoping that I wouldn't have the same result.The mic itself is incredibly sensitive and even with mic monitoring turned all the way down it constantly picks up background noise.The headphone possess very little bass capability."
"I initially really liked this headset. They are easy to wear for long periods of time and the sound quality is fine for my purposes. Unfortunately, I've had mixed results with the microphone. When using it to record into software like Audacity and OBS, I have no trouble with the microphone, but anytime I try to use it in a voice chat (specifically Facebook Messenger and Discord), I have been told I am nearly impossible to hear."
"My ratings are low but they’re a good pair of headphones, for gaming they sound ok really loud, but they bass lows kids are over whelming they’re too loud at times, and the people you’re playing with say you sound funny far away and not clear or (your $2 mic), haven’t listened too music just bought for gaming, they’re lightweight, comfortable but after awhile they’re not comfortable. You get what you pay for and based on the price they’re great, but I wouldn’t recommend them for gaming."
"Sound quality is outstanding. Deep, rich bass with crisp/clear mids/treble. Extremely comfortable. The price is More than reasonable, tbh, a little shocking for how great it sounds and the comfort. There is 1 problem: the mute control is on the side of the mic. Underneath the foam mic cover. While gaming I constantly have to mute due to eating, dog barking, cooking, maybe have to cough or sneeze, what have you. So, due to the inconvenience of the mute button, 3 star overall. It’s such a shame really."
"These headphones are extremely acoustically active, i.e. they ring like a gong. The slightest vibrations are picked up and echoed. If you turn your head, or your hair brushes against it, or heaven forbid you give it the slightest bump, you will hear every last detail very loudly in your ears. The complete opposite of what headphones are supposed to do.The worst is that sound is mechanically transmitted via the cord, so any time the cord moves it sounds like someone scratching vinyl right in your ear. They behave like those cup and string ""phones"" that kids make. If you turn your head, or move your arm, or do basically anything, you hear ""scratch, scratch, scratch, scraatch!"" The vibrations are even picked up by the mic, which can be heard as static by others if you're in a meeting. So you have to keep yourself muted, or hold yourself as still as a statue to prevent constant scratching noises from disrupting the meeting.These are really unusable."
"I bought this product with higher expectations but I realized it can't be a really good headset for only $25. The headset was light and comfortable on the head. My friends said the microphone was decent but I noticed I had to adjust the mic so it wouldn't pick up my breathing. As for the audio, I didn't enjoy it at all. There was no bass and the treble was very low. I returned the product and decided to spend a little more for a better product."
"The 3.5m wire is about 6 feet long, roughly?  And the wire is braided!  As for the fit, it is excellent. I have a large head,  and this thing goes on and off with ease, not much strain on the earmuffs or anything...  which is a problem I have had with other brands.  Honestly, for 25 bucks, this thing is great.  I have no complaints.  I guess I could say, the microphone is not detachable, but that would be nitpicky at this point.  The microphone has a goose neck flex, so you can bend it away from your face.  The sound quality is just fine.  Noise direction works, I have tested it in-game.  I'm currently using it to play 7 Days To Die zombie survival...  and hearing where the zombies come from is vital to my survival.EDIT : Update for May 2020.  The microphone no longer works."
My son's Turtle Beach headphones stopped working after 6 months. I tried to resolder the wire in the right ear piece but could maintain a good connection. These had good reviews so I took a chance on them. They seem to be better quality than the Turtle Beach 50x which were mainly plastic. These have good sounds but I don't think they seal out outside nose very well. The sliding mute switch works but it's a bit about because it's under the foam tip on the microphone. Why not just put a toggle button on the outside of one earpiece? At least it has a mute feature.Update 12/31/2019:On one of the ears the leather has come loose on the inside of the cup. I've tried to tuck it back up inside but it won't stay in place. I think it was glued and the glue has come loose. Very disappointed after 6 months. But they still sound great.
"Originally I thought these were fantastic, but after playing some games and comparing them to other headphones, I realized that the sound just isn't very good.  They are heavy on bass (50-200) Hz, but very weak and thin in the midrange.  The microphone is pretty good for gaming.  I probably won't end up using these.  Instead I'll be adding an inline microphone to a pair of Seinheisser monitor headphones (a more expensive option), but really the audio quality of these isn't passable for me."
"After using this headset for about a week, I'd say they're okay and was expecting better sound quality out of these. They don't have as much as bass, which was disappointing. It's really comfortable to wear for many hours though even for those that wear glasses like me. It does seem to cancel out some noise when you wear these and the mic is good enough IF you place it at the correct position away from near your mouth."
"loved everything about this headset, except the mic.  The mic itself does not stay where I move it to and constantly ends up pressing against my lips.  If the mic had more stability I would be keeping the headset."
"You get what you pay for. These won't do anything for you if you play video games and want noise cancellation, crisp sound or a comfortable, solid feel. It's just cheap."
"I have mixed feelings about this specific brand and set. They’re an amazing set, however, I’ve bought plenty for myself and gift. While their performance is great, they all don’t last the same. I’ve had some that last me a long time, months if not over a year and other that pooped within a week. With the exception of the new ones that only lasted less than a week, my other ones have been dropped dragged, bumped, you name it and they still work fine with a sounds inconvenience once in a while that easily can get fixed by unplugging the mic.I’ve bought a new set and I’m going to try to take pristine care of them to see how well and how long they last.Old review:I’ve been using them slight over a month now (4.5 weeks). Daily use with no problem, sound is amazing and mic worked to perfection. I even had contemplating in buying a second set to use for work. Well last week the mic stopped working randomly. Extremely sad because I said I use them daily and now I need to fine new ones. Give them a try if you want like I said they are great until they break. I wish they wouldn’t last longer. ☹️👎🏼"
"Except for the mic, I was pretty jazzed on it until my friend said I sounded like I was talking into a tin can (something like that). They were comfortable enough, something I was afraid of since most headphones/sets squish my head and cause headaches, didn't have that with these. At least not in as short of time as is usually an issue.The ear cups could be larger but worked out alright. I liked that the mic can be removed (it comes separate in the packaging, very easy to plug in) but the sound quality through it caused me to start a return unfortunately.I think this headset is worth a shot but it does seem like the mic quality is hit or miss based on reviews and my experience. I might try a set again at some point honestly.They're very nice looking also, and come with a (rather soft) storage bag to keep them in."
Bought these solely for my laptop but the audio did not go thru.Kinda wasted my money on this one.Looks and feels good tho
"Worked well with good sound for about two months, then slowly deteriorated by producing white noise that drowns out the sounds of your own voice. I would pass on this and get a mic that will last more than a couple months"
I have a Samsung galaxy smart phone  a52 5G and cannot get the headphones to work. Microphone works fine. This is my 2nd set after returning the first and the headphones are dead with no sound….Both pairs.I also bought the same brand in the 1000 configuration for my computer. Plugged it right in and it worked right away.Wonder what I'm missing……Vince
"The mic stopped working after 4 months of use. Tried the normal troubleshooting methods and ensured it was nothing wrong with my device.The headset itself has been amazing, however I don't believe I can justify paying the price again for a piece of equipment that lasts 4 months.Adding to this a day later; the right speaker just stopped all of a sudden the day after the mic stopped. Definetly a low quality headset."
"These headphones work with my son’s PS5 however he said that the sound quality is not the greatest. He said he sounds like he’s in a box, or like he’s talking through a drive thru window. But he is using them and having no issues.He probably would not reorder."
I likes the look and features this product demonstrated but unfortunately the product received was defective. Even plugged in to multiple devices there was no audio coming through the headphones and the detachable microphone did not work.
"They are not exactly good quality but they do the job.  As they say, you get what you pay for."
after a few months he mic out of nowhere stoped working and would glitch when used.
"Pos/ The headset it self is decently comfortable and my friend appreciates the game code I gave them. The mute button on the cord doesn't make a clicking sound that goes through the call/party when muting, that's at least what I've been told. Also purple is the current favourite color so I ain't complaining.Neg/ On both my PC and Xbox systems I've been told the mic is very quite. I understand if I join a call/party for the first time and I switch mics and it has time adjust itself, but this seams continuous. ""But what if you are just a quite player"", I'm not at all. When I get excited about something I get LOUD, but even when I do people still say the mic is quite. ""Could it be a problem with your system?"" No probably not, my old 20$ headset works just fine and no complaints about noise."
"After having these now for over a year I can say with confidence that the headset itself will last just fine, your real problem will be the microphone. Literally after a month or two it full on stopped working and hasn't worked since. Any headset with a detachable mic I'd be weary of but this headset in particular was just bad from the start. It's possible I got a faulty pair but either way just be aware when buying there's a good chance your mic will go bad within a year of use.Other than that the headset itself is probably one of the most comfortable headsets I've ever worn. It doesn't bother me when I wear glasses really, and it doesn't get hot. Noise cancellation is fairly decent but could be better. And the earmuffs have not lost their shape or comfort level since I bought them, still just as easy to wear."
"Got these for my Xbox X and the sound is just terrible. Sounds muted and can barely hear anything even with the volume turned all the way up, wish I could return them but I tossed the box :/"
"I bought these headphones *specifically* because they claimed to support ""3D Surround Sound""... They do not do this... When I asked their support staff about this function, I got the following reply:""Thanks for contacting us.We are sorry our headphones don't support Dolby Atmos. You can only use 7.1 sound with the driver.Thanks for your understanding on this matter.Best regards,CeciEKSA® GamingEKSA INC.info@eksa.net""So I am returning them... I am specifically searching for 3D Surround Sound for gaming."
"I had issues getting the computer to recognize the headset at first; and any other time they were disconnected for any reason. After the last issue, I could get some audio but not all to come thru and mic would not work. It was great when it actually worked."
"Nobody can hear me, in any game, on any platform whether it be Xbox or PC. The only positive trait is how incredibly comfortable it is.Garbage headset. And to say that it’s for gaming is purely false."
I like them but they get really hot to wear for more than an hour or so
"They have really good surround sound and I can hear everything when playing my game, only thing is it gives feedback when playing."
Absolutely horrible headset. even with the volume turned all the way up it is the most quiet useless piece of junk I've ever had. Do not waste you money
It broke in 3 weeks and didn’t do anything to the product
"These are cheap, these are budget, these are a random gaming headsets. I would expect them to sound bad, feel bad, fit bad but overall, I'm more surprised than anything.  Yea, they're built super cheap but they're relatively comfortable albeit super plastic-y.  The sound quality is better than expected, no where near audiophile level but for the price to performance they are pretty good.  If you need a budget pair of headphones, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
"They work good but they are not sound counseling, headphones"
"I bought these for my pc and the sound is wonderful on them but they are not compatible to my pc. I have messed with my settings for two days to get these to work, either the sound comes in and the mic doesn’t work or the mic works but the sound doesn’t come through, Never both at the same time. I was going to keep them and buy  different headphones for my pc and use these ones for my PlayStation but only the left side works with sound. Make sure your pc/controller can support these headphones before buying"
"When I say that this is THE WORST pair of headphones I’ve ever worn, I’m not joking. I’m a gamer, and I have used many headphones. Some cheap, some expensive, and some… dirt cheap. But this? This is BY FAR the worst pair I’ve ever worn, and here’s why?1. They fit horribly. They really hurt my ears when I wear them, so much so that I can’t wear them for more than 5 minutes. Either that, or it’s just that it hurts my eardrums because it’s terrible quality sound.2. The sound quality is AWFUL! I’m not lying to you when I said that my $8 offbrand earbuds produce higher quality noise than this heap of garbage.3. No directional hearing. How am I supposed to game without directional hearing? Once again, even my $8 earbuds have directional hearing.Now for the pros: uh, it has a decent microphone.Edit: these problems only happen when I try to use my microphone, but when I unplug it, the sound works… adequately. Still, why can I only have a good headset when the mic is unplugged? Plus, even when the audio is working, my $25 headset sounds better. Just don’t buy this, get another headset."
"The quality for price is definitely not bad, I’ll give it that. The sound is alright, but it doesn’t have that rich deep sound you enjoy in most headsets. The microphone is pretty good for what it is, and the fit is decent. It’s nothing to write home about, but it will get the job done. It was supposed to come with an adapter so it could be plugged in to a pc or laptop. Instead it came with a two jack adapter. Which would work fine in the early 2000s. But not now! Most laptops don’t even come with a microphone input jack and a headset jack. Maybe I got sent the wrong one, but it says on my order what I was supposed to get. Little tip, if you plug in a controller that has a headset jack port on it, you can jerry rig it to pick up the microphone and use the audio at the same time. All in all, I’m not happy with my purchase, but I can make do with it. I got what I paid for, which to be fair, is to be expected."
"These were cute and I really wanted them to work but they don't at all. I can't return and get my money back either. It's very temperamental, if the wire moves at all the audio cuts out and when it comes back the voice completely cuts out"
"The sound quality is actually pretty decent. Same with the noise cancellation, nothing ground breaking. The main issue is the mic. Trust me, as gaming headphones they probably won’t do to well. To elaborate, the mic only works when it close to your mouth. Any other time u can’t be heard which can be annoying.In short, if you just wanna have these in order to listen to music that’s fine though there are better picks. Due to the odd microphone, it lacks for gaming."
"Since it didn’t come in a package and no one was home at the time, it got soaked in the rain and the headphones are possibly ruined. It was supposed to be a gift for someone. I’m hoping they still work as I haven’t tried them yet, but I will be very pissed if they are broken."
"Not sure what's going on with these.  I have to crank my computer's sound way up to hear anything.  They're comfortable.  I thought it was odd that the microphone is detachable.  Let's hope it works.  I haven't tested that yet.  I have a different pair of these headphones, from this manufacturer, and have no issues.  Maybe I should have stuck with that pair - but I like the purple!"
"These headphones have really nice sound, and the mic works great. I really like how long the cord is, allowing me to not have to stay close to my computer panel the whole time, and I love the purple-and-black coloring. The ear pads and headband are soft, but the headset itself is small. It fits my eight-year-old better than it does me. The sides adjust a little, but even at the ""largest"" setting, it's still very tight. I cannot wear glasses with them at all because the headphones pinch them to the sides of my face. I've not had headphones be so snug before and not be labeled as for children. But if you have a smaller head, these headphones are great."
Wires to thin not good idea
I bought these for my son’s birthday and had them sit in the closet for two weeks before his birthday. And now he has only had them for less than two weeks and the mic doesn’t work already. We have troubleshooted for everything on the Xbox and have decided that this product broke in less than two weeks of use. Don’t buy this! It doesn’t last at all!And we can’t return it because it’s past the month date because of how his birthday fell.
Returned item back.  Sound not good quality.
"These headphones are very nice and high quality! The 3.5mm end just will not connect to my phone? Samsung A23 5G What's puzzling is that I have audio cords with the same 3.5mm ends that fit in my phone perfectly. I have called Eksa (E900's), I've called Samsung. I even called BOOST that sold me the phone! Nobody has an explanation. I couldn't get an exchange for a new phone cause I didn't buy their protection plan ( which was never offered)."
"Microphone did not work, had to return"
"I used this for gaming , they actually have good sound and volume but the static and echo when the cord is moving is so bad it take the good in sound to a zero in my book !"
"**UPDATE OF REVIEW BELOW**I bought this for my son for Christmas, he said they do not work well and preferred to keep using his old one even if it's all taped up and worn out.UPDATE - Since writing my original review of the product, EKSA reached out to me immediately to apologize and sent me a newer model headphones no hassle!  My son says these ones are great and he's very happy now!  Thank you EKSA for providing excellent customer service!"
"I bought this headset for my granddaughter to use while playing on the Xbox. Out of the box, the sound quality was really good and seemed very sturdy. My granddaughter used them, without issue for almost 6 months then the microphone stopped working.  It is too bad this happened. I would have liked to give this headset a good review."
"I bought this as a gift for my sons birthday. When he used it on his laptop (for video games), he was complaining that the sound was fuzzy. It sounds like a speaker that can't handle a lot of bass. We weren't able to get it to work but since I bought it just over 30 days ago I can't return it, so it was a waste of money since we'll have to buy a different one."
"I was happy with other versions of Eksa headsets.. so I hoped this would be good too. It wasnt. And it was a xmas present, so now that we finally used it the return window is closed. Seriously. Used them 4 times on online games and now have to buy a different set when i need them to play during xmas  with my sons. :/"
"At first they worked great, sound is fine and the mic sounded great. However the right side of the headphones completely stopped working. Tried troubleshooting and testing to see if it was just a user issue but clearly was just the headphones. Used them for only a few hours before issues started. Honestly pretty disappointed. If you buy these, be aware you may get a faulty pair as I’m not the only person with the same issue on here."
"This is the 1st time I have bought a cheap headset and got complaints on discord that I sound muffled, in a tunnel, underwater compared to my old headset.  I will keep these for an emergency spare, but I need to shop around and find a better quality mic.  (BTW I tried it with a mic mixer, and with and with out the ""boom"" on)"
"My son loved this headphones for gaming. However, within a month of use the microphone stopped working. The headphones still work and they are very comfortable, but he can no longer use them for gaming since he cannot talk to his friends."
"It’s a nice headset, it feels nice and sounds amazing, however, the input volume is horrendous. My friends say I sound like I’m far away or in a tunnel when connected to my PC. My web came mic sounds leagues better than this."
"They're not USB, with is a plus to me for a simple backup/go anywhere pair.  Big plus, there's metal construction on the head 'ring/adjust'  It's always the plastic parts that go.  So you ought to get some life out of them.  They don't sound great (maybe for the money) and they advertise noise cancelation.  Nope.  There's no cancelation at all.Good backup/who cares set, or with it's metal construction, might last a little longer before the kids ruin them."
"Bulky, staticky, and slide down. Uncomfortable"
broke within a month. so disappointed that i spent that much money for a headset that will break within 10 times of using them.
The mic quality is horrible especially in game.Sound no longer comes out of both ears.Sound quality is not directional. Lasted for 1 yr
"Bought two for my kids to use on their Nintendo switches. One worked when it wanted to. Had a lot of issues, and would've returned but threw out the boxes already. I don't think I would recommend this product to anyone"
"The headset design itself is great, it's very light and comfortable which makes it all the more disappointing that it doesn't work at all. My PC does not detect this thing at all, regardless of what input port I connect it to. Their support just says if it doesn't show up to double check the connection. It just has the one 3.5mm jack, it's plugged in, that's 100% of the things I can do to check to connection. Real shame cause again it's really comfortable and I wish I could use it."
"These fit great on my head, which is hard to do because my head is a bit smaller than the apparent norm.  However, the people I were talking to during the game kept complaining that I wasn't understandable because the beginning and end of my words was cutting out.  After changing several setting, increasing the input sensitivity, and doing all the troubleshooting steps suggested via a Google search I had the exact same results.  The sound was decent though and the fit was good."
"I’ve had this since Jan and it has worked for 6 months. I am out of the period to return and I’m very angry.  I did all the troubleshooting and the mic is still scratchy. I use these for my job! I’ll never buy this brand again.If you only need them for a couple of months, you’re good to go 🤬"
"Ambient sounds in the game I play are very loud and clear, but speech is incredibly difficult to hear.  These headphones are comfortable, but they definitely are not enjoyable."
"I bought this as a gift! And I found out that this broke 1 week after I gave it however because I bought it early to ensure I had my stuff here my return window is closed and cannot return! The child said the microphone piece came broken and one side of the headset broke within a week! Do not buy because now I’m out of my money because I cannot return! Definitely do not buy to give as a gift because you will feel horrible like I do, now I will need to replace the gift without getting my money back. Amazon you should not carry this product definitely below your standard!"
"If I wiggle the jack, ever so slightly, the left side makes sound. When fully seated, both channels come out of the right side. None of my other headsets have this issue."
"The sound quality is not great. I use this headset for Xbox and everyone tells me I sound like I'm talking through a walkie talkie. Not only that, I've had complaints of echoes and my friends can hear my sound through the mic even after adjusting the volume. For example, when I'm navigating through the dashboard or receive a notification, it all carries through to whoever I'm talking to. Sometimes I have to adjust the jack because out of nowhere, it'll just stop working. Not worth the money in my opinion. There are better ones out there for this price."
The mic always unplugs and makes this weird static noise idk why but the sound isn’t the loudest as well so I wouldn’t recommend
"When my package arrived, the box was already torn open and seemed to be damaged (You can see some wear on the flaps in the picture). I was disappointed to see that these headphones are a little too small and aren’t adjustable to fit on my head. Sound quality is alright, but not the best.Also the mic has some reeally crunchy quality, I think it‘s pretty funny."
"The price was good for what it is. A wired backup headset for when my good one dies. It functions as expected, but it’s nothing special."
The sound quality is great however the microphone did not work at all.
These things are junk. The sound goes in n out n the background noise in videos for some reason is louder than the person speaking and you can't hear them clearly.
"These seemed like okay headphones, a little cheap feeling but to be expected for the price. Be aware, however, that these are NOT fully compatible with the Nintendo Switch- the microphone will not work. It took getting the manual to realize that these were not going to work."
"DOES NOT WORK!! CAN'T WORK WITH PS4 YET MY OTHER HEADPHONES DID. AND YOU CANT CHANGE OUT THE AUX CORD TO USE FOR A LAPTOP. THE MANUAL DIDN'T HELP, I TRIED EVERYTHING, THEY'RE HORRIBLE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I AM SENDING THESE BACK FOR A FULL REFUND, TOMORROW. ASAP. AWFUL."
"Bought them in April and they just crapped out on me-- lasted almost a year, but I'm not spending money for planned obsolescence, I want headphones that'll work.Liked the volume adjuster module on the wire, but hated how the HUGE rubber around the headphone jack meant that these headphones could never plug into my phone with the otterbox/""heavy"" style phone cases on it. That's a problem I've never had before, and it was very frustrating.The fit was nice, as was the sound quality. Not amazing/work changing, but nice for thirty bucks.Enjoyed them while I had them, but I'm probably gong to seek something else out."
The cable that comes connected to the headset was creased with a significant indent and does not produce any audio
These aren't very comfortable.  1 hour of having them on they put too much pressure on my head and caused me a massive headache. Sound is quite poor as well.
"I have no idea why this happens, but everytime we use these headphones, anyone else playing games with us can hear the internal audio of the PC that these headphones are plugged in to. We have tried switching to default audio settings, changing the audio settings manually, plugging the chords into the front and back of the PC. Nothing works and I have no clue why this would be happening. We haven't used them for anything since."
Sound quality and noise canceling works great but I wear glasses and the headset has no adjustable parts for how tight they sit against your head. So by the end of the day my ear pieces of my glasses have been dug into my head and hurt.
"Save up for a decent pair, these worked fine for 4 days but didn’t work at all after that. If I could give ZERO stars I would"
There are a lot of things that I like about but the sound quality is not great.  Maybe if you are 20 and a gamer you don't care about that - maybe - but I do care about it and this does not make the grade.
Its sound is really good and so is the mic but my only problem is how lose it is when i plug it into my laptop. One little twist and one side works or if it gets bumped even just a little it gets unplugged.
"Note: Utilized the headset on the PS4 only.The volume in the right ear muff is lower than the left.  If you have the Playstation settings to feed all audio to headset then the microphone is lowered. The listener in the party chat told me my mic is low. The mic settings within the console were set to middle to avoid feedback. No change was made to mic settings when testing these. If I set the PS4 to chat only with the same mic settings then the party members can hear me clearly at normal levels. With these headsets, it feels like it is an either or option. The design is nice and I was hoping this would be the one."
The description of noise canceling a lie and voice control isn’t great… basically buy cheap you get what you buy
Sound quality does not exist. You keep hearing a sound reverbation echo.
"Tried these on and listened for a few minutes, but ended up returning them. They feel really cheap, aren't very comfortable (pushed uncomfortably against my head) and have zero noise cancelling. The sound is fine but really generic sounding, like airplane headphones. You could spend $10-15 more and get something significantly better.All of this is a real shame because the purple color is absolutely beautiful, and there aren't many nice-looking purple headset options."
Long wear while wearing glasses in very uncomfortable
"I figured out the mic mute button didn't work after using it for a week. I muted, coughed and the person I was talking to asked me if I had covid. Embarrassing."
"Comfortable and works ok. But makes your voice sound funny, almost robotic."
"I saw the rating and expected better quality, super cheap, plastic. Not noice canceling and I wouldn’t recommend if your looking for a heavier headset with high quality audio."
Did not last long at all. Broke right away.
"I ordered these headsets back on February but I did not receive them until March when my fiancé brought them all the way down to my country for me (Nicaragua). I started using them until April after he left and I had to go back to my normal stuff. From April up to last friday July 15th everything was fine. I put them on this morning (07.18) and they suddenly have a weird background noise on the left side... Mind you, I only use these for working and barely use them to listen to music when it is too late at night and I dont want to be  loud. I feel upset because I was expecting these to work fine for at longer than 3 months and a bit.never ordering them again."
"This headset does not connect to my PS5 even though the box says it does, to make sure it wasn’t messed up, I tried them on my PS4 and they connected, don’t buy these if you have a PS5, it’s not the worth it"
"The sound is fantastic, but after going on website, downloading drivers, etc., I still can't get the microphone (one of the main reason I picked this particular headset) to work. I'd recommend purchasing locally for better customer service"
Don’t buy this for ps5 it doesn’t work
"Bought these mainly for the microphone, as I spend a considerable amount of time on calls. Quality was hit or miss from the beginning, and after just over a month of use, I am already having issues with the headphones playing sound-- sound will sometimes just cut off in the middle of a session. Would not recommend overall, save your money for a better product."
"Worked fine, until it didn't. Both pair lasted less than a year."
"I use my headset for work and for my hobbies. I wanted to try this headset because the price seemed pretty good. Unfortunately, I got what I paid for. Words are no longer clear and after going between my old JBL headset and this one, people say I sound much clearer on the JBL headset and fuzzy on the EKSA. I think I'll just store these as back-up headphones when I'm between good pairs."
It almost killed my gf i bought it for her as a gift. DO NOT BUY FOR YOUR SAFETY. It short circuited on her head.
"Don't waste your money. After about two weeks of use, the wiring at the plugin end was breaking and you would loose sound until you wiggled it just right. Then if it moved you lost sound again. Around the plug in the device was designed to let it move back and forth. No matter how much plastic you cover a wire with, if it bends back and forth enough it will break. Even my 11 year old granddaughter recognized it as a design flaw. I ended up just putting it in the garbage. What a waste!"
Best for a toddler to use for hearing tabletAdult use is not an option with theseThey are horrible for adult gaming
I love how it sounded and how comfortable it was around my ears. Only problem is that it stopping working after couple of weeks. I wasn't able to talk or hear in my game chats.
The noise is perfect when you can actually hear them
Bought this headset and it arrived on June 1st 2023. I didn't get around to setting it up until July.  Since day 1 the mic was weak and could barely be detected. I contacted the seller over 10 days ago and still no reply from them nor any acknowledgement.  The sound quality isn't much better.  It's really subpar to anything I've owned previously.  There are a lot better choices around for the same money that actually stand behind thier products.
"Broke after less that a month of use. Didn't drop it, throw it, and have been gentle the entire time, but can no longer her center audio"
"They’re decent, but sounds are quiet compared to other brands"
I had rather have the microphone part on my right not my left.  Just a personal preference.  Great product for my money.
I JUST got these and the first day of using I’m having sound issues. Sound is cutting out its choppy. I’ve also had it cut out my friend talking and make a loud buzzing noise. So loud to the point I had to take my headset off.
"Sound quality of the headphones is good, but the mic is very fragile and broke within a month."
"it does what it says on the package for the most part: noise cancellation is fine, fit is good, the lights are fun (though you have to connect them via usb which takes up a usb slot but i knew that going in so no big deal). but when i try to use this mic for gaming (speaking on discord especially) which is what it is marketed for, like other reviews mentioned it is quite hard for others to hear me unless i raise my voice, which i cannot. the issue just seems to be that the mic starts pretty far back (circled in picture) instead of being at the end of the mic ""piece"" (where the red light is). also instead of being able to bend the mic closer as needed, the plastic near the top holding it to the headset itself doesn't bend. so you can't really move it closer to your mouth to solve the problem.it works, don't get me wrong, it isn't broken or defective; but it's not working for in game speech which is ultimately what i bought it for. that just seems to be a design flaw more than anything else. personally, it's more trouble to send it back since i'm moving so i'll hold onto it until i can replace it.TL;DR - if you are gonna be yelling the whole time you're playing, this headset is good. otherwise i'd look for something else maybe."
It works well with PC Xbox and PlayStation the bad side of it is that it will pick up every sound and make an echo through someone else’s side
"The headset has solid audio quality (though, I'm not exactly an audiophile), but don't expect a long lifespan on these. Had a nice, snug fit for the first couple weeks, but after that, it started expanding and was at risk of falling off my head if I moved too quickly.More importantly, however, was the fact that, just a couple hours ago, it completely died. Up until today, never had any issues with regards to performance. Then, in the afternoon, I start hearing occasionally audio crackles and a constant buzz. And then, while I'm in the middle of gaming, there's a loud snap and the audio goes completely dead. Laptop is still picking up that something is plugged in, as do my phone and controller, but no audio comes out and the microphone doesn't pick up anything, either.I've only had mine since June—so, about 5 months—and I haven't exactly been harsh on it. Too bulky to wear out of the house, so I pretty much only used them for gaming and listening to music on my laptop and consoles. If you pick one up, make sure you have a backup headset/earbuds/etc. on standby."
"These aren't good, but they're okay-ish. They certainly defeat the purpose of buying a full headset.My last set of headphones were Beexcellent; cheap, Chinese knockoff headphones, and they were really good. Studio quality noise-reduction, theater quality sound, just the best.The sound is good. I'm still able to write music and hear what it sounds like just fine. Obviously, they work fine for watching movies and playing games. I will say the sound is a little bit hollow, but I got used to it pretty quickly. Nothing else on this headset is good, though. The mic is good enough for playing DnD on Discord. It's fine for that. Recording sounds for sound-effects or my voice for actual use in music is awful. I only ever did it as a joke, anyway. My singing voice isn't the best, so I only used it for joke songs. The mic isn't good enough for joke music. Which s*cks, because I loved doing it.But the real egregious thing about this headset is the controls. The design of the controls is fine. It's a switch to turn the mic on and off and a volume slider. It works is the only good thing I can say about it. When you turn the mic on and off, people listening hear a loud bang, like a lightning strike, and when turning mic input on, it takes around two seconds before it will actually transmit your voice, so you can be talking and people will miss the first half of your sentence. This is inexcusable when recording, not just for the lightning storm this thing causes, but you have to use this because if you don't, OBS is still going to pick up your voice even if you've muted through the chat.The worst part is that if you're listening to a video, or something on Spotify or what not, the headphones transmit it directly into any voice chat or on any recording platform you're using, no matter what. This is for watching movies and single-player gaming and it will work for that just fine. For any kind of chat, the mic is terrible.I'm keeping them as a backup set in case my current headphones go out. I do not recommend them for anything else. The mic would actually be better if it were completely useless."
"They are very bulky, the audio is good, the microphone input is ok, but the auxiliary is too short too fit in most ports like phones, radios, computers, mp3 players and PlayStation controllers. And the base of the auxiliary is too thick to try to use with any sort of case you try to plug it into. The USB part works unlike like auxiliary but it is loose no matter where you plug it into. I do not recommend these if you need the auxiliary."
"So, I’m a little upset with this headset mostly because it has a bit of a problem when using it for my PS4. On the pros end: very good at noise cancellation, very comfy, and simple to set up and use. Cons: I now can confirm that this headset has given my original and new controllers for my PS4 some kind of virus or bug or something like that. Because I thought maybe because I threw my first controller and it popped inwards on the one side a bit that it was buggy because of that. However, I have never thrown my new controller and it has started experiencing the same thing my original is experiencing. It has caused both controllers to glitch by moving from the highlighted app to the next thing above it. And I have experienced it in games too as it will cause the character that I control to move up/forward at random and I have no idea how to anticipate this bug in my controllers now. Now the other con is that the wires are extremely long and get tangled in with each other so easily, not to mention when in a rush to talk to friends that it does not make it easy to set up extremely fast like you overslept for work and forgot to set an alarm. And the last con to this is that a lot of my friends eventually can’t hear me a bit too often and I tried everything to fix that by going into the PS4 settings or even going into it manually. The only way to fix it anymore is just to unplug and replug the audio cord until your friends can hear you. Overall, I can’t say that this is the best headset for anyone that’s looking for quality than looking for looks. I really do love the rainbow colors on the sides of it but it has infected both my controllers with something and I can’t even just do a reset on them to fix it at all because it does nothing to them. Love the looks but hate how it’s made gaming hard for me."
"This is a great headset when it comes to audio, but I did notice a few flaws that happened while I owned this. First problem was it was really big looking on my head even with the adjustments on the top of it. Second problem was the mic kept falling down and it would stay in a certain place, and it got really annoying that I just had to end up leaving it down."
"Headphones are great but microphone picks up lots of background noise.Not great for phone calls, especially with phone systems that want you to speak options"
"Lol, so the overall looks are great! I like the lights a lot (+1 star). Sound quality is great and makes me feel immersed in the music (+1 star). I expected more sound cancellation for $40 headphone, but was kinda disappointed (-1 Star). The mic was a bit hard for me to get to work, and the mic switch fails to work immediately despite being a wired headset (-1 star). The package came late even with prime, but it's not the seller's fault so there's no need to deduct stars for that.  Otherwise, the headphones are great for gaming and chilling (+1 star)Small blurb of my experience below:When it comes to inputting the cords into the PC and testing the mic, there were some struggles. As said in the instructions, I made sure that all the cords are tightly plugged in and set the PC sound input/output to the correct speaker and mic. Speakers/output are fine. I flipped the mic switch to On. The ""test mic input"" function on Windows PC showed a small bar, meaning that there was barely any input. I tried testing this on Discord and their ""test mic input"" function. How it works is that discord takes any sound input and plays it back to you. Discord was able to detect my voice, but could not play it back to me. **This might be a Discord problem and not the headset.** I tried this on Facebook and Zoom, and it didn't detect sound either. Switched to different devices and worked fine. **so maybe it's a PC problem and I'll look into that** After some struggles, I was able to get the headset to work. So there's no more complaints about that. The only issue that still persists is the mic switch on the cord. When I turn it off, it immediately mutes the mic. However, when I flip the switch on, it takes 5-7 seconds to calibrate/process and start detecting my voice. Because this is a wired headphone, I expected the on/off mic switch to work immediately."
"Honestly I bought this because it was cheap and had lights. I haven’t had any issues with the headset itself, but in order for the lights to work you need a USB port on your controller which Xbox series x controllers don’t have. Bummed out it doesn’t light up but all in all, worth the price and happy with the quality of the headset."
"I ordered this headset about a month ago because voice chatting with my friends was a fairly frustrating experience with the headphones I have when I use my laptop. I ordered these because the price was good and so were the reviews. Up until the time I'm writing this review, I've had no problems. They work great, they're super comfortable, and my friends don't complain about my sound and it was a very good experience. Now, the problem. I see my friends in voice chat and I plug in the headset to start talking but my bubble isn't blipping up. I check the settings, nothing. I go to the settings for my laptop, nothing. I plug it into my phone and turn on voice-to-chat and there's still nothing. I hadn't used the headset for a week but they were working just fine before. After every use I put the headset back in the packing as I got it for safekeeping but how can it magically malfunction after nonuse? A headset with no mic is just glorified headphones so I'll have to figure something out, sadly.UPDATE: It's been a few days since I've written this and it's fine now, I guess. I think it was just having a momentFINAL UPDATE: Yea....the mic went out again. I have used it multiple hours a day almost everyday since the last update (in about April or May). I have contacted the company about the warranty but no word as of yet. The mic hasn't been working for like 2 weeks now and I've only had the thing for not even a full year yet. I lowered the rating to 3 stars because even though I really love this headset it's just irritating to have the mic go out for such a long time. As stated, this is my final update and I hope this is helpful for someone!"
"I got this knowing it wasn’t going to be the best quality given I only payed $20 for it but I really wanted a mic for when I decide play online. Overall, it does the job. My friends can hear me fine and vice versa, however the sound doesn’t go as high as I would like for it to or as most usually go. It is definitely NOT noise canceling as I can hear my husband on discord perfectly clear while I’m playing. Lights are cool but note that they only come on when plugged to a PC (assuming the PC has more power output than a controller) but no biggie for me. Lastly, these aren’t the most comfortable headsets I’ve ever had. They’re not unbearable but there are definitely better products out there. If you’re okay with not getting 1000% quality and just want something to do the job you want for a cheap price, these are okay. I plan on using these until they decide to KO but I probably won’t buy these again."
I have a big head and it's still very bulky
The mic is really good and the cord is upside down the sound quality is great and the calue its given is good its really wasy to use just plug it in and have fun the issue i have is i bought the neon light version where the lights come on the sides and that does not work at all
Plz only buy if you are looking for something cheap and are not looking for quality
"UPDATE, seller did respond to correct the issue. Upgraded stars to reflect service.We've had this headset since Christmas, 5 months later the microphone stopped working. Tried reaching out to customer service and the email bounced back and has been unreachable."
The cord to the port had a short . Not the best not the worst
It was not a great fit for me. Did not connect to my Xbox 1s. It's big and bulky. Never hooked it up to use.
Not good..would Not purchase again..not worth money.. dollar store worth
These look really cute but they broke within a month. The plug already had a problem when I bought it. I had to turn it a couple times in order to hear normally than static sounds. But the worst part about all this besides it breaking was the mic. I sounded like I was being suffocated with a pillow. In my Xbox parties no one could ever hear me no matter how loud I turned my volume up or how loud they turned me up. At first I thought it was Xbox but when I got a PC it had the same issue...
They work well its just that they are VERY uncomfortable to me and do not feel good.
"The Sound quality is overall okay. However the mic quality and comfort is very poor. The mic often cuts out randomly, or is very quiet. The headphones themselves feel like wearing a bulky piece of plastic, and it doesn’t fit around ears very well, disrupting the sound a bit. Another thing I noticed was how long and bulky the cords are. It makes it very uncomfortable  for controller play because the cords are at least 1.5 feet and just sit in your lap while you play. Like I said earlier, it’s a 20$ mic so you aren’t really getting anything great. I recommend you buy a mic that’s around the 40$-50$ range, which can seem high but they are often much better quality and will last years. Hope this helps!"
"The sound quality is amazing, just wish i can say the mic was good. It's very quiet and people can barely hear me. It doesnt really pick up my voice at all which is a shame. It's really nice though other than the mic being quiet!"
The headphones work really well but if you plan on using the mic as well do not buy this. I had these for two days and it made me extremely quiet before completely dying.
"The headset works, like I can hear through it, but no matter what I do, I can’t get the RGB LED lights to come on. It doesn’t take away from the actual function of the headset but it was one of the top reasons why I purchased this specific headset. Definitely disappointed. 3 stars only because it functions, just doesn’t light up as advertised."
It's okay but the mic doesn't work
"This was a gift for someone and the person using it claims that none of his friends can hear him when he talks even if we pick d the correct headset for pc. Overall it has a nice design/look to them, probably wouldn’t use for a pc gaming mic."
"I bought these headphones in September, and one ear has already stopped working. They never move from my desk, so they haven't had any crazy wear adn tear, and then yesterday one ear stopped working. Also, even for $35, the sound quality is kinda garbage."
"I was excited to receive these headphones after ordering. They appeared to be awesome for the price.They are comfortable but a little heavy. The LED light feature is cool but… unless you are using a computer or a power source for the usb that powers the lights, they’re kinda of useless. I also noticed when powering the LED lights, it caused a feedback in the headphones themselves. The sound quality is pretty decent however, they’re not very loud. The non cancelling is pretty good as well but again, the speakers themselves aren’t very long.The cord seem durable yet because of that feature, it causes the cord to constantly get tangled up in knots.I’m returning these and ordering a different pair but wanted to give others a more detailed review from my experience."
"The sound quality and compatibility of this headset is perfect! I've used it for PS4 play, work via PC, and gaming via Laptop. The headset itself is incredibly comfortable and it definitely helps block out noise around the house. My only issue with this headset that's preventing that 5 star rating, is how quickly the audio jack has shorted. It took less than 30 days for it to start getting picky on how it sits. Children to not use this headset and I'm careful to keep my cords from being bent often or under extreme stress, as well as taking care to on pull and push the jack from the hard casing rather than the cord itself. I expect more life out of a headset before experiencing this issue. Other than its a great headset.... just not great enough to spend $25 a month on"
The maximum volume was the same as a 5/10 on the dial on my previous headset.
Could hear static and mic didn’t work. Didn’t last
Amazing product my kid loved it just that they shipped it on a bag and actual product got damaged in the inside the bag other then that great product 👍 really recommend
"So I figure headphones are headphones and buy these. They play sound fine and record fine, but I hear a whirring noise while wearing them, but fortunately the sound isn't in anything I record."
"I went to extend then right earpiece and it came apart and ripped out the wires, this is a very horrible mad product and wish I could get my money back because this product is a complete rip off and a scam"
"It worked perfect for the first couple months.  Now it doesn’t allow me to talk to anyone.  (Yes I’ve tried MANY ways to fix the problem.).  I can hear them, but they can’t hear me."
"I have had some issues with this headset shortly after purchase but I could not say whether it was due to poor craftsmanship or because my puppy took a bite out of the mic. Either way I could only hear on one side shortly after. I'm thinking the mic wouldn't affect the audio but to be fair I had no issues before that.It lit up the room creating a cool disco like ambiance together with my other RGB lights. The sound quality was acceptable and gave good sense of direction and distance in racers, RPGs, and shooters. I did not think much of the mic quality as i purchased a USB mic shortly after (this was before my dog bit the mic) and the headphone audio would bleed into the mic creating feedback for my listeners in Discord, Skype, Zoom, games, and on stream."
It's good quality for the cost. It's LEDs keep me up at night sometimes. The only place it fails is the cord. It's stuck in knots and refuses to become untangled. It's formed into such a way it cannot be straightened again.
"Headphones work well and are pretty durable. I have found that the mic settings can be finicky, and it should be known that in order to use the LEDs you have to plug into a separate USB. When the LEDs are on, there is a slight buzzing sound which is really disturbing to gameplay or audio"
"This was a fantastic headset until something happened with the wires a couple days after the return window closed. We did play with them daily for the month that we had them and they were working perfectly. When you plug them in now, you have to hold it just right to have sound. Otherwise, the sound goes completely out if you move wrong, which is frustrating. I’m giving three stars because for the price, they should have lasted longer."
The (3.5mm for audio/mic & USB for headset lights are intertwined at the end of the 6ft cord. As the pictures show after they intertwined they are both about 6 inches. It's impossible to plug the USB for headset lights into the console & the 3.5mm jack into your controller unless your PS5 is in your lap.The headset seems durable however if you have a big head like mine they will be really tight on the ears. I adjusted my headset & after 2 minutes my ears were starting to hurt from being to tight.If you don't care about the lights & only want them for the audio see other reviews since I never used the headset.
"Started out great, now the volume won’t increase and the speaker is not very reliable. Works half the time. Would suggest spending more money on a product that is better made."
It hasn’t worked since I got it I tried to return it but they wouldn’t take it over rap this product isn’t worth the money or time.
"The ear-cups are much too small. I have fairly average-size ears, and most headsets fit me just fine, but these only cover about half of my ears. It really hurts after wearing them for just a short time. I regret my purchase."
My son used them for about 2 months after getting them for Christmas a few times per week for his XBox. The connections came loose and could not hear. The connections are so small it’s impossible to fix. Very cool headphones but won’t be buying again.
The mic doesn't pick up sounds unless yelling directly into the mouthpiece.  It does not pick up normal voice.  I have to pull the boom and headset off my head right in front of my mouth for it to pick up sounds.  The noise canceling cancels out normal speech.  Piece of crap.  Don't waste your money.
Honestly when I bought this I thought the USB was a all in one connection port which I wasn't. I could care less for the RGB LED lights. the sound quality is pretty mediocre its standard quality and is too overly hyped. the audio connection for the mic was ok and pretty simple. the mic attached to the headset is too short and the quality and sound from the mic in some programs are lack luster. mic gain is too low and its built on the foundation of cheap Chinese manufacture parts that i would advise not buying and look else where. even though i get a product Protection for free its still not good enough. i felt like i was ripped off more than provided a decent product.
The clip over the microphone makes it hard to be heard.
"Not great quality, if you have the lights turned on there is a weird buzzing sound that comes through the headphones that is really annoying."
"was inexpensive & shipping was fast & i needed quickly in a pinch. Sound quality in both headphones & mic is poor. I do a lot of gaming & talking with friends in discord, everyone sounds muddled & flat on my end. People on the other end say my voice sounds like I'm in a tunnel. Unfortunately these will not work for my needs for the long run so a waste of money. Will not buy again. Do not recommend except maybe for kids"
My son really wanted gaming headphones and did the research on his own to find these.  I read some of the reviews and everything seemed good so he purchased them.  He was very happy with the purchase with one exception.  None of his friends could hear him unless he shouted into the mic.  Fortunately he is using Windows to play games so I was able to correct this by going to the Sound properties and adjusting the microphone boost by 36 dB.  None of the other headphones I have used with this computer have needed this and it wasn't intuitive at all to change this setting.  I don't know how it will work if he tries to use these on a different system some day.
"It might say it somewhere, but they do not glow if the usb cord is not plugged in, so they don’t work with controllers. The audio does just not the lights. But then the cord and extra usb wire are bulky and awkward. The real reason why I am giving two stars (and returning) is because there was a loose part rattling in one of the speakers. Every movement of the head and it’s super loud."
now the headset isn't all bad it works well when plugged into a pc  the sound is fine  but the mic still lags so id  say while the mic needs work along with the sound output for Xbox is not an overly bad headset just has a few things to work out and fix  but overall i enjoy the look and feel of the headset because its at least comfortable  but it needs some work for its console and mic performance
"The RBG lights only work if the usb is plugged in. The sound quality is distant - much prefer my Turtle Beach Recon 200. Its not $1 earbud quality, but onn headset quality. The headset is tight and the oversized ear pieces make the tightness push your jaw actually. Yes it has a USB splitter - but there is also a lot of cord - too much cord - I will never be further than 2 feet from my ear to controller; this is just extra cord to roll your chair over and break or get caught up in when you are going for the dub. I am 5'2 and the cord is longer than my wingspan. The volume doesn't actually go up that high. Yes, while USB is plugged in it looks cool but 10 out of 10 if this was the only product available for same day shipping and I had the opportunity to buy it again - I would not. I will still use it when my other one dies and for work while I have a new one coming but I will seek any opportunity to not use this product again. TBH I don't even knw how I will store this with all this cord."
"I bought this headset when my turtle beaches had the whole mic and earpiece just break away.. the plastic just gave out after 13+ years of use.The sound quality from the headset is decent, especially for a 20$ headset, but the mic is awful. I had to shout to be understood by people in my chat, and the stem for the mic is short and stiff, which compounds the bad mic.The mic for this headset is so bad that I Frankensteined my old headset back together with surgical tape until I could afford a new headset, and I have fully disregarded this one. Its sitting in a box, nearly as useless as my old one.Do not buy this if you need the mic to talk to people. You will not be heard."
"The headphones are comfortable and the nylon cord and volume dial on the cord is a great feature. However, the sound regularly goes in and out and the LED lights do not work on the pair I received. It seems like they may want to increase quality control on this product."
They are nice and big but there is a shortage in the microphone you have to move and wiggle a certain way for it to work
Worse headset I ever used. The audio quality is terrible and the mic didn't even work.
"there is no input cable for a microphone, the usb is only for lights"
"This headset is nice. The downfall is that if you use it on a console, you cant plug in the usb lights because it makes a buzzing sound everyone in the party can hear. The cords are long which is nice but they get in the way. The padding on the ears is comfy, but not glasses friendly. It does sit kind of tight on your ears which is great if you want noise canceling, but you honestly cant even hear yourself talk.This headset is great if you like to play by yourself and dont wear glasses. Otherwise the LED feature is useless because of the buzzing sound it makes that everyone but you can hear."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It's been 16 days, and idk. They're alright. They make a weird noise from time to time, but I just unplug it then plug it back in. That fixes it. But it is annoying. If you want to use it in your phone really quick, you can't if it has a case. But it's good."
"They work, but they're uncomfortable if you wear them for more than 10 minutes. The wires are stiff, long, and annoying to deal with. Sound quality is fine, but nothing special."
"When I got the headphones, they were working just fine at first but after a few uses the sound started cutting out in one ear. I had bought these headphones as a gift for my brother for his gaming. But he is upset that now the headphones has randomly stopped working all together a few days ago."
"I bought this headset because my 10 year old boy loves gaming but I’m on a budget. The first one was damaged and they sent a new one fairly quickly. He loved these and could game for hours with his friends. However, it’s been about 3 months and the microphone no longer works. He can hear people but they cannot hear him. I looked it over and the headset has no visible damage to it. I tried it out and had the same issue. He has gone back to his original, uncomfortable headset for now until I can get a new one."
It worked well for the start. Then now not even a month old the sound is warped. It’s not portable. It is a bit big if you have a small head. And they aren’t really adjustable. They were great the start but now there is a ringing in the right ear.
"i ordered these for my daughter to game with based on the good reviews and the price. first off the box came looking a bit squished and the cord was all tangled inside so maybe this was a previous return? anyhow, once plugging in first my computer didn't even recognize them-then when i finally got them to work, all they did was give mic voice echo and feedback into the headphones! no matter what we did-we could not get rid of that sound! positive things- lightweight  cool colors nice braided cord and good price. we ended u returning them and my husband got her some razer ones. def worth their price for amazing sound and quality. sorry"
Sound on these is very muffled
Got these for me and my best friend who at the time only played on Xbox. They worked fantastically on Xbox I could talk to her and hear her just fine. Hers just stop working after awhile though. And as for mine we tried using them on my new pc and I can hear her just fine but I literally can’t talk to her unless I hold the mic right in-front of my mouth even with the wire to split the mic and sound I still couldn’t talk to her. But when my father uses it for video calls on his laptop it works perfectly fine. Hope this helps someone in considering this headset.
"These headphones are okay to say the least. They were not very loud and I could barely hear the game, but I could hear my friends while gaming. I was expecting much more from these but you get what you pay for. A kid would be happy with these because they light up, but it’s not worth it to me."
Only thing my daughter doesn't like is that you have to plug it into a USB port to get the lights to turn on. That extra cord kind of gets in the way of gaming. Would have been better to have the lights come on with the cord you plug into your gaming remote or even batteries.
"Mic stopped working just 2 months after the return window closed, how convenient. Only had for 3 months before needing to replace, don’t waste your money"
they are use and not new wtf ill be calling to get my money back
"I absolutely love these headphones... until they decided to not play ANY sound. The lights work on them but there isn't any music whatsoever. It just doesn't make sense and it sucks cause I really enjoyed the headphones. Their actually over the ear headphones and they have great sound quality with decent bass for their cheap price. I'm not mad, just disappointed."
"Sound it great for games like call of duty and others. BUT, the mic for some reason will constantly be on trying to pick up your voice vs picking up your voice when you talk."
I can use the mic but i canr get sound from discord on it at all. Tried everything
"These were recommended to me by a friend who has them so I guess I just got a defective set. First of all, there was absolutely no sound in the left earpiece. I made sure everything was connected properly.  The sound in the right earpiece was staticky and I had to physically hold the jack in the plug to get the static to stop. I ended up returning them."
"I'm not sure if I just got a faulty pair, but audio is hella buggy. There's a high-pitched ringing sound in the backroom if I have nothing playing, which is lowkey annoying asf. The lights are prettttty, but for me these headphones are not it. My old pair, the pink ones, are broken, but they’re amazing in comparison. A lot bigger, more comfortable, and the sound quality is better, as well as the mic, and no annoying ringing in the background. Lowkey feel like you could get a better set at 5 below 💀 ignore my chair, gotta get a new one LMAOO"
"Had to return they are not very loud and for the lights to work, they have to be hooked up separately with another USB, making a heads up very heavy"
"Says compatible with Xbox one, yet can’t get the mic to work at all. Totally worthless. Not sure why these have gotten 5 stars, unless people aren’t using the microphone. Stupid and returning basically immediately"
"I like tha audio, but the mic doesn’t work."
"I would like to see this product redesigned.  It has potential, but the earpads are too small and are incredibly uncomfortable.  I also wish it was usb only and that an auxillary port didn't have to be plugged in as well.If this was more comfortable this would be a 5/5 for the price.  However, because it hurts the ears I have to give this 2 stars."
"Good quality headphones and mic, but the cords get kinks very easily and are impossible to get out. Kind of annoying since it makes the cord short"
"It is a good budget gaming headphones however my only two complaints about this headphones: you'll need to plug in 3 separate wires for mic, speakers, and for the asthetics of the led lights and my second complaint is comunicating with other players you can hear them but you gotta have to yell at the mic otherwise other players wouldn't hear you."
Just got this thing today and the mic sounds like static to other people. WTF!!!! Made in China junk!!!!
The color changing light is interesting but it’s snapped on one side of it. Need more durable headset. This is definitely very plastic and cheap.
Not the best quality. My son enjoys that they light up but the mic broke within a week.
Need help connecting them nothing is working.
They sound a little low but the colors are awesome.
"Audio is fantastic, better than my last headset, however the mic sounds like I'm in a bathtub and the coord refuses to not tangle itself up regardless of how straight I try to train it to stay asGood for when I was near broke but hand-cannoned my wireless headset into the ground, but not using longterm"
i JUST bought these NOT even two months ago. they already stopped working cuz the wires so fragile. my $5 earbuds lasted a year tf. scam
I wish the mute button worked but other than that played a full day of gaming and it was comfortable
I bought the white ones over a year ago and they worked perfectly until the cord gave out. The black ones have literally the cheapest microphone I've ever used. No one in any of my lobbies can understand the audio from this mic. I e had them for days and cannot stand how bad the mic is. Constantly repeating myself is very tiresome
Son could hear others but others couldn't hear him. Tried them on the computer and Playstation 4 and didn't work for either
"I didn't buy it for the looks so, I'm not all that dissatisfied about the lights not working. Sounds good but definitely not noise canceling. It also fits pretty snugly."
The foam is super hard and makes this very uncomfortable to wear for longer than 5 minutes. It's cheap so I guess you get what you pay for with this.
"Something happened, probably a circuitry defect, and now the right side constantly loses sound or has reduced sound. If I tap it a little bit it can temporarily work again but it goes out every few minutes or even more. Usually I enjoy HyperX products... but since they have all their products made in China I'm not surprised there's issues with quality consistency. Cost of getting a cheaper product. Most of the time it's fine -- but you're always risking a lemon.I've not had much luck with headphones (even my expensive $500 set had cheap plastic on one part that broke which results in one side just flopping without any stability. Due to how there was a metal piece tightly jammed at that section and how the headphone was designed to retract/expand it's almost impossible to fix. It just slides too easily preventing anything stable. Even when fully taped it eventually loses the proper angle and goes back to feeling incredibly uncomfortable even if usable. Still going to try to figure out something (since it was so expensive)... but I regret my purchase. Rather have spent half that and gotten something better built. Tbh the sound quality was worse than a $100 wired headphone I had.But lemons in general get at most 3 stars for me. Just a waste of money."
Ear padding began flaking off after 12 months. One side started having audio loss after 18 months.
"The headphones are overall good, but the right speaker died after two years."
"The audio is totally fine, the fit is very comfortable. My online friends simply tell me that the microphone generates a grainy audio. I tried the headphones with the mic cover and without, and they stated it sounded marginally better without the cover, but my laptop's built-in mic sounded better to them, ambient noise and all."
"Bought this to replace a headset I thought was broken (but ended up being something else). That aside, it's comfortable, it sounds good with both voice from the mic and the sound in the headphones. The biggest plus is the ear cups. They are not that crappy pleather stuff. But quality cloth/cushioned mesh material. Which will last WAY longer. Wish more headphone makers would use this material!Update: I have now had this since Sept. 2023 - and up until this point, June 2024, it had been good. But this week, I started having issues with the headset - mainly the right earpiece losing sound occasionally and I now hear static when I adjust the volume button. I'm not sure if there is a loose connection between the left earpiece where the cord comes out to go to my computer - and the right headset, where the volume control is. Very disappointing, and I can't return it at this point as it's been about 9 months since I bought it. I suppose I could reach out to HyperX and RMA it maybe if they have a warranty - but then I'd be without a headset. :("
Junk not working that good
"The sound it self is ok, like most gaming head sets way to heavy with the base. also just a little bit heavy but about normal weight to the head phones. They came overnight and look decent too so that’s a plus. my number one issue is that these don’t feel good at all. i’m really praying my ears get used to it and adjust but as of rn they padding is to short and my ears feel as if im sleeping on a plastic pillow. definitely for the money these were solid but just wish they were better on my ears."
"When I got this headset it was fine. The ear cushions are soft, the audio is clear and the microphone is crisp. However, after a couple of uses the audio started messing up. At first, it would cut off and I couldn't hear anything. I had to shut my controller off and then back on again for the headset to start working again. I thought it was my controller at first but then more things started happening like really loud static when any audio comes through the headset, making people sound like robots, etc. If someone asked me if I would buy this again, I wouldn't. This is a regrettable purchase. I'm shopping for yet another new headset. Waste of $42."
Purchased this model to replace a wireless one that recently stopped working. Static sound when the volume is to high and can be annoying when adjusting sound or mic settings.I'd say it's okay if you need a backup or budget pair.
It's ok for the price
"it's actually not bad. the audio is good and it's super easy to use. however, the microphone doesn't work for me. so if you need a mic, just buy a bluetooth or usb microphone :)"
"- mixes audio with desktop noise for some reason- after 4 months of use the right headphone sometimes stop working.- the only reaso I give 2 stars and not 0.. its because the microphone is not that bad, and the headset pillows are comfortable.. but I dont recommend you to buy this, is not good..  better go for the non-cloud version of it.."
"First of all, I love HyperX. The sets are comfortable (which is so important when you're on the phone for 12 + hours at a time as a Triage Nurse), sound quality great, plug & play spot on, and it's the only brand I trust after trying multiple brands. I thought the 80 hours listed talk time... great! We get a LOT of calls. BUT. The doggone set shuts itself off constantly. I just cannot have that with my job; lives are literally on the line. I can see trying to save power, but I have to shut my set off and back on after every call to keep it on in case there are a few minutes between calls. I'm still sold on HyperX and will just buy a different style. I'll keep these as a desperate back up in case my sets get run over by a car or something."
"Do your self a favor an get the upgraded version of this for $30 more, you’re going to have buyers remorse the second you put this on your ear"
After testing out these headphones they were actually unexpectedly good. Really good crisp highs and mids and fairly low base. Not sure about the mic quality just yet but just with the sound quality alone it was worth leaving positive review. Unfortunately the package was opened the inside was dirty.  I would have returned them but Amazon drop off location is quite far from my apartment.
"I bought this headset six months ago, and it was great for most of that, but now the battery lasts a few hours at most. This obviously defies the point of having a wireless headset, and also makes the fact that it is about twice the price of the wired version a complete waste of money."
The headset is really comfortable and light weight. But after a month of use the mic started to slowly go out to where now no one can really here what I'm saying. Just sad it couldn't last two months.
"The microphone quality is not the best. I discord call all the time, and my friends say it sounds like I'm talking through one of those clear phones you had in the 90's-00's. I recommend the Sony-INZONE H3's, but they aren't budget friendly."
"Sounds might sound weird for the first time, probably because of 3D function...  I would say Microphone is very bad. It worths if you have no need for good microphone. Looks good tho."
", the cord is flimsy and will too easily twist up like an old 70's phone cord so I deduct 1 star for the sheer aggravation of untwisting it constantly, anticipating the cord will go bad long before the headset does.Update edit: Removed another 2 stars from original four star review, just as I feared the flimsy cord that is always twisting up developed a crack in the middle I taped it but headset just quit working, worked great while it worked but not worth the money if your looking for a gaming headset that actually 'last' IMO."
"I bought these because I just wanted a decent headset with a decent microphone.  The problem is that no one seems to be able to hear the microphone whatsoever.  It might be defective, I don't know, but it barely transmit my voice.  The sound quality is alright but less than I would expect even for $40.  Headphone speakers have been decent for decades, even for the cheapest ones, but these are subpar.  On the other hand, they are pretty comfortable.In addition to that, the splitter that comes with it is not great.  I dislike the entire headset."
"My wife liked them a lot. However, the microphone started failing to where she was having to constantly repeat herself in game regardless of setting. Looks like they only have a 30 day warranty whereas others have at least a year.Probably won't buy this brand again."
the inside of the headphones has this thick plastic ridging covering the actual speakers (see photo). it rubs against my ear cartilage painfully unless i very carefully position the ear cups in a way where the top band is uncomfortable. my ears stick out probably more than average but nothing crazy.also the noise isolation is pretty bad and the sound quality is reminiscent of the free earbuds they give you on flights
Fine headphones but they pick up my computer audio. I can't talk to people without game audio leaking in. Not Ideal.
"I got this headset because I had the Stinger 1 and it was decent. The best thing about it was that it was very comfortable, to the point where it almost felt like I wasn’t wearing it. I was hoping this one was going to be like that too. It wasn’t bad as far as comfortability. But the bugs/defects are what turned me away from this headset. For starters, the microphone was so low, even turning it max on all programs still wouldn’t do anything. I had to download a software just to get it to work. Occasionally, I noticed whenever the audio playing at a certain decibel, the audio would shoot up to ridiculous levels that you can’t even manually reach. I would need to take the headset off when that happens if I don’t want to be deaf. Although, I should’ve expected some of this stuff for how cheap it was. Overall, I’d give it a 5/10."
"I don’t know why people are gassing this product up. I thought this was a simple plug and use item, clearly not. People say they can barely hear me and I either have to talk louder or switch to something else. This goes for in game and other uses like discord."
"The headset sound quality is really good for the price, but the mic is very quiet, and nobody can hear me well."
The battery life was terrible and the mic was terrible. Got constant complaints about it and ended up throwing it away because it broke. 80 bucks and this lasted 3 weeks. Never buying hyperx again. Cheap chinese knock off brand and it ain't worth it.
"Honestly I was super excited to buy these and try them out because they had so many good reviews. My last headset was pretty cheap and old so this was a nice upgrade. Unfortunately the top part of the headset sits a lot of weight and pressure onto my head that it gives me headaches. It’s to the point where I can’t even use them comfortably without feeling headaches or pain. Also started noticing that the sound becomes crunchy(?) which hurts my ears + the mic is pretty quiet when you talk to others so keep that in mind. Overall was disappointed, I wanted to liked these and they are solid quality. Just didn’t work out for me."
These headphones are comfortable but other than that a pain to deal with especially on pc mic didn’t work for me I tried everything.
sounds good but sometimes mic is very quiet and no one can hear me very good
The sound quality is pretty good. Although the microphone is so bad I’m forced to get a new headset.
"Hyped reviews, wherever they came from, were misleading. The device is functional, but I appreciate sound quality. As a former DJ and now casual gamer. I know there's better out there. Actually, thinking about using my DJ headset, throwing a MODMIC on it, and calling it  day."
"The sound quality is really good and if that's all you're looking for you won't be disappointed. However, the built-in mic is bad. I switched to these from a 5 year old pair of steel series headphones and people told me I sounded like I got a McDonalds drive through mic to talk on."
Microphone could not be detected by windows 11.  Tried all the suggested fix information to no avail.
"This headset has great sound quality and all. The negative point about this headset is that it disconnects randomly at any time. The USB disconnects for no reason and now it is not working anymore. I restarted my PC, but it only works temporarily. I tried using it on a different PC and it still has the same problem. I consider buying something else besides this."
"Went from decent sounding to pure treble in a matter of month, gonna just get some logitech headphones now."
sounds fine feels fine. but it disconnects so often i think im going to have to buy something diffrent
"Advertised as an Xbox headset, it is NOT. Research your headset and look at reviews before purchasing!"
I bought it for my 11-year-old son. The USB adapter is so big that you cannot leave it on the laptop.  And there is no hole to put a rope or a strap to keep it safe. It is made for losing. And my son lost it in one week. The manufacturer should make it small enough so that we can leave it on the laptop or make a hole in it to put a strap or rope to keep it safe.
"Both the mic and headphones don't work. Tried updating my audio drivers, restarting my PC, even downloading their app. Nothing worked."
All of these headsets have terrible mics. All of them. So if you don't stream as a YouTube personality..get it for talking to friends in games.But its no good for live streams.
"I loved this headset until the right speaker began to fail after 12 months of light use (when you adjust the volume with the knob on the right speaker, it cuts in and out). It gradually worsened over 2 months to where the right speaker doesn't work at all. Mind you, these are well cared for. For the price, this headshet should last longer than a year."
Comfortable but sound quality is average at best. Volume is low even when you max it . Recommend you look for other option's.
"Headphones are comfortable, but that is literally the only thing that is good about it. There is no bass at all, only treble. For any competitive FPS game, this is absolutely useless, all sounds blend into one sound, and you can't identify specific sounds or from what direction the sound is originating. For instance, if you play Escape From Tarkov, you will not be able to hear footsteps from further than 10ft. and any voice in-game is inaudible from more than 20ft. Other reviews claim that these are good for FPS games, this is a complete lie. Microphone quality is poor, mic monitoring while not present in the product, it will not adhere to software changes to the sound gate. Honestly, words can not describe how displeased I am with the product and the quality of the product. I figured they wouldn't be the best since they were cheap but a pair of $15 dollar apple earbuds are immeasurably better. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
Bought these after they were recommended by a coworker. They are uncomfortable. I wear glasses and the part that covers my ears hurts because it presses against my glasses. They are bulky. Super bulky!
"Only had the headset for two weeks, and already the sound is gone. It started to get lower and lower, before complete silence. I thought it was my Programs and Windows, then my hardware, but found the headset to be the culprit. Other headsets were tested and working fine. I know they were cheap, but two weeks?! I guess they were just rentals."
"The product was perfect. Unfortunately, the headphones that I bought for my son won’t admit audio on one side. Unless u want to end up like me out 60$ spend the extra money and get a better headset than this. Customer support won’t help you either, Thank you."
"It wouldn't click anymore so I couldn't turn them on. Worked great. Comfortable, great sound, battery lasted forever. Just that dang ol button, which happens to be one if the more important buttons."
"This is the worst headset I have bought, the volume is very soft and not loud, the surround is horrible the headset itself is cheaply made and looks generic unlike any other hyper headset I’ve bought overall 1/10"
"Horrible quality, broke instantly less than a week"
"The first thing I noticed is that the ear cups are extremely shallow and the speaker grills crush my earlobes. Never had that with any pair of headphones in the past. The microphone is also completely unusable. At 100% mic sensitivity and Discord's sensitivity maxed out on both ends, no one can hear me. They say it's like I'm barely whispering. I can usually find some redeeming quality for a product but this one is a complete waste of money."
the white noise in this headphone is too loud and it irritates my ears
"One of the worst headphones I have ever bought, always pick sup audio from computer no matter what."
We bought the wireless version and I purchased for use with an Xbox series X. It is not compatible with Xbox and I wish I did more research rather than reading questions/answers on Amazon.
The originals are so good and I’ve repurchased them a couple times already. I bought these when I needed a new pair and the warranty was up…. Returned so fast. I do not like the material around the ears.
"These headphones are very comfortable, and seem quality, but even with the sound all the way up both on the headphones themselves and the Xbox audio controls app, and in game audio turned all the way up. The headphones are extremely quiet, to the point where you can not hear what someone is saying if there is any background noise at all. Also the 25 character code that was send for the DTS X sound app was unredeemable even though it still had the scratch off untouched. Dissatisfied with this purchase to say the least."
The aux entry is way too fragile cuts out too much
"Headset worked great for about 2 months. Then the dongle just quit. Tried reseting, downloading driver updates and undownloading drivers. Nothing worked, led for the pairing on the dongle doesn't come on. But it does indicate on the pc that it recognizes something plugged in. Very disappointed probably won't go back to hyperx, support is very unpleasant."
Right side started fuzzing and became quiet
You cant even hear my voice with this mic because how bad it is
"If you need a headset and use Discord, avoid this one. Tried everything I could find to try and get this mic to work. Apparently this is a known issues."
I have had this headset for a month and the mic stopped working and there is nothing I can do to fix it. I have used other headsets and the mic works fine but for this one none of my friends can hear me.
"This headset is pretty comfortable, but it does not last. I had it for well under 6 months before it started having audio issues. Every time I would use the volume knob the audio in the right headphone would go in and out. Eventually, by the time 12 months had come around my microphone was getting quieter and quieter."
The headset requires an activation code for DTS Sound Unbound (which it comes with a 2 year one) to function properly otherwise it has awful sound.  Never before I thought I would be face to face with a SUBSCRIPTION headset!  This is awful in every sense of the word.  The mic also sounds very cheap and muffledSubscription to use a headset or hardware in general; what a terrible corporate strategy
Came without the extension so now they are just a pair of headphone.
"Swivel-to-Mute Function Is not working, even if i put it vertical my mic is still working."
Wish I could get my money back. The mic is terrible. Can’t even hear game volume it’s super low. Tried everything and it’s still super low. Please don’t buy this. Wish I can get my money back
not worth the money
"get something else, mic sucks, no audio control  0/10"
Mic cuts out and does not work.  Ive never had more issues with a mic and i hate the long cord it comes with it is way too long. My last headset from this company was so good and im extremely disappointed.
It was working great for a good solid week. People that I was in a meeting with complement how crisp the sound was compare to use of my AirPod but it no longer works. Disappointing
"What's there to like about this headset? Nothing.Yes it's lightweight, but it makes them feel cheap. I like a bit more weight in my headsets I guess?The sound is tinny (even after some EQ tweaking) and the mic is really hit or miss. It works fine in some apps, and in others it's utter garbage.Returning these ASAP."
Bought this for my son to use with his switch. It stopped working after a month.
"Sound stopped working after the return window was over. Very bad, Do not buy!"
Audio stopped working 2 weeks after return window closed. Bunch of BS
audio sounds like you spilled water in the headset and mic is really temperamental. it's like russian roulette on whether or not the mic will pick up your voice.
"Stopped working within about two weeks. Rather surprised, given how great old Hyper-X headphones used to work."
I did not receive my entire purchase.
"I'll grant that these are comfortable, although a bit heavy. That's the only good I can give it, as they lasted just almost 4 months before the right side audio started to crackle and pop in and out. They are cared for gently, never tugged by the cord and rested by the band when not in use. There is no visible damage, looseness or defect that I can find on the cord or connector, so somewhere internally the wiring to the right ear cuff is just suddenly on the fritz. For the cost and brand name, I'd certainly expected them to last longer than just 4 months."
It’s trash. U can’t even move over the mic when ur not trynna use it.
"Pretty good headset til the mic stopped working after only a couple months. Had 2 hyperx headsets, one wired one wireless. Both crapped out around the same time. Mic failed on the wireless too. Sound quality is still good on both but can’t be used for gaming anymore"
The cord is already having problems and I literally got it less than a week ago!! Please avoid these garbage headphones.
"Bought these to replace my old Turtle Beach PX11s.Pros : Liked the 50mm driver. Sounded good... Comfy.Cons : Let's talk about the mic problems... Incredibly quiet mic. Mic volume is also controlled with the sound slider on the ear of the headphones, you turn down the volume and you are also turning down the already dead quiet mic. I turned up the mic to 100% and also turned up the Mic Boost and it was barely audible. On top of that having no USB input and only 3.5m jacks was also a disappointment.If it wasn't for the quiet mic these would be pretty good and I would probably be using them right now instead of these old PX11s. However a mic is a main component of a headset so these get a failing grade."
Sound is okay but not that comfortable and the on and off button get kind of annoying as you have to hold the button for like 5 seconds to turn it on every single time.
Total waste of money mic is just horrible
Outside sound interfaring ur experience
Terrible quality product that doesn't charge well. I charged this thing for a total of 8 hours and received precisely 3 hours of usage before it stopped working. This thing will lose all charge during the day even if you spent all night charging it.I will be avoiding this entire brand from now on - simply terrible.
"Purchased this for my boyfriend to game on console, it started working good however the audio goes in and out at times like the set loses connection to controller. Other than that it's a nice piece, mic works well, very easily to use and set up, feels light."
"They worked medium well with Xbox, (connected to controllers by audio jack- never got the usb connection to work) and they lasted my 8 year old 9 months. Is that good? I don’t know. I won’t buy them again, I’m looking for something wireless, cuz the cord and my son did not get along."
"The fit of the headphones and the ability to adjust them is good.The sound quality is good, however, three months into using them they began to pop, and distort the sound. The cord has to be in a certain position for it to be clear again.Overall it was just ok. My Last headset was a $25 one from Amazon as well, that lasted 10 years."
"Good for the price, $20 for a headset is hard to beat, but of course don't expect more than that.The mic cable that connects to my PC is failing, so I got no audio, luckily I just need to connect them to the controller and problem solved."
Decent headset especially for my younger son. What i didn't like was the usb to make the headset light up is connected right to the headphones jack wire so unless your usb port is next to the headphone jack you can make the headset light up.
"It wasn't the best thing in the world. The sound quality was a little tinny and the fit wasn't fantastic, but it's also a budget headset so what do you expect? Good quality for the money, but I gave it away and bought a Logitech G432 instead."
Headset works and everything but it doesn't light up at all like it says it does.
Daughter said its too tight. She has a 12yos child's head.
Player be warned; the audio pretty good but its microphone is very short.
The earmuffs are not very comfortable. The bottom presses more than the top of the muff so my earlobes and head get sore after a bit of gaming. I don’t run my cans too loud but my friends can still hear bleed from them back in my mic. The sound quality is good for the price. Not a much low end. The cable’s jacket seems durable and is almost too long for controller use.
"My son uses these for gaming. The mic broke off. Pretty disappointed. We had to replace, went with a different brand"
"My 7 year old uses them for his switch and the audio is fine. He hasn’t had a chance to try the mic, but the lights don’t work. Just a small detail but I can’t find anywhere to contact the seller about this so I’m leaving this review and if the mic doesn’t work, I’ll send back."
These are good.
"The only mediocre part you'll get is the audio playback. This is not for sure the headset to buy even on a budget. If you are doing YouTube recordings, then the headset is trash. As I'm recording my voice, it picks up the computer sounds, everyone talking in the background, even my dogs barking."
I like the wired in idea but the sound and mic quality are very poor. Probably would have returned it if I was still in the window kind of poor. I get better sound and mic from my cheaper wireless headphones.
The lights didn't turn on. Mic worked fine
"The product works fine,BUT it hurts my ears to wear them. They are uncomfortable (even if they wouldn't hurt).The product comes with one AUX cable and a split adapter (to separate audio and voice). That adapter did not work. Fortunately I had another one lying around from a previous headset that was actually functional.I wouldn't recommend buying. In general I'd recommend buying headphones somewhere where you can try them first"
Sound 7/10 comfort 6/10 but quick 2/10 the thing that plugs in my controller some how bend so it just broke and i always took good care of it
So my main issue is the fact that the USB cord is attached to the single port which makes the whole thing uncomfortable when I use my controller for my consoles. Maybe the next model adds the USB to the splitter?
Breaks easy
"The headset does what it advertises in terms of noise cancellation. It's a bit heavy and wearing it initially gave me a bit of nausea due to how well it seals and the air pressure, but you get used to it. The thing that makes it horrible for me is that my computer just straight up doesn't recognize the microphone at all. It's plugged in correctly, but the computer does not sense a microphone to utilize, which was going to be its main usage for me."
"it fits on my head perfectly after adjusting it, the audio isn’t the greatest in my opinion because the volume is so low even on MAX and I’m used to loud headphones and when I turn on the microphone I can hear myself which is annoying but besides the everything else is good about it would I recommend? No."
"Kinda bulky and uncomfortable, the sound is good. There is no setting between voice and game volume, it’s all in one"
"The microphone is not that good quality. The voice does not transmit properly it’s very low. Others can’t hear me very well on the other side. The ear piece is ok. The sound  isn’t as loud as in my other headphones. I would not recommend these, there are better alternatives."
"This was a replacement to one that never worked, and the mic cuts out  constantly. Wouldn't recommend.  We've purchased 3 , and I won't buy another one."
"Mediocre overall but nice for the drive, durability unknown at the moment"
"So when I bought these I really need some headphones with a mic on it the mic broke Within 7 Days, I'm going to see if I can return it."
I really liked this design of headphones but i mostly excited for the lights that it says it has. Unfortunally for me it actually does glow any lights whats so ever. But still very useful.
Sound and lights stopped working after a couple months.
"Had this for 3 months and it stopped functioning properly.  Was very delicate with them, took good care so they would last and 3 months later you cant hear out one side and the mic doesn’t transmit.  No warranty or return available, wasted money."
"I’m currently writing this while eating hot Cheetos but this headset is alr, you buy what you buy, rgb only works if you plug-in the usb and the audio isn’t that great, microphone is very sensitive but I mean it works so yea, also breaks pretty easily and not too comfortable"
They stopped lighting up after one day and the mic seems to pick up every sound around you according to my viewers. You get what you pay for I guess. I may increase the stars if they reach out and offer a replacement.
The mute button keeps going on and off
"Got my maybe 3 months ago already the audio connection with the aux cord has stopped working completely, and the usb connection never worked to begin with. Absolute garbage do not waste your money get something built to last."
The mic Worked for a day and then decided not to anymore. Sound is great though.
Audio tends to echo to other players when your speaking
I bought this for my boy and within 2 weeks it was broke. Glad I didn't pay a fortune for the headphones
"No matter how much I adjust it, I find that this headset squeezes the heck out of my head and I'm left with a migraine within the first half hour of wearing them.Sound and mic quality though is great esp for the money. I don't have a big head or anything so idk why it hurts me tho."
If you buy this product it should only be used if you can plug it straight into your console or your PC if you use it on a controller the jack disconnects frequently if you barely even move. If the controller jack worked the headset would be great.
"Where to begin...a waste of cash. Not adjustable, I should say, barely adjustable. Just enough to fit around your head, but thats about it. Can't wear for more than 10 minutes without it feeling like my ears are in a vice... Also, why? Why is it you make the ear piece the hardest plastic you can find, but then also make it to where it doesn't cover the full normal ear. Maybe these are headsets for toddlers, but certainly not design for gamers."
Works great.  Not noise cancelling
These broke within 3 months. My son uses them for gaming and they slowly stopped working until they just quit altogether
My son stated these headphones are not good for his Xbox. He says he hears an echo and the quality is low.
The adapter to plug these into separate plugs will mix the speaker line with the microphone line so that any sound you're listening to will echo back through the microphone leading to lots of feedback if you're on a zoom call or something similar.I had to return mine.
The sound can go in and out based on how much you move the cord. Usually fixes it you unplug and plug in a few times. The look is really cool and comfortable though
Returned product because the volume seemed to be too low for some reason. Tried everything to turn it up but it wouldnt get louder. No other issues with it besides that.
"I have an xbox controller and the first day it didnt work. I plugged it in and the sound kept going in and out and it never worked. sound goes in and out, its too big and hunky and just a waste."
Sound great but too bulky for me
I’ve had this for not even a whole month and it already broke
Sound only works on one side of the ear it isn’t really that good.
Brand new out the box and the headphones don’t light up
"Thought the price was pretty good and I like the quality of the mic and sound.....until it stops working. Haven't been dropped nor was it pulled, but move your head the wrong way and the sound STOPS. It lasted 2 weeks ... Most expensive 2 week headphones I ever brought."
The headphones are trash didn’t work and they was brand new had to send them back and go to GameStop to get a brand new pair
"First of all, it works. Audio rarely is in stereo. Have to fuss with the volume dial A LOT to try and get it to work. And unless you have a USB extender cable that's at least 10 feet long, the lights are just pointless, and you have a mess of wires just dangling there. Spend a few more $$$ and get something else"
I just bought this for my son in January.  It's already broken.  Not cool. Not happy.
I ordered this for my son. The 🎤 gave out on it within a month. Poor. Comfort was okay. Sound started going out. Cost too much for the quality
Bought this for a Xbox one and none of the cords fit. It's not compatible for Xbox. It has been returned and we received a credit right away.
This item worked and then stopped working. Then the mic completely went out. It was barely used. Of course the return window closed a couple days ago
"mic just stopped working 34 days after purchse, so now its a $28 paper weight"
It arrived with a shortage in the wire!
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I have a Xbox one it says it’s compatible but the usb is different., I can’t really use it."
Not compatible with Ps5
It’s not compatible With PS4. There is no mic don’t buy you’ll be wasting your money
"The microphone doesn't work 50% of the time. When it DOES work, it picks up EVERYTHING, including sounds in the headphones."
Didn't work like I thought it would. But it was cheap.
Not recommended.  My son used these for less than a month before they stopped working.  No sound just static.
The lights don't work on them they are trash I just brought them and need to replace them the sound goes in and out they just a waste of money
Headphones volume low and gives echoes when you talk... Mic too short
I didn't have it long before the mic no longer worked. Lights don't turn on anymore but sound still comes through. Barely even had the chance to use it.
"Came with a tattered box. Figured, okay, maybe the headset works? Wrong. Only one ear piece worked. Absolute trash."
"I bought this a few days ago as it was time for a new mic, excited because of the RGB and the reviews I purchased this mic. It was great for 2 days and then mysteriously stopped working. I am now back to using my old mic because this one couldn’t hold up for 2 days? Never again with this brand for me."
"Sounds like I am under water, terrible purchase"
The quality is terrible.  I purchased this product 2 different times.  The mic blew out in both of them.  Don't waist your money
Sound and Mic stopped working in just two weeks of use.  Was hoping for something better than the gaming headphones at 5 Below.  Nope
"For me, I have a console, but you have to plug the cord into the console and the controller, and you have to be around 2 inches away from the console so it can work. Never buy this."
"When I received the package it was incredibly damaged. The sound quality is poor. It does not connect to PC but does work for PS5 just not very well. Overall seems like a lower quality, ehich is surprising for the brand. I read others reviews and they made it sound promising. However I guess I was the odd one out."
"Headphones didn’t work upon opening them, neither does the mic."
I bought these so I could have a replacement headset for gaming. I tried them out and they were worse than the old ones. The sound was muffled and the mic cut in and out before just breaking.
it works with in game music but when i tried playing music with spotify it kept breaking out didn’t play music smoothly and it doesn’t get loud at all. wouldn’t recommend.
"In my opinion, this head set no good for xbox gaming."
Barely works just a bad product overall don’t buy this headset
They were nice at first but it's only been 2 months and they've already gone out. Would not recommend.
Bought this for my sons switch and the Mic never worked.
"it picks up the audio from the game and the audio is very faint and can barley pick up ur voice , you pay for"
They have never worked great but the connections quit working after less than a month. Don’t waste your money. They are total crap.
"Product arrived in a damaged container, the left side of the product didn't function entirely and the quality of the audio in general was poor. Completely disappointed."
Not sure if I just got ones that don't light up but that's what it's looking like
This item was bought for my daughter and the quality is bad. The microphone doesn’t pick up good at all. Cheap and definitely cheap made
Terrible - don’t buy it
The headphones only last 4 months. Not used a lot by son and stopped working.
Never worked. My computer picked it up but never got any sound out of them. This was the biggest waste of money.
Got this for my 11 year old son. Not sure if I just got a dud one but he could barely hear a thing. The volume was all muffled
The sound quality on these headphones is awful.
Stop working after a few months
DO NOT BUY unless u want head phone that is not good
It didn’t work. The power cord is also so short . Never buy this
Left ear pieces sound was messed up. Sound is awful and harsh. Avoid. Returned.
"Product was received as a family gift, but otherwise, I would personally NOT spend $40 on this. Feels more like a $25-$30 product to me.Sound Quality: 3 stars out of 5.  -  It’s fine/ok but overall flat sound ( Expected a lot more for the price tag of $40 ) Headphones tested with Xbox Series X controller, iphone, and iPad. If you’re playing on the Xbox, make sure you fiddle with the Xbox’s chat and in game audio in the xbox settings first/while you’re playing. That way you can set the mic volume and game volume to your liking.Mic Quality: 4 stars out of 5  -  Players could hear me fine and players with the same headset on, I could also hear fine.****( If you’re playing on Xbox, make sure to fiddle/change the in game/chat audio to your liking in the actual Xbox settings not just in the game your are specifically playing. The specific game you are playing might give you options to change audio/chat, but this is NOT the same settings as found in your Xbox settings. Make sure to look at the settings in the actual Xbox menu settings. Don’t forget to do this or you’ll think your headset is defective. )**Also, the mic doesn’t have an actual button to mute/unmute, but instead let’s you move your mic in and out of the way and it makes a click to let you know it’s off. So mic in your face - mic on. If you pull the mic back towards your ear = mic is now off.*You’ll know if you’re mic is on or off by listening for a click as you’re moving the actual mic back and forth from you’re face to your ear.Some people might like this mic on/off functionality, some people might prefer a button. I’m indifferent towards it, but I figured I would describe it here.Build Quality: 4 stars out of 5.  -  The sound is underwhelming, but at least the build quality “so far” seems pretty good. Slight squeak when moving/adjusting headset but not unbearable. The padding is soft and it does NOT sit on the ears and instead over them (that’s good/your ears will not hurt). Overall I have played a few hours (1-2 hours at a time) with them on with no issues. No fatigue or discomfort.Overall: 3 out of 5I’m a casual gamer, so this headset will suffice, but an actual gamer might want better.My primary issues with the headset:  Unimpressive sound and price tag for what you get. The mic and build quality is fine, but sound just isn’t where I would expect it to be for $40. It’s unimpressive and honestly disappointing. Sound is flat and mediocre and overall, the build quality for me is not enough of a justification for a high price tag.Would not recommend at $40Maybe at $25-$30, definitely not $40."
"Bought last year for Christmas for my son. He is asking for a new pair this year because the sound quality is not what he expected and it broke. In his words ""it ws my fault, I took it off my head in a poor way and broke the part that holds each headphone together."" He was happy it didn't break any wires and he taped it together until he gets new ones."
"Lets start off with the pros.- The sound on this headset is quiet good.  It is a bit punchy on the lows, but the mids and highs still come through well.- The volume levels are also quiet loud as I found myself running this headset around volume level 30 on Windows compared to closer to 50 on my last two headsets.- It has decent battery life.  I have done 12 hour gaming session with these and didn't have any issues.  I haven't had the headset long enough to know if it will work through multiple sessions, but I am also good about putting my headsets on the charging cable every night.Now for the cons:- Cheap plastic construction.  I was actually a bit shocked at how cheap these felt when I got them.- Stiff and uncomfortable on the head and ears.  The foam padding does something, but I found myself needing to take off the headset every so often after a couple hours to give my ears and head a break.- Volume slider has some issues.  There is a delay between when I finish turning the slider and when the volume stops changing.- Poor range.  I can't go more than 15 feet away from the computer or have things between myself and the computer without the headset disconnecting.- Longer charging time compared to other headsets.  Some headsets I have had in the past could get 2-3 hours of runtime out of 15-20 minutes of charging.  I had these die on me pretty quickly after getting them out of the box, so I put them on the charger for around 30-45 minutes while I did some housework.  This only lasted about 60-90 minutes of runtime.  To get the good battery life, you need to let these charge overnight.  This can leave you without a working headset if you forget to charge them.Overall, I would say this is a decent entry level wireless headset for the sale price I got them at (~$50).  However, I would not advise getting these for the listed retail price of $79.99 as I think there are better options at that price point.  Even at the $50 price point, you might be better off getting a higher quality wired headset due to the comfort problems I outlined."
"Bear in mind, these are not horrible headphones, they are just not good ones when you compare them to the almost identically priced HyperX Could Flight.Some background:I purchased several units of the HyperX Cloud Flight headphones a few years back for my employees.The Cloud Flights were/are so amazing and are near perfect in almost any dimension.I disassembled one unit just for fun and discovered that they comprise over 40 parts + 32 screws, all put together in the most intricate and well-engineered design. Built to last. Their sound quality is good, they are very comfortable, they sound good, and they have taken a lot of abuse and have returned so much value over the years. A real tool for the job. You can check my review of them here on Amazon.More recently, I made a few purchases of these headphones - the HyperX Stinger Core, after my personal trusty Cloud Flights broke (after 3 years of constant daily use for hours and hours, being tossed all over and not handled particularly gently). The reason I decided to buy the Stinger Core was simply that the Cloud Flights were no longer available in my location. And I'm unbelievably unimpressed with them.The build quality is very low, and the intricacy of the design, which lacks directional swivel is odd, to say the least. The cups do not have a rotating mechanism, which means the cups stay firmly where they are and do not swivel as they do in the Cloud Flight. Even the plastic is cheaper, lower-grade, $20-headphones like material.The sound quality is adequate at best, but still very tinny and lacking, and much worse than the Cloud Flights.They punched up the base at the expense of everything else, so they sound like $18 unturned headphones.For someone just buying these for the first time, you might not be disappointed, and that's understandable, but coming from Cloud Flights, I can not stress enough how low quality these feel, sound, and look in comparison with them.Go with the HyperX Cloud Flight if you can (they are sold on Amazon), and you will thank me later. These are obviously a cost-saving ""newer"" design, which nowadays just means: less material, worse material, and engineered to reduce manufacturing costs and parts in order to maximize profit, not quality."
"I've had this headset for about four months now. I think you shouldn't get this headset because of the cons outweighing the pros. I'm not an audiophile or someone that cares about top-end quality stuff. For a wireless headset, it pretty much gets the job done. However in my experience, there are two terrible cons that ruin this headset for me to the point where I wouldn't recommend getting them.1. Whenever the headset has reaches low battery levels, the headset itself makes a beeping sound that lets you know that it needs to be plugged in soon to charge. You'd think this would be a great feature because it'd be a way to let you know that the battery is about to die. However, the sound is so obnoxious and incessantly loud. The sound just keeps blaring repeatedly until you finally plug it in. This beeping sound volume is fixed at a very loud volume which cannot be changed regardless of whatever volume you have on your computer because the sound is fixed to the headset itself and not to any volume controls on your computer. This especially gets annoying if you're in the middle of a video game where you don't have a convenient moment to pause, such as an online multiplayer game. I've been put in situations where I have to deal with this annoying loud sound until I find a brief moment where I can finally plug it in. I've tried googling solutions to this, but I was only able to come across other customers complaining about the same issue. The only ""solution"" I was able to come across was the manufacturer claiming that they will fix the issue in future models of the headset.2. The headset automatically turns itself off after it doesn't detect any sound. You'd think this would be great feature too. However, the headset sometimes incorrectly turns itself off despite the headset being used. A notable example is whenever I play chess online. In a chess game, the game just consists of quick intermittent sounds of pieces moving. Because this sound is so sporadic, the headset for whatever reason assumes that it's not being used and eventually turns itself off. I've tried to work around this by playing music at a very low volume because I generally don't like playing with background audio. However, the headset still decides to turn itself off after a while. I'm basically forced to play background audio at a loud enough threshold to ensure that the headset doesn't turn off. At the moment, my current solution is to just play white noise audio in the background, but I hate that I'm forced to do this in the first place.Other than these two cons I mentioned, the headset itself works fine. I'm not an audiophile or a hardcore gamer that needs top-end quality, but I feel that it gets the job done. However, I feel that there are probably  other headsets available in the market with similar price and quality that DON'T have these two annoying flaws. Because of this, it doesn't make any sense for me to recommend this specific headset over something comparable."
"Save the headache and get a wired headset they are better in every aspect aside from convenience of wireless. These feel and sound cheap, mic is not good either."
"This is for the HyperX Cloud Stinger Core WirelessKit comes with a USB C charger, and the USB wireless Dongle.Setup is a breeze on windows. Dongle was detected, headset was setup automatically, and was seamless. Registered the product as instructed to enable DTS Headphone X.Pros:Sound CLARITY is good. When the sound produced is within the headset's capability (range) then I can't complain. Works well enough for all the games I played and mostmusic.Cons:The sound range is bad. I've had better range out of earbuds that came with my phone. Bass in rap music just comes through with a lot of static, especially when volume is turned up. Also seems to sometimes static or drop sound altogether for a second or two. This seems to happen for me especially often when there's layers of sound (Like listening to a Podcast while playing simple PC games).Can't tell if this static or dropping issue is because of the wireless signal or the headset quality. I do know the poor range when listening to music is probably the headset so expect to turn the bass way down depending on your tastes.With all that said, if you stay within the headsets capabilities it'll get you through considering the price is reasonable.Ultimately though, I can't recommend these as a daily driver as a result of these issues interfering with my day to day experiences. A decent headset should produce OK sound that doesn't amaze but doesn't make you stop what you are doing. This headset made me stop what I was doing several times to try and make them do what I needed, even making me question if I got a defective set.(Disclaimer: All issues I mention were thoroughly investigated, tinkered with, optimized, and troubleshot before making my conclusions. I did not contact the manufacturer, though I considered it)"
"I would give these 4 maybe even 5 star review as they are perfect except for when its on low battery, they emit an extremely loud, blaringly annoying sound that you can't turn off. They can make that sound 20+ times in a minute and its unbelievably annoying. The worst part is that the noise is at max volume regardless of what your sound level is at."
"I have the wired version of this headset and it is spectacular.  I wanted to try the wireless version.  Everything is about the same except the most important part... the sound quality is lousy compared to the wired one.  Not that this headset is bad, it's just a huge compromise in sound quality to have the wireless sound.  So if you like the convenience of wireless, get this.  If you like your stuff to sound good, get the wired one."
"Trying this product out for the first time today I have a few takeaways.I decided to replace my Logitech G430 7.1 Gaming Headset with the HyperX Cloud Stinger Core. The Logitech headphones were my 'work from home' headphones that I used for calls with colleagues. The biggest thing for me was that I wanted a pair of wireless headphones so that I wouldn't keep pulling things off my desk when rolling my chair back, or getting cables stuck on things.I plan on keeping these headphones, but I don't think they are worth 4 or even 5 stars. I'm using these headphones on OSX and the volume adjustment isn't an adjustment on the device, instead it adjusts the whole system volume. It would be nice if I could turn up/down the system volume independently of the device volume. My Logitech's supported this as do my other pair of wireless headphones I use for Gaming (Alienware AW988).My work colleagues have said I sounded fine over the microphone, but when looking at the output levels for the mic in the Sound properties, it barely looked like it was registering. Also when attempting to make a test call in MS Teams, I was getting notified that there wasn't sound coming from my mic. The test call sounded like it was picking up only half of what I was saying. People said I sounded fine while on actual meeting calls though, so who knows.The headphones are light, and pretty comfortable and I've been using them for about 3hrs now. Charging with USB-C is appreciated, as I prefer that to be my 'one type of cable to rule them all'.Overall these headphones are 'good enough' especially for work, but if I was using them for gaming I would want something more, like a separate channel to be used for voice communications and a separate one for the main sounds so that volumes could be adjusted independently. Probably the 'HyperX Cloud Flight S' is what to get if that's a feature you want (which I recommend if you use them for gaming)."
"While the headphones I would say are amazing quality, it was a struggle to get them to work. First of all.. hyper x didn’t even provide the USB to make these headphones work? I had to contact hyper x support (Amazon was no help) to get the usb. Then when it came in and it was time to connect my headset to my computer the instructions they provide are zero help. “ Connect the wireless USB adapter to your device.Power on the headset.Follow the instructions on the DTS instructions card to enabled DTS® Headphone:X®.” but no that’s not what you do. I had to find this from a Reddit forum btw because these instructions weren’t even on their site.. you take a pin, push it in the usb, hold power button on your headset. No need for that DTS app either, they try making you pay for better audio."
"I say reliable in both negative and positive ways. I bought these headphones for discord calls, gaming, and streaming. It's a mixed bag of pros and cons.Pros-They have lasted over a year.-Mic works well, or at least I haven't had any complaints.-sound quality is decent.-durable, they've taken a few tumbles onto the hardwood floors.Cons-The volume control has the very reliable effect of messing with the sound cutting out on opposing speakers. You have to get it just right if you want sound on both sides at a certain volume.-theyre not comfortable, I can't wear them more than an hour without my ears or head hurting.Overall they're fine but when they finally do stop working I won't replace them with the same product. For the price I paid though I'm satisfied enough."
"Ok-ishI wanted to like these headphones. I really did. I saw a bunch of amazing reviews, and they're advertised as the best selling headset in the United States. So based off that, I thought these headphones were going to be good. Which they aren't. Not in the slightest.Build Quality;They feel okay, quality wise.-They exterior portion of the headset is made out of a thick plastic material, they feel like they could survive a couple drops and be okay.-The cord is long which is good, imo. However it is not braided. I don't feel like a lot of wires in a gaming setup need to be braded, but I think a headset's should, especially considering how a headset is constantly moving, when worn by someone.Sound quality;-I'm not an audiophile by any means. BUT. I can tell you right now. These don't sound good. The only thing it has going for it is the bass. The bass sounds okay, It bumps when you're listening to music, in game I can hear footsteps but cant really distinguish where they are coming from unless they are basically a foot (wink) away from me. The highs and mids don't sound good. To put it into perspective, image a old cranky lady is yelling at you right in your ear, it feels really annoying, and everything sounds cracky if that makes any sense. The volume isn't loud at all, the louder it gets the more cracky everything sounds.This is one of the things that lead me to believe I received a defective headset. I saw a review that said something about not being able to hear your wife but being able to hear gunshots from across the map, in my case, I feel like its the opposite, unfortunatelyMic Quality;-bad. Really really bad.Do me a favor. Go on YouTube and search ""kids today wouldn't survive a modern warfare lobby.""That's what the mic sounds like.Also another thing that leads me to believe my headset is defective. I watched a couple reviews. none of them sounded as bad as mine did. NOT A SINGLE ONE!Comfort;-They are comfortable, I'm used to wearing a old heavy headset from 2013. So I don't mind the weight at all, I wore them for about an hour with glasses, and I have 0 complaints.TY for reading. No hate on HyperX, but this headset could have been better, I bought a couple headsets in the 40-60 dollar range recently and these preformed the worse. Sadly."
"I mostly use this headset for my PS4 as it is compatible. However I don’t recommend purchasing this for console. I don’t know how well it runs on PC as I don’t own an actual PC. But I didn’t really have a good experience for console. I had a steel series Arctis 1 wireless headset before this and there are many pro’s and cons. The sound quality is very noticeable bad compared to my Arctis 1. My Arctis 1 wireless dongle broke after only having them for about half a year and I just found out I can get replaceable parts for it. But I purchase these to replace them and the quality of these just aren’t as good. The max volume isn’t as loud and it’s not really noise cancelling. I can still hear outside noise even on max volume and the headset just feels cheap. But that’s what I can get for a $80 headset. But the main problem i had with the headset was that the sound would get interrupted while playing. I would hear the in-game sound and my friends chatting with me but all of a sudden they would cut out and I can’t hear a single thing they say for a good 5-10 seconds then the in game sound would come back.  Thats the sole reason to why I rated this headset as so, everything else I can handle but the Interruptions is the main thing that bothered me as I don’t really have a good gaming experience with the headset. Again I don’t know how well these work on PC but I don’t recommend getting these for the PS4."
"**UPDATE AT THE BOTTOMSome of this might be personal preference, but its my review so I'm giving my opinion.Cons:-Price wasn't worth it, and then it drops $40 some months after I bought it (yeah I paid $85 before the price drop, rip $40).-When the battery is low, prepare yourself for the most annoying tone to blast your eardrums on repeat every 3 seconds.  I got the message the battery is low...  I'm in a Teams/Webex meeting and I can't get up right now so I guess I have to suffer.  But you better not suffer too long otherwise it will die on you in 5 mins, yeah they don't leave you much time when the warning comes.-For my work I'm often times in 'working session' type meetings where there can be periods of silence.  The times of silence can be 5, 10, +15 mins.  Apparently this headset likes to auto shut off if there is no audio for too long, with zero warning.  The first time I ran into this, the people on my meeting were waiting 10 mins for me to respond to a question and I had no idea... now I have to keep generating audio myself every so often just to make sure it doesn't cut out on me.Pros:-play audio-has a microphoneThere are better options, I don't know why this has so many good reviews.  The review count tricked me, rip.  I probably wouldn't be as salty, but the price drop is kind of annoying since I paid premium for a lack luster headset.**UPDATE:Well I just had one my fears come to life, and it was all thanks to this pos headset.  I was in a team wide morning meeting at work, and this headset's @#$!%#$ mute 'function' decided to break on me with no warning.  So while the boss was talking I was also having a conversation with my wife on the meeting.  I'm pretty pissed, I muted myself with the headset, and it failed at the worst time.  On top of that, I was talking about how I had slept in that morning (because I was up until 4am the night before for work), but no one has that context, so I just sound bad.  This headset is a piece of crap, save yourself some frustration and your career and get another headset.  I'm hulking these into the wall and have another headset in my cart already."
"These sound great, look mundane and not annoying, are a decent price, and are easy to set up and use. They aren't perfect, though. I went from a set of Corsair Void Elite wired phones to these and the microphone quality is nowhere near as good. The speakers are fine, but I wish the microphone sounded better. My friends can understand me okay, it's usable, but it isn't nearly as clear as the Corsair was. I'm not sure if that's a wireless issue or just a lower quality microphone. These also have to have the HyperX software running and minimized to the tray at all times in order for the 7.1 surround feature to work, or so I gather by googling around. Another annoying issue is that my computer will not automatically switch to and from the headset when I power it on and off the way most other bluetooth devices work. I again don't know if that's a failing on their end or something messed up in my settings, but I'm fairly computer savvy and can figure most things out and it doesn't seem to be a problem on my end. Setting these to the default sound device should make sound switch away from my main speakers (not set to default) and to the headset, but I have to manually switch sound to the headset (though discord does begin funneling chat into them immediately for whatever reason [discord is set to use the system default] ). All things considered, I regret buying them--just not enough to go through the hassle of sending them back or going back to my wired set. I'll live with them for the time being."
"The product is relatively high quality and for the price, the sound quality will meet or exceed your expectations however, the battery life could be better. On a full charge, I usually get about 2-3 hours of listening to music with them before I start getting the low battery warning. I also am disappointed that the headset audio slider isn't independent of your computer, it sadly just changes the device's volume in windows. The headset is comfortable though, I have large ears and find most ""over-ear"" headphones don't go over my ears very well but these headphones really are over my ear. If you don't mind plugging in your headphones sometimes while using them I would recommend these but if you are more like me and prefer to just plug them in whenever you aren't using them, you might want to look for a pair of headphones with better battery life."
"I chose this headset out of others in the pricing and category. After looking into spatial audio vs 5.1/7.1 surround, I had decided that I would rather get 7.1 since it would have better support. This listing explicitly states these headphones are 7.1 surround, and make 0 mention of spatial audio. However these are in fact spatial audio headphones. On the box it states spatial audio, and when I set them up in Windows I get stereo and spatial for my sound options.I decided to give them a chance, maybe it would end up being ok. When the spatial audio on these also stink. I found a video explicitly encoded in spatial for a demo and there was almost no difference in the way these sound vs normal stereo headphones. I really don't understand the point of these, they are expensive for stereo and suck at spatial. Honestly get something else. I'm most irritated by the misleading listing title and description. I searched every inch of this listing and nothing says spatial audio, it all explicitly states 7.1."
I don't write a lot of reviews but this is horrible. If you aren't talking after 2 minutes it will cut off. You have to press the on button really hard to get it back working. I just this for work and for some reason when you first turn it on and you have a customer on the other end they can't hear you and you can't hear them. So you have to turn it off and back on which as I stated earlier you have to push the on button really hard for about 20 seconds before it connects!! If you are being monitored at work this will become a problem. I will reach out to the manufacturer to try to get a replacement. I bought this in April and can't return back through Amazon. Hopefully since it is only 6 months old they will replace it. I had it unopened in the box for 5 months before using it. So I literally haven't used it a full month!
"I love the noise cancellation, the sound is great, but I don't recommend buying this if you're using it for the mic."
"This is prob very specific to my use case and for most people these headphones are awesome. I actually love them.  Here is my problem.  With WFH I am using a variety of chat/video clients and the headphones seem to get stuck with the prior client and the microphone doesnt work.  Well I think thats whats happening. The ""not working"" is almost always with Bluejeans which is my company's largest video client so I am using it most.  I am in a lot of meetings across a large tech organization.As mentioned primarily we use Bluejeans.  Some folks have adopted Zoom.  Our international offices use Citrix webex.  My developers like Discord for quick audio chats.  Plus of course my local PC usage.  And over and over and over again I'll pop into a blujeans meeting ""We cant hear you"".  I'll shut down blue jeans. kill processes.  Unplug the USB dongle.  Eventually one of those things will get it to work.. once i had to reboot the system out of desperation.  The annoying thing is I am typically the guy conducting the meetings (fancy man) so everyone is just sitting there waiting for me to get the mic working.So today I put down my hyperX headphones.  Going back to old school wired."
"These headphones are great for the price and comes with surround sound I just wish there was a wireless version of the stinger s rather than just the cores, as I’m not a big fan of the stinger cores as I bought some stinger core wireless for double the price expecting better quality, but they ended up fragile no surround sound and cheap feeling."
"over the last 5 years of use they have been okay, not the most comfortable material on the ears and on the top of your head. the material has a tendency to trap oils and dirt inside of the pores causing it to become oily/sticky. the volume wheel also spazzes out when I try to turn it up or down. very finicky."
"Wireless 7.1 version w/ DTSSound quality with 3rd party DTS app: 8.5/10 (Truly outstanding, and the app does take it to another level)Mic quality: 6/10 (discord friends reported that I sounded less clear and more muffled than on the much cheaper budget wireless headset this was meant to replace)Dealbreaker 1: The auto shut-off ""feature"" that is entirely undocumented and unmentioned on this page is NOT possible to disable. If the device doesn't detect sound for a period of 15 min, it will turn off, and you will not know that it is off. There is NO way to turn this off as the device is not supported by their NGENUITY Software, even if the listing claims that it is. I lost track of the number of notifications I missed because my pc audio was off, and I had no idea.Dealbreaker 2: The headset volume control changes your pc system volume, not the actual headset volume. Causing all sorts of random volume jumps for me in-game if I even bumped the button. This is one of the most absurd things I could imagine for a headset to do, and like the previous issue, it's not configurble in any way.Skip this one guys. Returning after 2 days of ownership."
"A bit of background first: I've been running HyperX's Cloud Stinger headsets for years, and I've been really happy with them, but this time around as my current pair starts to act up, I decided to splurge a bit and go for a Core 7.1 Wireless, thinking it was an upgrade. It is not, the regular wired model is cheaper than a regular Stinger, and it lacks few features, most notably rotating ears.The other part of the reason why I gunned for a Wireless was because the cord is the #1 failure point on literally every headset I ever get, including my current Stinger set that this was going to replace, so I figured I'd just cut my losses and ditch the wire. Unfortunately, with this headset, that turned out to not be a good idea.Overall, I was fairly satisfied with the quality of the headset, and it was pretty easy to set up, but I was very displeased to find that when I actually tried using them, first the microphone acted very strangely (the first time it wasn't registering on Discord a lot of the time, then after a restart it registered consistently but was extremely patchy), and then to my immense displeasure I tried listening to music with them. Constant. Stuttering. In most cases, the audio was cutting out very briefly, often multiple times per second, and on some programs (most notably I tested with Terraria) audio didn't work at all.As far as I can tell, this isn't a super common problem, and I may have just gotten extremely unlucky with the dongle I got, but I wasn't able to find a solution for it, and thus am planning on returning it. If you're looking for a good quality wireless headset, however, it might not be a bad choice; there aren't many wireless headsets available in this price range, and if that's what you're specifically looking for, not a bad option. Just be aware that you might wind up returning it. Such is the risk of going for the cheapest option."
I was excited for my first wireless headset to be heavily disappointed. The sound quality was BAFFLING disgusting. Everything sounded so far away while extremely bass boosted. I am unsure if I may have gotten a defect one or not but I felt like I left Dollar Tree with that headset. It was also not super comfy to me but I have glasses so Its harder for me to find a good fit. This headset was not it for me.
"I bought this to use on the PS5. I had a wireless, but everything I've read says that it's better to have a wired connection, if you don't want to break the bank.It feels and sounds like a budget headset. The ear cups are comfortable, but the headset does not provide enough tension to actually be noise cancelling. The cups move 180 degrees, which is good for storage, but it's a little annoying when trying to put them on. Once on, though, aside from not being tense enough, it's okay.Super long cable if you need it. Since I'm plugging it into the controller, that's not an issue for me.As for durability, I'm not too sure about it. Maybe I got a defective one, but I already had to process a replacement headset because one side of the headset was not putting out sound. This was after 3 weeks of very sporadic use - a couple of times per week, a couple of hours at a time.It's a budget headset, so I guess I got what I paid for. If it breaks again, I'll just call it a loss and buy something better."
"This is one of a few headsets I've gotten over the last few years in the new WFH normal.  I've had this headset for a little over a year now.  For a good portion of that time, I've noticed the mic will occasionally just not work.  The headphones are always fine and I can always hear the person, music, etc. I'm listening to through them.  However, the mic will occasionally just not work, despite turning on and off numerous times to spur it on.The sound quality in the ear cuffs is good enough where I may keep them to just use as headphones.  However, these were bought for me to use on conference and phone calls...and it's failing miserably.  Now on the look out for yet another pair, so we'll see if we can get better luck next time."
"I hope you weren't planning on charging these over 3 months or so and expecting anywhere near the advertised hours you get with a brand new battery.  At first I was amazed how long the battery life was, then it started to get worse and worse with each week...Now I am lucky to get 2-4 hours of charge out of them not even a year in....  So you get what you pay for otherwise I am satisfied with Mic quality, in game sound. ( Music is trash )Their build quality is surprisingly durable and I haven't had any real issue with that. They are great for extended periods of time. Here I am a few months later on a quest again for better headphones. 69 dollars worthy probably but the battery could of been better or optional door to replace with a new one down the road.. Oh and distance is slightly better than other 2.4GHZ latency free type headsets I get about an extra 5-10 ft out of them compared to others but nothing spectacular.  The battery alert noise is so bad I want to smash the headset into the ground tho."
"Flip to mute does not work with this headset and I did not realize that for awhile.I really like everything else about this headset.  I liked it well enough that I bought a second one for my husband.  It is super comfy and I'm really picky about that because I have tmj.  The sound quality is good and battery life is great.  The range is great; I can take out the trash or go do laundry in the garage without issue.  For the price it is a fantastic headset, but there's one problem.  Thinking you're muted when you are not really sucks.  I mainly use this headset to play Dnd over zoom.  On a bio break one night, I flipped my mic up and started ranting to my husband about one of the other players.  The mic was fully in the up position, but later a different player said they heard me!  I'm pretty sure the person I was talking about heard me too.  They haven't said anything directly, but it seems that they dislike me even more now than they did before.  And I'm stuck in a years long campaign with this person.Doing some testing since then, we've realized that with both headsets flip to mute does not work properly.  Rarely it will mute, but usually not and there's no way to know when it will work.  So if you use this headset be sure to mute yourself in zoom or whatever and do not trust the flip to mute.  You could wreck friendships, piss off your boss or just embarrass yourself."
"I bought these in July of 2022 and noticed that the materials felt a bit cheap and they are incredibly basic considering the price that they want for these brand new, but figured that since I was buying a refurbished pair at a fraction of the cost, they might be worth it. The battery life was great at first, but 7 months on they no longer hold a charge and drain while turned off. I plug them in each night and unplug them in the afternoon when I get on my computer, sometimes early in the morning, but I always turn them off when I need to get up and go do stuff. I unplugged them early this morning and used them for a few minutes and then turned them off. I just got back on my computer less than an hour ago and they are already yelling at me to charge them. The amount of time in between needing charging has gotten shorter and shorter over the last couple of weeks. Eventually, they will just be wired which defeats the purpose of having ordered a wireless headset in the first place."
Microphone is very quiet. Requires 3rd party boosting software just so people can hear you
"These have fine sound quality and the mic has worked fine for 2 years now, but the thing that makes me want to yeet these headphones out the window is the TERRIBLE design. The power button requires you to push and hold to turn it on and off, this sounds useful except sometimes you'll hold the power button down for a while and it just doesn't turn on. You'll hear the power button click and everything, but it just doesn't turn on. One time I had to try for multiple minutes just to finally get the long-press to register. The other big issue is the low battery warning, it will beep every few seconds to let you know that it needs to charge... and then it will keep beeping until you give up and plug it in. Would not buy again purely because of the frustration this headset has caused me."
"I get it, you don't care about sound quality, or mic quality.  This has both.  I have tested a lot of gaming headsets.  I give it 3 stars because the build quality is bad.  I expect more at this price point.  The splitter/combiner with the mute switch fails after a year.  It is great fun using this in a meeting only to find out the headset is great but the cheaply made mute switch has failed intermittently.  A simple replacement cable prevented me from tossing an otherwise really good device."
It’s okay. The ear piece on the left is beginning to get messed up and I bought it in December.
I bought these for my son to replace a 50 dollar set. Upon receiving them the old set was way better. I sent them back for refund not a good product
"these headphones are some of the best i have used, and the HyperX customer support team on the website are so helpful. The only reason i am not rating 5 stars is because i received a busted pair at first but was able to get another pair with out any extra payments. the second pair i received work amazing BUT, the left ear is MUCH louder than the right (having volume slider at max allows me to actualy hear the right earcup) and my computer volume controll did not affect the sound volume either, but when i talked to the HyperX support chat they were able to fix this issue no problem, but i need to do the fix every time my computer loses power/shuts off (not sleeps) it may just be my desktop though"
"Good quality, the sound and comfort is comparable to the hyper X cloud ii . The only thing that wasn't comparable was the distance and battery life.Both still were manageable though. I miss being able to go literally like 30 yards away and still hear what's going on at my computer but it's not bad, I can walk to my bathroom and kitchen no problem. If I go any further it starts loading signal.The battery life is manageable. It's about 1 full day of constant use and then it needs a recharge which isn't that bad."
"While the sound quality and comfort on these headphones are fine, when the headset reaches a low battery it will play the most obnoxious alerts. It doesn't only alert you once to tell you the battery is low, IT WILL PLAY A NOISE EVERY FEW SECONDS UNTIL YOU CHARGE IT. It's just as annoying as hearing your alarm clock in the morning for those of you who like to sleep in.To my knowledge, there is no way to turn off this feature, and you can only ignore the sounds or plug it in, which is annoying if you need these headphones. Sure, you could always just charge them often, but it would be easier for everyone if it didn't annoy the crap out of the user. Why can't we just get one sound to indicate that the battery is low?I do not even write reviews for products, but this feature has annoyed be for quite some time now."
"I really enjoyed these from the beginning. Very straight forward, install USB receiver and they work. after about a month I started to notice a few things.1.) The first thing I started to notice was the popping sounds and crackle sound. I at first thought EMF so I moved USB slots I even put my phone on the other side of them room. Placebo or not seems to help. skip a head a couple of months Now its just constant no matter what snapping and crackle.2.) The biggest issue is comfort, I have used all the nicest head phones because of the job I have and thought how bad can they be. Its bad. Imagine the foam garbage padding you find on a Walmart office chair on your ear for 4 hours. Itchy, painful, not fun.3.) If you honestly cannot afford anything better than these please by some garbage earbuds they will be better and save your money for a brand that knows how to make good gaming headsets.HyperX has failed as brand with these and I will not buying anything that has Hyper X on it EVER."
"I ordered this to use as a soft phone at my work desk. The headset is very lightweight, comfortable, sounds fine, and the mic works well. They're all black and it's a basic headset, so nobody will even guess it's a ""gaming"" headset.I also like to slide the headset off one ear so that I can hear someone approach or try to get my attention. This does significantly affect the quality of the sound.The only annoying thing is that each one of the earphones has a dedicated cable and the point where they come together is too close to the headset, so it often gets caught on my chin when taking it off. I have the HyperX Cloud Stinger (not Core) for my gaming setup at home and it only has one cable going into the headset. I was also disappointed that the microphone does not feature the same ""swivel-to-mute"" microphone as the Stinger, but the slider works just fine for muting."
"Love the product.  The features that I wanted are hard to come by - wireless, surround the ear muffs, lift the boom mic to mute.  Because of these 3 features that I desired, the selection of products that meet these criteria are slim.  The boom mic broke and it was outside of the Amazon warranty.  Started the warranty process with the manufacturer.  What a nightmare.  They are slow to respond.  After multiple communications, they asked for VERY EXTENSIVE information and pictures before they would even send me an RMA.  What a pain in the @SS!  I'm still waiting to return the product and get my money back.  At the rate this process is going, I expect it might be a few more months before I see my money."
"I've bought this device on mid October 2021 and used it until now. (2/14/2022)It's great, comfortable to wear with a convenient audio volume slider and a mic with a feature to slide it back up as a way to 'holster' it, all while having flexible availability on all the devices I own! However, the problem I ran into it is that it randomly reconfigured itself into an audio only device named ""Hi Res USB-C Audio"" on my computer and absolutely does not recognized that it has a mic despite working on other devices. As I am primarily a PC gamer, this is extremely disappointing to me as I cannot use half of the intended functions of this device onto my computer anymore. This isn't an very uncommon issue either and others who have received the same exact issue didn't receive any satisfying closure to the issue weather that be an actual fix or good explanation as to why this happens.It's a great product that should be worth the price! But I myself cannot recommend it to anyone as it bares this potential issue that can forever render it's microphone unusable on certain devices until the manufacture is aware of this and promises acknowledge and/or an attempt on fixing this."
"I loved this set when I first got it.... I bought it in November, but by December the right ear didn't work anymore.  This is the same thing that happened to my other Hyper X corded set, but it happened about 9 months sooner.  The mic worked and the sound quality was great for the price.Bottom line- if you are using these you probably want to have a hook on the side of your desk or something for them, and even then, the cords are highly sensitive to damage. I only saw one day where these had questionable cord routing and by that time it was too late. The older version had sturdier cables and it showed.I think next time I get something like these I will go for a bluetooth model for an extra twenty bucks."
"The headset sounds just fine. Build quality is great. But the battery is absolute garbage. I've never seen anything this terrible before. Full charge lasts only 1.5 — 2 hours on low volume. It's been a problem since the start. Assumed it was due to no support in the app or bad drivers, but every update so far has not addressed the issue. I can't even get support to answer me or anything.I have regretted this purchase 100%, which is disappointing because I have so many other HyperX things that work beautifully.Do not get this headset. Look for something else."
"I don't like ear buds, so my last three sets of headphones have been various styles of lightweight ""ear clip"" (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000Y2WTS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) style. But they don't last long. I purchased these (while on sale) for gaming and the sound quality is pretty good. The volume control on the headset is convenient, as is being able to mute the mic simply by pressing it up out of the way. The cord is quite long, almost too long for PC gaming, and it comes with a USB adapter. The major drawback for these headphones is that they are kind of big. Straight out of the package, at the smallest setting, these are quite big on my head. I cannot tilt my head backward or forward without the headphones slipping. As such, I wouldn't recommend these for anyone who is on the petite side."
"If you plan on using these for console gaming just know the wire on these will be extremely long and will get in the way especially when you get up to walk, if you get up to walk with your headset on and controller, another thing is the audio (atleast with mine) is too low. But I’ll be more clear, if you are not playing in a party (I play on ps4 so I’ll be using that console as an example) the game audio will sound somewhat loud and just fine, but if you play in a party even if you have the slider set to prioritize game audio to be louder it will still be too low to hear game audio. This would be an issue if you play games like siege. This is just my experience with my headset maybe I got one that has something wrong with it, yours could be different and you could have a better experience but I would give these a 7/10 at best"
I know have to try to slam down the microphone or push it down for it to turn on and it's annoying.  I have no idea why it started doing this but when I'm on conference calls and I'm talking and then people can't hear me it is embarrassing.  I need something that is going to work for several years.
"I'm a gamer, and I really wanted a reasonably priced headset with a mic. I've gotten expensive headsets before, but this time I figured I didn't mind a slight dip in quality. So long as it was functional, I would be happy.The sound on this headset, as expected, was slightly worse than my expensive ones. And honestly, I didn't mind, I knew I would get whatever I paid for.... However, I actually didn't.The mic does NOT work on my set! I have tried everything, making sure it is my default in settings, as well as in any game or app I try. But no one can hear me, and mic tests never show feedback or that I can be heard! It's very frustrating to waste money on something where one of the core functions does not work and is simply inaccessible. I will be sending mine back, and possibly looking at other brands, even though I usually love HyperX. :("
"The headset works just enough for me to deal with it, but it isn't detected by Ngenuity at all. I've tried just about everything to get it to work.It also definitely doesn't meet the distance limits or battery charge they advertise. It normally lasts about 4 hours tops, and as for distance, the max range is like 8-10 meters.It also consistently has crackling - restarting my PC usually gets rid of it for a few hours, then it comes back."
"This headset is just okay. A decent budget option but expected better from HyperX. The range of the wireless signal is extremely short compared to other wireless gaming headsets. The quality of the microphone audio input is average but the input volume is quite low in all applications and devices. Sound quality is average even with DTS audio and if the DTS audio settings are set to spacious instead of balanced the sound is atrocious and very muddy.Good if you're going for a mid tier budget wireless headset and don't care about anything except for the basics, if you're look for a more premium experience, look elsewhere."
"This is a good headset for gaming and the battery lasts for a decent amount of time. However, it does take a while to charge and when it is low battery it makes a beeping noise about every few seconds and it gets very annoying. And sometimes the volume control does not match up with the volume set on my Windows laptop."
"This headset still works, but the ear cups are disintegrating. If I could do it over again, I would choose a more expensive brand with hopes it would last longer.For reference, I only use these headphones on the weekend, and I’m pretty gentle with my equipment. I’d avoid this brand when buying again."
"Pros: It's a decent all-round wireless headset for the price. Good battery life, comfortable, around-ear cushions muffle ambient noise well, and quality is acceptable for listening to music, gaming, and teleconferencing.Cons: user experience has really rough edges. No automatic switching back to PC speakers while the USB radio is plugged in if the headset is powered off, and the headset automatically powers off after a few minutes of silence; the only clue is that the LED on the back of the headset turns off and the LED on the USB radio changes from solid to slow blink. You'll want the USB radio in a VERY prominent and easily accessible place, both to see connectivity status and be able to physically unplug it to switch back to speakers. Low battery bleeping is very insistent, but at least the headset can continue to work with a power cable connected."
"The mic mutes by being flipped up and down.  This function began to cause very loud crackling on the mic every time I would mute or unmute it.  Eventually the very subtle ""notch"" that keeps the mic in the upright position stopped working at all, and I couldn't mute the mic anymore.  Spend a bit more money and avoid this headset."
"This headset is mindblowingly , meh. The sound quality is.. ""ok"" at best. The only perk is they're somewhat sturdy. and ok to game with, not the greatest but it will be a good.. back up to anything that is actual quality. lolThe software is lacking, like it's incredible how little the software assists in anything really.ALSO if you plan on using this for work at home as a comfy option, i hope you get calls every 3 seconds cause the headset has an auto turnoff function to save battery that is NOT an option to disable..When mentioned to HyperX, they'll look into it. ( It's been a year they aint doing **** with this)(Can you tell I bought for exactly the purpose above, and also dont get calls every 3 seconds)"
"Yeah so the mic works and you can hear outta them, but they're quiet. I can hardly hear outta them when I'm using my stationary bike, which is loud but still.. They don't connect to my phone so I can only use them on my xbox, a huge bummer. I'm not sure if my headset is faulty or what the deal is there.There are no seperate controls for game sound and party chat.This was another big bummer for me. Oh and the one control is does have for sound is loose and super cheap feeling.The cost of buying an adapter to have seperate sound controls would be another $40.Definitely not worth it.Returning.I'd rather spend $150 for a wireless headset that'll work on all my devices with everything I need and not have the aesthetic appeal, than waste $50 for a mediocre corded pink headset and another $40 on an adapter for mininal sound and quality.This headset will probably work for a streamer that doesn't care about sound quality, or controls because it still looks cute and the mic does work, the only reasons it didn't get a 1 star.Still a dumb purchase to me."
"It's not a terrible wireless headset for the price.However, the power button is pretty soft (you really have to push hard to get it to function).The mic moving to mute is a nice feature, but even after my two months of use I can tell it's a point of failure and one day it just won't unmute again.Charge cable was included. A huge plus in this growing trend of leaving those bits out to cut costs. The port in the headset is a little tempremental.Lastly, the cushioning I'd a little thin in overall width, so despite sufficient padding, it tends to dig uncomfortably after a bit of use.3 stars cause it does what I wanted for the price but I believe it won't last."
"The headset itself is decent, particularly for the price ($60 when I bought it). However, the wireless range is abysmal, which is sad this day and age. I can't go into another room without it cutting off constantly, and my house is not very big.Another minor grievance is that these headphones will shut themselves off after a period of inactivity, which is a great feature, but it doesn't give you any cue/indication that they shut off if you're still wearing them; just turns off. Also, it frequently gives no audio cue when you shut them off like it's supposed to."
"Edit:I ended up returning this headset because the microphone muting feature didn't work well enough for me.  I went with Corsair void elite.I'm using this headset for work.  Teams is the meeting software I use.  No issues yet.Pros: light, comfortable, good sound quality, good mic quality, mic up to mute, range (I can easily go downstairs and outside to the car and back with no audio loss).Cons: flimsy, short charge cable, daily charging needed, when dying the notification is way too often and loud.Summary: if you can get this on sale like I did then go for it.  I use HyperX Cloud cabled headset and love it, kingston makes good products.  Comparing this to that, the sound is only a little worse.  I have also uses corsair void, and prefer that headset to this one, but it's also more $$$."
"This headset was incredible whole it lasted but I quickly realized it wasn't worth the money when my dog bit the tip of the mic and I tried replacing the mic.  The mic on this model cannot be replaced without going to extreme measures, soldering and removing many tiny screws.  I have attempted to repair it on my own and wasted 16.99 purchasing what seemed to be a matching replacement mic but was no compatible.  The mic should be replaceable like it is in HyperX's other headsets but it's not due in my opinion to Planned Obsolescense.  Apparently 90 bucks (or whatever) isn't enough for us customers to reserve a replaceable mic so when one tiny part breaks we have to throw the entire great headset in the trash."
"This headset lasted me quite a while at least a few months of use, the sound quality was great but the mic eventually stopped working completely amd I have no clue why, I can only guess its from just being muted and unmuted. I have had cheaper headsets last longer than this one, some even sound the same..."
"These were great for the first 3 weeks, loud and comfortable sound with my PC, long battery life and good mic quality. Out of nowhere I now have to turn the volume ALL the way up to hear anything and my customers now tell me they can't hear me speaking when I have the mic right next to my mouth.I've emailed customer service for this issue and nothing yet.I went from loud sound at volume 25 to turning it up to 90+ to hear phone calls."
"I usually go for over-ear headphones, but decided to opt in for on-ear and chose these. The sound is good, however feedback from friends stated I sounded a little muffled. After about 30-45 minutes wearing these, my ears began to hurt. I game a lot as a hobby, playing for anywhere between 2-6 hours at a time. I wouldn’t use this headset with the amount of gaming I do, so I ended up donating this headset to a friend who plays fairly less. Good budget headset, enough to be heard, not crystal clear."
"When I'm on a call with my coworkers, there's something when they talk, but there's a high pitch sound that hurts my ears with this headset.When I'm playing a game, the sound is perfectly fine. Range is pretty good."
"If I turn my head these will fall off.  These are for a big head.  I'll make due, but I wish they would adjust down a little.  Maybe they just assume all the users will be adult men, and I'm female."
"The headset doesn't sound great, but I got it at a steep discount and for that price it is solid. However, what makes the headset nearly unusable is that if the battery gets too low it starts beeping every 10 seconds to let you know you need to charge it soon. A low battery indicator is fine, but this constant beeping makes the whole headset unusable once the low battery indicator comes on, so once the battery is low it is as good as dead, and this is despite the fact that the headset still could last quite a while after the beeping comes on, I tested it once and it still had a lot of juice left.Also, when you use it plugged in you get whining and static. That's not abnormal for wireless headsets, but this one has it worse than others I've used.Basically, it's a fine headset if you can get it at a discount, but it's worth nowhere near $80. Closer to $30 would be worth it, and even then you get what you pay for with the constant annoyance of beeping."
It decided to no longer take a charge. In the trash she goes. It was a good headset while it lasted. I noticed someone else had the same issue.
"When they work, they are ok. They are VERY positional. What I mean by that, is if you turn your head, they cut out. If you are not directly in front of the computer, they cut out. If you look down, they cut out. If you look to the right, they cut out. You have a very small area to keep your head in to keep the sound coming through your ears. I'm returning.EDIT:  Got new set. Positional issue is better, BUT, the ""flip up to turn off mic"" isn't working. Others can still hear you ."
"Because of the lack of noise canceling, it makes it so that there's going to be a mild echo of whatever your sound is into you mic. It's very quiet but it is still obvious and annoying. If you use this headset for the mic, it's actually really decent quality. Maybe a good beginner headset when on sale."
"So I was all excited when I got the new HyperX wireless headphones. It comes with the headphones, the charging cable and the USB Bluetooth fob. I set it up in my living room for my PS4. The only problem us everything's me I connected it the headphones would work fine but the mic kept cutting out. Finally I realized I have to stay within a distance of 2 feet of the USB device in order for the mic to stay on. Unfortunately my couch is about 8 feet away so you can see my dilemma. HyperX how about we improve the range a little bit, sound good? It's ridiculous I paid all this money for this junk."
"I bought these headphones for my Xbox Series X based on reviews saying they worked for the console, but I contacted the company shortly after realizing they weren't working & was told that they color code the headphones to what devices they work for. Solid Black only works on PC. If you need PC headphones, these are great; audio quality is superb & the microphone is very clear."
"Audio was great. I liked how convenient it was. Only complaint was the loud noise it would make when it needed to be charged.Now, the right side completely stopped working. Worked just fine the night before. The mic had already stopped working properly about a year in and I've only purchased this about a year and a half ago. It's disappointing."
"Update: Reached out to the seller to inquire about a replacement because this is clearly a mechanical/craftsmanship issue and I was told they only have a 30 day return policy - so I’m screwed. Terrible customer service. 0/10 would NOT recommend. Spend the extra money on a SteelSeries or Sennheiser headset. HyperX is less than average and the customer service is even worse. They wont' stand behand their product.Purchased these in early August, less then 4 month later, the mic arm won’t stay in the upright position, but rather is sags. When I put the mic down to unmute and talk, it falls all the way down, past my mouth and sits at my neck. It’s pretty useless now. I might use these headphones with the mic 3 times a week, if that. I figured these would last a lot longer than that. I’m so disappointed, especially at the $40 price point."
"I ended up returning these because of the quality. I have a pretty small head and I only used them for maybe an hour and they were really tight. The sound quality is good for the price but incredibly bass boosted. Although other options my be pricey, I would say they're worth it."
"If I turn my headphones off and them back on a short time later, it takes several tries to get it to connect. Very frustrating. The audio isn't bad, but not great. But people I game with say my voice is clearer. So make of it what you will."
"So i have the wired version of these and am very happy with them, but I wanted to switch to wireless for awhile now because the cord gets in the way all the time. I decided to stick to they hyperx cloud stinger because I was impressed with the previous version.This wireless version however is quite the down grade and for about $15 more. The build is fine for what you're paying for and I find them to be quite comfortable, except the fabric used for the ears seems to be a bit rough and I seem to fine my ears getting too warm,  and as well as having decent noise cancelation, but my main issue with these is the sound quality. Absolute garbo! The sound is so muffed up and hollow. I'd never use these for immersive gaming or watching movies or anything! Tried fiddling with some settings (which you have to download and doesn't even have many options to begin with) and still can't even begin to compare the wired previous version to these. Thumbs down for me and will be returning"
"This headset is amazing, but I have to give it 3 stars just because of how AWFUL the low battery sound is... I can handle it if the frequency wasn't SO HIGH. The sound repeats every 5-10 seconds, and its like nails on a chalkboard. It is extremely bad."
"I bought these on a big sale (for $20) a week ago May 2nd 2022, and they are not worth much more than that to be honest.They are very lightweight, which sounds like a good thing but in this case dunno, feels flimsy.The volume control is too high on the chest (I rather they were lower on the stomach for a more natural reach with your hands) and worst of all the actual volume wheel is horrible, a tiny wheel super hard to feel and operate.The ear pieces dont cover the ears at all, so pretty much zero background noises prevention and they are not comfortable (kind of hurt your ears after 4-5 hours).The sound itself is pretty good tho.The regular prices for these is like $40, I would have returned them and bought myself something more serious at that price range."
"Quality was barely decent on these. I bought them for work, but they were a lot bigger/bulkier than expected, and the plastic felt cheap. I think there was a speech delay whenever I was in zoom meetings with my coworkers. I would say of that they are overpriced for what you get, with as cheaply made as it felt I don’t know if it was worth the price, I most likely wouldn’t refer to a friend or coworker."
"It's easy on the ears. Comfortable and snug for long periods. Sound quality, including surround sound options are stellar. Swivel mic started sputtering after a month and a half - people on the other end were screaming curses at me accusing me of making their ears bleed.Only way to make it work is to prop the swivel up to a point where the mic rests on my eye. Adapt, improvise and overcome. Which is absolutely stupid, specially when I realized that I could not train my left eye to talk. Maybe it just felt threatened with the possibility that the mic might poke it. Went through warranty. Got a new one but I had to pay for shipping."
"I purchased the headset for (Teams/Zoom) work meetings.  Some of my application support meetings can be silent for 20-30 mins at a time.  These headsets execute an auto-power down after a preset amount of time with no conversation ""without"" any audible warning.  I missed about 35 mins of critical conversation as I didn't know these things had even turned off ""without notification"". Great function for continuous usage, but not acceptable when usage may be silent for a bit."
"Quality is good sound is clear and microphone is decent.Not sure if the one i received is defective or it just isnt good. But, if i leave the room, phone calls are spotting. I hear static clicking noises, and people cannot hear me till i walk back into room.Working from home, this is very inconvenient."
"The headphones I received sounded good for the pricepoint, but the microphone only produced static. I figured it must've been a fluke, so I had them replaced just in case, but no. The new ones have the exact same problem. If you're looking for a headset just to listen with, this is great for the price and is very comfortable. However, not being able to use the microphone is a deal breaker. Why even put a mic on the headset if it doesn't work?"
"I bought the headset for gaming... They sound good, but i'm finding that I need to charge them more than expected.  What is making it worse is the charging cable is way too short to use while wearing the headset.  I need to order a longer cable.  For the price, adding 2' more feet to the cable should be expected if the battery doesn't last that long.  Maybe I just have a battery problem... Time will tell."
"For the price it is fine for listening to music on the PC, but for gaming the sound is terrible. 4/10"
"Voice kept cutting out, had weird tone to voice, no distance really to walk around and use the headset. would get spotty a couple steps away from playstation. not good overall."
"I'm certainly no audiophile (and don't imagine I would have purchased these if I was), but the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired.  The sound is not muddled but it's not crisp or rich either.  The most obvious flaw is the complete lack of bass.  A clear step down from my (wired) Logitech G430's that this headset replaced.The good: easy setup, good range, comfortable, nice battery life, and good price.The bad: average sound quality, no bass or low-tones, and humorously short charging cable.I'm not upset enough to return them but I also can't recommend them."
The mic broke a week after I bought it and when I was using it in game it was glitching out
"I've had these since June, but really only use them a handful of times per month. I'm surprised that I'm already having issues with these; they crackle and cut out constantly (nothing wrong with usb, not moving away from the computer so distance not an issue). Considering how much I paid for them, I'm very disappointed."
"The headphones are sometimes louder on one side, but this can be fixed with windows"
"I purchased these for work in October when it was determined we would be working for home for an extended period of time. I didn't want to be tethered to the computer any longer - these have worked great so far - 5 days a week for 8 hours, however, the microphone is rarely used. I did a quick test call once I received these to ensure it in-fact muted in the upward position & it did - however - now at the end of January, in the up right position the mic is not muting & it is very frustrating, especially when it was so convenient to use with a quick flip up especially when the dog barked or the kids requested my attention. For $70 I don't know if it is worth replacing, who is to say it wont happen again to another pair in 4 months time as well.Very disappointed. Keep this in mind if you're looking for something to use for WFH."
"While this was a great product for the 3 months I had it, I take good care of my electronics and these headphones just ceased function after 3 months of light use. I confirmed it was not the charger, but rather the product just no longer turned on after making a sudden loud static noise while I was wearing them one evening. I feel this is a good product in all other categories but it lacks severely in reliability."
"Had the thing six months. Standard use. No outward damage to the headset or mistreatment in any way. Suddenly the right ear goes dead, the source of the problem being the connection loosening from the jack into my tower, likely exacerbated by the horribly cheap cable connecting to the headset (standard flimsy plastic, like on those $5 earbuds from the gas station). Not fun when you pay this much for a headset.Update - right ear can be made to work again by moving the cable connecting to the jack, making the loose connection connect again"
"I do think this is a very confutable headset.  Earpieces swivels and it will fit you if you have a very large head.The mic could use some work for sure, but the sound quality seems solid.Something to note when I switch between games i have to turn it off and back on for the mic to work."
"I have a big head, and this headset is a bit too small. When you have it on, its natural position is too narrow, so you just feel pressure on your head the entire time. While all headsets do to some extent, there are a lot of better options than this.Big heads, look elsewhere."
"I bought the wireless version of these at the end of Jan 2022. It's mid-May 2022 and already I the mic stopped working. For the price, I'd expect them to hold up to everyday use (and most days the mic is ""UP"" and so turned off). Disappointed. I don't want to haver to buy another set after only 4 or 5 months.As for the rest...I'm not too picky when it comes to audio quality, but to me the sound is fine. Good 3D/stereo (I can place sounds all around me when gaming). Battery is still fine... I can wear them for at least 4 hours without recharging (They may last longer, but I don't keep them on longer than that).Time to try another brand, I guess."
I don't need to hear the loud low-battery warning 5 times over the course of a minute
"Good for a spare gaming headset for guests. Light weight so you can wear these all day. Sound quality is lacking, highs are not very clear and bass is non existent. Save up and get the more expensive HyperX clouds, unless you're on a budget, you should look elsewhere"
"The description stated the headset was supported for use with Xbox One. It did not make clear that it would require a separate connection using the USB cable to the Xbox to power them as well as the 3.5mm jack connection to the controller. This means that you would connect the 3.5mm jack to the controller, then from there (the Y split of the cable is about 3 inches from the USB and 3.5mm connector) you would need to run the USB cable to the Xbox, generating a cabled connection if you were using the controller wirelessly, or another wired connection if you were using a cable connected controller. It is nice that a USB extension was included in case this was needed.My son was looking for a headset he could connect to his computer. When he found out about the way these needed to be connected, he asked if he could try them with his computer. They did work as designed, but he did say the sound quality was low, even for a less expensive headset.Also, the foam padding diameter is very small and seems like would work well for very small ears, but the foam padding was on my ear instead of around it, pressing my ear to my head and making them uncomfortable. This did not fit my sons ears either as he was 19.With the way it connects, and the size of the ear padding, I do feel that these would make a good starting headset for a younger gamer using a computer, but that would be all I could recommend them for.I returned these."
These do not work with a Nintendo switch.
"Three is being nice, the mic doesn't work.What is the point of even wearing this when the mic DOESNT WORK!!!!!I feel like wasted money!!!!I don't care about  the colors that isn't what I play games for!"
"It works for listening to music, watching movies or making calls or video calls, but for gaming the sound quality is horrible!!!!!"
"received the product quickly, plugged it into usb and it gets no power unless you press the cord at just the right angle.  Returned and got another one, at least it works this time but mic is very poor quality even at max input volume its super quiet and like to disable itself."
"the headphone pads are small and my ears barely fit inside [I have to squeeze them in] but otherwise they are good. I did have to ""relax"" the headband to fit my head, it felt like a vice was pressing my head."
"I bought these because I was looking for a pair of headphones with a better microphone that the pair I had. The microphone on this pair did work better, but, other than the unnecessary RGB, that is the only thing that did.The audio was not balanced at all. It was off to one side and more towards the front that it should be, if that makes sense. As I cannot adjust front-to-back audio on my computer, this was a big issue.On top of that, the headphone jack was too big to fit past my phone case, so I could not use these with my phone.In summary, these are a disappointment."
You get what you pay for! Not cheap feeling and worked well for sometime but then just stopped working.
"I can't say I'm crazy about the quality of these, but they look cool and my 10 year old doesn't complain about them."
"The headset looks really nice, unfortunately the microphone stopped working on it after like 2 weeks if that so Its basically just a nice looking pair of headphones now I can't use voice with the set. I've tried everything I can think of checked all my computer settings, nothing is getting the microphone working again."
"I bought these for my son this past Christmas. He loved them, but it only took one month and the mic broke off. He was extremely dissatisfied.  *The company contacted me after this review and  sent me a new headset for free. This was very  kind of them. My son hasn’t been able to try  them yet. I’ll update my review after he tries  them out."
I bought this item thinking it was for adults it turns out that it's for children the mic is extremely small and doesn't reach my mouth.  But if I yell people can hear me
"My teenager uses them, sound and mic are good. But it’s sensitive where it connects to the controller so bumping it can mess with the connection.Still good for the price in my opinion"
"Initially these headphones were fine and my child loved them, but within 2 months  of use the microphone no longer works and he can on longer speak to his friends on Xbox."
"This is a 3.5 mm headset, which connects directly to a PS4/PS5 controller. You may like that. However, 3.5 mm has inferior sound quality to USB. When I used this headset, there were many times (during intense gaming moments) when the audio would cut out and cut back in. This issue is reduced when using a USB headset. If you do not mind this flaw, or do not play action-packed games, get this headset. Otherwise, buy a USB headset that is a little more expensive."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update: I’ve now had these for three months and they’ve started popping in the ears of my friends playing the game with me as well as in my ears. I can’t for the life of me find where to tell the manufacturer and see if they’ll warranty them out and the button for the warranty info just says to contact the seller. I go to the sellers page and there’s nowhere to contact them in that page. Maybe I can’t find it for looking for it but if you’re in a budget get these hopefully they’ll last longer than mine did but if you want something that last you might want to seek another brand. I’ve had these for one day and so far they are great. The sound quality is very good. The mic  quality is very good The guys our playing with said they could hear me very well. The only reason I gave four stars was because the audio jack did slip out one time but for a $18 set of headphones everything can’t be perfect. Also gave four stars because in my opinion, I would rather the headphones not light up because you already have one cord and the USB plug for the power to run. The lights in the headphones is y’d off of the auxiliary cable for the sound. So you have to run another cord to the USB or have the USB plugged into your computer which if you’re sitting at one I guess wouldn’t be a problem. I have a PS5 so the cord is just dangling unless I run another cord to it. They do send a cord that will extend to a plug or power source but then you have the two cords coming to you and your lap. Personally, I would have rather yet not light up and saved may having so many cords but overall, if you’re looking for a decent cheap set of gaming, headphones that you don’t have to charge or that are cheap to replace if they’re for kids, you can’t go wrong with these."
"The audio is really low quality and muddled, it's hard to hear different programs independently or clearly. Additionally, the headphones aren't very comfortable, they are at an odd angle for me with no way to adjust. They don't sit flat.On the bright side the microphone bends and flexes just fine and they light up, so the aesthetics are at least nice. But overall, I probably should have gone for a better model."
"Dead on Arrival. Cord already needs to be held at specific angles to get it to work. Faulty product, and ofc you cannot get a refund without spending money to have it shipped back. Love this beautiful system."
"Would be good for kids but too small for adults. You have to plug in both the 3mm into controller and the USB Into gaming system for the rgb lights to work. Can't recommend even though price is low, there are better headsets at dame price point. Sound is decent but not good. Mic is too low also"
I purchased this on June 1st and the mic is glitching in and out already. I also was unaware that the only way the Led lights work is by having them plugged into the wall.
"Bought these for my son to use when gaming online with his friends. The audio quality seems fine, but the microphone does not work, so he can't really game with his friends. I would not recommend these unless the microphone is completely unimportant to  you."
"I bought this to replace my headset for my computer. However, while the audio works just fine, the microphone doesn't work at all. Also, when the microphone is plugged in, the audio stops working. I had to go back to my old headset until I can afford a replacement that actually works. Only reason it's not a 1 star is because at least the audio works."
"Dislike product, plug slips out of computer, audio is staticky while turning it up and down. I would not recommend this product to be purchased."
The headphones mic lasted one week and a half and the right earmuff was the only earmuff playing
"Sound is good, microphone is complete trash."
You get what you pay for!
I suppose you get what you pay for. This headset sounded fine… until it didn’t. I could do without the virtually-useless USB connector that merely lights up the thing. It’s whatever. But now the headset cuts out frequently for no good reason. An older headset works fine so I’ve reverted to that despite its squeaky articulations and shredding earcups. Back to the drawing board to find another option.
"Works sometimes and sometimes doesn't, great headset for console or even PC gaming, but I've been running into issues with the microphone."
"Update....after my son spent a few hours he was finally able to fix the microphone himself.Gave an extra star since the company reached out to assist with a return.Headset worked ok. The microphone doesn't work. You need to yell for the person on the other end to hear you. Would return them, but the boy tossed the box in the trash and then told me it didn't work."
Not for adult size noodles. Kids ok.  To tight for me and my boys.  Small.
"When the sound came in, it was was crystal clear. However, no matter what settings I tinkered it would not work for my PS5. Works great for PS4. I will be returning it though, because I wanted something to sync with my PS5."
"Overall thought on this headset for the money; they're good for a backup set, but are definitely not my go to set for full time gaming.PROS:good value for the moneysound quality is better than expectedCONS:headphone fitment is uncomfortable after about 30 minutesmicrophone volume is very low, even at max input"
"I think these would be okay for a kid, but for daily wear or teen, i wouldn’t buy it. The ear parts are quite small and not very comfortable, the mic only goes up and down, not closer or further from your mouth.The sound quality isn’t great, I’m not sure how the microphone sounds, but I wouldn’t have high hopes. They do light up blue, and blue is cool, but it’s better to spend a bit more and get something better."
"The headphones themselves are very comfortable and have great sound quality. However, the first set I got, the mic did not work. I returned and the second set arrived. This time the mic does work but it's very, very low and poor quality. If you don't need a mic, go for it. If you chat at all, get something else."
I just needed a pair of headphones to use for the rare moments I'm actually on my computer watching a concert.These work fine they sound okay the microphone is crap but the headphones itself works great. I do wish they just had a USB connection instead of having to be hooked up with the USB and the second plug.When I tested these and I called friends from my computer with these they said it sounded like I was underwater so I knew this was not going to work for me talking to anyone with these.They're not like the best quality sound headphones are going to get but it's okay when you're in a pinch or just need some headphones so you can hear what's going on.
"I use these for gaming. It blocks out outside noise only if your volume is high enough. The mic is decent, but whenever I am playing with people they always say they can hear background noise and my keyboard(— extremely loud). I have a pretty clicky keyboard but I don’t think it should be picked up that loudly. Worth the price though I guess. Cords are annoying.Update- the longer I use them the less I like it. It just feels really cheap and uncomfortable. I got my brother a headset from best buy for around ~$40 and just seeing the comparison in quality is crazy. I wouldn’t recommend getting this unless you really like the cheap style"
Felt decent and the audio was fine on the right side but there was nothing on the left. Went through a lot of bug fixes to no avail.
False advertisement they do not light up at all it’s been couple months and still no light up at all. They been sitting here not being used for false advertisement if you wanna buy  for extra beauty with lights no point
"The audio is constantly cutting out and only coming out of the left side and the slide for the volume has no notch like system causing the volume to change by the slightest brush of something else. The flipping microphone doesn't turn off the mic it just moves it and even the switch to mute the mic DOESN'T EVEN MUTE ALL THE WAY, if you can speak loudly enough you can speak right through the muted mic. The only thing it has going for itself is it's comfortable"
"This is one of the most uncomfortable headsets. I got this to use for PC as it advertise, but it does not work at all. The mic does not connect. The sound quality is very poor and low. This is more like a toy headset than a gaming headset. Have to return it, and does not recommend it at all."
My grandson has been using these for 3 months and the speaker on the right side. He didn't do anything that would cause that so I don't know what happened.  I won't buy these again
"They are good headphones but my disagreement is that they have two USB and audio plug connectors. When I bought them I thought they had two connections for audio if I need USB or plug, because I already have the same ones but they only have USB. But in this case that is not the case, the USB is only for light. that was disappointing."
It was decent for the price however my son does  complain because it’s not as loud it should be and even though it’s advertised to work with the Nintendo switch it does not.
Cheaply made. Did not connect to my ps5 I end up returning it.
"specifically got these for using with Discord for raids. mic doesn't work at all, laptop won't even acknowledge that it was plugged in. only thing that works is the light which doesn't help me at all. absolutely useless for anything."
"Headphones come with both Aux and USB plug attached. So it has 2 plugs on one end you cannot remove. Mic only works when switched on, turning mic from up and down position does nothing. Sound is somewhat muffled and echoey like you’re in a large room when compared to my older more expensive headset. If I hadn’t owned a more expensive pair before hand, I may have not noticed the difference in sound quality. Good cheap pair but if you want better sound, pay a little more for something more mainstream."
This is the 2nd headset that had just stopped working. The seller replaced the first when it stopped working after 1 week. The replacement stopped working after the return window closed. Do not recommend.
One of the speakers stopped working after 3 months.
"Nice sound, cute blue lights (don't care, I'm not 12), none of the various audio plugs will click in on a phone with a decent protective case. Really!? Uh, most people have phones with cases, and want to use their headset for ANY common audio. Will buy a workable audio extender, but next headset, will note that these guys think blue headphone lights are important and phone audio ain't. Bonehead design."
Is good for gaming just wish the cord was not so big and bulky and long. There's an end piece to where it plugs up that has a big piece to wear it gets in the way sometimes spelled or not it sounds pretty good it would be better if it was actually Bluetooth compatible with no cord. It's hard to find a set of gaming headphones that are Bluetooth for a PS4 pro. These will work for now though.
"Unfortunately, despite these headphones are connected to the controller and settings placed on the xbox, I had to rely on the tv volume for the volume on the headphones. Therefore, the tv volume came through loudly and with much bass to those who listened on the other side of the game. I had to mic off in order to play but I needed the mic to play the games I play. I returned. Maybe it was just a defect of the headphones. Possibly might give another try."
Headset was good but cord connection at tip of input was horrible took lik 1 month before you have to move it around to workCable with all connection points is too heavy
"they do the job, well all except noise cancellation. Unsure how these cancel anything for anyone over 12. The ear pieces barely cover the ears. Sound and mic fine though."
"That phones were great in general but they didn’t work without using the second cable. I didn’t need to use the USB because I was using an office phone. I had a cord to connect it, but nobody could hear me through the mic. And I think it was because I didn’t have the USB cable connected which I didn’t need. So good for gaming I guess I haven’t tried that out but not great if you’re taking calls."
To say the sound is poor is an insult to the word poor.  If I had a choise between listening to music with these and plunging a screw driver into each ear I might chose the screw driver.  But I got these for gaming on my PC so they are.....who am I kidding these just plane suck.  Some might disagree but I can't hear them any more.  Got to go now and clean the blood off my screw driver...just to let the silly people know I'm joking about the screw driver....or am i
"Before I say anything - I realize these are inexpensive headphones. However, you would think they would at the very least, do what they’re meant for. My son uses them for his ps5 and unless the cord stays in a precise position, they disconnect.  The cord forks into two ends. One goes to the controller and the other to the PlayStation itself. Seems really silly and redundant to be so connected. The only reason I don’t give this one star is because they seem like they’d hold up well to wear and tear. I would not recommend buying these."
Not impressed with the sound or mic.  And if you have a lot of hair or large head the fit can be a bit tight.  Don't think I'll go this cheap again and don't trust all the reviews.
"I purchased these for my 11 year old grandson for his birthday. He's a big gamer. He says that he loves how clear and loud the sound is. He uses them with his fire tablet, computer and his play station. The price was very reasonable and the quality is great. I would highly recommend this.This is an update on the product. At first I thought this was a great product. After two months the my grandson said the headphones is trash. The sound goes in and out on one side. At first I originally gave it 5 stars. I've been forced to only give it 2 stars."
"I ordered 2 sets for my kids for school. These headphones were great, for the first 4 days.... Now my son can't use them for his online school. Extremely disappointed."
The mic could be better but it's just being used for talking online so it's doable. Bit heavy but the ear pads are comfortable.
"I purchased these with the hopes of them being a good product for what I needed for my office. However, the sound quality was just not at the level I was hoping it would be. Also, the size of the headphones were a tad too small for me. I was worried they would hurt more than help."
Ear cups are small and the sound is not good at all. Dollar store quality
They broke after 2weeks. Made very cheap. The microphone barely worked.
"Does not have a plastic mouth piece , which I was really looking forward to because my son keeps breaking the flexible ones! Works good just very upset with the mouth piece."
"Sound works through headphones but the microphone doesn't work at all.EDIT: The company did reach out to fix the issue and offer a refund, so although the product we received was defective, the company seems to be interested in making sure every customer is satisfied."
"they work well for the price, however it does not light up, and it also sounds HORRIBLE to the point where nobody can understand what is being said, they work on and off"
So very small headset and mic is very short wouldn't recommend for adults but kid or maybe early teen aged persons would be better fit
"The usb is just to turn on the LED, can’t connect thru the us"
"Everytime the cord touches the ground, the mic stops working."
"Does not work with a Switch like advertised. I tried to contact the seller, but I have not heard back."
"The plug broke and I emailed customer service and heard nothing back from them. Would not buy again, donot recommend."
"I probably missed it, but i was expecting the headphones to be rechargeable when it comes to the light part. i hate having to do all that plugging in just to get my headset to light up. It's a struggle. and you have to keep it on a power source if you want it to stay on and move around."
"The headset itself is comfortable to wear, the audio quality is decent and the microphone pickup isn't bad. If there are supposed to be lights on the headset, they never worked. Over all wasn't a bad headset for 20ish$. Will not be purchasing again."
"The sound quality isn't bad, the mic is fairly high quality, and its comfortable, but its slightly heavy. and it stopped working after a few hours."
These only lasted about three months. The microphone fell apart and no longer works. They did not get stepped on or anything they were resting on a stand and are now broken.
"I got these gaming headphones and have used them 3 times.  I went to use them again today and one side of the headphone stopped working, so now I can only hear out of one side.  I suppose you get what you paid for and $20 only lasted three times.  Throwing these out.  I wouldn't buy them again."
Mic broke in a couple days.
"They are okay.  Nothing great.  I haven't noticed noise cancelling in the least.  The one downside is that the USB does not work.  I am not going through the hassle of returning them as the 3.5 connector works which means that I can use them on my computer with the included adapter and PlayStation 4.  However, I cannot use them on my Steam Link as it uses USB for the connection.  Because of this, I will not be purchasing these again and would not recommend them to anyone.  I took off a star because of the USB connection being broken."
"I bought this with high hopes but it broke after one mic test on discord while trying to get ready to play phasmophobia with a friend.  The audio worked once then when I came back later when it was still plugged in, the audio broke and didn't work at all."
I rated this 3 starts because the cord gets tangled very easy. It is adjustable and sound is pretty good. It does cancel out some noise. I didn't care for the extra plug on the headset it's useless and in the way I use this on my Xbox for gaming.
"So this headset is a good value overall for the sound quality and microphone quality, however, it doesn't fit on my head very well even fully expanded, it just barely fits, and I don't have a big head at all. So I would not recommend buying this headset, as I have a feeling it won't fit on the head of a lot of people."
"At the beginning they’re were good , but after 3 months they’re starting going bad the volume was going low and you couldn’t here nothing"
"The headphones and mic worked great, but they would not connect to my laptop despite troubleshooting (my laptop would not recognize them). Coworkers reported that the mic was fantastic. Not a super comfortable fit, but ok for the price."
Product its self was great. However this was a easter bunny gift and was handed directly to my son who it was for. So now I have to figure something else out.
These headphones started to work for the first 3 days then when I plug it in it stopped working I will change my review once I get a replacement
"The quality is great they do as advertised only reason they got a three is they seem to be on the smaller size, or for a child."
Wasn’t packaged at all! Was in its headset box basically tossed around in shipping. You can hear great out of them but the mic didn’t work
"Sound quality is okay, best suited for children that don't know any bettee"
These are big and heavy. Bought for my son but I've used them as an adult and they weren't very comfortable after awhile as they didn't fit my head.
Look I game a lot and use my headset almost everyday. So to me it’s very important it works and works well. This headset is okay. It’s not bad but not great. It’s mediocre. You’ll cut out in middle of conversations and the sound quality is not there. The worst part is people can’t understand you because of the quality just buy a more expensive headset. It works better than this.
I use it for working at home on work computer
Son said his friends couldn’t hear him while gaming.
"Lights don’t work. Voice volume way lower than gameplay volume, couldn’t hear anyone talking, have to adjust the game each time. Fine for under $20."
"My son was very disappointed. We bought these that he’d be able to game and speak to his cousins online while playing however, they are very comfortable and durable looking, but the mic does not work we still kept them and he uses them for regular headphones, but they’re not good for gaming as you cannot use the mic"
Plugged in my headset and it’s so staticky. Nobody can hear me because it sounds too staticy
The audio comes in and out and only comes from the left earpiece. The little thing where you adjust the volume needs to be pressed down sometimes so you can hear.
"I got these headphones a couple of weeks ago, whenever I plug it in to my laptop or Chromebook the usb lights won’t light up"
I purchased the headphones for one of my sons to use on his Xbox. The sound quality is crystal clear both through the mic and on the earpieces. The problem is that they are very small. He is an average sized adult and the headphones look and feel as if they were made for a child. If you have a very small head they may be great for you but for anyone else I do not recommend them.
When i play with my friends they cant really hear me throught the headphones
"First of all Products packaging was good. Came in a rather large box, but contents were protected.It also came  with the basic manual etc. Gave this a 3 star review as this headset was recommended by a gamer friend who had purchased one of the later models and had suggested it as a good option for a remote job.Sound QualityThe first five months of using the product went fairly well. Audio can be turned up very loudly, but if there is background noise the person on the other end will hear it. There is a manual mute botton and volume enhancer botton, but the persons on the other end will hear the odd silence when you press it.FitThe fit was pretty good, fits the ears really well. The ear muffs are very big, comfy and round. (As mentioned, before, noise still gets through).  Disadvantage, after about 6 months the mock leather on the ear muffs will begin to strip a bit. The headset  overall has a pretty big fit, so if you have a small-medium head you may have to readjust a few times. If you have a big head head (tee-hee!), you'll like it. Plus it has a rigid lengthening options on both ears. The muffs themselves have a bit of pivot in them, but the headband (that rests on top of the head) is made of hard plastic and can break if not treated with care.Issues I had:1. The cord or the point that connects into the computer (3.5 mm jack), under six months started to lose static, then over time it stopped working. (Have lighted the part in  on the headset that gives trouble overtime). You can hear videos if you turn it the right way, but others won't hear you clearly, until one day you completely lose the static. Overall was disappointed in the headset as I expected more from a $25 headset.2. We tried to get another jack but those efforts failed, hence the end is cut off in the photos."
"I don’t recommend you buying this for your main headset. But if your headset breaks in your fund, this is a pretty good “cheap” headset. I don’t like the removable mic And also just know that both earpieces have strings so if you wear glasses a lot of the times taking the headset off, we’ll catch your glasses"
When I got it was clear as day. I had good comms and the audio is amazing but I have had 2 of these now and both of the mics quit working but the headset audio still works I don’t know how this works but I’ve tried and tried to get it to work and it never came back so I just use it for audio now until I get a pair of wireless because I think the wires get messed up at the jack part of the controller
"Bought these in May 2024, dead after 5 months.  Sound was clear and crisp, and the mic worked just fine (my family never complained about not being able to hear me clearly).  I could only wear them for a couple of hours though, after that I started getting a headache (my hat size is about 7 3/4, for size reference).I have owned 3 of these, and they all died the same way, one of the wires going into the headphones (has been left and right sides) comes loose. After that the sound starts cutting out or goes away completely.The other 2 I bought lasted about a year ea. , I guess I got a dud this time.  Overall you get what you pay for, and these are cheap......"
These headphones don’t have enough padding in the top section so after some time they begin to hurt the very top of your head.
I don’t even remember using this headset. 3 stars for not being very memorable. Probably worked though because I don’t remember anything negative either. 😂
"It's a decent headset, but after a month, I don't get no sound out of the right speaker anymore"
Kids what driving my crazy for new headsets so I got them these.... They're doing good so far. Not the best headsets we've ever had but they're definitely not the worst!
Good product for the price only issue I had was about a week after buying and using the plastic broke and had to be taped back together
Probably on me but one drop and they stopped working
"They are descent headphones for gaming, their was a short in the chord upon arrival so as long as I don’t move the chord to much it works fine. Also, I was playing the game Alan wake and I noticed that the characters sound like they have no base in their voice and echoey almost."
"Bought this for my son and it worked fine for about a month after which time the mic abruptly stopped working. Tried all the reasonable troubleshooting steps, eventually found that the mic had to be removed from the main body of the headset and re-seated. Easy fix, but not something I would expect to have to do."
"The head set it self was functional and great, but not the microphone,  even reconnecting it.  The major blemish this product had was in a sensitive area, the cable it self. This product should not have been accepted for resale. Poor QC"
"I ordered this headset to replace my Hyper X Cloud IIs, as they're about 5 years old now and getting sticky from the coating rubbing off, but they still work just fine. I unboxed the new Turtle Beaches, plugged them into my mic/headphones jack on my PC and . . . nothing. Windows did not recognize the device. Tried searching the web and doing extensive troubleshooting; nothing. Had to attach it to the microphone adapter from my Hyper X headset just to get it to work, and even then, since it was plugged into the Hyper X adapter, Windows still recognized it as the Hyper X headset, and not the Turtle Beaches. Makes sense, okay sure they worked at least.Then I compared audio quality with music/games. My goodness, even with messing with equalizer settings, they still sounded . . . meh. Booted up a few different games, quality was sub-par. Lack of bass/treble, muffled/scratchy. Switched back to my Hyper X IIs and was immediately impressed with the quality and disappointed with these Turtle Beaches. Figured I'd just give them to my girlfriend for her to watch shows on her laptop, and even still, they sounded pretty bad just watching shows on Hulu, Netflix, etc.If you're looking for a cheap headset that's not $80+ dollars, these will maybe work for a console (PS5/Xbox), but good luck getting them to work on a Windows PC. You get what you pay for. I just put in an order for a Hyper X Cloud III headset and I'm eager for their arrival. Will be returning these ASAP.In sum: Bad audio quality, not recognized by Windows without an adapter. I recommend you look for something else and bite the bullet by spending a little more on something higher quality."
This product is about what you expect. Pretty cheap and lasted about a year before the mic stopped picking up my voice about a year later. Sound wasn’t bad.
"It's not anything exceptional, by far. But, it does work well enough for its price. If you're not trying to shill out $100 on a pair, and either aren't an audiophile, or simply don't care for the relative quality, go ahead and buy it.Noise cancellation is basically redundant. It's about as effective as it looks; you can cover your ears, or use earbuds and likely get better noise cancellation. Sound quality is alright. It's not gonna do any wonders, but if you just want a headset, it works.Oh, and for those getting the Red/Black colored pair (the Recon 50, a PC-targeted version); it does not, in fact, come with a splitter cable, despite what the FAQ, or even the box itself may state. If you look in the product's description, it doesn't even say that it comes with splitter cable. That means that if your PC has 2 dedicated Audio/Microphone ports instead of combing the both of them in one, you're gonna have to settle for sacrificing one of the two main uses of a headset. It's deceptive, and you should not expect a splitter in the first place (though I've seen some reviews that DID apparently get it, it seems. However there are a decent amount who didn't get it either). That being said... it's not anymore expensive than its differently-colored peers; it's on discount to be just as expensive as the others (at least, as I can see now). Perhaps that's a sign of whether or not you'll get your splitter cable. Deceptive, sure, but... I suppose it's not entirely malevolent."
"the price was appealing for my son's first gaming headset. I forgot that anything AUX related has horrendous issues and also turtle beaches also have 2 major flaws.1.) They use some kind of live feedback feature that is supposed to help you not blow out people's eardrums if you start yelling or screaming so it transmits your audio back through your headphones so you can be aware of how loud you're being, but the problem with this technology is that when you pair this with an audio splitter for using a headphone and mic port, it tends to pick up audio that's only supposed to be transmitted to you and spits it back out to you in an infinite loop like its coming through the mic. This means soundboards and voice changers are off the table for these headsets.2.) Last but not least, turtle beaches have always had major issues with their mics working on PC specifically. This headset has a single aux cord, and with most computers you have to use a splitter that has the green and pink cables to get the mic to work at all. The problem with these splitters is that they never upgraded the internals of this technology so it's always terrible audio quality for input and output once you split it. The port on PCs that is supposed to accommodate both output and input through the single aux does not work so PCs, turtle beaches, and audio splitters are all at fault for never upgrading this garbage technology all across the board. I can always tell when I am talking to someone who are using turtle beaches online because it's crackling and popping left and right.I had forgotten why I swore off these aux headsets over 12 years ago, but it's all coming back to me now. Just stop making them, it's a terrible audio experience for the user and the people on the other side. You shouldn't have to go through hours of troubleshooting and needing other equipment to make something work. Just go look on youtube, look how many videos there are about getting turtle beach headphones and mics to work on PC.If you can't just plug it in and it works flawlessly, you have a bad product.If you're on the fence about this product, I cannot speak to the use of it on console but for PC it's a hard pass, just spend a little more money on a USB headset, that technology is dialed in."
"If you play Roblox, go ahead. I play Dragonball xenoverse 2 and if the sound is turned up more than halfway the speakers crack."
"My son has gone through so many headsets. He is 8 and pretty rough on them. This brand was highly recommended so we gave it a try. They have held up pretty good as headphones, but the mic quit working by week 9. I didn't realize it was removeable when I bought it- and wish I didnt get one like that. Hes too rough unplugging and likely self-caused breakage"
"Bought this as a replacement for a previous cheep headset. The fit, sound, and mic quality are all great; however, the cord is very short, and leaves me no room to connect to my PC (that sits on next to me on the floor)."
so flimsy and shaped weird so a bit uncomfortable for my head after long periods. mic works well.
Honestly confused by the positive reviews on this product. The mouth piece attachment barely attaches - I can shake the headset one time and it flies out. It won’t even stay up where your mouth is because it is so loose. Quality of the sound doesn’t really matter when the parts literally won’t stay together
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Dislike
"I'm disappointed because it looks like a very good headset indeed. I tried my best to make it work with my Xbox series X but unsuccessfully. I watched many videos to find a way to make it work and found nothing. The manual doesn't help at all. You will find clear guide watching internet videos. I tried it in my laptop and it sounds great, but unfortunately I Purchased it exclusively to use with my Xbox series x playing MSFS."
"Do you like pain? Forget the corset and buy this headset!In all fairness, this headset is actually better than decent. The sound is clear (almost always) and the mic seems to work well...well, well enough so that whoever is in your party is not constantly pestering you to repeat what you said (i.e., ""Help! I was screwing around and accidentally attacked a guard! I need a soul gem, lest I am forced to respawn at a wayshrine!""). As long as you keep the mic somewhere in the vicinity of your mouth, and the people in your party don't have cotton in their ears, they'll be able to hear you quite well. That said...After spending an hour and a half with this monstrosity attached to my fairly petite and feminine skull, I found myself twisting and turning the large, plastic, headcovering-of-doom in an effort to gain some much needed relief. Unfortunately, unlike my quest to find four stupid miners in a cave, I was unsuccessful (truthfully, I was unsuccessful on both counts, but that is hardly the point right now, is it?). The point is that, the following day, I was nursing a headache that left me feeling like a dragon had used the top of my head for a drum. I assumed it had to be a fluke, until I repeated the process the following night (I'm stubborn that way).After attempting increasing ludicrous solutions to the pain this hell-spawned headset caused me (imagine being so desperate that, caring less how ridiculous you look, you fold a silk pillowcase into a ball and place it ever so gently between your head and the top of the headset!), I finally came to the conclusion that the headset was, without a doubt, the source of my pain. Despite the misery heaped upon my poor Nord soul, I decided to give this headset three stars, mainly due to the quality of the sound and the mic. If you have a head that is of a different size, or even if you just enjoy having a constant, nagging pain on the top of your head, you might love this headset. I, however, feel the unquenchable desire to take a blacksmith's hammer to this thing, turn it into a pile of dust, and order something a bit more comfortable!"
They are decent for the price!
Good sound but if you have a bigger head it pushes on the top of your head
"Let me preface this by saying, I've owned *at least* 5 Turtle Beach headsets over many years of console gaming. They were literally my favorite brand for quality vs. cost.My most recent TB headset broke (my fault) so I, of course, hopped on Amazon to order another pair. The Recon 50s were cheaply priced, and I trust the brand, so I got them.The first set came yesterday. There was NO SOUND in the left ear. I figure I just happened to get a defective set. Mistakes happen. No big deal. I initiated a return, and asked to be shipped a replacement.I got the replacement today. I excitedly hooked them up, ready to game with my friends. To my absolute shock, the sound quality was HORRIBLE. It sounds as though my audio is coming from 2m underwater. In disbelief that my favorite brand would sell a product with such awful quality, I thought that I must need to tinker with my audio settings on the ps5. Unfortunately, nothing I did made it sound any better. They are absolutely unusable.Maybe I was unlucky enough to get TWO defective sets back to back? Or maybe the product is just garbage? Who knows?! I'm definitely very disappointed."
"They seem to work as described, the mic works well. They are comfortable to wear and don't fall off while playing. The cord is a decent length to be able to keep it out of the way while playing. I tested this one on an Xbox series one and was plug and play.ConIsn't very loud even with the volume all the way up, actually I have been using it at max volume. Maybe a positive if parents want to safeguard their kids from hearing loss."
"[Disclaimer, I am not an expert on Headphones/Audiophile. This is purely based on experience and on what I consider to be ""quality sounds"".]I have a Beexcellent Gaming headset that I bought on sale for 15$(Original price = 19$) and I've used it for over a year now. I've decided that It's time to get a better headset that's under 50$ so I went with the Turtle Beach Recon 50p (On sale for 25$). Of course, I went and did my research and found out that it's pretty good for it's price. Boy, I was wrong! Here's why (Also In comparison with my old 15% headphones)Pros:+Comfortable - I was able to use it for 3 hours without feeling anything on my head. The ear cups perfectly fit my ears and it adjusts as well the moment you wear them. // -The Beexcellent Headset however, is too heavy. I can't use it for more than 1 hour and the ear cuffs is too large. ( I have large ears)+Portable - You can rotate the ear pads for 90 degrees. You can easily pack it into a bag and travel with it. // -You can't do that with my old headphone so I had to be creative in order to travel with it.Cons:-Build Quality - I may be asking too much for a cheap headphone but I feel like this will only last for a few months. The cables are thin and easy to wear off after a few twist n turns, the ""headband"" part of it is made of plastic like most children toys are and it's very clunky. I have a heavy hand and I'm scared I might accidentally destroy this after a few uses. //+Beexcellent is sturdier than this (Had it for a year, dropped it multiple times 6 ft max and I'm not good at handling devices so I can assure you it's sturdy)- Sound Quality - This is where I am disappointed with this. Obviously the most important feature is the sound quality. It is so bad it's like turning off the equalizer for your music. To be fair, it's for gaming but this is bad for gaming as well. There's no immersion, it's like you're listening through a Can. No such quality at all. I also record my voice in Audition and hearing my voice and using my preset is so bad I can't make a proper preset on it //+On my old Headphone, the quality is good. Comparable to Razer Kraken (I used to have one) except there's no noise cancellation and it's not as immersive since it's Razer lol.-Price - Too overpriced. I bought it for 25$ and yet a 15$ headphones is WAY BETTER overall. The build, and sound quality is better.Overall, if you're looking for a better sound quality headset, this isn't for you. Think of it like buying an earphone from the dollar store. I'd suggest the Beexcellent Gaming Headset linked below. It's cheaper, and sounds way better than this. If you don't mind the sound quality but want a comfortable and portable headset then this passes as a cheap headphones.Link:  Beexcellent Gaming Headset with Mic for PlayStation 4 PS4 PC Laptop Tablet Xbox One - Surround Sound, Noise Reduction Game Earphone - Easy Volume Control & LED Lighting - 3.5MM Jack"
Bought these for my 7 year old for his Switch. They worked great for a couple weeks then the mic went out. We got a replacement and it seems to work fine. I will update In a couple weeks on durability. Hopefully these ones jeep working.
Kinda works at times. I have to wiggle the connector for it to work sometimes. Not sure if the connector has bad contact or something internal
My son says they work very well but would be better if it had cushions on the top it hurts his head after a while.
"The headset itself works fine. Cheap option with good audio qualityHowever, the microphone attached doesn't work at all - not with my phone or my PC. There's nothing else I can really say about it"
"Pretty decent headphones , cushions are comfortable but start to hurt after a while the only problem I had was with my cord it seems like it has a shortage , my headphones would tend to cut out or start making static noises when I moved the cord a certain way"
Bought for my kid’s to use for PS5. Nothing special in terms of value…not very comfortable and has a distinctly cheap feel to them. Nothing special in audio quality. Was hoping to get more for my money to be honest.
"Ok, whoever is reviewing these and giving them top stars must have stopped growing at the age of 12 or something is up! :DTo put it simple this headset is small - everything about the design is small and lightweight which is nice - but - am finding they fit snug and tightly and are not very comfortable.If you are an average sized human person - be cautious - because these things while they will likely fit will be tight. The design is interesting because the headset cups are like 25% smaller than the other headsets we have - they essentially barely fit over your ears - if you have regular sized ears that is (likely perfect for the tween/teen crowd).The headband is about 25% shorter too and while it does make it across my head and cover each ear - they are tight on the ears and can feel the headband pushing in to the top of my head. The headband part itself has about 95% less padding when compared to the other headsets we have - so there is little to no relief of the pressure these cause on the top of your regular sized head.My 12 year old loves them - they fit her fine and she says she likes their style.So in summary as an adult - these are a headache inducing uncomfortable headset with 25%+ less material than your normal headset creating pressure points on your ears, side of your head above your ears, and across the top of your head - they are tight and uncomfortable.Gave them two stars - because the tween in the house said she likes them and the sound and mic seem to work ok. Personally will never wear them again - but maybe she can have them. :)"
Sound is good but not very comfortable after a while and the cord is easily wrapped around your neck. That last point may be a positive
It’s not good but for the price you’re paying it’s absolutely a steal
"Decent for the price. Quality is okay, we’ll see how long they last."
"Bought this because my mike kept cutting out... this did not help. Turns out the issue was with my controller. Nothing wrong with the headset, except the sound quality is subpar. I went back to using my standard $16 headset that I use for work. Both seem to have identical sound quality but this one is just bigger and heavier. Not quality enough to call itself a gaming headset"
"I had them overnighted for my grandson, but wasn’t able to use.  The mic kept falling out, I did send back. Was nicely packaged."
Update 11/2024 They stopped working can only hear low sounds. The volume stopped working after 7 months of use.These make playing COD so much better as I can hear a bear poof in the woods when these are on. Good sound quality for the price ! You can't go wrong here ! The mic works well as everyone can hear me clearly !
These headphones can sound as nice as they want (they're okay) but they pinch the top of your head and you don't want to wear them maybe more than 10 minutes which kind of defeats the point. Most gamers I know like to run 1-4 hour sessions and that doesn't really mix when your headphones cause your head pain :(
I like this headset ideal but I bought another one because I didn't like how the microphone was just in my face like that yk. But the value for money ratio is pretty good.
"Hate to say it, but we had to return these rather quickly. Lost sound in one of the ears, and then a couple of days later, the whole thing stopped working. Shame, since they are very affordable, but it seems to be a lottery on whether or not you get one that works/lasts.Check out all the reviews before purchasing, as I am sure there are genuine positive experiences. I didn't want to roll the dice again, so we chose something else. Good luck!"
"The headphones themselves work great, my only complaint is that these are pictured with the boom mic and when they arrived the mic was not included. Not too big a deal, I actually had an extra one. But I think it's misleading and a little dishonest. For everyone's knowledge, authentic replacement parts are available through Turtle Beach."
"I have a decently large head, nothing crazy, and even on the biggest size it’s a bit too small. After an hour or so the band on top gets uncomfortable. The sound is great for the price. The mic is decent too. They look pretty normal, nothing flashy, and there’s a volume dial and mic mute switch on the cable."
"I bought these to use for streaming so I needed a headset that was very comfortable when worn for a long time. This headset didn't meet those needs. The sound quality is really good and the mic comes through nice and clear but the headband is barely padded and grips a little too hard, putting a lot of pressure on my temples and skullcap. I had to take them off after barely 5 minutes of wear.If you're less sensitive to pressure, these are great sound quality and worth the money. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to go with a different set."
It works but only after plugging it in and unplugging it then replugging it back in again.. every time.. i have no issue with my x15s working on same exact controllers the first time everytime but this specific one i loterally have to do this process everytime..
"This is a pretty good headset. I got it in November 2020, and it's doing good. The audio is good, and if you buy a paid headset audio enhancer, it makes the audio way better then just stereo uncompressed. But, after a year or two of buying this headset, problems started to show. Sometimes, you couldn't even hear out of one ear on the headphones, and you would have to twist the audio jack to make them work. But even after twisting it, within 5 seconds you wouldn't be able to hear out of one ear again. The mute switch and the volume slider is great, but there is a weird buzzing noise that people in your party/call can hear after you mute, which is annoying. Overall, this is a great headset for the price, and if you can take really good care of it and not use it as much as I do, you can probably keep the sound good for 4-5 years."
sound is not good.
The headset is stiff and uncomfortable. The mic makes you sound robotic sometimes
"The quality of these headphones and the materials were super cheap feeling and uncomfortable on the head. They’re definitely not great for long gaming sessions, however the audio quality makes up for this. For a budget headphone it’s not too bad however I can’t say I recommend it."
"When someone is running or any sound is directional the headset plays it on the opposite side, which makes losing games a frequent thing. The mic is on the left side, so I know for sure I’m wearing it right. And if I flip the headset, then my mic will be to the back"
"Perhaps the fault is my own.  I did purchase a refurbished product to save a bit of money after all.  However, when I buy a refurbished item, I do still expect it to work.  Such was not the case with these.  The headphones themselves worked fantastically, the microphone was a whole different matter.  It's the detachable type, which I had thought might be convenient....it wasn't.  When everything was hooked up to my computer it was able to detect the mic and knew something was there, but couldn't pick up any sound from it at all.  After a great amount of time spent troubleshooting the mic and attempting to fix the problem in case it was an issue with a driver, my computer, or simply user error I was finally able to narrow down the problem.  The connection between the microphone and headset was simply broken.  I'm not sure what exactly the issue with it was, but if you spent enough time wiggling it around and then held it at just the correct angle...it would work for a second or two.Amazon was wonderful and handled the return quickly and easily as always and I already had a credit on my account for the product the next day...while the headset is still sitting boxed up on my couch waiting for UPS to come pick it up.I don't really like having to write this review as I still have a lot of faith in Turtle Beach, but will be more cautious about purchasing their refurbished items in the future.  In fact, I actually went ahead and ordered another set by Turtle Beach as my husband has used them for years and loved them, while I have typically used Logitech and have been equally happy with them.  However, since I'll be using these for transcription work as well as gaming I wanted the more comfortable feel and noise cancellation offered by the headset I eventually ended up purchasing.  Ironically enough...I still didn't buy a brand new set.  I purchased one of Amazons open box deals.  In this case, however, it states that the product may not come with the original box intact or with the instruction booklet, but that the headset itself has never been used before.  Here's hoping I'll be back in a few days posting a great review of the new headset and not another poor one proving that the problem isn't Turtle Beach or Amazon, but me...for being too cheap to suck it up and pay full price."
They fit comfortably and have good sound quality but aren't as loud as I'd have liked. The microphone on them doesn't work. I've tried everything and made sure it was plugged all the way in but still nothing. I have to use my other headset when I need to play something where I need a mic. Essentially I just bought a set of headphones
Stopped working after a little over 2 months
"This headset is good enough. There's no serious issues with this product. But overall sound quality and comfort, nah...but if your budget is tight..it'll do just fine. Mic sounds good enough too."
The sound quality is alright. I'm sure there is cheaper brands that are better but turtle beaches have been a staple of gaming headsets.the microphone bends and is flexible. but it's not an issue
"I bought these having never owned turtle beaches but always hearing how they were “good” and I get it, these are budget but MY GOD. They feel so filthy. It’s like sitting in a 2003 vehicle interior in the summer sun. The plastic is so crunchy and loose and cheap feeling. The sound in the earphones is eh at best quality wise and plan on cranking that volume up cause these lil fellas is quiet. But hey at least the mic is good? Nope. Wrong . My buddies describe me as talking through a tunnel through a running vaccum. Wouldn’t buy these. Razer has the kairas for like 5-10 dollars more. Get those."
The sound quality is great for the price.  The detachable mic was a big win for me.  They are only comfortable for a short while.  The padding in the overhead band is very thin.  And unlike a lot of other reviews I found them to be very hot.  My ears were sweating after an hour.
"So I bought these because my current headset was not working in one ear, it ended up being a bad headphone jack port on my pc. Thank God I no longer need these turlebeach headphones because they feel so incredibly cheap. They are super thin cheap plastic and the ear cushions are also very cheap and uncomfortable. Don't let the turtle beach name fool you."
"Got these as a replacement to old ones I had just like it. I have a feeling they’re made differently now. They work, just not what I expected from this brand."
I bought these for my boyfriend because he has an Xbox/ps4/nintendo switch but it’s only working for the Xbox. I bought these because it says universal. A real disappointment that it doesn’t work for the others.
Works for the price it is. Unfortunately was not the quality I was expecting. Shame on me for expecting cheap to be quality
"Not good hanging headphones the sound is trash could be much better, have to adjust your settings on your system just to hear better, I honestly hate Xbox PlayStation has way less problems was way easier to use and buy things for it"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I got the used “like new” so was expecting to have the mic but guess that’s what I get for buying anything used thought it would have the mic so if I can get a mic cool wouldn’t return hope customer see sees this 🤷🏼‍♂️
"So far, I only have a couple of complaints. first, they are somewhat tight for me. The pinching feeling after wearing for ~30 minutes. Then there is the excess heat that my ears feel when wearing them for a semi long play time. The last two can be prevented by taking a break. (I know, WHAT? A break?) The final issue was the microphone ending up breaking on me. It snapped something on the inside of the headphone and now will not connect and stay in, just falls out. I still use them as the sound quality is fairly good for the price. Just don't ude these with wireless as the volume was very low. Connected them to one of my old USB controllers and the volume is good."
"The earpieces work fine, volume is not that loud though. Also, the plugin mic does not work. Would recommend spending the extra $40 to get the more expensive Turtle Beach headset."
"The headset works great, but we never got the mic to work!"
"This headset is overpriced, period.  At the time that I am writing, it is a $40 headset.  For $80 you can get the Turtle Beach Ear Force Stealth 450 which is wireless,  has various surround modes, allows you to dial your own voice into the mix so that you don't feel a psychological need to shout, etc. etc.  The Recon 50 may be cheaper, but it's not like it's only $15 or something, which is the price that I believe it is worth.The biggest shortcomings that actually bother me are:1)  I cannot hear my own voice in the mix.  That means I only hear myself sounding like I have a cold (muffled) and I find myself overemphasizing syllables that are blocked by the earmuffs.2)  The USB cable is short.  Very short, and their solution is to have a breakaway in the cable.  I can sit at my desktop with the headset on, but I cannot stand up, which I was able to do with my older Turtle Beach wired headsets.  Also, the cable is too short.  Did I mention that?3)  The design of the USB cable is also awful.  Headsets like my old P11 have a single wire that dangles down from just the left-side earpiece, with a dongle that gives separate volume controls for Game and Chat.  The stereo sound is therefore routed through the phones themselves.  But this model has a wire hanging from each earphone that meet in a Y that practically forms a chinstrap.  I find it rather claustrophobic, and there is only a small on/off and volume slider on the dongle.Bottom line, save your pennies and spring for pretty much anything else, because for not much more you should be able to purchase a far superior headset.  For the same price, I'm sure you could do better."
Cords gray easy and audio isn’t the best but it works well
"Ok pair of headphones, decent sound for price. The cord is a little annoying and tight around your neck/chin area.  And prolonged use gives me a head ache from the top of the headphones on my head"
"My TB 600s died as they snapped where the headband meats the earpiece because its cheap plastic that TB Scores.  These are also tb but they are cheap and are wired instead of wireless.  But, I have the Series X and these plug right into the controller.  Comfort is ok.  Sound is nice although tone control would be nice.If they break, well they were cheap.  Ill just replace them."
This headset makes both of my controllers die randomly.  I thought it was my batteries so I bought special Xbox controller battery packs and the problem is still there.  It happens on both controllers and the firmware on both is up to date. This sucks because I missed Black Friday deals to buy something else because I didn’t realize it was these headphones doing it. Makes me so angry to die in intense games all the time because my controller just shuts off randomly. Super frustrating.
I ordered a red headset and got a red/blue headset. It works but it’s not what we wanted
We loved this product was comfortable to wear but the mouth piece is cheaply made and broke within 7 weeks of having it.
"Headset works perfectly, microphone quit working after a week. I guess you get what you pay for SMH!! Disappointment is an understatement"
it makes you sound kinda goofy but i like to troll so it’s ok
It works great the sound is amazing no problems with plugging it in and playing however the ear cups are very uncomfortable and cause me a lot of pain and I can't wear them for more than a few minutes before it starts to hurt.
Sound quality is at the level expected for the price. The material is very thin and flimsy. Don’t be fooled by the photo! It is very low quality but for the price you are getting what you paid for.
"Like most headphones, the weakest point is where the ear cups meet the headband. On this particular headset, that point is very flimsy. My eight-year-old has managed to break them twice in the six months we've had them. Granted, if you're an adult or a teen you may treat them a bit better than a younger kid and they might last. Or, you might accidentally sit on them one day and they're done for. The good news is that they have a one-year warranty and I just submitted my second claim. The bad is that going through this process is annoying and I'm not expecting them to hold up for long once the year expires.Besides being break prone, they are a decent headset on a budget. It's nice to be able to adjust the volume and mute. The sound is fine. They feel very light and not very substantial, but they are fairly comfortable.In the end, I recommend spending a little bit more for a better headset just for the peace of mind."
"so my son has been using his for a couple days and now he can only hear stuff it won’t let him talk to people that can not hear him, i went in settings and made sure it was turned on??? help"
"I use this on my Xbox One controllers. This is the second one I've bought, the first I broke by accident and it was the white and green one. This one broke because the audio jack cuts out and it doesnt connect well to my controller for some reason, I think the connecter from the headset is broken so I'm upset that my second one broke so fast and my first one didnt have that problem at all!Pros:Mic is totally removable so if you want to play with just the headphones it can be connected and disconnected really easily!It cancels out noise pretty well, I can barely hear myself talk when its projecting audio.Ear pieces are comfortable and headset design is aesthetically nice.Cons:Plastic piece can dig into your head a little so you need to adjust it well.Audio jack can go faulty so it will only play sound out of one ear it breaks, or not at all!Overall I like this headset a lot, but I really wish my second one didn't break with the audio connector because my first one did not at all. Now I'll need another headset and I might look to other brands for a more sturdy headset that won't break like my second one did."
I bought these for Xbox like it says in title and description but the box that showed up says PlayStation (they do work obviously with any 3.5mm jack) but handing a ps5 box to an Xbox owner is insulting lol
Likes: good sound. Good mic pick up.Dislikes: cord easily frays and can easily break.
"perhaps it's the fact that the mic is removeable, perhaps it's just a shoddy headset built to never work properly. either way, here's been my experience with this product:the first headset, the mic was MISSING. i demolished the box looking for it. it wasn't there and it was brand new. wtf, right? i got in chat with customer service who hook me up with a drop-off with QR code, which was cool. i took it for a little test run to see how the sound quality was, and it isn't terrible. it was better than i was expecting, really - you can discern which side a sound is coming from in a game, it can handle some bass noises preventing the sound from being tinny and staticky. the color is nice too (got me the black and green ones). they are VERY uncomfortable though. i wear glasses and they squeeeeze. i was like ok, this whole process and the fact my mic was missing sucked, and then they're downright painful to wear, but the sound is good enough i'll probably give these a 2/5.nope. i get my replacement headset, and i cannot make the computer recognize that these headphones have a mic attached. i tried putting it in all the jacks, i tried updating my sound drivers, i tried manually setting mic settings to this headset, and it just can't be done. i do not have the option to do it. i'm super aggravated, please don't waste your time and money on this headset, it isn't worth it."
"My son has broken 4 expensive headsets so the price is great! However, the sound quality is horrible! It's turned up to the max and you can barely hear people talking."
"This gaming headset was a gift for my son. I ordered the black/blue option and it arrived as the black/green option. Kind of disappointed I didn’t get what I paid for, but he seems to like it."
"the bad: literally no padding on the top of this headset making it really uncomfortable if you don't have a full head of hair. i'm pretty much blad and this thing hurt within minutes.  Also , the connector is straight, so it hangs down on the controller and makes it snag all the time ... 90 degree connector would have been much better.the good: it sounds ok and has volume and mute button on the cord. Can't beat the price . looks cool. mike is like a flex snake so you can move it where ever you like , that's nice .. others say it sounds fine and they can hear me good.overall:  i'll use it till it breaks but won't buy another one...  for the price it's ok , but low quality considering the brand name ... my previous 2 other turtle beach headsets looked as they were made way better by a different company. This feels like a cheap headset made to look like a nice turtle beach headset."
It’s cheap the Sound quality it’s not great and the mic it’s ok  but after half a year or so it will break the mic will sound horrible or not work and the sound also will stop working this product it’s meant to be bought and thrown away after a while will definitely recommend to spend the extra money on a good headset cuz on the long run you will probably waste more on replacing this than a good headset
"This is the second set of these headphones we've owned.  The thin wiring wore out in the first set, but my son liked them otherwise.  I decided to order a second set for him, and we were disappointed when right out of the box, the microphone would not stay in the jack.  Normal (minor) adjustment of the microphone (that is made to bend and adjust) would make the microphone fall out of the (incredibly) loose jack.I contacted the manufacturer's support - as suggested by Amazon, but after a handful of back and forth emails over a couple weeks' time, I'm still left without resolution or a replacement.  At this point, we just want a useable set of headphones.  I recommend finding something else."
My mic on my headphones stop working every time I get a new pair I’ve gotten two and the mic won’t work when I try to switch it on
He had then a week and one ear failed.. great headphone for the price tho.. loud . He fixed the mic wire and it started working again
I bought the blue color of this headset. As soon as I took it out of the box and plugged it into my Xbox the volume was much quieter then expected. it’s still usable but this has been a lingering problem that’s frustrating. Otherwise comfort and durability is great but wouldn’t recommend if you want loud volume.
"I intended to use this for an amateur radio headset, but the microphone pickup was far too weak. I checked this on a PC input as well and found that, as with the radio, it required maximum mic gain and speaking very loudly to get enough microphone volume to use. I tend to want to speak at a soft to normal voice, so I returned this. I did not have the same problem with a Koss SB45.The weak pickup might not be so much a defect as a design choice. Perhaps it would work well for a gaming console with more gain and/or where a player might tend to shout."
Defective hardware audio cuts in and out team mates can’t hear me or they have to turn there party chat to 100 even THAN they still can barely hear me very disappointed and the audio output was garbage when you speak it’s not crystal clear like there other products it’s a cheap headset low quality and will fail may not at first out of the box but it will within a month this product may not be compatable with newer controllers or even on pc I tried a few different ports a dozen controllers if you want a headset BUY the turtle beach XOFOUR it will be the best and only headset you will ever use I tried this to save money but it brought me back to the xofour set
"These ave pretty good sound, battery life, are light and comfortable for long sessions. Mic is very sensitive, will pick up pretty much everything, hope your call software has good filtering, but the mic itself sounds fine, but the mute button is so unusable.The mute makes a very loud, sharp clicking sound that the person on the other end of the call can hear, and the sound it plays to indicate it's been unmuted is long enough, and loud enough that it also makes into your call, meaning they can hear audible feedback when you mute and unmuted yourself, which i've been told is very annoying to hear on the other end of the call.If the sound was more subtle, this wouldn't be an issue, but it's LOUD. You will need to use a software mute to make this headset work in an environment where you need to mute occasionally due to noise. Clicky switches for mute buttons is poor desing, even for a headset this cheap. Membrane buttons are not expensive, and Logitech should know their importance on a mute function. This was clearly never tested."
"For the price the headphone and mouse isn't bad but there are a few problems I experienced that docks a few points off. Starting with the good I found that setting the items up was easy, only needing to plug everything in and turn it on. The headphones have decent build quality and trust me when I say you will not be able to hear anything outside the headphones once your in game, the buttons are ok but sometimes can be a bit flimsy being that it looks to be made from plastic. The microphone included in the headset is not the best, luckily i have another mic so i didn't have to use it but the few times i have led to complaining teammates and friends about the quality. Volume control on the headset is ok but if your like me you never ended up using the buttons as you just use windows to control the volume. Im also going to mention that it could have just been turned into Bluetooth as I didn't really see the need to plug it up even though its a wireless headset. The mouse also isn't bad although if you a person that doesn't like white gaming accessories due to them staining easily id say it wasn't really a problem with these two items. The mouse after awhile did gain a bit of wear and tear and a issue that I've experienced that I'm not sure if any others have is that the mouse will randomly disconnect and reconnect during play sessions, which if you like playing games competitively it can and from what I've experienced will be a problem. Overall I would say that for the first few months its a very comfortable experienced but i will mainly recommend this for anyone who either games on console or is new to gaming in general as it at least helped me get my foot into the door for pc gaming. But I do recommend to not expect this to be a permanent/long-term item for your setup as it is coming up on a year the items are almost unplayable."
"I bought it for $66 and the total amount charged is like $83.34 someHOW???? I went to get a refund and it was gonna give me $72 back and I’m pissed now… btw side note I went through the motions like I was going to purchase another one and there isnt even an option for $10 shipping only 6.99 idk they tried to scam me or something.Now for the product review… the headset is the best on the market in my opinion accept the mic that’s not the best. It is the lightest headset ever…It feels great sound quality is good, I went to YouTube and did sound test and everything was really good. And the bass is good enough…The mouse.There is a lot of better choices for the price range. One thing I really don’t like is the weight… it’s almost feels heavier then the headset… and I’m not a fan of the shape…."
pretty uncomfortable out of the box. maybe they are fitted for a kids head idk.the wireless tech is pretty good though and my friends can hear me pretty well.
"The headset works and is lightweight, but the button interface is awful. There was no manual in the box and I had to look up how to pair the headset up with the dongle on Google. The Lightspeed (dongle) connection is holding the power button for 1.5 sec (what?) and powering it on is 1.5 sec. Yup same thing.Bluetooth pairing is a blinking blue light while Lightspeed is blinking CYAN. WHY? You can also change the max volume setting from 85 db to 100 db but I don't have room in my house for the transmutation circle required for the demon binding. I dare not try to pair this with an PS5, I might bring down the whole playstation network"
"If I am completely honest with you I do not buy my headphones without doing research and knowing what to expect out of the box. I was sorely disappointed with this set of headphones.I love the bluetooth feature, it is one of the reasons I have chosen to get these set, but in doing so I lost much of the good sound quality I was used to.I have a long line of headsets I use for gaming, music, work etc. I am a bit of an audiophile, and these were not it. In the reviews I had read, seen, watched the headset was advertised as having a great quality found audio output. I did not experience that at all.The headset has virtually no bass and with that It does not connect with Logitech G-Hub to attempt equalizer help.All in all these are not headphones I would recommend buying for gaming or music, only comfort, the mic isn't even a good quality in my opinion. I don't know if I just got a bad batch, but this is only good for watching videos or movies or just talking on discord.I had high hopes for this set as I got a new laptop and wanted to keep my USB ports free, but I much rather go back to my Corsair void elite wireless 7.1 surround headset, my word the sound from this headset didn't even cover normal conversation from my nephew to my mother. I could hear everything going on over the output of this headset."
"I bought these as they are known for being quite comfortable and staying in good Bluetooth sync. And that is true. They are!But let's not kid ourselves, the audio quality is OK at best. The mic is clear but not great. Also the lack of manuals lately in things is annoying. I bought them on sale and they still seem a little over priced."
"Even though it is branded lightspeed it won't work with the unified receiver from other logi devices. Quite a bummer, I'd say. The device works great, though."
"Without updating this headset it will barely work, so make sure you have the most up to date software. Unfortunately the update process can be rather tedious and finnicky. If the dongle works, it makes the update easier. Without the software updates, you can either listen to decent audio, -or- use your mic and have the lowest quality audio you may have ever listened to, so make sure to update."
"Good sound and overall comfortable headset. I bought this headset specifically because it doesn't have the mic on a boom/arm and honestly enjoy the form factor and light feel on my head. Its great to have a headset that is more like a set of comfortable headphones that happen to have an integrated mic. There are however two key issues with this headset that makes me wish I had gone a different route.1) The microphone randomly quits and can only be fixed by switching which USB port I have the Lightspeed dongle plugged into. It is very frustrating to have to dig to the back of my PC in the middle of a game or zoom call to move the dongle to another USB port or to one of my front USB ports. This happens randomly and is definitely an issue with the headset, as the headset speakers will still work while the mic remains unresponsive(even in windows mic test). Driver and Logitech software are up to date and it will even happen on a fresh full charge but this issue is so random and the only sure fix is the move the dongle to a different USB port and the previous USB port with not let the mic work until after the PC has been rebooted. Audio will continue to come thru the headset.2) There is no real battery charge level indicator other than the LED on the headset itself. It only displays Green for 31% or more and Red for 30% or less. I would think that a battery level indicator on my monitor/display wouldn't be to much to ask for any wireless headset or headphones in 2022. It wouldn't be a big deal if the headset could be used in a wired configuration while charging. Either solution would be a huge upgrade in my opinion.These two issues aside I still like the feel of the headset and the audio output is great and have been told the mic comes thru clear. Considering the price and my satisfaction with the feel I will be sticking with them for now but I dont know that I would recommend them. This is written after 3 months of use."
"I think I understand why these were so cheap now. Not like the previous quality I have seen with Logitech. The sound quality is overall poor. I do not listen to music at high volume and this headset was new. The sound tears and is distorted with certain high tones. I also have been using this with the supplied ""dongle"" and am within 4 feet and line of sight of it without any obstruction. I was hoping for a better deal. The foam on the ear pieces are also pretty noisy with any slight movement of your head. They are fairly comfortable and very lightweight. Despite other complaints about the mic, it seems to work well. Battery lasts all day as well."
"While they sound fine, maybe a bit bass-heavy compared to my old headphones (though I'm no audiophile.), they're TINY! If you have a normal-sized head, do not buy these. They're pretty small, I'm definitely pretty much the maximum size that can wear them, and they're not comfortable, the headband presses into my head.. If you're buying them for a child or someone with a small head, they should be great, though. The microphone sounds decent enough. They block a decent amount of sound, I can barely hear the clicks of my keyboard (blue switches) through them."
i actually do like this headset. but my main problem with them is the lack of noise cancelling and bass.i can still hear other things in my room while playing compared to another wired headset that i have.it also lacks the bass feel that i should be getting. for example - Hell Divers 2 has a lot of explosions and they just don't give me that immersive feel as my wired headset does.if these two things were addressed i would give it 5/5 but don't get me wrong i still use this headset and do like it over others. i can walk pretty far away from my computer and hear everything clearly.usability of the buttons and charging abilities are 5/5
"They work well and were easy to install, they’re just not comfortable."
"I've been having horrible luck trying to find/obtain a wireless headset that ticks all the boxes that I need.I loved that this one was lightweight with easy setup and no need to install additional drivers out of the box. The audio (Sound) quality was very decent.But I was instantly dubious about how the ""boom-less"" mic was going to work (or if it would). Turns out it DOES but that was not the problem. The issue I had was that the mic quality was SO BAD.I saw the reviews, and I took the mic criticism with a grain of salt since that's the nature of reviews. But for real - please heed this part. I don't need professional quality by any means, but I'm in Twitch streams which require that I don't sound TOO bad (I'd post a link but not sure that's allowed? Search YT ""Miniterraindomain Back to the Lab"" (s2 E24) and go to 2:09:20, I'm Coop, and sound like I'm at the bottom of a tin can) . If i was just talking to friends over Discord/Facetime/Skype, or doing work meetings, then I don't think it would be a big deal. But I need it for more.So if mic output quality is important to you at all then maybe pass on this item."
My friends say the mic sounds bad but otherwise great headset
"The good:they work, long battery life, and mediocre wireless range.The bad:feels incredibly cheap, same audio quality as a set of cheap headphones in 2005. No game and voice audio balancing so, you either can't hear anything or you have to tune your in game sound for each game you play to be able to hear voice chat over the game.Knowing what I know now, I would not have purchased this, there are $25 headsets out there that perform as well or better than this."
I bought this for my boyfriend for his PS5 cause his old headset broke. It isn’t compatible with his PS5. Sound quality isn’t as good as my AirPods but not terrible. Unsure if it is compatible with other gaming consoles.
I switch off between 2 headsets and the other has a longer battery life so the logitech stays on the charger more and I think that this caused the battery to drain down even faster than it should
"Comparing these to my Corsair Void RGB wireless, they are absolutely terrible. Now ill clarify. I bought these for a couple reasons. I wanted a cheap alternative to my everyday gaming headphones and these serve that purpose. And I wanted something light that will stick to my head while walking around, which the corsair voids will fall off your head if you look down basically at all.Pros: -SUPER light weight. Like thought the box was empty- Long battery life- no required software-Bluetooth makes them a convenient grab and go headphones, along with a dongle for regular 2.4 connectivityCons: -Not big head friendly, I mean completely extended they barley fit over my head-Feels like they are made of cardboard. IF you ever owned Logitech headphones you'll know what I mean. I suppose its part of the lightweight but they do NOT feel good to handle or wear.-No software, no Equalizer tuning or adjustments at all. (no bass or low notes nearly at all)-volume is super low (maxing out pc settings loudest is barley half the volume of any other headset I've ever used"
"The sound quality is good, but it drops signal at least once a day during use, sometimes multiple times a day. And the headband of them is very fragile. It takes absolutely no effort or force to accidentally break them."
"I was very excited about these headphones, but after a couple of weeks of using them... they just don't seem to hold a charge. I get a chime sound seemingly at random (I thought it was an alert from my PC, but I muted all alerts and it's still happening), no clue what it means since the documentation (a separate PDF I had to download, there's absolutely no documentation in the box) mentions nothing about any kind of low battery sound or anything. The sound is very annoying.I keep leaving them plugged in overnight, and they seem to have no battery in the morning. If I use them while they're plugged in, I still sometimes get the chime. The only way to find out how much the battery is charged is to press the power button and interpret the light... the PDF guide says if it blinks red for five seconds, the battery is <15% charged. I have never seen it do anything other than blink red for five seconds. When they're plugged in, sometimes the light turns green, sometimes it blinks green, sometimes it does nothing. What do any of those lights mean? No clue. The guide doesn't say. It says it'll be solid green for five seconds if the charge is above 31%. I have never seen that. It says it will turn cyan when it pairs with the receiver, but when I turn them on the light starts solid red, blinks red, and then turns off... but sound is coming through them, so they must be paired. I haven't tried them with the bluetooth setting, so I have no idea if that works, nor have I used the microphone. I just wanted to be able to listen to music or YouTube at work without having a cable getting tangled in everything.I'm using the USB cable that came with them, and a generic USB adapter. It's possible that's the problem, but I have no idea since they didn't come with a USB adapter to charge them with, and the adapter I'm using works fine to charge my phone. I'm just very, very frustrated with these headphones.I went with these headphones because they were a brand I've had good experiences with in the past, so I'm very disappointed."
"I got the headphones because I do a lot of meetings but wfh, so I need to be able to hear without everyone else around me hearing my meetings, while I still need to be able to hear what happens around me. Per specification these would be a good fit with the sidetone feature. And it is, but only part of the time - when the device they are connected to is only playing audio but not recording sidetone, regardless of the setting is disabled. The device they are connected to must activate the microphone for sidetone to work.Otherwise these are light, comfortable, reasonably priced, have good Bluetooth range (two rooms over work without skips or gaps in audio) and have good sound quality - both when listening as well as recording. The mic on my unit sounds much better than what YouTube reviews claim. Even in noisy environment my voice comes clear. They have surprising good and neutral frequency response, especially for the price point, which is always appreciated - speakers should be always true, if you want EQ - do it in the software/player."
"When I got these headphones, they were great and I was so happy with my purchase. After 2-3 months of using them, I have an issue (I might've damaged it) of my headphones connecting, but no sound is coming out. When I try connecting it through bluetooth, it works, but the audio is very static and hard to understand what's going on. If anyone knows how to fix it, please, and I am please, let me know! Also, the mouse is very nice and I had no problems with it!"
"Absolutely love these headphones. The sound quality is pretty good and they're very comfortable for extended sessions. My only gripe is that they will randomly disconnect even when the receiver is right next to me. I've made sure that the battery is fully charged and even reset the adapter, but it'll still disconnect"
"I went thru so many headsets both wired and wireless that would not interfere with the programs I work with in my job. I used to use the Logitech H390 for several years, but its quality went so far downhill, I had to start looking for something better. Every headset that works via a smart phone app confuses the phone system and continually tried to answer each call. This included the other wireless Logitech models. I found with the donegal, this headset finally gave me the wireless freedom I was looking for. The sound is decent on my end but on the other side people say I am very clear, I just kind of sound like I'm in a empty room or tunnel, but its not enough to be a game changer. The only other drawbacks are with the ear pieces themselves. They are really really not eyeglasses friendly and will press the temples into your head behind  and over the ears and they are pretty hot. Luckily its now fall into winter so its much cooler in Tucson AZ lol. I have no doubt I will have to figure out a cooling method before summer lol, perhaps cooling cloths. If I come up with something I will try to update.Update literally 3 days past the 30 day return time and its no longer charging, this isn't the first time but wasn't sure if its me, but at this point, I feel I can no longer rely on Logitech products. The company they are now using for manufacturing has terrible quality and has become a waste of money.  Now stuck with this and had to dig up a used one to work with today as this headset has again caused me to miss work!"
mic is garbage.  light as a feather. cheap plastic. they did pass the rage test tho
"Dig the design, really like the fit, very VERY comfortable over ears, and I’m picky with that.I ordered these to replace a $60 8 year old turtle beach xo one ear force wired headset - the logitechs sound doesn’t even remotely compare. Sounds like I’m listening to game audio through a soda can down a concrete hallway and around a corner. Seriously. Even for an inexpensive set I’m big disappointed, sounds like they took the drivers out of a $.50 flea market earbud and built a nice headset around them. Hate to slam them like that but damn. I’d be embarrassed if my brand put out this product"
"Bought this headset for my son’s Nintendo Switch and took a bit to figure out how to pair it using Bluetooth only to learn that the Switch does not support Bluetooth microphones, so this headset is no good for online gaming with friends."
"I got these as a budget gaming headphone set that was wireless so knowing that it's budget I'm keeping that in mind. Whenever I use the microphone, XBOX game chat on PC, or just randomly while opening a tab or a window, the headphones will cut out and sound underwater and like they're a mile away. When I talk it echoes and I use a separate microphone. These headphones will randomly die with no warning even after being charged and you can turn them back on and they will be at full power. They run lowbattery with either 100%, 30%, or 10% randomly and will go up and down. These have nothing about gaming and aren't related. These should be priced at a third of their current price with what they feel like. Better off using earbuds, because easily come undone. These headphones have a headset feature which gives the same crappy sound. The setup process is okay with a 10-minute time but it needs a USB stick and is easily missplaceable because it's half the size. The USB-C charging point is inconveniently placed on the left which gets annoying when most PCs are on the right so the headphones have to switch. Luckily has audio splitting and separation.MICROPHONE:As I said I don't use the microphone because it ruins the audio quality making it sound submerged and far away. It's hard to head as it switches your headphones from the [Headphones] setting to the [Headset] which to my knowledge is NOT changeable.COMFORT:They are somewhat comfortable, and have okay size adjustment, but have terrible quality and feel like a mass-produced piece of plastic.VERDICT:DO NOT BUY SAVE YOUR MONEY"
"These are probably the most comfortable over the ear headphones I've ever owned. They're light and I love them for that. The mic quality is bad, though. Cuts out often, been told its hard to hear when speaking. Wouldn't recommend for that at all.Disconnections happen. Sometimes I can use the headphones for hours before a disconnect happens. Sometimes it'll happen after 25-30 minutes. Sometimes 60 or so minutes. The disconnect occurs both in Lightspeed and Bluetooth modes. The headphones are always fully charged before each use, so I'm not sure what the problem is. Using the latest 3.0.1.81 firmware.09/13/24 Update: Disconnections still occurring. Battery life isn't anywhere near the advertised 18h. Getting maybe 8-9h. Only used for listening to audio, no mic usage."
"I got these as a possible solution for data center work, multiple devices and noise cancellation. I am not a 'gamer' but the annoyance of carrying a pair of different headphones for multiple devices due to work is always frustrating especially when i try and sit down to work at my computer. In my current PC build, I chose a board before onboard bluetooth was more prevelant for most devices, so, now I am either going to use a USB bluetooth adapter for my JBL, but the problem in almost over ear headphones is a lack of good voice quality.of course this means I need a headphone that is akin to most torpedo microphones focused on my mouth to avoid shouting over the ambient noise of a data center or the noise of when I travel on the road. Coming off the idea of a USB-C wired headphones, the one selling point was the 2.4ghz adapter and the bluetooth capability of the headphones. overall, the headset didn't meet my expectations of good voice quality over cell phone calls (i checked the standby mode, my voice sounded distant which meant the position of the microphone is close to my ear and only on one side). I'd think for the price, for a kid or a teenager whose primary focus is gaming across multiple devices but i think i expected too much."
"I say overall its a pretty solid headset for the price, its lightweight and comfy and the sound quality isn’t bad. my only problems are the battery life is a little less than advertised in my experience and it randomly will disconnect pretty often in long gaming sessions, not sure if just random bad headset problem"
"The mouse works great and is just the right size for my smallish hands. It's good if you want a high DPI mouse in a compact size.The headset has constant connectivity issues, skipping sound, and has poor sound quality when it is actually working correctly. It is well below the standard I expected for Logitech. When I attempted update drivers for it, the driver update program wouldn't even detect it. I wish I had not bought this bundle so I could just return the headset."
"Purchased these to use with my notebook via Bluetooth but when you connect to it, you can't select it as an output device.  Device shows connected using Bluetooth but not an option to use it as speakers.  LAME"
"I recently purchased this bundle because I’ve recently gotten cats and wanted to go with a wireless setup. The headset I have absolutely nothing to complain about, other than maybe my ears feel like they’re literally flush against the inner walls of the headphone itself.The reason I returned this is due to the mouse. Within the first 5 minutes my mouse was disconnecting every 2 seconds, reconnecting, disconnecting again. It turns out the way this mouse is built, leaves very much wiggle room for your AA battery to be moved around by even moving your mouse left to right slowly. It was insane to me how sensitive the battery popping out of place was. Had to return both since they came in a pack, if you want a cheap headset (with no mic) I’d totally reccomend them by itself."
"I got this headset on sale for about $50 after shipping. I needed it in a pinch when my previous headset broke and this seemed to work just fine. I will say, however, that this headset is definitely NOT worth the original price and if you don't have a separate mic, the mic on this headset is TERRIBLE. It sounds like the quality of an old MW3 in-game chat.The headset also feels incredibly cheap and extremely light. The lightness makes it more comfortable, especially if you're someone who wears glasses and has trouble with the ear muffs pressing down on them.Overall, I wouldn't buy this headset unless it is on sale, you need a good budget option, and if you already have your own separate mic."
"These are the cheapest feeling headset I've ever purchased for over $30. I was shocked at light and cheap it felt. I think I spent $50 on them and could not justify keeping them for that cost. I wasn't a fan of the lightness of the product, it was light to a point that I was suspicious. The ear cups didn't feel good, they were a bit scratchy.Sound was mediocre and I use my headphones for important meetings and gaming so I need good sound to hear. Bluetooth range was fairly decent and even though they're extremely light - they did look really good.I was looking for a second pair so I could take my steel series pair into work. This unfortunately wasn't it.Don't pay more than $30 and don't expect anything great outta these."
Honestly this headset is quite bad. Because it's a bluetooth when you use the mic the audio quality will be terrible. So if you want to use this for gaming and to communicate while playing while still having reliable audio then this isn't for you. It also frequently turns off/disconnects which is really frustrating midgame but also in general. I think your better of with a wired cheap headset then this thing. Don't recommend.
"Had this headset for a few days, and even though it was fully charged, would randomly shut itself off.  Contacted Logitech, but got nothing other than canned responses.  It does seem that this particular model has issues with random disconnecting, and no fixes for it that I can see.  It's possible it's random depending on the one you get, but I would definitely say buyer beware.Really sorry that they didn't work out, as they had pretty decent sound quality and weren't very heavy sitting on your head for an hour or two. Ended up returning them in the end."
The foam on the headset felt cheap and overall it felt low quality. Hated it the instant I touched it.
"I like the lightweight feel and comfortable of the headphones, but the microphone quality is below average. The signal between the USB and the headphones isn't that strong, can easily disrupt the sound with anything in between the connection."
"constantly have to unplug and replug the dongle to get it detected, like every system boot. one of the modes, i cant really tell which is which, the mode where the light is blue, totally useless. quality sounds terrible but i just use the green mode. theres an annoying pointless function where you press a button twice and you hear a slight echo of your own voice driving you insane while you try to figure out what is wrong with your headset. logitech is a big name but im never buying them again if i can help it, my mouse is logitech too and its a huge hassle. this has no software. also this has no boom mic obviously so it will be picking up anyone listening to tv in the other room or anything."
"So I've been using Logitech headsets and products for over 15 years, this most recent headset has been nothing but a headache and now less than 90 days after buying it, it stopped connecting to the USB. Here is my review before it stopped working all togetherMajor issuesSensitivity doesn't appear to remain consistent, one day sensitivity will be enough, the next I'm cutting in and out.2nd is no indication it's dying or getting close to. I feel once it's around 20% it proceeds to sound terrible.Lastly, all of a sudden after a couple of months of this headset, I can start hearing myself when in a active call. Regardless of what application and device ( tried 2 pcs and 4 different voice apps) as soon as the mic is active, you can hear the playback in the headset.The minor issue is there is no actual microphone or obvious side for it. so you can't ""fold"" it up for a quick mute. This also leads to a not simple way to determine which way the headset goes if you are putting it on in a hurryI am now looking for a new headset and I likely will not buy Logitech because of these issues"
Besides mine came in with a broken piece the headset has zero padding for the top of your head. Even the $25 ones have padding for your head. On the bright side it did connect straight out the box. Returning and buying a set from someone who knows human anatomy.
"Headphones are light, comfortable, and easy to use. However there is very little to the volume of these headphones and you will probably be disappointed in the top volume ranges."
"I returned this product after many, many attempt's to get the head set to pair with my pc. I purchased this item because of my past success with Logitech products. Usually is is a plug and play situation. From the way it was packed and the condition of the packaging, I think this was a prior returned item that got put back in stock. The headset was very comfortable and the noise cancellation was way past my expectation."
"On the positive side, the device works out of the box with Linux via the USB adapter, so it's a great alternative for wireless audio if you're trying to avoid Linux woes around Bluetooth.However, the lack of any pause button is really confusing since it seems to be a simple thing to add, the device has a ton of buttons, why not introduce same combination (even if it's non-intuitive) to pause media when using the headset in Bluetooth mode?I get that the device is optimized for gaming, but it's not a stretch to think that most people would want to use it for other things too."
"This is actually my second pair of G435s. I found my first pair on clearance and was impressed with the combination comfort and microphone quality, but it was unfortunately damaged during travel. I bought this one full-price as a replacement and the microphone quality on this one is awful. It peaks early and often sends buzzing or irritating noises to the people I am talking to. I have been told that the microphone quality is comparable to my cheap $10 bluetooth earphones. It also disconnects at random and takes time to reconnect to the LIGHTSPEED dongle. Unfortunately there does not appear to be any software that can possibly fix or mitigate these issues.I'm disappointed because my initial experience was so good, but from other reviews I see and hear about from newer purchases, it seems like the microphone quality has dipped dramatically since the first pair I purchased. Would no longer recommend."
"Sound is decent. These have noise cancellation? Haven't noticed as I can still hear people fine. This ""beam technology"" microphone...that a f'ing joke! Still have to use a USB mic because this one either doesn't work, or it's such a badly made, weak POS mic. I usually love Logitech stuff, have been using their products for years, these are very disappointing."
"Periodically disconnects, both the headset and mouse. Sound quality is sub-par. But at least they're comfortable to use and fairly cheap. Good for a dip in the ""wireless gaming"" pool to see if you want to commit to an expensive pair."
"I needed to replace a headset that I've had for years and tried to find a decent replacement. I saw that this headset had supposedly good reviews and ratings, and it was on sale for more than 50% off. The first time I ordered was in the beginning of February. It said it wouldn't arrive until the 16th. No problem, I'm sure it's a busy time with Valentine's day. Well, the day they were supposed to arrive I got an email saying it was pushed back until March 3rd. I talked to ""customer support"" and was told that an email would be sent to find out what's going on. That never happened. Instead they canceled the order without my knowledge or any confirmation. After getting no help for support, I had to order the headset again, but this time I had to spend more money on them. It was only a dollar, but it says a lot about a business when they screw up and won't even match the original price. Anyway, I got the headset a little while ago and the sound quality is just bad. It's about the quality you'd expect from a 15-20 USD set of ear buds. On top of that, the headset was smaller than described. I wouldn't get this for any guy who's gone through puberty as it won't fit too well. I've never set up a return faster in my life.I'd highly advise getting something of better quality because these aren't it."
wife likes the sound quality of the headphones and the mouse she said feels better and is better quality then the staples mouse she had. but the headphones seem alittle weak compared to the after glows she had.
"Picked these up after wanting a lighter pair of headphones. Cant really complain too much however I did run into some issues with these.Negatives:They ran out of battery pretty quickly, much faster than what is shown on the product.The audio quality is pretty bad. While gaming and while listening to music. The volumes seem to always be a little off. Even at max volume they seem quiet.Audio would randomly disconnect I would need to shut the headset off then replug in the donglePositivesI have used the mic for work , not gaming and I haven't heard complaints.LightweightOverall I would not recommend these"
"If I'm not actively listening to anything, these headphones will stay connected until they auto-shutoff for battery. If I am playing a game, listening to music, or podcasts, or an audiobook, or *anything*, there's a good chance these will shut themselves off every five to ten minutes and it is beyond obnoxious."
The sound quality were alright. But I would buy the vibe 100 instead of these. But i realized i needed a usb dongle so i went with these. They pick up my discord notifications and even the music from the living room which is 20-30 ft away even with my doors closed
"Lets the the good out of the way, it connects to bluetooth, comes with a usb dongle, and it does play some audio.Okay, now that we have that out of the way...Audio Quality: 1/5. Its like having 2 crappy laptop speakers strapped to my ears, every sound is washed out, no depth, no bass, cant even get loud (w/o limiter even!)Connectivity: 1/5, Randomly turns off while doing things like browsing the internet, will turn itself off unless it is playing audio at all times. Often takes 30s to 1min to turn back on, and get audio playing again.Comfort: 1/5. Im an adult and the band has to be maxed out to fit at all, with no padding on the strap (its just thin fabric stretched over plastic). it clamps pretty hard (because it tiny), and makes my glasses rub on my ears.Value: 0/5, The only benefit of these is that they are wireless, everything else is worse than a cheap 20$ pair of wired headphones. If you dont need the wireless, dont bother.I"
"I've been using this headset for 8 months daily with no issues, however today I had a issue where it sounds like it was 1930's radio, come to find out only way to fix it is by disabling the microphone. This only happens on Bluetooth for me. Still a letdown now that I can use the mic on this because of some Sofware bug..."
"For most gaming applications, you need to utilize the dongle for this headset. I have my PC on my desk, 1.5 ft from my head. I plugged the dongle in the back of the PC (albeit, I could not see it, so it could not see me), and the audio quality was choppy. I had to plug it in the front to actually use this, and even then, the range extends to maybe 10 ft. I’m skeptical to even try this on my PS5. If I had the original box, I would return it."
"Here is an image of my old Corsair headphones next to these ones. These headphones are as extended as much as they can possibly be in the photo. The Corsair headphones aren't even midway to where they could extend. It's as if these headphones are made for micro people. Gives me a headache and my ear lobes hurt just after 10 minutes of having them on. Have to return them. Besides that, the latency seems pretty good and the sound is on target. So if you have a small head, go for it."
"When I bought this product I was in the Market for a Long Range Wireless PC headset I could use. This seemed affordable and at the time it seemed like a good purchase, the Mic quality is horrible but I already had another Microphone so I wasn't worriedDespite my different placements of both the USB adapter and The Headset, this plastic piece of junk can't stand being more than 2.5 feet away from the USB despite being in the same room. Even when right up against the adapter at times the Sound quality takes a dip to the point of static and constant Buzzing. Maybe there are better models from said company, but for the time being I'm junking this and looking for a better headset from a better company."
"There was nothing about the functionality of this headset that was worth my time. The sound was so low, it was unable to play both music and game together, and it sounded like someone stepped on the reverb switch. I sat her in disbelief that this product was made my Logitech. All my awesome older headsets, mice, keyboards, and then this junk. If this is the direction they're going with new stuff, count me out.The microphone does not appear to work at all. I've tried. I can hear my friends, they can't hear me. This thing is just not PlayStation friendly at all.Also Amazon delivered this with no packaging. Just the headset on my porch, with a UPS tag stuck to it. Very weird."
"so i got this a like a few days over a month ago and ofc when i have a major issue with it, the return window closes, but i might as well review it now. it was a pretty decent headset but it gave me some minor troubles at the start, i didnt think much of it and figured it was just me struggling to set it up, but this past month ive been echoing no matter what i tried and everyone else was echoing for themselves, today it started playing the mic audio directly into the headset instead of an echo, so i could hear EVERYTHING the headset picked up, down to hearing my bracelets on my arms move... if there is a solution to this, id love to know"
The sound is okay. The usb connection isn’t bad and connecting with Bluetooth was easy. Very lightweight. The microphone is garbage. It picks up about 70% of spoken audio. There are better options for the price. 2 stars for the okay sound. Disappointed in this. Buy Corsair or Razer.
"Audio Quality is great if you don't want to talk to anyone. As soon as you select the microphone option, the headset won't be able to pick up your voice but will hear good audio quality. If you select the headset option for the input device, the headset will be able to pick up the device but the audio quality is absolutely terrible. It's unusable. I've had several Microsoft IT members trouble shoot the problem and every time their conclusion is the headset it self. Save yourself hours of troubleshooting and pick a different headset."
"$45 is too much for this headset. They're mostly plastic and very lightweight and comfortable. The over-ear cups are a great size and fit nicely around my large ears without pinching.The largest disappointment is the audio quality. It's very tinny and lacks bass. The built in microphone is poor quality too. The controls on the left ear cup are clumsy and pushing on them causes the headset to lift up and over your ears. The battery life is nowhere near 18 hours; I get 5 or 6 after charging overnight.While the audio is generally lackluster, it's been fine for casual gaming. No latency issues while using the USB adapter. Logitech's Lightspeed adapters are very fast. But if you want good audio quality, aim for a pair of Astro's A10 headphones, which are usually cheaper but are much more comfortable and sound incredible, however, they are wired instead of wireless.You'd be better off getting the HyperX or SteelSeries wireless headsets in the same price range."
"Overall, the mic is decent when it's working properly. There's times when the surround sound gets awkward and doesn't work right. Once in awhile the mic will have input issues. I'll have to remove and reinsert the dongle sometimes when there's sound issues.I'm guessing it's because the headset and dongle de-syncs. The main issue is when the headset will randomly disconnect. It's not too often, but it does happen once and awhile. The battery is fine and charges fast. The price tag is also a bit high for what you get. You can get other gaming headsets for about the same price for higher quality. In conclusion, the headset is good when it works, but when it doesn't it becomes inconvenient. Then there's the price tag."
"I bought these after seeing them on LTT's ShortCircuit and thought they would be pretty good since I needed a new headset for my PC. The comfort is pretty good, I have a normal sized head and was able to make them fit but they are fully extended. They don't clamp super hard so they will fall off if you look down, but that does make them useable for long sessions.Unfortunately, the audio quality is just not very good. The actual drivers seem fine but the 2.4 GHz USB dongle that you need to use for a PC is quite limited and so audio just sounds bland and compressed. The microphone quality is just bad.Additionally, these cannot be used with a USBC cable directly connected to a PC for audio. The port is for charging only, so don't lose that USB dongle. They are also not supported in Logitech's G HUB at all, which means you can't do any tuning or see the battery level unless you use Bluetooth.I really like Logitech's other products, especially their mice, but this is a letdown. Get something else."
"Sound quality is good.  Definitely should have a chat-game mixer on it.  That’s quite frustrating.  Not as loud as I’d like them to be.  But that might just be me, I am a heavy equipment mechanic.  So my hearing may not be as good as yours.  But all in all a good headset.  One thing I know is buy name brand when getting a headset.  I’m a semi professional gamer for 12+ years.  Been through more headsets than I’d care to say.  I will never buy turtle beaches again.  Junk, they don’t last at all.  And I take care of my gaming equipment.  I personally love astros.  My m80s blow this headset away.  But great headset for the application I’m using them for."
They worked great for the time they worked. After about a week or two fo use they started to need to be plugged in all the time then after about another week they died altogether. They felt and acted like they where worth the 30-something dollars I paid for them.
"Connected easily and sounded OK, but this isn't for regular/larger heads.The cups also press on your earlobes excessively if you have a ""non-small"" head so its gets uncomfortable to wear.Would be great if the cups were a little deeper/larger and the adjustment strap where wider"
Everything was great and included in the box but… the mouse 5 button (top side button on mouse) was broken on arrival
Constantly disconnects from usb to go to Bluetooth and it’s a pain to figure out which setting it’s on. After a month of owning it has completely become disrespondent it won’t switch from Bluetooth to usb. It won’t mute or show battery level nor does it connect properly to its own usb lightning port. Horrible product.
"I bought this because I wanted a new headset and a wireless one, so I bought it thinking it would work for Xbox but it doesn’t I spent 20 minutes trying to connect it to figure out it won’t even work for any Xbox new gen or old gen."
"These headphones were good overall, there wireless connectivity was good and the usb connection was good but the problem to me was these were $70 headphones and still almost no deep bass it was kind of a bummer, they were very flexible though and could fit your head very well but the ear cushions needed better ventilation"
Loved the product until it stopped connecting shortly after purchasing. Went on a two week vacation to come back to the headset failing to connect regardless of trouble shooting efforts .Expensive for a low life span .
"First couple months it worked great. Did everything it was set up to do. Then the first of many auto disconnects happened. This thing uses a USB stick to plug into the PC, and it will lose connection if too far away from the USB stick. My PC is not even a foot away from my head and my headset auto disconnects every other day. Other things happened such as when you press any button on the headset, no noise would be heard when pressed such as mic mute/unmute or power off/on (this only happened once). Mic quality is ok and does the job just fine, just sounds like your standard Bluetooth headset microphone. Comfort is good too, I haven't had an issue with these other than the previously stated."
"I just received them and I am returning them for the G635s. I wanted the bluetooth connectivity which these have.  They sound good and are really light.  My negatives are the ear cups are smaller than my old G headphones, and I noticed it more on my ear with short use.  I could image a long session would get uncomfortable.  The headband is not padded much.  The cloth wrap give a very slight padding but with short term use, I felt discomfort on the top of my head, again with a short usage session.  Long term I could image more discomfort. Everything else seems ok, I like the lightness and feel of them, but the fit was not comfortable, despite how light it is."
"ProsCheap for the brand. Fast shipping. Incredibly lightweight, didn’t even feel like it was on my head. Uses USB-C to charge. Bluetooth connects fast without the adapter to my iPhone. Visually they look great too. Nothing overly bulky or unnecessary pieces. It also has great range on the Bluetooth.ConsWith this being a gaming headset I would have assumed that it would have deeper bass for explosions and things of that nature. But the bass seems to be almost non existent. Even with the paid Dolby atmos on PC with a EQ the drivers just didn’t pack a punch.Also even fully expanded this didn’t fit my head. The ear pads are on the smaller side too.OVERALLThese would be great for a kid who plays Fortnite or Minecraft just fine. But for anyone who games at a serious level I wouldn’t recommend. They are too quiet to hear most details."
Overall the headphones work very well except for the fact that the microphone no longer works. I have had it for a few months and I am sad to realize that others have had this problem as well. I do not recommend
"The product itself isn’t bad; it does provide audio for gaming and the setup isn’t too complicated, but the overall volume for the headset is extremely low. It’s the lowest volume threshold I’ve ever heard on a gaming headset. Not even exaggerating on games like apex legends on max volume this headset sounds like other headsets I used at 30-40% volume. On others it hits maybe 60-70% of the others threshold but it’s still far too low. The actual quality of the sound is decent, but I’m straining to hear footsteps and other game audio cues and it’s very frustrating."
Very light plastic material. Felt cheap and easy to break.
"I originally wanted these headphones for discord and gaming. These headphones are very comfortable for my big head, and it fit me well. The issue with these headphones come with the mic. The mic is very sensitive, picking up any and all sound in my room. Breathing, air from a fan, and typing on keys are examples of little sounds it picks up. My original pair of headphones before this one did not pick up these sounds, so I blame the mic on the Logitech G435 because the mic is ingrained into the headphones itself. Even tweaking with sound settings did not help the sensitivity. Unfortunately, I had to return these in the end."
"Worst price of Logitech gear I’ve purchased. And there quality just keeps going down wile price goes up. They feel comfortable but the main purpose of the headphone to hear audio is complete trash can. These are bluetooth first of all, the audio just none stop cuts and stutters why i listen to music or aim race. I’ve had them 3 days and the audio just cuts none stop continuously. When I shift my head sometimes it’ll stop for 3 seconds then the stuttering and audio cuts come back. I can’t get a refund unless I ship them back. Don’t even bother wasting time, money, and hope on these. Complete trash, makes me want to throw ever logitech equipment I have in the trash. Eww gross, head just hurts from audio cutting trying to get the audio in the game to be steady through the headphone. Bad nada, no do not buy these. Spend money elsewhere on different headphones. I don’t write a lot of review but with how bad this price of crap was I had too. Cant even return, I know it’s not Amazons fault but it’s their fault for even selling this garbage."
"I absolutely love the mouse, no complains whatsoever. However the headset has become a headache. It will work for 15 minutes and then randomly shut off. I can turn it back on and again, it will only work from a short amount of time before it turns off again. The headset can be turned on again after it shuts off so it's not an issue with battery. I did find some forums where this issue is common but there aren't any permanent solutions."
"Bought these headphones over 6 months ago and never had any issues with the headset until now as of writing this review. Audio quality is fine when headphones are functioning properly in windows and noise cancellation is good while gaming. But now drivers are bugging out in my system and everytime I connect my headset, they will only connect through bluetooth using a ""Hands Free"" mode and ONLY on hands free mode, which diminishes audio quality to automatically utilize the built-in mic on the G435, which I did not want use. I'm not able to remove and reconnect the g435 and disabling Hands Free mode in control panel breaks the headset entirely until I re-enable it. My 3-year old pair of AirPods never have this issue in windows and battery life is 5x worse than the g435 lol. I'm never buying another headset from Logitech again."
"GARBAGE HEADSET!!!! In my particular headset that I got, it works some of the time. The rest of the time it’s either cutting out or turning itself off for some reason. Switch to Bluetooth which fixes that but gives horrible sound quality. Wtf is this logitec??? Poor quality control from logitec. Very disappointed, do NOT buy this headset"
"With my last headset, I set Windows volume to 12 and it was great. 14 was getting a little too loud. But with this headset? I have to keep adjusting the volume up and down. Many songs require volume at level 50, even with the in-device sound limit set to the higher option. I've tried adjusting Windows settings such as equalization but it isn't enough.Worse still, when gaming, this headset doesn't do very well with sound distance. If you play a game that is very sound-based, such as Hunt: Showdown, Tarkov, etc. you will likely have more difficulty than some other headsets in picking up footsteps or judging the distance of shots.In terms of the physical qualities of the headset, it's pretty comfortable, if a little itchy at times. The sidebars feel solid.Overall, I struggle with this headset and hate readjusting the volume after every song or trying to adjust voice chat with game volume."
The mouse is great but the headset is bad it craped out on me and now i cant use it.It says that it is connected to my pc but no sound is coming out of it and its fully charged. If anyone can help my please lmk
The quality is ok but the feeling is just horrendous honestly I could only put up with it for about 2 months it’s really uncomfortable feels really cheap and tacky wouldn’t recommend there’s better at this price point
"When running on Windows this headset will shut off after 30 minutes of ""inactivity"" but it will shut itself off seemingly at random on a full battery when playing game. What it considers to be active is impossible to figure out, Logitech's only advice is to download their terrible software that will try to override other logitech software, deleting the settings on your mouse or keyboard. Look on Google, some people claim that fiddling with power settings in device manager helped but it hasn't helped in my case."
"This headset is just ok...it does what it needs to do. It being wireless and from Logitech was the main reasons for buying it and so far it fits that need well. Range seems to be good and have not experienced any dropped connections while using... But there is no way this thing should cost $79. It seems to be made of only plastic, so it feels cheap and likely to break. It is super lightweight; which is good and bad in my opinion in the sense of ""quality"", but is fine for a comfort factor... the earpads fit well for me. This thing would be appropriately priced in the $20 to $30 range max. In my opinion, this is not a premium product and should not be priced as such."
they work but they are way too small and the audio quality is very bad
Updated review:Order these in late February. It's May 4th and the battery doesn't last more than 2 hrs on a full charge. This is a bummer. I'll see if Logitech can help out on this one..............................Got these on sale for about $30 bucks.These are basic wireless headsets and work great. I have a big head and these fit just barely. They are so light that fit doesn't bother me.Good for the price. Good sound.
"Good headset, you can hear anything in game like on MW3, you can hear doors open pretty far etc. Hear peoples movement etc. But, I also use a program called FXSound, and use presets on there to help quality hearing.I don't like the fact you can hear crickets that are literally outside of my house in the mic. I'll unmute my mic to talk and you will hear crickets chirping in my microphone for example at night time.The mouse is excellent. But other than the mouse, I would've just got a microphone with a mic boom to have clear sound coming from your mic."
Escape From Tarkov or things of that nature where sound ques are extremely important.
"My gaming experience is quite diminished on these headphones, but the mic and lightweight comfy style is good for my work calls. It's a mid headphone, with a cheaper build. I would splurg a bit more to get a better headset, but these were on a super flash sale at the time so I'm happy for the price I paid for what they are."
"Got these in the hopes of having headphones that are more comfortable to wear with my glasses. First pair had a defective left ear, anytime there wasn’t a louder noise playing, there was a rather irritating high pitched noise playing and it made quieter sounds (like footsteps) sound weird too (not great for gaming). They were slightly more comfortable with my glasses than my previous ones, and I liked wireless, so I decided to return and ask for a replacement. Waited a few days for said replacement, only for it to have the exact same problem as the one I returned, but even worse. Also had it randomly disconnect and reconnect for no apparent reason, which when I play a lot of very audio-centered games, is a problem. Don’t waste your time."
"I bought these headphones as a stopgap when my main pair of gaming headphones broke. I was not expecting very much from them based on the price point, which was probably for the best. These headphones are relatively cheapy made, about one step up from the kind of headphones you might get on an airline. The padding is nothing compared to a $50 or $100 pair of headsets, but is present and enough to give your ears and had a small amount of cushion, though extended use made my ears hurt. I didn't expect the microphone to be as flexible as it was for something at this price point, so that's one thing the product has going for it. One thing to keep in mind is that the USB serves no purpose other than turning on the RGB lights, as the headphones themselves use a headphone jack. I find that to be an odd design choice and a little wasteful, but again for the price point it's understandable.Based on the above factors, I'd have ordinarily given it 3 stars for a decent job for what I paid for. However, not even two months in, I started to encounter issues that made them completely unusable. First, the microphone began to malfunction and my voice would only come through in glitchy bits. Even worse, while connected the headphones began releasing high-pitched crackling and noise that was so sudden and aggressive that it made my ears ring for minutes."
The headphones worked great for the first six months. Then the internal wiring for the microphone broke. I can still hear sounds through them but others I game with can’t hear me when I talk. They didn’t last as long as I’d hoped.
After a few months of light use it's now cutting in an out for no reason. No better than the cheap headset I bought three years ago. I just wanted something more visually appealing. Don't waste your time. Not durable overpriced poor performance
"I always purchase my son an extra pair of headphones for his PS5. These are WONDERFUL. He said the Quality is Great, comparable to higher-priced gaming headsets. I highly recommend them.Update: Purchased 4/2024;  4 months later the cords are shorting out. You can't hear anything on one side. There are no bends or cracks on the cords. We tried to contact Customer Support to see if a replacement can be shipped; we only had these for 4 months. Amazon doesn't have any contact information for the manufacturer. I understand they only cost $30 but If you need to buy a new pair every 3 months; You could just spend money on high-quality ones. This is getting crazy with manufacturers not offering replacements; as if we buy products accepting they will only last for a couple of uses.  Do not waste your money."
It's comfortable but the volume controls are not great at all. We use our Xbox quite a bit and the sounds quality is not good at all with these. They are corded which is not ideal but I was trying to find a cheaper option. But when you plug them in you really can't move much with the headset or controller due to the crazy amount of static from the connection.
"This headset isn't very expensive, being only about $20-$25 dollars. The sound quality is fine, about average quality for gaming headsets in general. There are some main issues that I have noticed when I used it. First off, the earcups are solidly barred onto the device and adjustment can be rather stiff. Turning your head too much and given the leathery material that the earcups are made out of, it's not very breathable. My biggest complaint is that the microphone is rather quiet and the quality just slightly better than phone quality. Good pair if you need a quick gaming headset for cheap, but there are better options, such as fully USB headsets."
Works ok once get the right plug but only lights up if USB is plugged in then not able to plug in to talk and hear
"Maybe for a kid starting out or just in general, but for the serious gamer I'm gonna have to pass on another purchase. The quality of sound is pretty good, I'll give them that, but the plugs don't work very well and the mic is useless unless you can have all the plugs plugged in."
"It has a cloth cord which are well known to go out very quickly. Low and behold, my sound is getting pretty spotty and its only been about a month"
I ordered these early on 12/6 but my grandsons did not receive them until Christmas morning. On both headsets the mic has broken. I would like both to be replaced or I would like a refund for both headsets. Please advise. Thank you!
I bought these headphones for my son so he can play on his switch. The headphones work great and fit him well. The only downside is he can’t hear anybody that he plays with and the headphones aren’t lighting up like they are suppose to. Everyone can hear him just fine.
This was great for about 2-3 months. Then it totally stopped working. Very disappointed & would not recommend.
"I bought these for my son to talk to his friends while gaming and they work ""okay"". They are not fully noise cancelling, but they do help. The problem we are having most is he can hear them but they can barely hear him and he sounds like he is ""in a tunnel""."
Does not work for my son ps4 controller does light up tho
No longer working after 4 months.
"the padding in uncomfortable compared to other brands, the mic quality is less than desirable, and it has trouble connecting at times."
"The headphone/ mic jack has never really worked no matter what device it is plugged into.  Pushed in all the way, the mic will work but audio is bad. Pushed 3/4 of the way in the audio is good but no mic."
"The design of this microphone and LED light setup for the Xbox controller is flawed. While the main cable is sufficiently long, the split cable for the LED lights is too short, forcing you to hold the controller within 1 foot of the Xbox if you want to use the LEDs. This severely limits usability and makes the design impractical."
"Bought for my grandson and he loved the way it looked. However, when he started playing with it, his opinion changed. The mic didn’t work and the sound quality was horrible. Don’t bother!"
Used for gaming everything was working fine and I loved it. But after half an hour one side stopped working. Moreover couldn't figure out how to sign up for lifetime warranty
Had these less then 60 days. Update seller refunded money
"Headset noise cancellation worked really well, couldn't hear anything, sound was okay, not great nor bad.Barely had it over a month before the headset rolled off the couch and cables yanked right out. The switch it was plugged into wasn't damaged, looks like it wasn't built to last long."
"This headset is crap. I bought it because of good reviews. However the first one we ordered arrived broken. So I ordered a replacement and planned on sending the first one back. The second one arrived and seemed to work ok. However within a few days it quit working. Same issue as the first set they sent. So it’s obviously a flawed product.Unfortunately I had a medical emergency that put me out for a month. I’m just now getting back on my feet but it’s too late to return either set. So I’ve been charged for two broken headsets that don’t work. Definitely bi-pass this product regardless of what their video and reviews show. It genuinely seems to be crap. Especially when it’s the same reoccurring issue of the microphone not working and broken wires 🤷‍♀️ like I said, the first one arrived this way. So it definitely was not user abuse in any way. Just really bad low quality product."
"I bought these for my nephews who are 7 and 11 for their Nintendo Switch. They loved them when they first got them, and so did I. They could hear their friends well, and they could finally talk with them. The headphones worked very well for what we needed, until they took them home. After using the headphones for about a month, the connecting adapter is starting to become exposed and is breaking. Their friends can no longer hear them clearly. I am also just past the 30 days from my date of purchase, so I don’t think I can get an exchange."
How can I return these for another one. Was bought for a Christmas present and they stopped working already.
"Overall, got this because the reviews seemed pretty positive ! But I didn’t care for the sound quality. Overall, the comfort was great!! But I feel like the headset wasn’t loud enough, or noise canceling. It didn’t feel like I was getting the best out of my gaming."
They seem to be good quality but they only light up if plugged in. The cord is super short so it’s not possible for you to use the light up feature if playing on anything other than a laptop or PC maybe.
Was playing today and the audio just kinda went out. Everything is at a lower volume and tinny sounding. Sad that the return window closed before i could get a refund.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I have to set it up.  Jury is still out.
I ordered 2 of the headsets in two different colors for a Christmas gift for my 2 nephews. One box looks brand new and the other box looks like it’s been opened too many times and the box looks like it’s been smashed a couple times. I just hope it wasn’t returned a couple times because there is something wrong with it and it’s never been fixed. I may have a sad nephew on Christmas morning when one works but the other is broken.
The headphones are just ok. There is no volume control and the led lights don't work at all. Very disappointing. Grandson really wanted lights to work but no. And truly don't want to go thru the hassle of returning and lately amazon has been charging for returns. Not paying a charge for something they sent that don't work properly.I would not recommend these headphones.
Never have been able to light up
These are not even a year old and cause lots of static and glitchy sounds not worth what we paid for them.
I bought this cuz I thought the colors would be really good and waste of money. The nothing worked. No sound. No nothing. Mike didn't work. Didn't even make the colors that it says on the thing. Bad don't buy this
Includes mic and headphone splitter. Easy to connect. Comfortable to wear. After a few uses started to make noise. Volume has to be adjusted because it cuts out randomly.
"The mic didn't last on this at all. The day after we could've returned them, the mic stopped working completely. My grandson is a gamer so he relies on being able to talk to his teammates and this just won't do. Not any good."
"Nice style. but they are not noise cancelling, I can here all background noise."
Nobody can understand me. The microphone is so quiet and impossible to turn up. My PC is configured properly because my other mics work fine.
"Lights don’t work, and the cord on it is ridiculously long and has a lot going on with the two adapters and volume control."
The LED lights lasted till just past the 30 days return window.The sound to the left speaker quit 3 months in.Something sounded loose inside when you put them on at 4 months.The sound to the right speaker quit at 5 monthsPaid $39.99 and took very good care of them from day one. These are junk. Don't waste your money.
Plug in and put multiple times to get them to work. Then sound only in 1 ear. Lasted 5 months.
These worked great for a couple months. Now they dont work crazy. Its hard to find good quality items these days. Smh
This headset worked great for about 6 months then the microphone stopped working out of nowhere.
"These headphones are ok at best. I have problems whenever I'm in a party it continuously keeps cutting in and out, and when I'm streaming I have to unplug it and plug it back in. The WORST part is that sometimes when you unplug it and plug it back in, your controller stops working. I've tried it on both of our controllers and it does the exact same thing for both of them. I know it's not the controllers because other headphones work fine on them. Not worth your money go buy something a little higher quality.."
I got these for my son to use with his Switch. While the headphones themselves work ok they do not light up unless they are plugged into a USB port which was disappointing to my son.
These are super cute. However we haven’t even had them a month and the mic no longer works. My 7 yo was super upset about it and now I have to go spend money elsewhere to replace these.
"The cable leading to the jack is already unraveling and at other areas as well, my grandson has had it only 1 month. I thought it would be better for the price I paid. Really disappointed in this product."
"I got this for my daughters PlayStation for, however if she is using it, she cannot have the lights unless the lights are plugged into a USB but when would she ever be plugged into a USB because PlayStation 4 controllers you just plug it into the aux The only thing we could think of is that she would need to plug it into a portable charger while using it, but that’s so odd"
"We are in germany due to military so we it takes 2 weeks for us to get our orders from Amazon. I ordered this early so we have it for my son's birthday and the first time he opens it to use it the mic doesn't work. We thought maybe it was his playstation but no it didn't work on our lap top or PC. Talk about irritated, now we have to return so we can wait 4 weeks since they have to receive the defective order first to send out or even refund us for the new one. So disappointed in the product as well as Amazon defective return policies."
Microphone stopped working within a month of usuing it and it was too late for a return.
We’ve had this for three months for my son to use with his switch and the mic stopped working. Don’t bother buying it!
"It didn't work correctly, the mic wouldn't work. We ended up returning it."
"Headphones worked well, the microphone has stopped working already after having for 2 months."
I got these for work.  They work good from a hearing clearly but everyone can hear when people are around you.  Even when you change the sensitivity.
"It was a usb headset I work from home and needed something comfortable and easy to wear this is comfortable but doesn’t work for my needs, this is for gaming, for a work from home set up I needed a usb headset this has 3.5mm jack and usb."
The headphone wire broke from the headphones the second week my grandson was using them and they didn't light up at all.
"These headphones aren't the best. The mic will occasionally stop working and they already stopped lighting up. We’ve only had them for 2 months. Maybe we got a defective pair? I will say though, the sound quality is decent and they’re pretty comfortable for my 7 year old."
My friends can't hear me
Already the mic is broken and it was a Christmas present so no chance of an exchange
There is already a short in the cord witch makes the mic and wound cut out unless I hold it a specific way
Comfortable with good sound but the mic doesn’t work well at all.
The wires appear to be broken. I will be returning this item.
"These headphones worked well for less than 2 months and now they don't work at all. Not sure what happened, but very unhappy with the life of these headphones."
Lights don't work and occasionally has static noise.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Arrived in terrible condition. This is a gift that I don’t have time to replace. I am embarrassed to have to give this to the birthday boy in the condition it’s in. I sure hope it works but I doubtful considering the damage done to the outside.
"We are disappointed that after about 5 weeks of use, the microphone on the headset stopped working.  Amazon will not refund or replace the item :("
Literally 1 day out of the return window. Mic is no longer working. No available support. Have tried everything.
"We gave it to my son for Christmas and he loved it! Worked great, sounded great. About a month and a half later the mic stopped working. This is with very light use. He is only allowed to play a few hours a week."
Stopped working within 2 weeks. Fixing to return. Very disappointed
I got these headphones for my sons birthday that was on Jan 3rd they worked fine until jan 20 when all of a sudden they just stopped working. It is such a waste to buy these when they last such a short time. These are pretty pricey so i expected them to last a while longer.
it started bending to the point where it looked like a bridge and the second pair broke cause the cheap wires got fanum taxed
Didn’t last long. The microphone broke off after a month. Cheap
Stopped working after a month! Missed the return window!
"The sound comes in and out - it's the wire, when I move it around the sound comes in and out."
I ordered this with alot of good thoughts. But when it arrived its too heavy for the neck
It’s broke so I didn’t even had it that long
My son used this head set maybe 15 times. It stopped working. I called the company to have it replaced and they told me they would give me back $3 of the $22.50 I spent on this. They would not replace it which is what i was willing to do. NEVER AGAIN from this company!
"While plugged into the wireless controller the audio does not work properly. Very disappointed with this product and it’s claim to be compatible with Xbox and Play station, I bought this because I use both. The microphone does not work on Xbox, I can hear but not talk."
The cord on both headsets I bought are bent over and the insertion site rendering them useless as now they don’t work for talking to others. Would not recommend as they didn’t even last 1 month
I bought this for my child to use with his Nintendo Switch. The mic was defective and did not work. I tried this headset for a work meeting and there was a “buzzing” sound which disrupted the meeting. I do not recommend this headset.
When I bought these for my son as a Christmas gift he loved them & now they have just quit working all together! I’m not sure what happened but he’s very disappointed so I am going to attempt to return them.
If you want them to light up well GOOD LUCK
My son was excited about these and used them every Friday to play Fortnite with his grandpa. The ear piece stopped working after only two weeks :(
They worked great for about 5 days then they stopped working.
The mic tears apart easily and static is what you mostly hear while playing in lobby. Save your money for something else
"USB did not work out of the box. Other option was in mono.Update, after fiddling around with it for a bit I found that the internal wiring is shotty. So I tied a knot near the RCA jack and now that part works. The USB will never work."
The speaker doesn’t work I need to return.
Sound quality not so good
"They worked well for about a month. Then sound was super low and microphone stopped working. Tried to return, but the window had closed literally the day before. So don't waste your money."
"The mic failed less than 1 month after purchase. We are passed the return window by a couple days. Very disappointed!!!!! Do NOT buy!!!!  If the company/manufacture is reading this, please reach out to me."
"Nice light weight, but the wires shorted out so the mic sometimes works and if it does it braodcasts static."
"Don’t buy these. They stopped working in 2 weeks. The headphones still worked, the microphone stopped working. If my son wanted just headphones…I would have purchased just headphones. He wanted the microphone also so that he could talk to his friends."
Lights up if you plug the usb to a PC but not the aux to a Nintendo switch…
Do not buy these because they do not work.  I spent hours trying to connect it and nothing.
Microphone stopped working. Very disappointing as these were well taken care of.
"This headset was a gift for someone outside the country, he tried to use it and it didn't work. Now he's with a non working headset. And in another country, so I won't be able to return it.g"
"I started using these headphones in the middle of September and the left channel shorted out some time in November. These use a mini-xlr to 1/8 inch cable. I spent $15 on a replacement cable…and that didn’t work either. That means there’s a short in the internal wiring and I’m out of luck. I didn’t open them right away as I bought them as a cheap backup option so any warranty is long gone, despite getting only 2 months of usage out of them. Needless to say I am not happy.When they did work, they sounded quite good but not great. Not as good as the Sony mdr-7506 or the Senn HD280 pro. I guess you can say they are worth the price, but that presumes they last more than 2 months. They offer a really nice soundstage and excel at TV/movies. They sound is well-balanced albeit somewhat subdued.The earpads aren’t the best but are good enough. I had bought a set of softer replacement pads but didn’t have a chance to use them yet (so that's another 20 bucks down the drain. yay). I can’t see these lasting very long in any sort of studio environment. Aesthetically, they’re unique, I’ll give you that. The gold colored plastic looks kind of tacky but that is a matter of taste, of course.AKG is a venerable name in audio and I simply expected more durability out of these. Yes, given the price I wasn’t expecting a workhorse, but 2 months is obviously a no-go. I’d simply spend a bit more and get the Sonys I mentioned above. I rate those higher in comfort, sound and, yes, durability."
"I've been reading a lot of very positive reviews for these headphones, so I bought a pair to add to my collection.  I'm a huge fan of AKG microphones, so I've been excited to hear what they're doing with their headphones.  As it turns out, they're good, but not great.High frequencies are a little too loud and more harsh than I'd expect for a set of headphones in this class.  This really causes many of the artifacts caused by MP3 encoding to be over-emphasized.  Instead of being smooth and silky they are a bit cutting and shimmery.  If I was to listen to these at anything over a moderate volume level for long my ears would fatigue rather quickly.  That boost does occasionally help certain types of music, though.  For example, as I'm writing this I'm listening to Lindsey Stirling's ""Elements"" and the high frequency boost makes it easier to hear some of what one of the synth parts is doing compared to other headphones.  But on other tracks it is distracting and unpleasant.  Demi Lovato's voice, for example, is a little grating on these headphones while perfectly fine on others.The low end is a bit of a mixed bag.  There seems to be a bit of a boost right around 100 Hz but everything below that is definitely quieter than they ought to be.  The 100-Hz boost is probably why some feel like they have more bass they really do.  But below that they are definitely a little thin and lacking.  They are capable of producing really low frequencies, but they just aren't very loud when doing so.The mid-range is also a bit weak.  Vocals seem more distant than they should, especially in comparison to the sibilants which are in your face (again, this is why it is hard for me to listen to Demi Lovato).  There is also a little bit of unwanted honkiness between 1kHz and 1.5kHz as well.  Not bad, but they definitely aren't producing a flat response through the mids.Compared to my other headphones these are a lot quieter than other models.  I have to turn up the volume nearly all the way on my MP3 player to get sufficient volume.  My other headphones play at comfortable volumes with the player's volume control at half of what is required for the K240s.In comparison to the Sony MDR-V6 or MDR-7506 these aren't nearly as good.  At least not if you're talking about accurate reproduction of sound.  The Sonys are much flatter (as in, more accurate, not dull), which means they are both easier and more enjoyable to listen to.Relative to the Grado SR80e, the Grados definitely have a huge edge over the AKGs.  The SR80e model doesn't have the same aural deficiencies.  But they do rest directly on your ears, which some people may not like.They do blow away any <$150 Sennheisers though.  I still haven't figured out why anyone likes the modestly priced Sennheiser headphones.  They all sound awful.All in all, these probably are better than any pair of headphones that most people will ever listen to.  But for the money you can do better.  I'd take them over pretty much anything less than $50 for sure, but for just a couple bucks more you can get the amazing MDR-V6 if you are okay with closed backs, or Grado SR80e if you prefer something more open."
"I ordered new headphones but unfortunately, I received a used one (Really unacceptable, I wish able to return it back by using free shipping). But it looks like new. This review is only for headphones performance.I bought AKG K 240 MK II based on the professional reviews on the Youtube and other websites. I was expecting more based on those reviews, but really I don't know why. Did I get a faulty headphone? Currently I am using four Headphones (See below).

"Definitely not suitable for mixing. They weren’t super expensive, but was expecting better sound for the price. Works well as an extra set of headphones in the studio though, for just monitoring while tracking instruments."
"I needed a replacement pair of headphones for a home studio. I wanted something with a decent build quality and sound quality.  These are an average pair of headphones, no frills or fancy features.  The sound quality is ok, the bass is a little heavy for my listening, but at low volumes it isn't a problem.  The upper-midrange could be a tad more boosted.  But still not a bad pair of phones."
"I have worn AKG 240s professionally since 1988. My first pair wore out after 22 years, the leather pads were cracked and flaking and the cable was showing exposed wire from my chair rolling over it repeatedly. In 2010 I bought a replacement pair and now the pads are showing their age so I bought another set this month and that was when I realized it was the end of an era. No longer do the cans say ""Made in Austria"".  They don't say anything at all, but the packaging does, ""Made in China"". The clear response and huge separation are gone, replaced with a thuddy, bottom heavy bass ('so popular with those kids today!') flat highs and narrow separation. I put the new AKGs on my wife with the tin ear and she said ""Those sound pretty good!"" and then I put the old pair on her and her eyes got wide and she said ""(unprintable)!) Rather than send them back, I am going to take the ear cushions off and put them on the old set. If you have never experience true audio excellence, you might enjoy these cans. Contents: 100% Chineseium."
"Very comfortable to wear, but the sound quality isn't great for professional use. The top end of dialogue sounds quit muddy/muffled and doesn't give an accurate playback of what's actually coming through the channels. Probably fine for gaming and general computer use, but not for professional audio editing and mastering."
"These were not especially expensive, but for their price compared to some of its competition, they're just ""meh"".Sound-wise, I prefer my aging Grado SR80's. I recall paying right about the same amount of money for the Grado. I'm no audiophile and don't know how to describe in audiophile terms, but these particular AKG have a very ""pent up"", stiff sound. Best I can describe it, they're not nearly as sensitive and responsive as my Grado nor as overall ""full"" sounding. This may not be fair comparison b/c these are over-ear, partial open-back design where the Grado are on-ear, full open back design. But, comparing to both the Grado and a pair of more-expensive Senheisers that I have (Which are fully closed-backed, over ear design), everything from these AKG feels like it's straining to get out, and I have to turn everything up quite a bit to bring out any fullness.Maybe there's a break-in period? I have only listened on them for a few hours at this point.Comfort-wise, they're also just ok. they're kind of bulky, but fairly light weight. The strap sits on my head ok, but the ear pads are kind of stiff and don't form a good seal around my ears, so both stiff and a bit loose. Maybe this will break in. Compared to Senheisers I have, little more comfortable b/c they're a lot lighter. And compared to the Grado, also more comfortable in different ways b/c the material of the pads on the one-ear Grados is pretty rough and since these AKG don't press directly on my ears, they're a bit better for me.The detachable cable is a nice touch.In all, though, I'd probably pass on these if I had to do it over, and put the money towards something better. I'd probably send them back if I hadn't already worn (and sweated on) them."
"Being a fan of AKG, I bought these based on their pricepoint and their reviews.  The sound quality was very good.  My main issue was the fact the earpads and speakers have a very large diameter and did not fit snug on my ears.  They also seemed to allow a lot of external noise in.  That might not be the case for everyone, but was my personal experience.  Very nice quality and fit and finish, but I did return them for a different set of headphones."
Super light use over one and a half years. Tiny wires inside broke but there is no way to access where they were broken. It's an easy solder I'm sure.  But you will have to destroy the headphones to get in there to do it. And there is not a single hint online about how to get them apart. Akg k 240 mkII
"I'll preface this review with the fact I received these at 50USD, not the current (at 3/31/21) price of $70.These headphones are open-back, meaning you can hear most anything going on around you while you have them on. This is up to you to decide if its a pro or a con.The sound that comes out of these is decent. I don't have much distortion with loud noises in gaming, or with loud music. The sound is nothing special, but nor is it disappointing.There are two primary flaws with this headset that warrant a 3 star (or what I consider 'average') rating.The first, and most glaring issue, is that this headset does not fit tightly at all. A slow turn of the head causes them to slip. I have an above average sized head at almost 6 foot height personally. This may be impacted by the headphones being almost entirely made of plastic, including the headband supports. I wouldn't expect this to be able to provide adequate memory/squeeze of the head.The second issue I have with these headphones is the proprietary connector for the headphones-side of the cable. This isn't an immediate issue, but if my cat manages to find the cable, then I'm not sure how I'll be able to go about obtaining another.All in all, these headphones are for the lack of a better word, adequate, at $50. I would not pay $70 for these (at current pricing.) There's likely better sounding and feeling headphones, however I wanted to try a new brand. Not disappointed in these, however I am now looking for more... upscale... headphones."
"You will definitely want to pick up a replacement set of ear cups, you can find them for <15$Sound quality is okay. I mainly use these for calls and situations where I don’t want to block out my surroundings. I would not recommended these for a hifi setup not even a beginner one but they fit my specific use case very well and I would recommend them for anyone who can’t have their ears closed while working/gaming/listening"
"These are about as useful in a studio as idling diesel truck.If you just want to use these as the headphones you give to the musicians so they can hear themselves, they're fine, as long as you like smiley face EQ settings.But the really unbelievable thing is that AKG markets these as professional headphones for mixing.I can't believe they put the name AKG on these headphones.My Sennheiser HD Pro 280's from a decade ago that still sell for $99,make these sound like the $9.99 Sony headphones you can buy in a drug store. My guitar player used these things to set up the tone on his Kemper, and the second he plugged in in the studio he said; ""That doesn't sound right"".I said, ""I'm relatively certain that the NS-10's in the studio sound more correct than a $50 set of headphones"". Yet I still bought a pair when they went on sale like an idiot. I gave them to my niece to plug into her electric piano."
"I think overall it’s a pretty okay headphone. I personally like my headphones a bit tighter on my head and these are pretty loose, other than that the eq-ing of the headphones aren’t too bad"
"The sound quality is ok, not very clear on the midrange frequencies. Not much bass and the noise cancellation is poor due to it being semi open. The headphones are much wider than anticipated so they wear very loosely. I think they are middle of the road and just ok. However, since they are somewhat of a standard they are good for checking your mix on yet another pair of headphones."
"I read the few poor reviews before I put down over a hundred bucks on these headphones; mostly the complaints I saw were that its really poorly made and the audio isn't that great. I really should have listened, and if your smart you'll read this and take it to heart: Do not buy these headphones.I really figured that with all the great reviews it could just be a few people who have had bad experiences, however after I got them and I went back and checked, some of the people gave it high ratings, even the five stars, actually wrote a review with lots of very valid cons to buying this.I Could get over the fact it's made from crap plastic-(Imagine the plastic they make plastic utensils out of, then imagine it being twice as brittle and you have a good idea of the quality of these headphones.) -, but I can't forgive the fact they sound as bad as they look. Again, that's on me for not researching it further, because nowhere does it say these headphones offer a good sound, even the customer service has said that the audio wasn't that great. I even took the advice of one of the supposedly five star raters who said it has poor audio and you should buy an amp, I bought a really good amp when I bought these. Even with the help of the amp it still sounds flat. I bought a pair of thirty dollar headphones before this and thought I'd be getting something really good with this ""upgrade"" unfortunately after a day of listening to these headphones I went back to using the cheap ones because they sound much better.Please don't make the same mistake I did buy just looking at the average rating and thinking they are great, because, as two reviewers that Ive now read have put it, these headphones are ""Subpar at best""The way the ear pads encircle the ear instead of cupping it does provide for a very slightly different sound. It's more like listening to a orchestra in room, which might be good or bad depending on your tastes. However, DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU WEAR GLASSES. The encircling method it uses puts pressure against your ear where the glasses rest, it starts hurting after an hour. Wear it them long enough and the area behind your ears will hurt for hours even after you've taken them off.The ear pieces it comes with are some kind of fake leather and felt. The fake leather might as well be made of plastic for how they felt, and while the felt were more comfortable it feels like I'm wearing ear-mitts, which is uncomfortable when it's not cold.My biggest problem with these headphones is the materials used to make it. It's completely made from a cheap plastic that's so thin even the headphone band flops around when you wiggle it."
"K240 MK II have no business being used for checking mixes or monitoring in a recording studio. For critical reference listening, one needs headphones that have a relatively flat, uncolored frequency response. Like the classic K240DF. I purchased the MKII thinking they were the current K240DF. MKII look like the DF but they are nothing more than entry level portable device headphones, and far from flat. I should have seen the red flag at ""55 ohms."" And AKG has the nerve to market these as both (!) studio headphones and portable device headphones.I used K240DF, exclusively, for some 30 years. Those headphones developed my ear. Fellow musicians often send me mixes to critique. So, having been conditioned by the DF, I heard the muddiness of the MK II right away. Also, the MK II do not reveal sub bass frequencies, such as 20 Hz. Though they are rated by AKG to have a very wide frequency response, there is a peak in the upper bass region that adds ""punch"" to music, if you like that sort of enhancement, but this peak overtakes and cancels out the sub bass region. I know this conclusively because I can hear and feel in my head the rumble of 20 Hz in my Beyer DT 880 Premium 600 ohm, but in the MK II, I hear nothing more than a low buzz. There's also a peak in the mids which adds a fat fullness to music, if you like that sort of enhancement.Did I do AKG's recommended 200 hour burn in? Truthfully, I gave up on these after 75 hours burn in time (using Jlab and Tekfusion, as well as sub bass tones in loops and of course a wide variety of music). I believe in burn in; but I also have learned the results are more, or less, dramatic depending on the headphones. That is to say, 75 hours of burn-in time just to hear barely perceivable improvement, pretty much indicates there will be no dramatic transformation.I did the research I should have, and came to the Beyer DT 880 Premium 600 ohm model. These required very little burn in time. Out of the box, Bingo, I had the new current K240 DF with an even wider range. And they got better...quickly. For me they seemed to burn in and fully mature within a day or two. You can get these for $190 from Isaac Store--best price on the internet (as of January, 2016).Yes, I returned those disappointing K240 MK II DF look-alikes-don't-sound-alikes. Good riddance."
"There are plenty of reviews here and on other sites that can tell you the in's and out's of why these are a great set of cans, and those reviews are the reason why I bought these cans. The reason why I am here today is to nitpick about the small things some of the reviews don't talk about because they are the small things.Head band and elastic string - The elastic string that keeps the headphone cups up are okay. At the moment, I find myself re-adjusting the cups because the elastic string is pulling too much after every 30 minutes or so of use. I worry that the elastic will stretch over time and the cups will sag too much. Instead, I would of preferred an adjustable locking mechanism so the headphones would always sit correctly on my head. The band that sits on your head is fine. Not the best or worse of bands but just fine.Elastic String and stopping method - when the headphones are off your, the elastic string will pull the cups upward until the stopping point. Well, that stopping point is when the knobs (the other end of the elastic string) make contact to the driver enclosure. Meaning that when you pull off the heads, the string pulls up until the knob hits the machined edges of the enclosure, cause the plastic of the knob to be damaged.Cable - the straight cable feels cheap. The sheath feels thin and it doesn't seem have a lot of rubber in it. When bent to an extreme, the cable doesn't spring back to its original shape like quality cables should but leaves a slight bend as it feebly tries to retake its form."
"These are supposed to come with a screw on adapter which was not in box. Big ""no no."" Also all literature was in non English language. Box was ok but not in ""new"" condition."
"the plastic glossy glued on label thing is peeling off right out of the box, it feels extremely cheap (ive bought better feeling headphones for far less, the akg k72s are a great pair and a lot cheaper), i cant find any stainless steel on it its almost entirely plastic as far as i can tell.the cable feels very cheap.the earcups are slightly too small and touch the edges of my ears which is somewhat annoying.the sound isnt even that good, its not bad but its not good.not happy with this at all, if i can return it i will.looks like im fixing my akg k72s after all."
"Pros: sound is clear and authenticCons: inside height of earcups (~60mm) not tall enough to accommodate my large ears (~80mm).  Results in compression of tops of my ears, and inability to wear them more than ~15 min at a time, due to developing pain. Returning (much to my chagrin, because I really like them, otherwise)"
"I have older AKG studio headphones that I liked but were starting to fall apart.These aren’t nearly as good. Not very comfortable, the padding doesn’t really conform around ear. Also sound wise, unimpressive and can’t handle much bass without distorting very quickly.I spent a little extra and got Sony 7506’s. So much better."
"I've had them all... Just tried the K240 (kept them for three weeks) and ended up returning them. I ended up with the Sony V6 and am very satisfied.The K240 are the most comfortable of the three I've tried but the sound is rather lacking. Like the other reviews have said there is very little bass response. The Mids are real dominant, especially the high-mids... They really, really didn't sound good when listening to 320k mp3s on my ipod. But they did sound better when I listened to my mixes through my IO Dock (I'm using the IO Dock as a recording interface). However, they didn't sound better enough for me to keep them...The Sony V6 are great. Maybe I've just gotten used to the way they sound as I've been using them since 1990. I had a pair that lasted 10 years (until they got sat on). I can hear the entire frequency range and like the way they feel (they're a bit too tight at first but will loosen up over time). They are a kinda muddy but not enough to be a deal breaker and its always helped my mixes sound brighter in the end. I can listen to my ipod or the IO dock/mixer and it all sounds great. And, yes, the ear pads are going to crack, flake off, and make a mess in a year or two... There are replacements that I'll end up buying and I wish I didn't have to. The quality of there sound makes up for this inconvenience. I wish the cord was detachable and that they were as comfortable to wear as the K240.The Sony V600 sound super-muddy and have all the other negative issues that the V6 have. I've noticed that they make my head uncomfortably ho when I wear them, too. Stay away from them."
The sound quality is great. The only issue is the muffs cracking overtime I’m not sure if there is something I can do to prevent that or not.
"I mainly bought these headphones as I wear glasses and normal over the earphones press the temple supports that go over the ears into my head with a pressure that over time will cause discomfort.These don't do that nearly as much, it's still there, but I can wear them longer.The sound quality is nice, I watch Hulu, play games, and listen to music.There is an issue with the connection point between the headphones and cable. It is a 3 pin connection with a click in style. When the cable has pressure it will cause the pins to not connect properly and I lose sound in the headphone where the connection attaches. I have to fiddle with it to get it to regain connection back.I'll probably buy another headphone that doesn't have the disconnection between cable and headphone to ensure this doesn't become an issue."
These sound like you are listening through a thick layer of wool socks.  Avoid.
"They're adequate, but not what I needed. I returned mine and got some open back Sennheisers. MUCH BETTER."
"These are really good open headphones at a great price. If you are listening in an otherwise quiet environment, it will be hard to beat these for any non-professional use. My only complaint is they can become a bit uncomfortable over long periods of time. Also, as someone without hair, the headband is not the most comfortable as it offers no cushioning whatsoever.It's also nice you can replace the cable, but the connector on the headphone side is a special 3-hole design. If your cable breaks, or you want to buy a longer one, you have to get a special cable just for these headphones. You can get such cables quite easily, but it would have been nice to see a standard TRS connector there.Other than that, just be aware that these offer basically no noise cancelling or sound isolation. If there are noises in your environment you're probably going to hear them. No points deducted for that, because it's not an advertised feature. Just something to be aware of."
"My old AKG phones finally broke after 7 years or so. I forget the model but they were quite a bit better than these. Don't get me wrong, these are great headphones  for the price. I just recently bought a pair of Audio Technica ATH M60s and they blow the AKG away. Yes four times the price. If your budget is holding you back,  the AKGs are wonderful,  If you want super response go AT."
"There are a lot of things like about these headphones,1. Headband is very comfortable and so easy to take off and on.2. They stay comfortable after several hours of having them on your head. (no sweat on ears).3. They are good headphones to keep around for gaming or anything you are not doing critical listening with.4. They are good in places you want to hear people speaking to you.That Bad1. They are open/semi open  headphones and allow much of the ambient environment to leak in. (expected)2. They actually sound a bit flat and I feel a little too open. Giving a sense of weak sound.Why I think I don't like them.I love AKG and the design they have for the head band, every big headphone should have this band.The problem I had was I purchased the ""Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone"" prior to purchasing these.I feel in love with the Sony headphones even though my ears sweat a little (closed headphone) comparable price .After using the Sonys I placed the AKG K 240s  on my head and they just feel ""flat"".I don't regret the purchase but, I don't think of the headphones as great just good.I do love the AKG higher end but for under 100 they're ok."
"The box the headphones came in came damaged but the headphones was fine so that wasn't a big issue.Sound : I am disappointed in the sound quality, my old headphones that came from a 60 dollar Lexma kit that had headphones, a mouse, and keyboard sounded better as well as felt better than the akg headphones. The kit also included a mouse and keyboard so you get a bang for your buck that way. Keep in mind that I am using the headphones on my pc not studio production but in general use it doesn't sound like 67 dollars so I would suggest only buying this on sale.Build: These headphones are light and portable which makes it easy to carry around, it's a bit too light though and feels like I could snap it in half pretty easily. The ear pads feels like leather but is pretty small which is why these are semi-open so don't expect to get immersed in your game/music since you can hear everything around you pretty easily. What I'm hoping is that these will last for a while so I'll give an update when I use it more.TLTR: lexma target headphones sound better and feels better, not worth 67 dollars."
"I wear headphones every day to listen to on-line radio. I've had several pairs of ear buds & got sick of the cord breaking. I bought a pair of headphones that got good reviews in several audio forums. I had these for about a year when I sat on them & broke the ear cuff.The sound quality & fit was great. But I thought that they broke too easily. I shopped around, & these AKG's had a lot of greats reviews. They came today & they are awful!! They problem is they aren't sound deadening. Since this was only my second pair of HP, I wasn't really aware of just how important that really is to the sound quality. The pair I broke still work, the cuff just hangs loose, so I swapped the old pair during the middle of the song, to compare. I keep my volume set at 8 with my old HP and the new pair had to be turned up to 29, to even come close to the same volume. And the background noise was overwhelming!! The old set are;Griffin GC36502 WoodTones Over the Ear Headphones for Smartphones and MP3 Devices, Walnutby Griffin Technology. I paid $57.99 last year. But they've went up to $99.99!! So I found them on eBay for $49.99 w/ Free Shipping. I also want to add that I have tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, & background noise is a deal killer for me. But I would think that even for those without tinnitus you would find that having less or no background noise would greatly improve the listening experience. Also one other important issue with the AKG is the cord is a special type cord, & will not be as easily replaced. I find that the cord on HP is always the 1st thing to go. I've had to replace the cord on my other set a few times. I will say it's been my fault by dropping them or repeatedly bending the cord in the same place. So the cord being $1.99 to replace is important. I'm not sure the cost of the cord on the AKG, but it's a special cord that may need to be ordered from them. Which in my experience is never cheap."
"To start, I was excited about these. In fact, when I heard them, I was still excited. They're a great pair of headphones. I wanted more bass and they delivered without sacrificing on mids and highs. Just to give a bit of perspective, I've owned the Sennheiser hd 280 pro, 380 pro, 598, ATH m50, Koss Pro Dj 100, AKG K 240 MK II, & AKG K 612.I kept the Sennheiser hd 598s & the Koss Pro DJ 100s but returned both AKGs & the m50s. They all sounded great and were detailed, but too much so. The m50s & the K 240s both have a treble spike around 9k Hz. This caused enough fatigue for me that I couldn't stand them for too long, even though I liked everything else about them. So, I can't argue with all the other reviews that say this is a great headphone, especially for the price, because it is. However, if you're sensitive to higher frequencies and need something warmer and less fatiguing, just keep this in mind. The detail & airiness comes at a price, and it did for me. They made my right ear sensitive enough to where after listening to the AKG 612s, my ears had to take a couple of weeks just to return back to normal. This has never happened before, and I'm mindful of listening levels. It's a shame, because I really loved the 612s as well.Other than that, these headphones are a lot of fun and a joy to use."
"Bought these brand new. Immediately after taking them out of the box, I noticed that the brand sticker on the side wasn’t properly adhered to the headphones (see photo), which isn’t a huge deal to me tbh, but was the first indicator of poor craftsmanship. The bigger problem is the circular ear cup design, which doesn’t properly conform to the natural shape of my ears (would be better if it was ovular vs circular). While the sound quality isn’t half bad, the immediate discomfort was a deal breaker for me. Better to fork over a little more money for Audio Technica’s, which is exactly what I plan on doing."
"I bought at 49$ deal with high expectations from the brand. Its sound nowhere near ""reference monitor"".  I have also Sony MDR-ZX110 which you can buy at $10.I see no difference between them while Sony has better bass.Returned immediately.Buy Sony MDR-ZX110 and install ""Equalizer APO 1.2.1"" to your PC. Apply corrections and you have an audiophile headphone.Keep away and save your money. Not recommended."
"So here is the deal.  I got these headphones to use mostly from my home/dorm room.  It appealed to me in a couple of ways.  First off they are semi-open which is usually my favorite design.  Secondly the long cord (3m or 10ft) as it allows more movement while plugged in.  The finely feature is they have a wide array of replaceable parts. Sadly these ""great value headphones"" are actually a waste of money.  Let me explain...I took them out of the box, put them on my head and noticed something disturbing, they are massive.  Now I don't mean their ear pads (which is still true) but the headband.  It is so wide that it just falls off my head.  I will mention I do indeed have a smaller head, but I have it on the smallest possible size and it was still too big.  It would not even create a seal on my head!  I made note of this and handed them to my girlfriend who wanted to see if it was true, it was even worse on her head! (still small but not abnormally!)  This is a major design flaw, the fact that it cannot accommodate for I a large  amount off head sizes is terrible.  Major over-site.  My girlfriends exact words were ""these are crap....send them back."" That is exactly what I plan to do!  For the sake of being thorough for those lucky enough to have big heads here is my break down numerically of this headphone.Sound: 7/10 (effected by poor seal on head)Design: 2/10Durability:7/10 (cheap plastic, but replaceable parts make up for it)Value:4/10 (better with a big head).....(not to be confused with a big ego!! :P)Overall: 5/10These headphones may produce great sound but due to large design flaws that could not be over looked they have entered the land of failed returned items.  My suggestion is looks elsewhere, much better cans for much cheaper, or far superior for a few bucks more."
"AKG, the brand known for great sounding headphones.k240?  not one of them.  I'd put these in the same category as the K72's. Failures.Soundstage is mehSound quality is nothing to be proud ofThey don't fit that great and the earcups are pretty thin.These are the budget of budget akgs and the overall performance and build shows that.  Save up and get a more upgraded version of akg's.The detachable cable is a nice touch and while I will use them from time to time (I like to rotate my headphones) I can't say it's a fun time lol"
"After working with AKG, I have decided to update my review. In essence, the speaker wires in the unit I received kept disconnecting, during two years of light use. The first time, I disassembled the headphones, and re-soldered the leads. The second time, I complained to AKG. Despite being outside of the two year warranty window, AKG sent me out a replacement pair of MKII headphones. Apparently, from the serial on my unit, it was determined that the plastics and speaker wires were later improved. While I was initially very disappointed with the product, AKG's customer service definitely made right of the situation, and I have left the experience with a favorable view of the company.That said, here are some notes on the product outside of the build quality issues I encountered:- Very transparent, neutral sound.- Much lower output than other headphones; sometimes it is difficult to drive them loud enough.- The open-back design is inappropriate for recording (they are not marketed for that purpose), as sound can bleed into microphones. Since a good amount of sound escapes to the environment, they're also not the best for listening to music in areas where others might be bothered.AFAIK, neither the K240 Studio nor K240 MKII is made in Austria anymore; both products I've now used have been from China. I am hoping my new pair will prove more durable, as they are nice-sounding headphones."
"Please understand I am an audiophile snob, for context I play Overwatch on ATH-AD700x so I can hear the footsteps ranging from Sombra to Roadhog. Yes I can tell who they are before I see them on the screen. Also love music, ranging from classical to Snoop Dawg Old Skool rap.These headphones are definitely simi open but suffer from the same mud that closed stage do. It does not give the response that I love from the AD700x....As for sound canellation, no these do not come close to the House of Marley Pulse that I have worn the buck out of. Yet for the price they are not bad. If you are rough on items, these will take a beating and still work. As for bass, yea, they are ""alright"". If you are looking for a huge boom, look else where. Good mids, treble is a tad muddy. Looking  for under 100, these are definitely worth checking out. If you are looking for sharp and clear range....AD700x are a the better grab....I wanted to believe in the AKG , still do. But these are not really filling any of the required ticks I am looking for."
"After having and adjusting to the sound of my Sundaras, I wanted to give some Studio monitors a try. I see why this is regarded as a pinnacle headphone for MIXING. Each instrument is separated so well from each other and reveals a lot more detail in the mids and highs, like the page said it would. Though it's not the most fun kind of listening, if you want to hear something new in a song you've played thousands of times before, this is a good choice."
"Bought to use with guitar into amp while my wife watches TV in the next room. There are alright in that they do allow me to play plugged in without disturbing her but the sound quality is less pleasing than expected. That is, they sound nothing at all like my guitar into the amp I use. Rather harsh treble, remedied partly by turning the treble on my guitar down a fair amount. They don't get used every day so I can deal with it but would not buy again or recommend to a friend."
Sound not there for me I currently have the Akg 371 closed back and akg702 open back which I think has one of the best soundstage and imaging out there .Akg 702 can be had for around 180 well worth the price.the 371 is also very good for closed back .240 never did do it for me overrated maybe in studio environment it works just not for listening to music critically and for enjoyment.
Older generations of the same headphones like K77/K66 etc have better durability and longer cable. Sound is still good.
"I do not feel I have large ears, and have never been commented as such. I'm not sure but I feel for me these were not quite spacious enough for my ears. They pressed against the side with a bit too much force for comfort for me after a 45mins, (could maybe be accustomed too but not worth it for ME).The sound stage of these for me were more than I'm used to and is a treat. I am particularly interested in jazz and these are recommended for the great 'mids' for its price. Out of the box some sounds I experienced were a bit new and satisfying, after some EQ or frequency tweaking Take 5 by Dave Brubeck sounded illustrious and other-worldy. The sound too my inexperienced ear was quite refreshing I think especially for its 'lower' price if you have maybe smaller ears or don't mine some compression (mind you it DOES have a slightly nice padding). I could see being a nice purchase and maybe even a bargin especially going with the older AKG K240 (Not MKII w/ extra features cord etc). Hook this up to an amp/dac system and it may sound quite enchanting. I got appreciable ammount of chello and cords EQ'ing the trumpets softer."
"I use these headphones mainly for listening to vids off my tablet or computer when I do not want to disturb my wife in the same room watching her TV shows.  I got these to replace a previous set that eventually bit the dust. The ear piece is a bit larger and my ears fit inside easily. They are fairly light weight and the padding is comfortable. Overall sound quality seems fine... nothing I have heard yet that jumps out at me except for one item which is major to me. The sensitivity factor. By comparison to other headphones I have, these are more power hungry. My last set, and full volume could get uncomfortable and made me adjust the volume down. Not so with these. Max volume on these falls short of what I consider normal listening level. My tablet/computer just does not have the juice to push these drivers. Using them with my home system the problem goes away, but I rarely use headphones that way. I would not recommend these headphones for computer/tablet use."
"like so many other companies, the once reliable AKG sold out to stamp-them-out production facilities in a far-off land..... once upon a time ago I had some k240s that were reasonably good cans for the price and reliable for minor studio work. but oh dear Betty do these new versions suck.  you really can't hear anything except a muddled mess. this company should be ashamed. They really let a lot of people down by selling out. Amazon should change the rating system. the one star score should be the very first thing you see.......... oh yeah I sent them back."
"I purchased these for myself ($65), and the Samson SR850 ($30) for my wife. The Samson SE850's sounded better than these! and they are under half the cost!Sound:The AkG k240's sounded like they were really muffled, as if someone was holding a piece of paper in between by ear and the headphone speaker/driver. The highs are very accurate and pronounced, but when it comes to the mids and lows, there is so much lacking. The ""Bass"" sounds muffled and almost silent. The mids are down out by the extreme highs. All in all, the sound leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to the Bass and the Mids. I would use the term ""airy"" to describe the sound quality.Build Quality:These headphones have a nice build quality. The earphone cups are very comfortable. The adjustable head strap system is very nice and convenient. The gold plated aluminum looks very appealing as well. The detachable cable is a very nice plus. They feel EXTREMELY light, which is nice, but gives them a somewhat cheap feeling. Great build qualityResults:At the end of the day, if you like extreme highs then these are the headphones for you. They are definitely not my type of headphones because they just sound like theres something wrong with them with the extreme trebble. I would recommend the 30$ samson's any day over these. Bottom line, the sound quality is lacking too much for me to justify this purchase. would not recommend when there are many better alternatives."
"Had high hopes for these despite the somewhat stellar ratings.  Nope... they're going back. And here's why:Too lightweight to be noise-cancelling.  The ear cups are fine. But these should be snug against the head, and they are not.  I can hear my processors running in the background, which is dealbreaker for ""studio headphones""  Totally returning for something heavier and fitting."
"I really wish I could give these headphones a good review, honestly I do, but the build quality is so poor that I cannot give them more than 2 stars. As far as sound goes they're fantastic, especially for their price. They have a very honest and well balanced sound, with accurate reproduction of both bass and higher frequencies alike. However, none of that matters when they're broken, and they break VERY easily, and this is coming from someone who treats their hardware with extreme care! One of the features that is listed for these headphones is that you can listen with one ear by twisting one can off to the side of your head. I did this frequently during use, and after a couple of months it caused the right can to just BREAK OFF. Upset, but determined to continue using them because of their exceptional sound, I soldered the wires back in place and superglued the can back on and continued using them. This happened twice. Now it has become obvious that the right can has developed a bad connection, and now I've finally given up on them. If they still worked, I might actually give these a 5 star review because they sound so fantastic, but that means nothing when they're broken. My frustration is accentuated by the fact that I've gotten so used to these I can no longer stand to listen to consumer level headphones but I'm forced to for the time being.In summary:They sound fantastic, but the cheap flimsy plastic they're made of breaks very easily, and all the sound quality in the world doesn't matter when they're broken. You're better off finding a pair of cans at a similar price point that aren't entirely made of plastic."
"First off the AKG logo on the right side was peeling off right out of the box.  The adjustable headphones can and will pull your hair pretty often when adjusting one to 2 ear listening.  The sound balance is technically flat sounding to my ear atleast, however the distance of the speakers or quality of the build make the mid high frequencies hurt my ears at comparatively low volume which normally only happens on my cheaper headphones..  probably going to return these."
