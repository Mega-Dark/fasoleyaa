The bottom strap is made funny. It doesn’t not fit right and hangs funny. I would t purchase another.
"I have had a compact wash in the past, a different brand which was great but didn't have enough wash load space. This brand is the opposite. Fits a good load but not worth the money. Received the package in bad condition, so had to throw the box away right away. The first couple uses we noticed the water output wasn't releasing normal and realized the hose was all twisted up. We purchased a new hose after that but soon after it had trouble during the spin cycle and at times will just completely stop without finish draining the water. Seems like it is a motor problem or whatever that controls the spin and drain cycle. Not convenient when you have babies in the household that needs clothing washed regularly."
It just stop working and this is a product Amazon is representing. Amazon do better.
Works well but it makes a lot of noises.  Took us a month or two to get used to the sounds. For awhile we kept thinking someone was in the house or something fell.  Sounds like some hard was dropped on the floor or sometimes sounds like a loud click.  The actual hum of the compressor is fine and not very loud.
"Updated 20 Dec 2023:Well, here I am 90 days out from the purchase and about 6 weeks ago, it appears the venting fan no longer works, all steam remains and accumulates and since was not paying attention initially - accumulated significant'y under the rotating tray! (Wife asked,""what's up with all this smoke/steam?!, water!).So, the 30 day window to return is gone - yet may yet ""Chat"" just to fully document to them.So, I try the Warranty service and wade through TWO seperate sights to then be told there's a ""special"" division that handles THESE units. Hmmm, okay... Instead of doing a ""warm handoff"" considering all the work I just did - I do, as they could, FORWARD the entire mail to the Email they provide.I then get back an email of ""questions"" (some bot response with an individuals name with a big thank you and let us know....!). So, ALL was in the email, but answer again and then take a photo of the serial number tag (no one told me where it was btw!!).I notice the email added ""numbers"", so ""support@.... turned into ""support+nnnnnnnnn@..."" and I had forgotten to attach the serial number phone pic so resend all and to specifically ""support@..."" AND the other too with the yet ANOTHER incident number.Next day (time difference with CHINA I am used to - my mornings are the best time to engage them it seems) - I get an email (yesterday) - ""we have one more question for you"" embedded in a link - RATE OUR SUPPORT SERVICE for this... ""like"", ""don't like"" or similar words. My response was - rater what? You have not done anything. So another day goes by and NO RESPONSE.So, I now have a Microwave just barely 90 days old, barely used since is 700 watts and used for only specific things, and? Wow - I can't afford to buy stuff like this here if there's NO WAY TO RETURN, REPLACE, REPAIR, REFUND IT!!. Wow.I said to them too - with how this is going - I look forward to reviewing how this goes - so, here this is to date.I will contact Amazon likely - since they may intercede, etc., or not, but letting them know directly and specifically and with ALL the messages in their system - they do review this stuff (I had one prior bad experience I got resolved by involving them directly within it all). So, can't fault Amazon in this, but if this is how this goes - and can't rely on what's sold here, then?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I purchase for the Brand since have had many items that just seem to do well for me.This is a disappointment functionally for two reasons -1) IT SLIDES all over the counter. Why would ANY OEM build something that will live on a formica counter top with SLICK, unstable supports? I just don't get it.2) Tiny thin, writing on Black, not back lighted - Labeling. Until this product I never needed to turn the big light on in the Kitchen AND put on my glasses. Now I do.The noise put me off a bit when first started up - startled me.All of my other Microwaves, ever, had a fan noise and more of a higher pitch, light hum to it. This one is to me, 3x's as loud, with a low, very textured buzz (not a hum a buzz, buzzing - heavy running sound).It's not the least expensive, not the most costly and since I find price is not always, or even usually an indicator of ""good/not-good"" - I went with brand and reviews.I did read the, or see the reviews that state the same as I say now - NOW I understand - but just didn't ""get it"" until today - wow - what to do.Otherwise, the controls are somewhat intuitive.The times to heat are about the same or the same as on my 1200 watt unit or the prior 900 watt unit. I felt that there was no need to use that much wattage to heat water, or warm food, etc.I was anticipating the inside dimensions being ""tight"", but remain functional for what I experience with other units. So, what I mean, as e.g., is like - I'd love to heat 3 slices of Pizza same time one place as with the room or power with the 1200 watt unit. However, I often wind up doing two or even one slice in order to over all just heat the slice versus getting very ""spotty"" hot/cold not evenly warmed. Slight overlaps of slices never works and actually have burned things when got jammed/not rotate. So, the smaller footprint would seems as a non-issue, or better this way. HOWEVER, as the Manual says, allow for THREE INCHES all around this unit when using, placing it. So, it may not ""functionally"" be a small a footprint as you imagine if don't have that for air/heat which you need to take *seriously!So, anyway, it's a microwave. The door looks safe, will remain safe I hope, not sag, loosen up, etc., ""leak"" as is the warning concerning the - Door. However again, the Non-back lit Control Labels, small font/type and thin/light/hard to see AND that now I have to figure a way to keep it from SLIDING ALL OVER my counter top - SO DANGEROUS even for ""Adults"" - WOW. I looked in the box for some anti-slide thing not installed - none. I mean - where - is a Microwave EVER INSTALLED that is on a NON-SMOOTH, easy to clean, sanitize surface - ""sliddy""? Where - Black+Decker?In my opinion, that miss the mark for what I would otherwise, as first use rate would rate otherwise, 4 or even 5 stars. Then the Buzzing when running thing - is likely something that could be addressed. As with many things I see today now usually has to do with lowering the cost of manufacturing. I deal with mechanical audio and ""hear"" what they've done versus could do to quiet it down substantially.So, I hope that assists someone. Additionally, all in can say if Sliding is an issue, Small Control Labels, and Noise is an issue - take those Reviews to heart to consider - those are issues and wish I did. Yes, I could return it and may - we'll see. Who's to say what the others may be like - so... how much time to spend on this. Returns, especially with something this size are not easy for me to ""get to a shipper"" - so, consider all that is my advice and experience."
"Bought for a small office. Its just very slow to cook at 700 watts. Everyone assumes a microwave if quick, this thing is very slow for most lunch food reheating, don't even consider cooking from frozen unless you want to wait forever and have people complaining at you. We are an office of 25 right now, we have been an office of 50, its terrible for that."
You get what you pay for.  The turn table is always coming off. A bag of pop corn is too big to turn on turn table.  Nice auto features.  Next time zi will go larger.  The capacity of my old Sharp had a larger for the same size unit.
"We have a small counter space for a microwave so it's hard to find a decent one. I researched a lot and thought this one was ""it."" Well, it will work OK, but my main problem is the beeping is ANNOYING and you CANNOT stop it by opening the door! And it beeps WAY too many times! The other thing I don't love (although not a deal breaker) is that it doesn't beep to remind you something was left in the microwave. We temporarily were using a cheap Walmart one (was bought for college use). I actually liked that one's features BETTER! This one looks nicer with the stainless steal trim. I'm trying to adjust to it, but you can't even cover the noise since it appears to come from inside the microwave. It does slide easily as others stated. We have a small block at the back on the button side which usually keeps it in place. But it is worse than the cheapy one for sliding (will be getting rubber grips/pads to help). Decent price, decent microwave. Does basics we need it for (I do like the 30 second start button and quick start minute ones). Just not loving beeping (the worse offense!), lack of reminder, and sliding."
"This microwave has an automatic door lock, for safety purposes, that also poses a great challenge for a senior citizen.  We can’t figure out how to prevent the door from automatically locking. Otherwise, it might be a good choice for someone."
"This microwave heats food ok. I like it because it is small and light weight to fit on my shelf in the kitchen. I got rid of the countertop microwave I had before after remodeling my kitchen..The problem I have with this microwave is the rotating glass plate constantly comes off the grooves and I have to keep putting it back on track. The other issue is the condensation buildup is ridiculous. Water sits inside the bottom of the microwave and leaks onto the front face and door. The condensation is now causing severe rust on the face and inside the microwave. Now I have to look for another small push button microwave. If you purchase, you have to wipe and dry condensation immediately or it will chip paint on inside microwave and rust."
I don't like how this locks and thought it would unlock on it's own once done cooking but it does not. Not that big of a deal but have to hit unlock button before I can open
Works fine but very strange average plate doesn't fit in easily.I have to turn a little to get it in.Never had this issue with any others I have owned.
"I wanted a smaller microwave to sit on my counter and wouldn't take up too much space. This one does that. But I've gone from a 1200 watt to a 700 watt machine, and if I'd thought it would have made that much difference, I wouldn't have made the purchase. I really only warm or reheat food items. Even reheating takes significantly more time. I won't make a purchase like this again.An aside, it has a popcorn button. It didn't even inflate the popcorn bag. I had to add 2 minutes after using the popcorn button."
"Arrived damaged, not too much damage to justify the work to return, so not happy."
This is a nice size for small spots and moderate use.  Probably not a good choice for high usage.  Some of the touch surface buttons are not working well after less than a year.  Does a really good job on everything but if you micro a lot may not be the best choice.
"This is a good small microwave that is easy to use. However, the 700 power is requiring some adjustment from me since I previously had a 1200 Microwave. That having been noted, this microwave requires a lot of minutes to get things hot but it works well with the previously noted caveat."
"When I cook my oatmeal for breakfast the interior is dripping wet. Or when I put a bag of peas in to steam, the interior was dripping wet. That is not safe. I cannot use my 10"" high Pampered Chef microwave cooker because it touches the ceiling of the microwave. I wish I had not bought this. I bought it because of the Black & Decker name and reputation. The beeping is annoying. One beep is sufficient."
"There is one concern, a few of the numbers look like they have a bubble underneath them. My wife said once you push those a few times they probably will stay down like the others."
"I bought a used one that said it looked like new. However, the actual product that was delivered had a few small defects. Buyers should keep this in mind when purchasing used goods."
"This microwave was light weight which was great when I had to take it from the box and put it on the shelf, but not so great when you push the button to open and entire microwave shifts. But the bigger  issue is the beep/horrible sound when food is ready. If you don't stop it before time ends it makes these ridiculous long horrible beeps over and over even after you open and close door several times and attempt to hit cancel. Until it is done you also can't put something else in it because no buttons work. I have overheated things because I put too much time on so I have time to stop it before it ends.It seems to cook fine. But honestly regretting that I didn't return it and pick something else."
"I bought mine 2/2023 and started to have electrical problem 8/2024 (electric sparks everytime i use it) and there is a burnt on the inside where the electric panel cover is. I had plenty of microwaves in the past and they all lasted longer than 1.5 years, at least for how much it costs."
Good little microwave for our efficiency but it did not last.
"I bought a used/open box item so I didn't expect it to be perfect.  the description of the unit says no scratches and that it comes in the original box.  What I received has a good sized dent in the left rear section and did not come in it's original packaging.  It does work, however, and looks good from the front, so I think I will keep the unit.  I didn't find anything similarly priced at the local big box stores, and I don't want to wait another three days for a replacement.  just a warning to others who purchase this."
When you push the door button it doesn’t open unless you pull the door at the same time.
It does what we bought it for.
"It goes muuuurrrrr, makes food hot."
This feels more flimsy than the previous model - which itself only lasted 3 years.  It is the only nuker that I have found to exactly fit the microwave shelf over my regular oven.  BUT  I am having trouble registering it with B&D.  They say my model number doesn't exist!!  Is Amazon selling fake Black&Decker?  Or is B&D registration process broken?  Hope I can get someone to help.
It seems every time I slide anything into the microwave it dislodges the turntable and it's a pain to fix.  It's enough of a issue that I have thought about replacing it.  Otherwise microwave does what is supposed to.  I have learned to increase the power or time over what I use for the microwaves because it's pretty weak but it clearly says what the wattage is.
"This microwave isn't great.  It looks nice and is small if that's what you need, but past that not so great.  The buttons do not register with a touch, they need a hard press (both my wife and I so it's not just me).  Since the microwave is so light, it then slides on our shelf.  Even opening and closing the door makes the microwave move around.  It is also woefully underpowered.  I know it says 900 watts, but there is no was.  Our old microwave heated my neti pot water in 22 seconds, this one takes 35 seconds.  We are returning it even though we got it on sale for just $65."
"The microwave is great. Customer service for Amazon and Black & Decker…not so much. Bought as a gift.  It was missing a part. When I contacted Amazon Product Support they told me to return and get a replacement. I said it was a tiny piece.  Not worth returning it. Then I contacted Black and Decker only to be pushed around and then they found the part # and told me I have to call another place to “order” it and pay for it. I asked why do I have to pay for it when it was missing!!  Needless to say it was a sucky ordeal and I ordered the replacement from, where else? AMAZON 😫🤦🏼‍♀️ it was cheaper than what Black & Decker wanted."
"Cons1) Fan doesn't do much, water accumulates in the bottom, sides, ceiling and door. Can fill a dishcloth.

"Update: a couple of days after submitting this review, I researched multiple microwave brands so I could replace it. Apparently excess moisture and eventual rust is a common problem with most 700 watt microwave brands. There were also a lot of negative comments about the exterior of the microwave being hot to the touch (which is why I replaced my old microwave with this Black and Decker one), smoking, and various other problems. So now I find myself ordering another one of these - better the devil you know, right? This time around I'll try to remember to use covers for what I'm heating whenever possible, and I'll make sure I immediately dry off the condensation after each use. Fingers crossed that rebuying this model isn't a colossal mistake.I bought this microwave in 2021 to put in a small cubbyhole in my kitchen, and my choices were very limited due to the size restrictions. I mistakenly thought Black and Decker would be a good quality, long-lasting microwave. Shortly after the 2 year extended warranty I bought on this product expired, I noticed a dark spot along the back seam where the top joins the back panel. I tried several different things to remove the spot before I realized the area was rough and that apparently some of the finish came off. Today I noticed a little area that looked darker at the bottom of that panel. It wasn't as dark as the one at the top, but it also wouldn't clean off. Then I noticed a few dark spots at the top of the bottom edge piece behind the door. I tried cleaning it with a damp paper towel and an approximately 2"" x 1/2"" chunk of the finish peeled completely off. Most microwaves I've owned have lasted more than 7 years before they had to be replaced, and none had the actual finish peel off."
past Kitchen Aid microwave died so we quickly decided on this one It works fine but less features from the last one some of them I miss It’s fine
"The power button doesn't work. So basically I have to heat everything at full power.Otherwise it seems to be a good mcrowave,"
"thought I would be getting a good unit, with the ""Black and Decker"" name.However, I am truly disappointed. While the unit looks great, looks are deceiving. The door sticks, constantly and it is noisy, more so the normal with a microwave. I am not pleased and will not recommend this model."
Door opener has rough bumps on it. I cut my finger. So now I have to press on side to open. Very inconvenient!
The push button for the door is giving me problems and I've only had it for a month.
This microwave lasted a month shy of 4 years.  It was used maybe 4 or 5 times a week for usually 5 min. or less.  Not sure if this good for a product made by today’s standards.  I have a microwave at work that was made in 1997 and it is still used 3-4 times a day with no issues.
Pushing the button to open the door moves the microwave every time. I wish it had a handle.
"This microwave functions well enough,  but after a couple of years the paint inside began to bubble and chip off."
"First off, the microwave was much smaller than I anticipated even though I measured my older microwave. The defrost takes forever, and the instructions are difficult to follow. What should take seconds to defrost takes at least a minute or two. The glass plate does not fit into The plastic piece in order for it to spin. Overall, this has been the worst microwave I’ve ever  owned."
Not great to be honest. Wish I would’ve listened to other reviews. The steam and moisture that builds up is insane. Not even 6 months in and it makes a really weird noise when heating up. DO NOT RECOMMEND
"I am reviewing the 700W model so perhaps the larger models do not have these issues, but these are the problems I have encountered:- Requires too much pressure to operate the keypad and to open the door. Since the unit is very light weight, it slides all over whenever you apply enough pressure to operate it unless you use your other hand to stabilize it. Might have to invest in a heat resistant/non-slip pad to go under the unit- argh!- I use my microwave timer as a general kitchen timer - a LOT. This one can be confusing to set. You have to set the 2 digit minutes, then the 2 digit seconds, and you need to enter leading zeroes. For example, if you want 5 minutes, when entering the minutes you have to enter 05. If you forget and just enter 5 you will get a time of 50 minutes. Hopefully I will get used to this, but for now I too often forget and wind up timing 50 minutes. Sigh.- Heats quite slowly, although this does not shock me - maybe that's what to expect from only 700 watts.  But it is disappointing. Heating a cup of water for tea took 1 1/2 minutes in my old 1100 watt microwave. Takes 2 min (at minimum) in this one. For me this is a trade-off - wanted to recoup counter space in a very small kitchen so opted for small size rather than performance. I do like the size and overall appearance. Plus, the interior size is fine for my needs, hence the 2 stars rather than one."
"I had high hopes for this since black and decker is a usually good brand, but this microwave heats sooo unevenly. Like if I microwave a tortilla (just as example lol) for like 20 seconds,  one bite would still be as cold as when it went in and the next would burn my mouth. So annoying!!"
"I've owned Black and Decker Products before so I hoped thos would be a good find. I was wrong. This is the loudest microwave I have ever owned. It sounds like its going to explode. The turn table struggled and jerks its way around. Popcorn is nearly all kernels at 2:15 and burned at 2:30 with half the bag still unpopped.  Trying to reheat leftovers, faster in my airfryer. Its getting so loud we've stopped using it for fear its going to burst into flames."
"All in all, if I had not had a better microwave for over ten years, I might think this unit was better. I didn't realize 900 watts was so poor. I would have bought a higher wattage. When you push the button to open it, the unit slips backwards (you have to brace it), the button is not easy to push, and is noisy. I don't care for this unit, but for 900 watts, it can be all right until I can buy another more suitable microwave. The price was ok, so maybe I should not complain. It has nice features and it's easy to use in that respect. Because of the low wattage, it takes a lot longer to heat things up, which I am getting used to. Also, being lightweight, it was easy to lift. This unit would be good for someone who has never had a better unit, or who cannot afford something nicer. I consider this a good unit for possibly a dorm room, or for something that will not be permanent."
"After using a few times it ran very hot. The glass turn table was hot to the touch with nothing on it. If you used unit for  five minutes twice, back to back it would shutdown, turning off all power. After 10 minutes or so it would come back on. The clock time would need to be reset. The same issue again. I did like the unit, good size and features. It also matches my stove. I returned for a replacement to Amazon in under 30 days.Fortunately I noticed it was overheating before it damaged my brand new counter top in a completely  redone kitchen. Replacing the counter would be thousands of dollars. Didn't see anything in manual about possible overheating and any concern about counter you put it on. My learned lesson is always test out  a microwave very closely before putting it on the counter"
I seem to get defective item if I don't buy from the store. This microwave makes a loud grinding sound from the spin plate while cooking.It still works so I use it. But next time I will use the store.
"I purchased this unit August 2021 and it has already crapped out.  It randomly started making a spark-like, crackling noise when I went to heat something up one day.  I unplugged it and tried again a few days later and it worked fine until it did it again about 2 weeks later but this time it was louder and more concerning.  It sounded like the unit would either explode or at the least catch fire.  Since I have children in my home, I decided to err on the side of caution, so I unplugged it and refuse to use it again.  It was great while it lasted but I would not recommend it."
"Still getting used to. Much smaller than my last one.  Still not sure if I like it.  Having trouble with several features. Not able to change the PL, (power  level). Don’t like the door. Door lock is tight; I need 2 hands to open it,  B/C i’st small enough to slide all over the counter.Maybe good enough for Recreational Vechical- no space for it to move around!Lp"
Would be a nice product but the button that  opens the door is in a small space. It’s hard to fit your finger/ thumb in the slot in order to push it and also hard to push. Really annoying.
Turntable does not stay put.
This is a basic microwave. It produces excessive moisture. Despite wiping it dry after each use it has rusted along all the inside seams and corners. If you attempt to use the preset  potato or popcorn setting- which are high heat- it will overheat the white interior coating and it forms bubbles...which will peel off.I filed a claim with Black and Decker/ Midea within the 1 year warrantly period. It was denied because neither problem was deemed a manufacturing defect. Will never purchase another product from any of the Midea companies again! Neither should anyone.
"Missing rubber foot on bottom.  The screw threads are there for it to screw onto, but no rubber bumper foot. Had to buy my own rubber bumper so screw wouldn't scratch countertop. And, if the rubber foot was there, that would be 3 total.  Why not 4, one in each corner? And the bumpers are so small they are ineffective.  Microwave slides back when you push on keypad. Have to push on keypad too hard to enter anything.  And, the picture does not match the product.  The picture depicts white letters on a black background  Nope, letters are off white, harder to see than white letters would be to see  Must be some artsy fartsy moron working at Black and Decker.  Human factors engineer would make it white letters on black background or black letters on white background. Probably not sending it back unless stops cooking. I'll also be fixing my old GE microwave that had no problem for 20 years."
"The microwave came dented and the only option is to return it.  There is no doubt the dent was there when it was put in the box as there is no dent or tear in the box. I am unable to do this myself as an elderly woman. I am a Prime Member and thought there might possibly be another option, an adjustment maybe, but no. I am disappointed. (This purchase is also the second one in a couple of weeks that was defective when it was sold and shipped to me.) The microwave it replaces is dead. I had to impose on a neighbor to help with the switchover. This one is supposedly higher wattage, but you can't prove it by me."
"I bought this microwave recently, and 5 months later it doesn't work anymore.  Very disappointing!"
"The support ring which the glass plate sits on to rotate is so thin & flimsy, it broke within 4 months!Had to glue it twice  the unit itself is small enough to place a dinner plate, so no heavy anything was placed on it! It’s just simply..a bad purchase."
This is my replacement as the first time around it was not handled with care and came with a huge dent. The second time it was shipped fine but after a couple uses I realize it doesn't heat evenly. It has a hot center point. Burns food easily if heated for long.
This product arrived with dents on the outside box.
Only 2 years old. Not used extensively. Just stopped working. Got it to work again for a few months. Was using it yesterday and it caught fire.
The glass tray will easily move away from the center pivot which causes the food to sit in one spot rather than rotating for even heating/cooking.
"We got this after having an LG that was a bit larger. We were looking forward to getting a smaller microwave to leave us more counter space. Also the LG buttons were REALLY hard to read in low light, but other than that, no complaints. The grass is always greener.We looked at several smaller models and picked this one after reading reviews and ratings. I won't buy it again.It might work in a dorm for heating hot pockets or something like that, but not as a household piece for regular use.Our issues with it:• It doesn't heat consistently. Sometimes it'll make things super got. Sometimes the same size thing on the same setting will have cold spots. It's just inconsistent...which is annoying AF when you heat the same thing repeatedly. The old microwave I automatically set the same way each time. This one's a crap shoot.• You can't heat and have a timer going at the same time. Sounds stupid, but the LG was great on this score. We could use the kitchen timer for one thing and heat something else at the same time, no problem. With this, it's one or the other.• Buttons - still not easier to read (though easier than the LG. My visions decent - but it's like the people who make microwaves have never looked at ADA regulations. I'd certainly never get this for anyone without good vision.• The little plastic thing under the glass plate is too small a diameter. This should normally be as close to the size of the base of the plate as possible. This one is really small, so you need to make sure you center whatever you put in it or it can get knocked out of whack easily.I'm going back to LG next time - even if I have to rewrite the damn numbers with a paint pen.ADDENDUM - It's now just under two years later. The button that opens and closes the door is starting to crap out already. I don't know what I was expecting for under $90, but I sure as hell won't buy this thing again."
The microwave was a Christmas present. It was delivered on December 18th. Now 4 months later in April it malfunction. It was returned to Amazon for a credit.
"This microwave leaves a puddle of water that takes multiple many paper towels to sop up, in the bottom under the turntable. Rust started to firm within weeks. Paint started chipping up within months. And now they won't help me with another microwave because I waited too long to complain. The company has told me it's a 'health hazard' at this point, but refuses to do anything towards the fact that I wasted a hundred dollars buying an absolute piece of junk. It's a shame I desperately needed the use of a microwave and didn't have the time to let them know in the beginning that it would puddle up and started to rust, it wasn't until a huge piece of paint lifted up that I was more than furious enough to contact them. So even though this problem started immediately upon using the microwave and happened within months... I was a little over the 'warranty time' and they just don't care that I can't afford to buy another one. This huge company can't help a single mother that doesn't want to continue to use their 'health hazard' - their words with a hundred dollars towards a new purchase ... Disgusting. Do NOT BUY Black&Decker. They don't care about the customers or if they sell garbage that can be detrimental to your health."
The microwave is clean & looks great but it didn’t come with a plate on the inside
It worked fine at first.  It slowly lost power & I slowly had to add cooking time.  Now after adding one minute to a 5 minute dinner I still have frozen food in the middle.  This is the second microwave from Amazon that has done this.  The other one lasted a little longer & I thought this brand might work out - nope!
"Nice microwave but after a few uses the back started melting, had to send it back"
"Design flaw is that the microwave makes a loud 5-beep noise when its cycle is finished, regardless of whether or not you open the door.  No stopping this noise to let your family sleep.Otherwise it's great."

"I bought this microwave in July 2022. After 2 years of use, the paint started bubbling, and now is chipping and peeling on the inside of the microwave. I get it, it's been being used for 2 years now. However 2 years of use or not, no normal use of a microwave should cause the interior paint to bubble, chip, or peel. This becomes a contamination issue, putting your food at risk. No abnormal cleaning chemicals were used on it, or anything that would have caused this. I have to purchase a new microwave now, even though this one technically still works, because this is not safe to use."
"I like the size of this microwave, however was disappointed with mechanism in opening the door. Also the turntable often needs to be checked, easily goes off track, noisy when operating."
I will not purchase this again.
It's okay for how much we use it. It's small and dosen't take up room on the counter. The only issue I have is not all the amount of time buttons work.
"The turntable base ring was broken.  Not surprising since it was on the bottom and the microwave was sitting on top of it.  But we had an old one we could use, and so we tried the microwave.  It runs more loudly than any microwave I’ve had.  And when we closed the door on it, it set off our alarm system because it was so loud that it sounded like a break-in.  I’m disappointed.  We have lots of Black and Decker products that are great.  We thought this one would be as well.  We’re returning it."
I got it on sale and the rattling exterior and broken roller wheel remind me of it on the daily. Features are standard so if not for the flaws it would be a 3.
"It’s a nice little unit but the keyboard takes some getting used to. It works just fine after you figure out the quirks. However, there is one big problem. The turn table will not stay in place. Almost every time I use the microwave I find myself having to stop the microwave, remove the food, and fiddling around to get the turntable carriage back in place and then to get the glass. Then I must carefully set the glass tray set in place without knocking the turntable out of its track. You have to start over again. That usually takes enough tries to make me a little frustrated."
"I needed a smaller microwave to fit into a limited space in my kitchen. This one was fairly priced and works as well as any other microwave in my opinion. I like the simple button layout on the front of it and the various options for quick selection for various food items.What I don't like is the smell of burning plastic when I use it. At first I thought I had accidentally left part of the plastic covering on the inside of the microwave or something but I don't think I did as I've looked all over the inside several times just to be sure. I'm hoping the smell will go away after several more uses. But I have to say, I've never had a microwave that smelled like that during operation. Had I known this, I don't think I would have bought it. I don't think it is defective, but they should do something to address the smell."
This product broke down after just two years. The turntable and microwave runs when the door is open. We have to replace it as the warrantee is no longer good.
"I have never had so many issues with a microwave!  It's 2024; it can't be that hard!  First, the Glass Tray kept sliding, despite being properly aligned on the Support Wheel Ring---which also kept dislodging!Next, I have NEVER seen this before (I'm 65) but after a month of use, there are LARGE WATER DROPLETS that continuously hang from underneath the Glass Tray!Most annoyingly, you can't just press any button to start cooking.  If you want to cook something for JUST A MERE 7 MINUTES, you have to go through a FOUR-STEP PROCESS!?!?!?!Oh, I guess MORE annoying is with my old microwave, I could heat up a frozen pot pie in 4-5 minutes.  With THIS machine, it comes out HALF FROZEN!!!  I pushed it to 6 minutes---and there is STILL a small section of ice on the bottom!!  Hence I had to look up the manual on how to get it to heat for 7 minutes.Maybe you will have better luck..."
Bought this for my 97 yr old mother who has somewhat impaired vision.  The turntable is small and a bit wobbly on the spindle.  That paired with the vision issues meant that the turntable kept coming off the spindle and she couldn't get it back on properly.
"Not sure if other reviews noted this, but the interior of this microwave is too small to hold a regular size dinner plate. I did not realize that when I purchased it, but will likely keep it regardless since my space is small and it is otherwise a good fit. Have only used it a few times and it seems to work well."
"My old 100 watt  microwave reheated yesterdays coffee in one minute this one takes 90 seconds. The door opening button isnt solid and the doors sounds “tinny” when you shut it. It is ok for what I use it for, baked potatoes,veggies and reheating coffee."
"I don’t understand the number of positive reviews. Here is my honest reflection after having had this microwave for 3 months. I talk about the following below: (1) low power, (2) lingering smell, and (3) useless turntable.(1) Low Power. When I say low, I mean it can’t heat one cup of room temperature water in a mug. We had a much better built in microwave in our previous house and needed to buy a new one since our new house didn’t have one built in. We got this one for the small foot print. Unfortunately, it takes us more than twice the amount of time to heat foods and beverages as compared to our last one.(2) Lingering Smell. If you heat anything in there with any type of scent, be prepared to either leave the door open (and therefor the light on) overnight for the smell to dissipate or live with eating or drinking the scent of whatever was in there prior. If you heat fish, forget about using it for another day. I’ve used it to heat salmon one night and opened it up to heat a cold cup of coffee mid morning the next day only to be met by the most foul scent that can only come from old fish odor. Btw, i clean my microwave daily and it’s spotless so it’s not from food splatters.(3) the turntable is a piece of glass that sits on top of a loose plastic ring with three wheel and the whole thing slides ALL OVER THE PLACE. There are three grooves at the bottom of the glass turntable that is supposed to catch the center turning mechanism in the microwave. However, that will only happen if you precariously balance it in such a way that doesn’t slide around on the wheeled ring thing AND is perfectly situated in mismatched grooves. A hair off and the whole thing slides around again.I wish I had the time and energy to send this back when I still have the chance. Do yourself a favor and pass."
The good: it’s compactThe bad: it’s light weight so it moves around. It also doesn’t do a good job of heating things up. It takes like 3.5 minutes to heat up liquids.
"I make it a point to not direct rage, disappointment, or petty insults at kitchen appliances. It's not productive, nor is it a positive for my mental health and wellbeing. Disclaimers aside, this microwave pisses me off more than college football referees. Oh, sure, it heats stuff...I have no beef with that, but it does one single thing that sets me off. It's. the. turntable. Why does the glass turntable constantly jump off track and refuse to turn? It seems that every time I choose to use this annoying little countertop failure, I have to reseat the turntable. I've only had it for a year, but I'm ready to donate it to some microwaveless group...perhaps a devil worshipping clan, thus avoiding any guilt feelings."
"Bought this because of the weight, I am FM not strong with some health problems. Wished I got a different one that was almost the same weight. Size is what I expected. Easy to use. Big problem is that the glass turntable keeps popping off. Even weight on plate, plate not heavy, not interfering with it turning. Still pops off. Works with small item that is in the middle of turntable. Went to defrost chicken cutlets and had to do one at a time.  Those reasons why I put one star on easy to use and 3 stars of overall rating."
"Beautiful appliance,  but when I took the foam and plastic packaging off, there was deep scratches on the top surface.  Not something you'd expect from a brand new product.I need it so I won't send it back, but I am disappointed."
The product looks much bigger in pictures.  I received a large box but when removing the microwave it was much smaller than I expected or wanted.
"Was looking to replace a Toshiba microwave, I tried this as it fit the specs & that model did not agree with my apartment (shorted out). However this thing is really loud. Microwaves hum, it's normal, but this one was on a whole new level. Returned. I ended up with a Chefman that is somewhat better."
It cooks a little slow but it's a small microwave.  It buzzes and rattles alot when cooking.
"This microwave would probably work well if you are worried about tripping a breaker but for normal, household use, buy a different model. 700W is not very powerful. For instance, It took over 8 min to heat up a package of vegetables that steam in a bag (it normally takes 4 min in the larger ones)That being said, it is compact and easy to use. It is clearly marked 700W. If you’re retired (like me) and have extra time to wait for something to heat up, this microwave may be ok for you. If you’re like my wife/kids and impatient, habitually late or in a hurry, you’ll need something with a lot more power (like 1200W)."
Heating times are rounded to the minute
Bought for my son’s small kitchen space when my husband had to go live with him and cook for him after he lost the use of his right arm & hand and left arm in an accident and had so many other additional injuries that time to spend on cooking would be in short supply. It was the right size to fit in that small counter space but they had difficulty getting things to cook to hot enough to eat in a reasonable amount of time. So it didn’t really help as much as we were hoping. Now that my son only needs the bone grafts to heal in his arm abd then physical therapy and is otherwise functioning mostly on his own except driving he’s still not finding the microwave very practical.
The microwave works great but the turntable doesn't like to stay in place
"Arrived dented, like so many others have complained about here. The packaging on this is not suitable for Amazon's/USPS's package handling. Probably the weakest foam and the thinnest cardboard.However, it fit perfectly into the hole I needed it to in my cupboards, and the dent is not visible while it's in the hole, so I guess its... fine.It's features are exactly what I expect out of a microwave. Nothing fancy. Push button to open is a little stiff but fine. It's just fine."
"it glitches out on me and I have to unplug it for a couple minutes to ""reset"""
Well built but takes too much pressure to open.
"We purchased a Black & Decker microwave EM720CB7. It very soon started sparking, emitting smoke and frying the interior lining. We called B&D not so much to complain but to warn them. Instead, the company took a defensive posture stating my wife did not clean it, or for not placing the rotating plate while heating or cooking with metal in the oven. None are true. We punched in ‘Black and Decker microwave fires, sparks, smoking  and interior damage.’ The number of complaints and photos were numerous, similar and plentiful. For B&D to be more concerned with blaming  the consumer was amazing. For what?  Avoiding a class action? Keeping our money? I am talking no response other than to blame my wife. If B&D corporate management saw this.and other complaints with photos, heads would surely roll. I no longer trust the black & Decker name and assure you our microwave was replaced at our cost and. certainly not under the Black&Decker name- Jay Albert’s -Kingston, NH"
"The unit will heat up food. However, if you reduce the power on any level, it really doesn’t do a whole lot of anything. For instance, if you cook something on regular power for two minutes, it’ll be blazing hot. However, if you reduce it to half heat over four minutes, it’ll still be cold. I’ve tried to see if experiment even reducing it to maybe seven or eight power level. So I’m saying with my unit is that if you leave it all in all the time you’re gonna be happy. Anything else and you’ll be sadly disappointed  And take five times as long to get the same result. If you don’t go full power all the time."
Insanely low power. Took 9 minutes to defrost a small bowl of berries. FML.
"The BLACK+DECKER EM720CB7 Digital Microwave Oven is a great option for small spaces. It's compact and fits easily on a countertop or in a cabinet. The digital display is easy to read and use, and the design is sleek and modern.However, I have noticed that the heating time is quite slow. It takes longer than expected to heat up even simple items like soup or leftovers. While this may not be a huge issue for some, it can be frustrating if you're in a hurry or have limited time. Overall, if you're looking for a microwave that is small and convenient, this is a good option. But if you prioritize speed and efficiency, you may want to consider other models."
"My last one was a lower wattage by a couple hundred,  so I wanted something more powerful although the old one serviced me well...  Having limited space was an issue,  so there isn't as many to choose from when that happens. So I went with this one. Good looking,  stainless and black and the smaller size with ample controls is a definite plus. I've owned this now for a couple months and would recommend this. By the way... its very,  very quiet. I've read in other reviews some have taken issue with the loudness of their machines. So,  if quiet operation,  smallness of size,  ample controls are what you're looking for,  I think you've found your new machine..."
"I have now owned this microwave for 3 years, so figured it is time to write my laughable review. I bought this microwave because it’s cute and matches my vintage decor but I didn’t know it was going to cook my food vintage too or not cook it. This is the most confusing microwave to use. I’ve given up on anything besides the add 30 second button. I have multiple friends with this microwave and all of us only use the 30 second button times whatever it takes because no one really understands it. We all laugh at ourselves for buying the cute vintage microwave that barely work. It takes extra long to heat up anything. Whatever the package says, double it! 3 stars. 1 for being cute, 1 for making me laugh and 1 for teaching me patience."
The black text on the red microwave is a colossal mistakeWe want to love this perfect little microwaveBut frankly we hate that we can’t read the words on the controlsI’m literally thinking about donating it and buying something else
"I bought it because of the look, color, price, and reviews. Now Amazon reviews, if a good sample size, generally give a pretty good indication of a given product's worth. Now, perhaps I received a one-off less than from Galanz, but I doubt that's completely sure...especially because of the price (which was cheap I admit). Even so, and while it does work ""OK"", I need to point out a few things that have kept my rating at three stars.First, it is loud by microwave standards with a ""rat a tat tat"" kind of sound when turned on. Yes, it does work but is relatively loud and annoying. Guessing it is the fan motor that is making this sound, but it could be something else.  This just questions the quality (or quality control) of the manufacturer. Yes, I know it's relatively cheap, but still, this is something mechanical that will obviously wear faster than it should and not something cosmetic and harmless.The second and third issues I have are with the time selection for operating the different cooking features (completely subjective I know) and the way the unit operating as a microwave oven uses its power source (the magnetron) to heat the food. The timer is set by dial rotation which works well...but in 10-second increments. This is just a personal thing, but I don't like not being able to control the cooking time a little more precisely. Also, I know it's a cheap unit and does actually work, but not really all that well or consistently. It tends to be very target-focused at the center of the rotating plate and will at times overcook in the center and undercook the edges (of course this is food-dependent...as this is not an issue when heating just liquids for example).  Bottom line...this microwave is just OK and nothing more (other than it being cute I suppose.  However, it's just annoying enough that its looks and price are not going to save it.  I'm going to bite the bullet and upgrade a bit (which is what I originally set out to do)."
I’ve had this for about a year and it has gone out and will work sometimes. It’s purely decoration at this point until I get a new one. It’s small and probably won’t be good for heavy use so you should definitely purchase the warranty with this because microwaves are too expensive to replace yearly. I have never had a microwave go out on me in alll the years I’ve been adulting. This microwave is pretty much for novelty purposes. 700 watts requires food to be heated longer than usual.
It’s cute but I’m not in love
"I love the way this looks. Gorgeous.  It even cooks well. It's not the fastest, but dies the job.Issues: there are 2 main issues I have with this product that comes down to factory quality. First is its not level. It has tiny legs made of metal that are not adjustable. One of them is dramatically off and my entire microwave teeters when forward when I touch it. I always have to use two hands to open it because not only will it tip forward but because there is no rubber or traction, it slid against the counter. I use a piece of cardboard to level it.The other more annoying problem is the turntable. The glass plate itself is not the issue, it's the wheeled ring under it. This microwave has no track to keep it in place so it's free floating under the glass plate. Each time you use it the ring starts to shift out of place until eventually the glass plate becomes unbalanced and tips. This is so dramatic that it's like the wheeled thing is trying to escape from under the plate. Lol I usually have to realign my wheels/plate every few uses"
"When my microwave that I had since 1989 (34.5 years) broke, I wanted a new one with a smaller footprint because I have limited counter space.This one takes up somewhat less room than a regular sized one. It is cute and comes in pretty colors. You can start it easily by pushing the start button, which gives you cook time in 30 second increments.But, all that is NOT worth it breaking after only six months!!! Also, there is no timer. And the time cook only comes in ten second increments, so if you want to set it for 17 seconds, you are out of luck. And, boy, it really lacks power. It was a waste of money.I am sorry I bought this."
"This microwave works great, but it beeps for every single button press with no options to mute it. Tried using this late at night and the high pitched beep is too much. Will have to consider going with another option unfortunately because for me it was that annoying."
"I bought this low-wattage microwave so I would have something small that didn't take up much counter space. I wanted something small since I would mostly use it to heat the occasional burrito and other quick foods and occasionally heat up leftovers or warm a cup of coffee. The color was nice too. I have a lot of aqua and turquoise in the kitchen (this is more aqua than regular blue).So it has mostly performed all right and does the job I bought it for, albeit with me putting on extra time because of the wattage (which isn't even covered on most packaging instructions for food; they usually start with 800 or higher), which I expected. But it also has smoke or steam coming out of the microwave if I open it right away, and I don't think I've noticed that with other microwaves.Also, I can't read a single thing on the metal control (which is partly from age and partly because the words are extremely difficult to read because they are small and the font is very thin) and thus don't use most of those features. Last night I couldn't get the light to shut off when I shut the door so I was trying to find out if the control had a setting to turn the light on and off, and I had to get reading glasses AND a flashlight. I finally shut the door really hard and the light went off. And while trying to look that issue up here, I read that other people have had this model of microwave start up automatically. That's scary.I'm planning to get another microwave with higher wattage, even if it's not as pretty as this one."
"I love this microwave. It’s adorable and it gets the job done. However, I noticed today after owning this for a couple of weeks, that these ripples started showing up on it. I haven’t been able to hang it up yet but it was concerning. It’s definitely metal (not just paint) when I run my fingers over it and I’m a bit nervous. It doesn’t seem to be on the microwave part so hopefully it should still function without the microwave radiation escaping, but unfortunately if it gets worse I’ll probably need to get rid of it for our safety."
"I liked the design and it was on sale for $69 dollars.I got it mid June and the inside light stooped working at the beginning of October. The heating part still works, but sometimes I heat by visually seeing if it’s done. I didn’t get the warranty.Additionally, I thought I wouldn’t mind the dial button to set the time, but longer stretches of time are kind of a pain with a dial."
I prefer to use things as long as possible. I bought this microwave in 2020. Its still runs fine in 2024 so I would not be shopping for a new one except that the inside is falling apart. For this reason I only gave it 3 stars. I was hoping to get more that 3.5 yrs out of it.
"Retro style and in red was the attraction. Price was right but so often you get what you pay for which wasn't much. Always heated unevenly, had to stir things up mid heating i.e bowl of pasta, soup, stew. I mostly used it for quick warming : milk for my coffee , my coffee, to soften hard ice cream. Nothing major. So today, it decided to give up the ghost with a large SNAP! and then no heat. Guess that cup of milk was too much for it. It was so young, only a year. So lightly used, too. And can you believe (lol)  just a month and a bit past return and over warranty! My microwave prior lasted for YEARS! Hear that , Galanz? YEARS. I shouldn't have fallen for that retro red styling with an exotic brand name."
The microwave works just fine. It's a microwave it does what its supposed to do there's nothing to comment about on that. The part that I'm annoyed about is the COLOR. I ordered GREEN box says GREEN pictures show GREEN. Pull the darn thing out of the box and it's BLUE. It arrived before I got home from work and my teenage kid and roommate decided to set it up and use it before I got home so now I can't even return it. So I have a BLUE microwave in my multi-GREEN kitchen. Awesome. Not happy.
The microwave is cute and I haven’t used it yet. After taking it out of the box I noticed a piece of plastic in between the glass on the door.My hope is that it doesn’t melt and run down the front. That’s all I see because it’s right in the middle
This is an absolutely beautiful red microwave oven. Unfortunately the timer doesn't work. You can set the timer. You can turn it on. And it will work. But not with the microwave oven. Which won't turn on. The timer turns on but not the oven. The timer has a set 3O second option. So you have to use the 3O seconds over and over again in order to use the timer for more than 3O seconds. So if you need 3 minutes you have to push the pre-set 3O second timer over and over again until you reach close to 3 minutes.If you call Galanz tech-support you will simply be told to unplug the oven for two hours and then push the dial to reset the microwave oven. Which does nothing other than turn the oven on for 3O seconds.So if you want a microwave oven with a working timer. Do not buy this absolutely beautiful red microwave oven. As the timer only works for 3O seconds at a time. Which will drive you crazy. Please see the other reviews which complain of this issue. Which indicates that Galanz is selling a product which simply doesn't work as marketed. Or their instruction manual is simply incorrect. And Galanz apparently has no solution to this issue.
"This was our fault as we didn’t examine it too closely before purchasing as we needed something quick. If you noticed, there is no keypad to type in the amount of time you want to cook your food. There is only a dial. That wouldn’t be so bad if the dial went up number by number but it goes up in 10 second increments. To soften butter, often I want 7 seconds but I can’t just set it to 7.Also, the heating of food takes longer time increments than other microwaves. I think this is because it’s just smaller and has less capacity but it can be frustrating when you are trying to make late night nachos and you have to keep putting them back in over and over until the cheese finally melts.The look and feel of the microwave is as expected. Didn’t come with any dings or scratches, it was very clearly brand new. It’s pretty lightweight and because it is small it fits in a lot of places.It has multiple settings for defrosting or cooking but there aren’t really preset buttons, you have to read the little manual booklet each time unless you can memorize it (most microwaves have those instructions on the machine itself when you open the door).Anyway, I guess we got what we ordered but it has been pretty disappointing to use."
It stoped working with a banging sound and an extremely burnt area in the middle of a brownie I was warming up for one minute.  The sound took me by surprise but the laser like burn in the middle of my small brownie blew my mind!  I havent really enjoyed this unit.  I shouldnt have bought it just because it was pretty.  Every time I opened the door of the unit it would scoot against the counter.  I had to put silicone pot holders under it so it would stay in place.  It took forever to cook.  Not one time did a baked potatoe cook perfectly.  One side hard the other side soft.  To warm a cup of liquid it took 2 minutes.  Please dont buy this unit for looks only!
"have to close door gently or inside latch will break, its made out of plastic so be careful and do not slam door when closing"
"I wanted a good looking, compact microwave for my pantry. We typically only use the microwave for reheating coffee that we are too busy to drink. This fit the bill for looks and size. I was pleased when I opened it, but other reviewers are correct with its inefficient heating. I have to press 30 seconds multiple times for it to reheat my coffee, when my former microwave would have it piping hot in one 30 second stint.We will keep it because we are not very reliant on microwaves, but if you use yours on a daily basis, I would not recommend this one."
Does the job. Doesn’t cook very evenly and makes grinding sounds from the turntable. No very strong either (power wise). It does look nice though. I don’t think it will last very long though.
"This red microwave is a beauty.  It gives a lovely pop of colour to my kitchen.  I have only used it once and it worked well.  It will get some taking used to that there is no number pad (which I knew when purchasing)My major issue is that the control commands are small and black and do not stand out well to read, especially in low light.My last microwave was also a galanz which is 18 years old and I am replacing because it beeps softly and appears to have a short.  But it served me well!"
"Too many ""bells and whistles"" for me.  I could not read the printing above the buttons without glasses and a lot of light.  The black print on red made it hard to read even with glasses.  It's an attractive microwave; very retro.  But too difficult for me to figure out."
"This microwave works fine, is easy to use, and small, so it's good for small kitchens. The design is cute. My issue is with the color. I specifically wanted a GREEN microwave for my green kitchen and have been looking all over for one for months. I ordered the Galanz microwave described as ""green"", but the color of the microwave itself does not match the photos in the product description online. The actual color is more of a blue teal, unfortunately not green."
"Cute, kinda of small. But took way too long to heat a mug of coffee. I sent it back"
"This microwave was very powerful and extremely easy to use. It was also very easy to clean. Plus, I loved the red color and the vintage look of it. However, I didn't even have the microwave for a year before it completely stopped heating up. From what I understand, this is a very difficult fix, so I ended up replacing it. It was a shame, a microwave should last much longer than that before having to be replaced. I won't get this one again."
Looks cool but it’s underpowered have to cook everything longer than instructions suggest.
"So I bought this in 2021 and have loved it until last week.  At 2am I awoke to my smoke detector beeping. The microwave was smoking.  Fortunately there was no flames but house reeked of burnt plastic for hours even after opening all the windows and doing exhaust fans.  Looked up what may have happened and found several sites that explained that if you leave  microwaves plugged in the motherboard does sometime spark from just the current running through the plug i have to say the outlet was not affected, no black marks so the breaker in the electrical box did not pop and stop the current.  This is the danger so no matter what microwave you have because this one is not the only one that has had this happen.  It being empty apparently that also affects it.  So unplug you microwave at night to avoid anything like this. I was grateful I was home or my house may have been set in fire."
"Cute little microwave, can't fit large dinner plates though"
We’ve had this microwave for only a year and a half and it suddenly died today. Wouldn’t recommend this microwave.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It’s cute and heats up stuff ok.  The glass tray inside sits on a track that spins when it’s heating something.  The track moves around when it rotates causing rattling noises.  My last microwave had the same set up but there was a groove that the track fit into so it did not shift around.  Seems like a pretty basic thing in the design that is lacking.
"Don’t often write reviews but I expected better than this. Owned it for 14 months and only used it for 9 months before it died. From the “symptoms” (noise and won’t heat) I’m guessing the magnetron and it’s not worth an appliance repairman.It looks great and the .9 cu is a good size for small spaces. The biggest issue I had while it did work was the uneven food heating. The center would always cook/heat much more than the outer edges. Had it lasted longer than 9 months of use, I would have given it a 4 star review because I really did like it while it worked.Died today and I got online to order another one, to keep the matching theme with my Galanz fridge, air fryer and toaster oven, but then I noticed a large number of recent reviews of it starting fires! Yeah, umm, no. I want no part of that clearly faulty batch.  Ended up cancelling and I ordered a different brand retro microwave to try."
"It's cute; we would have liked to have kept it, but...We ordered this three times.Order 1: Broken during shipping. Working, but broken handle and no light. Returned; re-ordered.Order 2: It worked--but I accidentally ordered the wrong model. My bad. Returned.Order 3: NON-WORKING. Unlike the previous two orders, the glass tray flies off the roller ring. In other words, if you try to actually use the oven, the glass tray (and anything on it) slides off track , spills anything on it, and lands on a diagonal, unable to turn.In the shipping box, there was an enclosed note asking to ""Contact Galanz"" rather than return to Amazon. I did that; I figured they would send me a replacement roller ring or something. But no.What happened instead was nine days of my placing multiple phone calls, sending multiple e-mails with photos, and getting non-responsive e-mails back--and only when I called to follow up.Note: They are polite enough on phone--but there's a total lack of follow-up or follow-through. E-mails were non-responsive, asking for info already given them.To me, it seems like a simple issue that should have been answered quickly. But...no.After nine days of runaround, on today's phone call (my 5th?), I was told to return it to Amazon.Which I would have happily done nine days before.So we're returning it--and buying another brand."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            See the video. It’s noisy, I am old and I’ve had a few microwave ovens and none were this loud. It also vibrates and frankly that seems suspicious. It looks pretty but looks aren’t enough. I hope I can return this."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this microwave because I thought it was beautiful. I received it and it was shockingly loud, like something was broken inside (see video). I thought that was just a mechanical glitch so no big deal, I returned it and got a replacement. The second one they sent me was completely scratched up inside like it had been used (well used.. for a long time). I returned that one too obviously. I called Amazon and they said they need to look into the brand and find out if they’re selling used items. I don’t recommend buying from this company."
"cute, but extremely low power. I got used to cooking things twice as long but after 15 months it died. Not worth it!"
"I really liked this microwave for the 6 months I had it before it suddenly sounded like a revving car engine and smelled like an electrical fire. Very scary stuff. To give some background: I am a one-person household and use the microwave for maybe 3-5 minutes total every day.  It's gotten very light use during the time I had it and was well taken care of. My last microwave lasted 20 years, so this 6-month business is a shock.I sent an email to Galanz since the microwave is clearly under warranty and was told to call a number that hung up on me multiple times. I finally got through and eventually reached a person, who took all the info from my microwave and said ""someone will call you back in 15-30 minutes."" About an hour later, a lady called me back and she had no record of all the info (model number, serial number, etc) that had been collected on the first call. After going through the process again, she placed me on hold only to come back and tell me I need to scrape every label off the microwave (without tearing them) and mail the power cord at my own expense (and at my own risk, which was repeatedly stated.) So in summary, the warranty process feels like a total scam (multiple times stating that packages can get lost in the mail),  and I now have a 6-month old microwave I have to figure out how to properly dispose of. (Also they were zero help with disposal either.)In summary: AVOID THIS MICROWAVE AND THIS COMPANY unless you like buying a new microwave every 6 months, enjoy the smell of electrical fires, and love fighting your way through a complicated telephone labyrinth in an effort to get your money back."
"This microwave is super cute... I love the retro colors and style. However, 30 seconds in this microwave barely warms food. Whereas my other microwave heats quite a bit in 30 seconds."
I have had this for a few months. That’s about all it lasted. It’s super cute and color is great but the thing is making noises now like you’d hear in Jurassic Park. I have no clue what is going on with it but it’s either broken or I’m microwaving a T-Rex with every use. Save your money and buy somewhere else.
"Love, love this microwave but I do not like rolling track for plate. Constantly have to adjust. I have never had to do that on any full size microwave I owned.**UDATE: After fighting the ring and plate continually dislodging for 1 year I finally contacted customer service. They were no help. Emailed their repair department, no answer. Bought a new ring, still same problem. Getting rid of this."
"Absolutely unbelievable!  This product is proof perfect that you get what you pay for...and this microwave exemplifies cheap Chinese crap!  The interior light bulb burned out, and Galanz first tells me - I'm not making this up! - the unit is ""unrepairable"" [That came from the guy manning the technical support desk].  I then get an e-mail from their customer service team that I need to go to their website to buy the replacement bulb.  Well, don't you know they don't carry the bulb!  Not only that - they inform me that I ""...need to contact local technician to fix this light bulb issue.""  So, at this point (after several e-mail exchanges and three or four phone calls), I find out they don't sell replacement bulbs, and that the microwave needs to be repaired by a ""local technician"".After attempting to repair it myself, I now know why they mention ""local technician"":  Galanz has used tamper-proof screws in the microwave cover, which requires a special bit to remove.  A quick visit to lowes.com, and I find many options for these screws there.  I'll spend a few bucks for the bit, find the bulb online, and continue to admonish people like me for buying a cheap piece of Galanz garbage."
"My microwave rattles when I open and close the door and when things are cooking.  Also, when I set the timer and press the button, it goes back to 30 seconds automatically.  In other words, if I set it for 3 minutes and hit the start button, it only cooks for 30 seconds.  I emailed Galanz over a week ago, but never received a response, so I sent them another email.  They responded they would get back with me soon but after 3 days, I emailed them again.  They then responded that I need to send them information from my machine, which I did, including, the serial number, the number between the prongs of the plug (why), my Amazon order number, etc.  Two days later after I sent them another email, they told me I didn't send the information.  I told them I clearly did but have not received a word.  I am just looking for some help with the produce, as I may be doing something wrong.  If I didnt like the looks of the microwave, I would have sent it back because of the horrible customer service.  Wish Amazon would do something to get them to help me out."
I’ve had this for almost a year now and it barely heats stuff up. We have to put our food in for at least double the amount of time it needs to be able to get it lukewarm. And it’s at the highest setting too. I’m disappointed because it’s so cute
It was the perfect size for us put the entire inside of the unit is covered in rust.  The paint has flaked off the area where the door is supposed to seal.  We only use it for defrosting and heating up precooked  food.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I like it and it works well.But it’s started making a noise about a week ago. So we will be returning it 😔I’m not sure if we’re going to get another one..May have the same issue?🤔
"We loved the retro look of this microwave.  But we soon learned that the controls are hazardous.  We had the microwave in an Airbnb that we rent out.  The controls are so sensitive that buttons are pushed and the microwave can be activated when you just lightly brush them with a cleaning rag.  I always reset the settings after cleaning it.  But my wife cleaned it once and didn't hit the reset button.  The microwave didn't start right away, but instead started a few hours later.  Somehow, the microwave turned on and caught fire some 5 or 6 hours after being cleaned.  Luckily our fire alarms went off and woke us up in the middle of the night.  We followed the smoke to the microwave and unplugged it immediately.  The fire was contained inside the microwave.  At first the microwave was too hot to touch.  We moved it outside as soon as we could touch it."
Item shorted out within a year. Very dissapointed. Can you replace??
"3 stars for looks, works, heats well. Otherwise sounds loud and feels cheaply made. I can’t really understand the other reviews not mentioning this. I know the cheaply made isn’t a defect, maybe ours is extra loud? Or maybe our last one was really well made and quiet.I would actually return this thing but it’s a hassle and we finally have one again. So, for now it’s what we’re using. Hopefully it lasts and doesn’t blow up like those scary reviews."
The item I got does not start at allThey did not check the item before they sent it to meThe item I got one side there is dentVery very bad quality
"Got two microwaves. Only ordered one. Got 3 shampoo bottles only ordered one , not happy if I have to pay to get it shipped"
"Lightly used the microwave in our guesthouse. Moved to our house as an interim microwave while deciding on what to buy for an everyday unit. Used for about three weeks. Noticed that it is very underpowered compared to other models, but to be expected due to lower wattage. While using it last week, I pressed the button to restart after pausing. There was a loud pop. Took out an entire circuit in my kitchen. Circuit breaker and GFCI were not able to restore the circuit after checking them. Having an electrician out next week. Will cost more than this microwave did. Gave it two stars for low price and extreme cuteness."
Received mine today haven’t tried it out yet so I can‘t really comment on things such as whether it’s easy to use. What shocked me is there’s a gap between the door and the main cabinet. See the pics. It’s so obvious that’s the first thing I noticed after opening the packaging. I can’t help wondering if this product is safe to use if the door is misaligned. Anyone has the same issue??? Thanks
"This microwave looks really cute and is very easy to operate. It's easy to clean and maintain and the price is right. Unfortunately it's not reliable and always ""acting up."" It randomly goes on ""Cancel"" and you have to press a bunch of buttons and open and close the door to make it work again. I think the heating is also inconsistent. We're happy when it works and heats all the way through. I wouldn't buy it again."
Don’t buy! Never worked from day one and now the time to return is passed! Guess I’ll try the number on the Manuel and see if they’ll do anything!
"Love the look of this red microwave and wanted to LOVE it.  BUT, I could not read the selection buttons on the right side.  The buttons need to be backlit so more people can see them.  In bright light and dim light it was not easy.  I returned the microwave because of this issue!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Only if I slam the door it will think the door is closed and start heating. Otherwise it will not spin. Very poor quality control.Also the buttons and knob and handle are plastic. Not sturdy. Maybe it’s better for decoration, but not everyday usage."
"I just received this today. Have not even used it yet (will update on that later) I chose this microwave out of all of the ones I looked at in this or a similar color because it had 5 stars. I was setting it up and noticed what looked like a plastic coating that I thought was part of the packaging that needed peeled off, I quickly realized that was NOT the case and rather it was whatever seal/coating they used over the entire unit that just isn't clinging correctly in these areas on both sides. I set the time on it and that was super easy. It's beautiful from the from, but these bubbly and pealy looking sides have me irritated. I am curious to know if this is a weird fluke or a common issue with these"
"Really cute and wanted to love it but it's just not good for someone who actually uses a microwave normally. Firstly the knob you turn to choose cook time only goes up by 10, so you can cook for 10,20,30,40,50,60 seconds and so on, this doesn't allow you a way to choose a cook time of 13 or 15 seconds to heat up some cold coffee or a roll for instance. The microwave is also very noisy and just not practical on entering time to cook. You can either hit the button to add 30 seconds multiple times to cook 3mins for example or stand there and turn the dial knob around for quite some time to get to 3 mins or higher. Not many precook selections at all. I wouldn't purchase this microwave for somewhere a microwave is heavily used it takes a long time to reheat cooked meals as well. It's very cute and I hate that I don't love it."
This was a pretty microwave but takes three times longer to cook anything.
"Mine is already back in the box, ready to be returned. I made the mistake of trusting the 1000s of positive reviews only to be majorly disappointed. After I packed it up, I breezed through the honest, 1 star reviews to see that someone else had the EXACT same issue. You plug it in, it turns on automatically. WHAT?! Press every button, consult the manual, and NOTHING. Unplug, plug back in. It turns right back on. This is cute, but absolute garbage. I believe the others that are claiming it breaks within a year, causes electrical fires, etc. I’m glad mine was obviously junk right out of the box. It isn’t worth the risk! DO NOT BUY! Get a name brand, regular looking one and save yourself the hassle."
"I wanted a retro looking microwave, and it looks great, but it's not easy to use.  Setting time with the dial is time consuming although the 30 second button is convenient.  It's only been in use for a couple of months, and the interior light has already burned out.  Since it's not that easy to set time, we're still deciding whether to replace the bulb or just replace the microwave.  The look, color, and style are great."
"This product would arc pretty frequently, and eventually set off a series of loud, terrifying, electric sparks that were so great I was sure my house was about to burn down. Will never buy a random off brand electronic like this again - I learned my lesson. Now I have a trash item and no microwave; totally ripped off but I guess I should just count myself lucky that somehow it didn't manage to start a fire.I'd also like to note that there were multiple reviews about this happening and were even pictures of ones that DID catch on fire, and those are now mysteriously gone. What a shady company, will avoid like the plague and I've let everyone I know know what happened."
Do not purchase this microwave unless you want to plug and unplug it every time you use it in order to turn off the interior light 🤨🤨🤨
"The appearance is retro as advertised.  But it is difficult to read the main dial (the middle silver one) which is needed to adjust heat and the timer unless it is facing direct light or you use a flash light.  The lettering on that dial should be much bolder / darker in black.  The lettering shows up on my iPhone pic only because the flash went off. I like the unit, but I cannot recommend because of this issue."
"The microwave was pretty and useful for about a year.  The outside stayed pretty,  but the inside corroded with rust both at the edges and inside.  When I wrote the company, adding photos, first they said it was out of warranty (1 year).  I complained that though several months out of warranty, it shouldn't have rusted after normal use.  I then received an email that they would refund my  purchase.  I was glad that Galanz was standing by their product, and I actually planned to buy another microwave, and write this one off as a lemon.  But the next day, I received an email that I should disregard the previous email, and that there would be no refund.  Don't buy this product if you care about a company honoring the quality of what it makes.  Landfill after 18 months of light use - how disgusting."
"It's cute, and small, which is what I was looking for, but even on full power, it takes twice as long to heat anything compared to my last one. Also, I liked the Power Level button, because they never make it easy to adjust power level, but it's just a button. God knows how it works, because nothing happens when I press it, it stays at 100% power, even when pressed six times, which is what they say you have to do to get it at 100%. The manual is almost useless. It can only be set to ten second intervals. I don't know if I'll learn to live with it until it blows up, or go to the hassle of repacking and shipping back. But it really is lousy."
"The microwave works fine. The problem is the amount of moisture that it retains. I'm not sure if it doesn't vent properly or what but in the indention under the glass plate will fill with water. I have all the vents clear, lots of space above and around the microwave but it still continues to retain moisture. Every day we make sure no water is sitting in the unit. I'm not talking about moisture, I am talking sitting water in the unit, that takes 2 to 3 paper towels to sop up. This was an issue with my last microwave also, which I didn't figure out until it suddenly died and tripped every plug in it was plugged into. When moving it, water came out from inside the unit. So I'm ready this time and know what to watch for."
It looks good and seems like the quality is good except when you use it it sounds like my old one when it was going out little loud. I’m really thinking about returning it.
"The color is beautiful and the size just right, but it was bent on one side.  I am going to keep it because I can cover up the flaw and returning it is just too much effort, but it is disappointing that I received an item that was supposed to be brand new but was clearly not!"
"Hello guys.As I wrote in your return form, 200 characters are not enough to describe the case.Yes, I bought this because I wanted a beautiful and nice powered micro in my kitchen.But I dein't pay attention that it can't be used in Israel because indeed 120V and we have 220.When I plugged it into the socket, it turned off the electricity in the entire apartment. And to be honest, I don't even know if the microwave is broken. So be aware, it may already be broken and doesn't work.I'm not much of an electrician. Here's what I found out afterwards.In order to have the opportunity to use this microwave in Israel, you need to purchase a special transformer that costs about 600 shekels at the store for 700 watts.This is more than your product cost.Why don't you warn people that many of the electrical devices you sell are not suitable outside of the USA?It should be written in big red letters. Or a warning about this should appear when trying to purchase such a product.I offer to take him back and give me back all the money, including taxes and fees.Otherwise, I will try to find a law firm that will agree to file a class action lawsuit against you.Best Regards.Alexander."
Lettering on dial is to small to read without magnifing glass
"Love the look of this and hadn’t used for popcorn until a couple of weeks ago and noticed that often the bags of popcorn had many burned kernels even though we set it to popcorn setting (2:40). We tried bending the bags so it would go around better but still usually get burned kernels inleas we way undercook it. Not sure if we got a bummer or if it simply is too small for regular bags of popcorn. Not ideal for hearing other items either - takes longer than our old microwave for  defrosting and reheating pizza, pasta. It is so cute. Love the color and retro look but quick dissatisfied with the microwave. Missed the return window so if you do buy it. Try everything you want to use it for within the return window. Bummer!"
Didn’t work. Power was good but didn’t heat at all. So disappointing.  Useless right out of the package.
"I got my retro green microwave yesterday and it is very nice looking. One thing has frightened me, I set up the time on the clock and in the middle of the night the oven turn on by itself. Lucky my son was up to unplug it. Had no idea I had accidentally set up a preset cooking time. I am scared to keep it plugged in now. I want an oven I can turn on and off only. There are too many unnecessary functions on this oven I will never use. I bought it for the retro look."
"I like the size, but the exterior depth of the microwave does not include space taken up by the thick power cord, and that adds about 3 inches to the depth of the microwave. The skinny and tiny black text on the chrome type circular settings buttons are difficult to read at times, but I eventually will know which button adjusts which setting. Just a bit annoying. The photographer who shot the product photos cleverly made the black finish appear to be a matte surface (which I would have preferred), but it's actually rather reflective and shiny (which I do not like)."
I purchased this microwave to replace an old one. I like the retro look and small size.The first unit purchased would work for a time and then the display would come up with a message 'FAIL'.I could clear the message by unplugging the unit but that is not optimal. So I sent it back for a replacement not knowing if it would ever be correct.The new unit does not give any obscure messages but it sounds like a diesel tractor. Very loud.So this unit will be going back for a replacement with something else. Not the same brand.
"Oh wow! I am still shaking!! I pressed the 30 second button to heat some food and turned my back for just a second when I heard a loud pop! There were shooting flames inside the microwave! Then, within a split second the microwave safe paper towel caught fire! I pressed the OFF button (I know, I know I should have disconnected it)  grabbed a pot of water to douse flames which were spreading SO VERY FAST and  the burning paper towel which continued to burn as I submerged it in the pot of water to dump in the sink of  running water! This really shook me up! The fire was spreading so fast had I  stepped out of the for even 10 seconds, I believe the blaze would have been out of control. Shortly after purchasing this microwave I called customer service (repeatedly during several days because no one was answering the phone) to return the microwave, but the carrier has made the return process so convoluted that I just gave up. BIG MISTAKE! Before purchasing, I had read a review where it was mentioned this microwave had  and electrical short. I should have paid more attention and taken that review seriously. What happened to me tonight could have had dire consequences had I not been right there to catch the fire before it was out of control. It spread so fast! PLEASE, PLEASE , PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MICROWAVE! I shudder to think of someone seriously being harmed by this inferior, obvious lack of quality control fire started masquerading as a microwave. JUST DON'T DO IT FOLKS! PLEASE! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"
"I really want to like this thing. It's cute and it does the job, but the controls are counterintuitive and difficult to use. I have to spin the dial for time, and it is next to impossible to get what I want. When it is running, turning the dial does nothing. The most aggravating thing is the power level. If you press the power button and turn the dial, you change the time. You have to keep pressing it, and each time is reduces the power by 20% - 80 - 60 - 40. If you wanted 50%, well shame on you. I am getting used to it, but I am not supposed to have to get used to things like this. They should be intuitive. So 3 stars because it works but it is a pain."
"So it’s super cute, it’s not too noisy, but not super quiet either and easy to use. My problem is with the paint job. For whatever reason the outside tends to get sticky. Something to do with the paint. And then when I try to clean it with just normal soap and water the paint is coming off. It’s starting to bubble and certain places now as well. I’ve never seen anything like that. I feel like they put a weird coating on it or they forgot to put a sealant on the paint. Either way it’s not so cute anymore."
"Love the color....But, not as great as I had hoped for. Too light...clock is a nightmare to set...only allows 30 second settings."
"We bought this microwave because of the size and the vintage look which are great; however, a week in the microwave changed pitch of the buzzing it usually makes when running and just doesnt sound right. Amidst trying to reach customer support I came back here to get my order receipt, and re-read the poor reviews and there are so many mentioned fires which is what I'm afraid of will happen with ours making this weird noise. Not comfortable using it after reading about fires. It seems there is no way to return it now and doesnt sound promising I will get ahold of customer support or refund or repair/replace."
"According to my echo microwaves should last between 5 - 10 years. Sorry to say mine isn't even 2. No warning just died. Did work fine b4, how to remember about low wattage."
"As a microwave it functions adequately. Things get hotter in a reasonable amount of time. That's when things go downhill. Not content with merely beeping to signal that it is done, this abominable POS beeps EVERY 30 SECONDS UNTIL YOU CANCEL IT OR OPEN THE DOOR. It's a MICROWAVE, not the center of my existence or even the primary thing cooking in my kitchen.  I used to heat a side dish and let it sit in the microwave while the something else cooked on the stovetop or oven. Not anymore! This prima donna needs me to pay attention to it or it just keeps whining."
"This is a cute retro microwave.  It came in its original box (like I would have taken it off the shelf) and the corner was damaged during shipping.  This caused a chip in the corner of the microwave, but it wasn't enough damage for the hassle of returning it.Be careful, the start button is on the round knob - I accidentally pushed something back on my countertop which hit the start button and the microwave started with nothing in it.  I wish there was some lock or safety feature so that wouldn't happen.It's okay for reheating but the power level is low so it takes twice as long to microwave a lean cuisine or other frozen entrees."
"Works well. Looks great on kitchen counter but the overly plasticky front (even the handle is plastic) turns me off. We'll keep it, but you should be advised it is not all metal. As for the fire hazard, we simply unplug it when not in use."
"I loved this when I first got it. But I quickly found out that the low wattage will not cook much. I could not cook any of my frozen things properly. Cooking things longer than normal does not help. You need the extra power. It's great for warming up, but not cooking."
I got this because I thought it would be easier for my sister to use because she is blind and it was. The only problem is that it doesn’t pop popcorn very well. I’ve burnt several bags despite trying different adjustments and it shouldn’t do that …have to be careful
"Its pretty and looks nice on my counter, but there are things I don't like. You have to set the time in 10 second increments. It shuts off during the defrost cycle, so you can "" turn the food."" It's very light weight and moves around."
I bought this microwave for my office. I do not like the buttons as they are really hard to read. It also takes forever to heat anything up. I believe that my Betty Crocker mini bake oven had more power. I really only use this to reheat coffee and maybe food that has gotten cold while I'm working. So I'm not cooking frozen meals or anything like that. This cannot be your only microwave. You are paying for looks and not function.
"It consistently stops cooking in the middle of whatever cook time is set and the screen reads FAIL. In order to reset, the unit must be unplugged and plugged back in, which then will restart at 30 seconds of cook time and the stop/cancel button doesn’t work to make it stop.I’ve had this issue periodically since I purchased it but since it was sporadic, it didn’t bother me too much. It’s now happening every time I attempt to cook something. I purchased protection through Assurion but since it’s still under manufacturer warranty, they pointed me to Galanz to resolve. I’ve reached out to the manufacturer, we’ll see what they do!"
"It’s small enough to work in my office (which is why I bought it). Super disappointed that it came with a dent on the side. Still seems to work fine, so I won’t go through the hassle of returning."
Stopped heating after 1 mo.Stopped heating
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This item makes a sound when I turn it on.It sounds like a fan hitting something. I am going to return it.
"We got it for the distinctive red styling.  But, the sides are Orange, and it very clearly doesn't match the front.  It might be an OK microwave, but the build quality seemed very poor.  returned."
"While I love the retro look of this microwave in my kitchen, I realize its design ignores functionality. The shaft is so wobbly that it—along with the too-small roller ring—may allow a dish being heated to slide awkwardly here and there, making enough racket that I notice and hurriedly rescue a hot dish of bowl of oatmeal before it ricochets off an oven wall and dumps over.UPDATE: The original roller ring shifted around, destabilizing the whole plate/roller ring/shaft relationship. I replaced it with a more substantial one, which appears to better support the glass plate. While the shaft remains wobbly, I can securely use the oven."
"Almost exactly a year ago I bought this microwave.  It's been good all year, but a few weeks ago it started making a strange noise, and yesterday there was a flash fire inside the unit while I was heating some water.  I immediately unplugged it and will be replacing it with some other product that hopefully lasts longer and is less dangerous."
"It started showing FAIL errors like the other reviewers called out but after a month it is turning itself on and added time.  By itself!  I just saw it malfunction myself.If I wasn't home this could easily have started a fire.  This is a classic review bait and switch where they sell a good product for a while and swap it out with trash, and yet it keeps the 5 star reviews."
I loved this microwave but now 6 months later it stopped heating up my food!!!! Now I have to go thru all this crap for a piece it needs.Why pay for a product that is going to stop working in 6months waste of my money!!!
"It’s super cute, but that’s about it for the good qualities. I bought this microwave 2.5 years ago, and it’s stopped working properly. It’s not holding up in appearance either. There are spots on the inside of the microwave where the paint has started to chip off and rust.  Everytime I close the door lately it will automatically turn itself on. So I just keep closing and opening the door until it finally stops. This happens even when it has no cook time set and without me hitting start. I contacted the company and I was told the warranty is only good for one year. They then referred me to their repairs company. The repairs people informed me that counter microwaves don’t have any repairs services or parts offered. They only offer services for the over the range microwaves. These little ones are basically trash when they stop working. Two and a half years use out of an appliance before trashing it, is do do in my book. Do better Galanz."
"So I bought this to run with EB70 Bluetti which has a rate output of 800 watts. This microwave requires 1100watts to run, the microwave output is 700 watts.  If it was advertised as per the manual specifications, I would not have made this purchase."
"I have written 3 product reviews in my life... So I have to feel strongly about something to leave a review. I've also owned several microwaves over the last 40 years, so enough to compare! First, the one positive: the only positive aspect of this microwave is that it gives you the option to silence it. That's it... Here are the reasons I would advise anyone looking to NOT buy it: 1) The clock does not hold its time. It's weird, I can't explain it. If I do anything on the number or command pad beyond pressing the Express Cook buttons - there's a real risk that the clock will zero itself out. I don't even set it anymore. 2) It just ""blanks out"" randomly. It usually happens if I try to enter in a cook time, or a cook time and a power level. For instance: I want to cook something for 45 seconds. Or I want to cook something for 3 minutes on 90% power... Forget it. Sometimes it works fine, but a good 25% of the time it blanks out. 3) The buttons are hard to push, to a surprising degree. I saw this mentioned in reviews I read before buying it and thought it was silly. It is not silly.  It's surprisingly annoying. So often jabbing the buttons trying to get just the right spot, until it registers. 4) Sometimes when I hit an Express Cook button - it just makes a click and does nothing. 5) Sometimes I go to heat something - the fan turns on, but the microwave doesn't heat, at all. This can happen in a variety of settings, there is no predicting it. 6) Lastly, and this is just an observation - either due to the wattage or the variability of the microwave's performance overall - it frequently totally toasts popcorn. Even at 80% power level.  I dislike this microwave so much that if it weren't environmentally unsound, and if the machine didn't cost so much to replace with another model, I would gladly chuck it into a canal."
"This review is for the TOSHIBA ML-EM45P(BS) Countertop Microwave Oven. I shopped for a new microwave for several days before deciding to give this one a try. The biggest reason I ordered this one was because of how much the price jumps when looking at anything better than this model. Unfortunately it seems that all of them have reliability issues now, so I wanted to spend less because I feel like I will have to replace it more often.This microwave is fairly basic with some annoying features. I like that it has 1200 watts and the door just pulls open. I also like the turntable, but that's where what I like ends. So, here's a list of Cons:-The control panel is difficult to see and not very responsive due to button activation zones being small and not well centered (Note: I did peel the protective covering off, so that's not the issue.)-The menu/control functions are not convenient in any way-Pressing the numbers 1 through 6 will automatically run it for that many minutes, so you have to press a different button before you start in order to actually cook for a certain amount of time or to change what they call the power setting (which is 95% of what I do, so it's really inconvenient)-On occasion when I accidentally double tap the start button it wipes out whatever I've programmed and just runs the microwave for 30 seconds at 100% power (not good)-The microwave is very noisy with lots of popping and clicking sounds as the magnetron comes on and goes off. Sometimes I have to check to make sure what I'm cooking isn't splattering all over and I'm somewhat relieved when I figure out it's just this noisy oven.-The turntable does not rotate a full turn in X seconds, so you cannot just use even time increments to have items stop at their starting point-The rotate to starting point feature is required because of the above, but it is annoying and time consuming to have to wait for it each time! My old microwave didn't have this and it worked perfectly because the turntable rotated once every 10 seconds, easy peasy!-Sometimes the rotate feature loses track of where home is and just keeps rotating until you press the stop button. How long would it run if you were not watching it?-The power setting is a lie! You are not adjusting the power output; you are adjusting the amount of time the power output is at 100% to a fraction of the time you input on the time setting. Running it at 100% power for 30% of the time is like 1970s technology and causes everything I try cooking to splatter all over the place, heat unevenly, and ruin the flavor. Even my daughter said food does not taste as good in this new microwave.-Sometimes I notice the power is not working at 100% when I press one of the X minute preset buttons of 1 through 6. This is frustrating because there is no indication it isn't going to be using ""High"" power when you press the button, but you can clearly hear the power cycle on and off during the cook time as if you've entered 90% power.-The rubber feet keep the microwave from sliding around, but they also mark up my counter tops when it does manage to moveFor what it is worth, I paid $149.99 for this microwave when I ordered it. I was expecting a lot more, so the disappointment is real. My old microwave was made in 2008, was cheaper, and ran circles around this model, but it died after 15 years of loyal service. The very basic functionality of this device, poor control panel, and quirky computer all scream this should be a sub $100.00 unit. During the first 30 days I kept hoping this microwave would fail so I could send it back for a refund, but it didn't so I'm stuck with it.I definitely do not recommend this Toshiba microwave and I would not order it again. Next time I'll just pay the extra and get another Inverter microwave from a better brand.Update: Another Con I forgot to mention... Once you press the Start button there is absolutely no indication of what power level this microwave is cooking your food at. There should be some indication of that. My 2008 microwave had it and so did the microwave I had before that one. Like I said, this microwave isn't very current on the technology it uses."
"There’s a lot to like, and also, a lot to hate about this microwave.The Good: Peace and quiet1.  It’s silent if you want it to be.  No beeping at all.  No beeps even when you hit buttons.  Unlike other microwave manufacturers, Toshiba gets that most consumers don’t want the beeping.  If they do, they want it to be minimally intrusive.  You don’t need five long, loud beeps when one short beep is sufficient.2.  It runs very quiet.  It’s easily the quietest microwave I’ve ever had.  It’s hard to tell when a job has been completed, but I will take silence any day over loud beeping.3.  It has one nice feature in the interface, and just one.  As the microwave is running, you can add 30 seconds to the job simply by hitting a button once.The Bad: The interface is a mess.1.  Except for that one nice feature, the interface is horrible.  Who designed this?  The way they’ve marked the buttons makes no sense.  I’m always hitting the wrong buttons.  For instance, the button for starting the microwave is entitled “Power Level.” You’d think that button would be prominent, easy to find, and have color.  But no, the only button like that is the “Stop/Cancel” button.  For weeks—before I had any coffee in the morning—I’d intuitively hit the Stop button thinking it was the Start button.  Both buttons appear to be one button, but they’re actually two buttons, four altogether.  You have to learn how the buttons are mismarked and that what doesn’t look like a button actually is.  Googling this model shows that it has an alternative interface panel with a big green button for Start and a big red button for Stop.  Wish I had received that version.2.  The buttons are hard to successfully hit.  The panel is flat which makes it difficult to know whether an attempt to hit a button was successful.  There are no little bubble things underneath the buttons.  Half the time, I push them hard and nothing happens.  This becomes problematic when trying to set a specific number of seconds.  To do that, you have to hit “Cook Time” first.  You can’t just punch in the number and hit the start button.  So when I hit “Cook Time,” and punch in the number of seconds, it automatically starts running for 1, 2, or 3 minutes.  That’s what happens when you think you’ve hit “Cook Time” but didn’t.  Then I have to hit the Stop button and do it all over again.  This happens almost every time I try to set it for a specific number of seconds. The interface panel is a mess.3.  Occasionally, the interface fails to work at all.  The only way to fix that is a reboot—unplug the microwave for a few seconds and plug it back in.So for the interface, I give it zero stars.  It actually deserves less than zero.  But the ability to easily turn off ALL noise is 5 stars.  So I’m giving it 3.  Would be 5 if the interface was just halfway decent."
"It's a microwave and it works. It arrived undamaged and quickly. So it gets points for that. However, it has ""features"" which I feel could be better designed or at least better described. Mute Function: To enable, hold the ""5"" for 3 seconds. It will BEEP LOUDLY to let you know you did that. What is the point of mute function that makes noise? I had hoped the mute function would be active for one cooking cycle and then go back to default. It doesn't work like that. Turn Table Feature: There is no indication that I can find that this feature is enabled or not. It's the same button and the same beep to enable or disable. What's the point of a feature that I don't even know if I'm using? Could be useful features but I'll never use them because the user feedback is terrible and I think this could have at least been communicated better. To be fair, it heats up food which is the main point so I'm keeping it."
Good items but noises start up complicated to use not simple to use other than a warm up
"I bought this back in December of 21, finally decided to can it because of the issues.Overall it did what it was supposed to for a little while but a year ago it started doing this thing where it acts like the time is up when you push start followed by long beeps and a blank screen. I would have to open the door, shut it and start again. Considering how much I paid for this thing I kept hanging in there but it recently stopped heating altogether. Yep, I'm done.With that being said two things I want to mention; I'm glad the issues happened because I realized that I don't really need a microwave for ""COOKING"" as I've been doing more healthier stuff. I'm probably going to get a cheaper smaller one that takes up a smaller footprint for less essential things.Second, if you're anything like me and follow trends; it seems this is a ongoing problem consumers are having with electronic products across the board. It works good for a minute and then gives up the ghost. Why should I have to purchase an extended warranty to keep a microwave around?Just some incite to help you make a informed decision, thanks."
It's on the smaller side but easy to use
The product didn't arrive when I ordered it. Have tried this product before and I Liked it
"I had a Toshiba Microwave for more than 30 years so I thought it was a safe choice to buy another.  This one seemed great at first – much faster than the old one with more features.  But soon I started noticing occasional quirks where it just wouldn’t cook at full power.  Ie: you could press 4 which should be 4 minutes at full power, but you could hear it cycling on and off and pressing power displayed that it was cooking at power level 8.  I tried various theories to try to reliably get power level 10, but never found a consistent way.Even explicitly setting the cook time and the power level didn’t work as the microwave would simply replace your choice with its choice once the cooking cycle began.  This happens with manual cooking as well as memory presets.  One day, you can use memory 1 to slow coat some oatmeal, but another day, you’ll come back to a cold bowl of oats and water.  Run memory 1 again and it may or may not cook on the second time.  Two days ago, after 3 memory 1 cycles in a row failed, I transferred the oats to the range.  The next day, memory 1 worked the first time.  Today it did not.  Today it struggled to even get 50ml of water to boil at “full power” (which wasn’t full because it was cycling).  Tomorrow, who knows?It has a few other surprising quirks as well.  The buttons under the panel are a little flakey and you have to hit some of them a little off-center  (vs the labels) to activate them.  The “5” is especially hard to reliably activate.  Amazing that simple things like this worked fine on the 30-year-old model.On the plus side, it is lighter, cheaper, and more powerful (when it decides to run in full power) but the 30-year-old one didn’t have to be watched all the time to see if it was actually cooking as set."
"I gave this microwave a 3 star for three specific reasons, but it otherwise appears to be generally an attractive, solid unit at a reasonable price.The major downer is that the control panel pressure points are a mystery at best. They require too much pressure and the pressure point is not accurately centered. I made the problem livable with a pink eraser. You know, the kind for your kids in school or the office, trapezoid in shape. Anyway, I use it to press the finger area. I have to press a little harder than I would like, but with a bit of usage, I have no problem. It seems to hit the sweet spot without much more effort.Another downer, the ECO mode is nonsense. There are no instructions, no explanation and you can't tell whether it is on or off. I researched it on the internet and my opinion was affirmed.The third was an annoyance. All these companies seem to give lousy internal dimensions. They don't note whether they include the 'curvature' depth/ with or not. Thus the interior on this one was not larger than another because one included the extra space and one didn't. I could get ugly about this but, oh well.I like very much that I can turn on and off the 'finish cooking' ding-ding. But it is fussy and not a simple on/off. I just leave it off. The handle adjustment feature works well, so that's a plus, I guess. It takes a few seconds to adjust, so grab and go isn't encouraged if your life is a whirlwind.Overall, I wouldn't buy this model again despite the good price. It works well enough and fits its location to not be worth the effort to return and do more research. On the other hand, I expect I will replace it within a year or two whether it needs it or not.Good Luck!"
"I've had this for over a year and still don't like it. Panel hard to read, most programs useless.  I miss my 13 year old Sharp!  I won't buy Toshiba again as it is inferior to Sharp."
What is it with spending good money on a product only to have it quit working after 13 and change months?
I'm not too happy right now.  I've had it just over a week or so. I find that the timing is way off from my old Sharp.  3 strips of turkey bacon used to take exactly 2 min 20 seconds.  Now it burns to a crisp by 2 minutes. The containers are a lot hotter than the old one. The numbers are very hard to see. They are black on black and hard to push on. Maybe there is a trick that I haven't figured out just yet as to how to get the oven to start by pushing the button just once to get it started. I don't know how hard to clean yet as I haven't had the occasion to do so yet. The microwave pizza is hard when I use the time specified on the box it came in. It's also louder than the old one and it sounds like it cycles rather than just hearing a steady sound. The manual is written in very poor English so it's a bit confusing as to what it is actually telling you to do. It was probably written by someone without a command of the English language who didn't realize how confusing their writing was.  I'll either get used to it in a month of use or I'll be so discouraged that I'll try to return it.  I don't know how hard it is to return something this big to Amazon as I haven't done it before.
"I purchased this last October and have had it less than a year obviously. It's been about 8 to 9 months at this point. It began to spark inside when cooking food and was making a toxic smell at the same time, I cleaned it and tried it again and it did the same thing.Toshiba has refused to honor the warranty. I have never in my life had a microwave do something like this, which means that the quality here is really bad from Toshiba...you want a microwave from a company that honors their warranty, which is not the case here.Their support will look for anything possible to wiggle out of a warranty claim.I supplied photos as requested and one of the first replies during our back and forth chain of communication was that she noticed a small dent on the side of the unit, something which you would only notice if you zoomed in at least 500% in a photo program to see it. I know this as I double checked the photo and had to use that zoom to see it myself.This is one of many many nitpicks which had nothing to do with the malfunction of the unit, but, was clearly a attempt to build a case to deny honoring the warranty.I know that my next microwave will be any brand but a Toshiba, their lack of support has lost me as a customer for good."
"First off, it's very large, and requires a specific amount of space on all sides. This is good and bad, good because it's very deep and can accommodate most large meals, or family size frozen dinners. Bad because, well, it takes up a lot of space, and gets hot in certain areas.  The worst thing about it is the keyboard, tiny font, no backlight, and is very difficult to see what you're doing unless it's directly lit, that part is aggravating! The way the door opens and closes without a soft method, like a button on the handle, or on the front, is really getting irritating because it's a HARD close, every time. For a microwave with a feature that quiets the end of session timer, it's loud as hell to shut, very weird. It cooks extremely well though, and I do like how a cup handle returns to where you put it when you warm coffee, or something hot. I fit had a backlight, or doubled the font used on the only way to interact with it, I'd give it 4 stars, it really is incredibly annoying, and that's unfortunate for something that does it's job so well."
"I am returning the oven after one day.  The keyboard buttons were very hard to press, so hard it moved the oven itself, and often I had to use the other hand to brace the oven just to press a button.  Some of the buttons seemed not to be centered and I had to press them ""nearby"" and not in the middle of the button.  The sound OFF button did not work.  I could not change the power while the oven was mid-cycle.  Had to stop and start over.  The OFF button, the most important, was very iffy and often did not respond.  I read another review that said the buttons were ""off-center.""  Also, my first impression was that the keypad's numbers and buttons were too small.  Not like my GE.  Also, two of the buttons had shared functions, that is, they did two things, as if Toshiba wanted to save money.  It is so hard to buy a microwave online. A shot in the dark.  Reviews don't help.  People are so complimentary.  You never know why.  But I'd suggest you read all the negative comments thoroughly to see if there is a pattern.  You'll soon know what to believe.  You will notice that many microwaves have many one- or two-star ratings.  It's as if the manufacturing of microwaves has sunk to a new low.  I have to shop for  another new one ... and thank god Amazon makes it so easy to return.  Next week I'll order the new one and cross my fingers. Maybe a Panasonic.  Maybe a GE.  Many brands don't let you turn the sound OFF.  Would you believe that? My GE had 3 different sound levels, and also OFF.  And it was only 160 dollars 9 yrs ago.  Oh, another thing ... the first few tests to boil water were successful but I smelled an electric ozony or new-wire odor.  Worried me a bit, tho it was probably okay???  It was otherwise a nice looking oven, rather solid, and was packaged very carefully."
"It either overcooks or undercooks food, which is frustrating. I also noticed that it heats unevenly, leaving some parts of the food cold. Not impressed!"
"A microwave is used lightly at our home, basically to reheat dinner plates, soften butter or once in a great while defrost meat.That said, just a few days past the return window it started making horrible, loud grinding noises.We contacted the Toshiba customer service department and were given a list of things they required to approve our case is in fact a product problem.We did everything we could, sent everything they requested only to be emailed that we needed to redo half the things. We live very rural and our internet/cell service is bare minimum. We accommodated them and dealt with them by phone a few times.We are on day 3 of dealing with Toshiba and are still waiting for a response to know if they’re going to stand behind their faulty product or not.With the cost of everything nowadays, losing nearly $200.00 is a hit to the budget.We bought this microwave because we’ve purchased Toshiba products for years, been happy with them and never had a problem like this.We’re very unhappy with the lack of them standing behind their product."
No popcorn button
"Start off with, yes it functions and it cooks well, had it over a year now with little problems.My issues are that half the buttons on the microwave are just for looks, I bought the microwave because it has a mute function, but the mute button doesn't actually work. Buttons 7 - 9 don't work, and you mute by ""holding down the 8 button"". Also you can't just the wattage or power, as there's no option to change wattage, and the ""power"" button that it says is for adjusting power level doesn't work, and if it did you'd only be able to change it from 10 to 60 or 100% because again, buttons 7, 8, and 9 don't work."
You would think that anyone producing a microwave oven would know; 1) how to design a keypad and 2) how to write a user manual in English.  Toshiba fails on both counts.  This is a first impression.  Functionally he heats and spins - no issue there - but I'm only into my third day.  But the front display is barely readable keypad - with dark lettering on a dark background - requires a bright light.  Forget trying to hit the right button in a nim morning light.  Turning to the instructions - laughable - must have used a Google translator because you can barely understand what the instructions are saying - how long have they been selling into the US market????
"The microwave arrived today on time. However, all four legs are loose and wobbly. It does not sit level on the countertop because one leg is a little shorter than the others. I contacted Amazon and was asked if I had contacted the manufacturer. Therefore, I reached out via email and have not heard from them yet. I do not wish to return the microwave. If possible, I just want to know if the legs can be replaced. Waiting to hear from someone. I'm hoping to resolve this without the trouble of having to return the microwave. Once my problem with the legs has been resolved, I will change my rating and give an update on it."
"So, first of all, it took a long time to get here and when it came it was in a beat up box with no manual. The manual is important on this one because the buttons are not standard. I found the manual online, but it was written in odd English, that means translated from Chinese? to English without really understanding the English language. I can't figure out if the features on this work or not because some things work and some things do not without extra steps such as figuring out which power is on. You can't just push a button and have it work, which is what most of us are used to. The power level is important because if you can't access it then your food gets overcooked, which is what I experienced. I am considering returning it, which is always a hassle."
"This is the nicest microwave I have ever purchased.  I don't know what the sensors are doing, but it doesn't heat up very well at all along with being noisy it was a bad buy for me. It's nothing like the advertisement that I saw but I realized I couldn't send it back when I tore up the box, so I'm stuck with it, but I would never buy another Toshiba."
"I have had this microwave for about four months now.  I started having some trouble with it after the first two months of use.  It works, but frequently needs to be unplugged and plugged back in, and to have the clock re-set.  Sporadically, it will click when activated, but won’t run – and the display goes blank, and the keypad becomes unresponsive for several seconds.  When it reactivates, the clock displays “00:00” and has to be re-set.  On a couple of occasions, when turning on power, the power runs intermittently, even though a lower power setting was not selected.  The electronics seem to have some “bugs” in them.  Whether I just got a “lemon”, or whether this model has inherent flaws, I don’t know.  Too late to return it.  I do know that I will avoid Toshiba microwaves in the future.ADDENDUM: It is now six months since purchase, and the problems continue.  The most recent quirk; the cook timer counts down one second every three seconds!  I may have to trash this microwave and replace it with one that is more reliable.ADDENDUM: Still having the original problems, and now the microwave has started making rumbling/rattling noises.  It's time to trash it and look for something better.  What a waste of money!"
"I bought this Microwave in November of last year. It is now September and we are having issues with it. I've never really got a hang of all those many settings and ways to cook on it. Now, when you put in one minute and thirty seconds it takes it as one hour and thirty minutes. A little disappointed in this microwave but plan to unplug it to see if it resets itself."
"I purchased this microwave used as new. I have done it several times and am usually very happy with the purchase. This however is not good, to me anyway. The front has a dent in it and it was filthy with greasy fingerprints all over the front and number pad. The instructions were not included as with any other original warranty and product information! The box was in fairly bad shape as well. This has NOT been an even reasonable experience!!"
"We bought this microwave in 2020 and it worked great the first few years, like a good ole microwave should. We are in year 3 now and it has been acting up, not heating evenly or the light will come on randomly after shutting the door, or the light will come on and the microwave will start humming and turning the plate as if it was started after closing the door. Lately it’s been overheating or under heating food or just not working in general."
"It works fine, but it is noisy when it's operating/cooking. I was surprised. That is a fault. Be warned, shopper. Maybe you'll get a quiet one. IDK I'd consider returning it, if it wasn't so heavy. The keypad is hard to see b/c it's so dark. Very hard to see. That's common for microwaves, I know. It's a ubiquitous design flaw. Microwave control panels need to be backlit. Also, the keys are too small and too dang close together!If you get noise-endued headaches or have less than 20/20 vision, skip this microwave."
The microwave is not level. Can't adjust the feet.  So we put something under the short leg to make it level.One occurence of the microwave's exterior getting hot.  Waiting to see if it does it again to investigate whether the microwave should be returned. Microwave purchased 08-04-23.
"Loud. Also, stop button is orange, not the start button. So that took time to get used to. I think the start button should be visually different.After 6 months, the plastic over the buttons started to bubble. Looks terrible.1.5 year update: still unimpressed with this microwave. Somehow one of the little feet broke off (no, we didn't move, so I have no clue how this happened). Also the buttons look terrible. Never buying a Toshiba microwave again. See second photo."
"It cooks OK.  However the glass tray rattles very loudly when it is rotating.  I have tried all sorts of remedies.  Nothing wrong with the roller ring either.  What works the best is a few layers of paper between the rotor and plate. Still rattles but not as loudly.I shouldn't have to do this.TOTALLY INEXCUSABLE.And when I say loud - I mean LOUD !It's like, when they were designing this thing, they went to the existing parts bin and chose parts that don't quite fit.  The spindle used to turn the tray has so much free play between it and the tray that it WILL cause it to rattle.  I'm having to ""pad"" the spindle with folded up paper and the dang thing STILL RATTLES!!Do people who design these things ever USE these things?Toshiba really disappointed on the design of this unit.Addendum - After much experimentation, I finally got the glass tray out of the old unit that it was replacing.  I put that tray into the Toshiba and the sound went away.  The older tray is an inch or so less in diameter but that is OK.  Comparing the two trays side by side, it is quite evident that the casting on the newer tray is too large for the spindle drive.  The older tray fits tighter and luckily is noise-free.My advice is to NOT get rid of your old microwave.  It came in handy for me.Still inexcusable.Addendum 2 - now eight months later the door glass is fogging up. Not on the outside. Not on the inside. But between the layers of glass where it cannot be be reached to be wiped off.WHAT A TOTAL HUNK OF WORTHLESS JUNK!!BUYER BEWARE!!"
"Yourself to cook a few time; and, then stopped heating the food. Probably better for cooking food on the appliance top since that was the only place which got hot!"
terrible microwave oven. Was loud and vibrated from the beginning. I should have returned it. 9 months later it takes longer and longer to heat anything. I assume it will die soon. Also the clock has stopped working. don't waste your money
"I've had this microwave for about 3 weeks. It recently started changing the power level from 10 to 8 on its own for some reason and I don't know why. There's nothing in the manual about this, and the Toshiba website only offers technical support for laptops and TVs. I've had trouble cooking store-bought refrigerated mashed potatoes to where they're not watery."
"I bought a $169.99 TOSHIBA ML-EM45P(BS) Countertop Microwave Oven, 1.6 Cu.ft with 13.6"" Turntable, 1200W, FREE Shipping & FREE Returns. See https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081T6GZZF/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&th=1 about Dec. 29th, 2022. I used it regularly, mostly to cook meat, without problems until March 28. It started making a loud humming noise that I had never heard before. A few minutes later I noticed dark grey smoke pouring out of it. I unplugged it and intend to return it ASAP.. I think that it has a one year warranty so I'll just request a replacement and hope that it will last longer.On March 31, 2023 the seller (TOSHIBA) wrote: ""We are pleased to inform you that your refund has been approved. Please expect delivery within 10-14 business days.""As of April 21 NO REFUND CHECK HAS BEEN RECEIVED.

Every call takes too much time. I asked them to send me a replacement check that I can track. For many years the US Post office has been delivering mail to the wrong addresses in my area. Nothing can be done about it."
"Nice microwave, good size, easy to use, but bit the dust after only 18 months.  They just don’t make things to last anymore. 😢"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This worked well for about six months, but is now struggling to spin."
"The microwave is fine except I wish the numbers and letters were larger.  My only complaint was the delivery.  It was shipped USPS and they couldn’t fit it into our mailbox……. We had to go to our post office and pick it up.  We are in our 80s, so not so easy to do."
It stopped working after 40 days from the date of purchase and it was rarely  used. Turns off even after 30 seconds.
"This microwave had to have been dropped.  The wheeled the microwave plate sits on arrived broken, and makes a bad sound when cooking anything!"
The microwave works fine.  The problem is the clock frequently reverts to 000 when I set a microwave time and press the power button.  It is extremely annoying.  I probably reset the clock 3-4 times a day.
"I bought this microwave 5 months ago and it absolutely sucks. It makes a lot of noise and it lacks power. If Amazon would allow me to return it, I would return it immediately. Do not waste your money on this microwave."
"The clear cover that is put over the keypad area has started to buckle on the start button. The button still works, but it is unsightly to look at. Bought the microwave at the end of November for a new home we were taking possession of in January. So it was in the box until the first part of January. We aren't even to the end of February and this has happened. We are empty nesters, so it doesn't get a ton of use. Irritating to have an essentially new appliance that looks so unsightly!"
"I decided to change brands, I've had Panasonic for the last 20 years, and I see now that that was the wrong thing to do. I had an inverter oven and the inverter went out, so I decided to get one without the inverter. The food cooks very unevenly, so I'm having to turn food over halfway through the cooking. Not only that, but the control panel is horrid. They are not buttons, the panel is flat, but half the time I have to push several times to get the number to come up. The panel is not at all sensitive, quite the opposite, you have to push and push to get it to work. I will never buy another Toshiba microwave, and I will go back to the inverter oven next time."
Arrived with the turntable roller broken. You would have thought that I was asking for a new microwave instead of a cheap piece of plastic! One and done!
"Microwave works well, the issue is that every time I need to do something simple, I have to read the instructions. Most microwaves have a popcorn button. Not this one. It is about as complicated as it gets. How about setting a timer? Forget about it. Back to the manual I go. Where is the start button. Nope, not happening. You have to decipher which one it is. Want to cancel something. Go read the manual. I am smarter than the average bear and this microwave is impossible to figure out."
"I am really dissapointed when my microwave came. The dimensions are not what is described. The depth is 2"" shorter than what is described. Supposed to be almost 18"" deep and it came as only 16"" deep."
Not dependable. It malfunctions way too often. I would not buy it again.
"There are several false claims floating in the Internet that Toshiba microwaves are made in America. This one was made in Guang Dong, China.  I needed to replace  a old faithful Panasonic microwave that would be rated 1200 watts and fit in a horizontal space 21.5 "" wide so I had to settle for this Toshiba model. The previous 1200 watt Panasonic adequately heated 20 ounces of coffee in 1 minute but this Toshiba requires 1.5 minutes to come to the same temperature.  The control panel design is an embarrassment to the art and has a weird glitch in the software at the ""1"" selection when in quick mode; most of the time when I punch 1 for 1 minute it does 1 minute but it erratically does 3 minutes so I now have to pause and monitor that selection  to avoid boil overs or food damage.Update: 1year and 3 months after purchase the magnetron died."
"In general this microwave worked ok.  It had nice features and was easy to run and clean, but it often had problems.  Sometimes it just wouldn't work or would switch to a different power level on its own.  I often had to unplug it, wait, then plug it back in for it to reset.  Eventually, it just DIED after 3 years of light use.  I strongly feel a microwave should work better than that.  NO, I would not buy this microwave again and do not recommend it."
"I bought this for my daughter and her family because hers was damaged in a house fire on 11/8.  They lost everything!  This appliance is dented.  The box was not dented, but the content was.  Very disappointed.Shame on the seller and manufacturer."
"First of all, the instructions are not very good, but honestly I should have had to use them.  A good microwave is pretty intuitive to operate for the most part.  I am still trying to figure out the programmed defrost/cooking settings.  Second of all, the buttons are not clearly delineated and sometimes I will accidently activate the button below the one I intended to be pressing or (more annoying) nothing happens at all, because I have not pressed in precisely the center of an un-outlined button on a completely flat surface.That being said, I like the size of the interior of the microwave, it is aesthetically pleasing and cooks appropriately once the right buttons are pressed."
"right out of the box the clock wouldn't set and you must push hard on the touch key pads to get them to work. some times when you press the 1 the 4 setting will come on , and yes the clear plastic film covering the key pads was removed . I was going to send it back, but mom said their all made in china and we needed a microwave oven so we kept it."
"As soon as i plugged it in, it turned on.  The only way tobturn it off was to either unplug it or open the door.  Returning it."
This is a nice looking microwave but it has a rumbling sound when you heat something up no idea why. At least it hasnt blown up yet
The most obvious thing was noise coming from the right side when the microwave was running.  I opened the case and repositioned the fan cowl.  It has been ok for a couple of days.  The continuing aggravation is the keypad.  The buttons are hard to push.  They are sensitive to position and press firmness.  I had an old microwave that lasted 25 years.  It was easy to use.  Key time and press start.  Big buttons.  Oh well...
"This was a terrible, terrible, purchase.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  Less than a year old, but of course beyond the short-term warranty, I was heating up some leftovers on a simple two-minute, push-the-2-button, cycle.  Partway through, I heard silence, thinking ""Has it been two minutes already?""  Ordinarily, it beeps 5 times at the end of the cycle, and there had been no beeps, just silence.  I looked at it, and the screen was blank and dark.  Opened the door, the light did not go on; dark, though bulb was close to new.  No re-set button that I could find.  The microwave had not been moved, bumped, disconnected, etc., to cause such an event or effect its performance like this, in any way.  The unit is nothing more than a ""boat anchor"" at this point, and I still have to dispose of it; it weighs a ton.  I will never buy another Toshiba product, again, the risk is just too great based on this adverse experience. I'd give this product a ""0"" Review, if that was even possible."
"Control panel is pretty useless, small font, hard to see unless you shine a bright light on it, and even when you’re able to see it, it’s confusing to use…!"
"The smart sensor often miscalculates cooking times, leaving food either undercooked or overcooked. The position memory turntable is also inconsistent, which affects even heating."
"it works like a microwave should ....  but despite the fact that it was in 3 layers of boxes and Styrofoam it arrived with the foam busted and dent ... i have a cabinet that is made for it.... so dent is not visible ... and so far the microwave works great ... but only had it for 2 days ... the dent is 1/2 inch deep along top, pushing out the side 1/2 and 3 inches long, but does not effect how the machine works ... they could do better on their packing choices .."
"The first one we ordered arrived with damage to the top metal.  The replacement unit we ordered arrived, and we try using it for a couple of days.  The size of the numbers on the controls are very small, and had to be pressed very hard for them to work.  I fought with it for a few days and gave up when it took me 4 or 5 tries to get anything entered.  It also started making some loud noises in use, so we returned that unit for a refund."
The time cook button and power level button were not easy to use.  I thought it would last longer than  2 1/2  years.
"PROS:It's a microwave and it seems to work at a level that matches its power rating.It's sleek looking and isn't loud.It has a rotating plate and always comes back to the same place.CONS:The buttons are terrible and difficult to use.  They are off-center; pressing squarely on the number on the button, nothing happens.  You have to aim 1/4in (3mm) off.  Very annoying, do not buy, (or plan on peeling the sticker off and re-centering it).  I'm not the only one with this complaint, so they may be a common problem.The beep alert for the microwave process completing is long and quite loud.  This might work for you.Final say:Buy a different product unless you are ready to compensate for the poorly-aligned buttons for as long as this microwave lasts."
"I bought this as an open box customer return. It was rated Like New by Amazon.5 weeks after installation, it failed. (The light would come on, the table would spin, and the counter did the countdown properly - BUT no heating at all.So I reached out to Toshiba for warranty service. After several days of wasted time, I was contacted and told that they considered the item to be USED and was not covered by any Toshiba warranty. No partial credit - nothing...(Happily, Amazon made good on the failure, but be warned. If you buy refurbished Toshiba products, do it knowing they will not be there to warrant them.)As far as the oven itself, when it worked it worked OK. Nothing special. We did find the user interface to be rather awkward. (As a retired engineer, I cannot see much human factor work paid to this model.)"
I ordered this microwave which I liked but couldn't set clock called customer support and they said it was disfuctional so I returned it getting another one of the same model and it also was no good had to return both... 😬
"This microwave works great, has plenty of room, and is really quiet.  We love it. Update review.  This is the most aggravating microwave I have ever used.  It is constantly needing to be reset like a computer.  You have to unplug it or in my case throw the circuit breaker to reset.  Then it works fine for a while until you have to do it again.  I will not buy one like this one again"
I had this microwave just a little over a year and it started sparking as if medal Or something was in it and the company refused to fix or replace it. As a result if you purchase a product they will only honor it up to a year and their products only operate a year. I am very dissatisfied with this outcome I have received. I paid for an appliance to only operate a year.
Its like wanting a Cadillac and settling for a Mazda.  Clunky is best way to describe overall construction.  I get keeping costs reasonable but I wish someone would make premium versions of these products that have a bit more gusto.  Works as designed but would it kill anyone to light the key pad?
"One of the reasons I chose Toshiba was because it has the option of turning off the beeping noises that all microwaves make. I purchased this item, and the muting function did not work out of the box, and Toshiba technical support wasn’t able to resolve this. I returned the first purchase of this item that I made, and then ordered the same item, thinking that the first product was defective, but the muting function of the second one also didn’t work. So it seems that this is simply false advertising with regard to the muting function."
I really love this microwave but after only two months the covering over the numbers are coming off. See image. Guess I need to use that warranty.
"As microwaves go, it functions as you'd expect.  My complains are with the insensitivity of the membrane covering the buttons and how difficult it can be to actuate the button.  There's also the noise, I never expected it to be as loud.  It's possible that my placement with the rear against a half wall is amplifying the noise, but not that much.  I will say it's easy to clean."
One year and two weeks after purchase this microwave repeatedly went POP POP POP with sparks shooting inside. Smell of something burning. Always kept it clean and maintained. Very disappointing. It really is a beautiful microwave and worked great until this.
Bought Nov. 2022.  Interior paint began to crack and rust in less than 1 1/2 years of normal use.  Called Toshiba customer service and was told it was not covered under any warranty as it was a cosmetic failure.  Interesting that it might also be dangerous to cook with it but not their problem!  Don't buy this one if you expect it to last for a reasonable time and if you want good customer service to back up your purchase.
need this replaced asap or return to Amazon seller
"The film over the buttons is bubbling. It does not diminish the functionality obviously, but it’s definitely unattractive. It’d be great if your new microwave could look new for a few years+ but this happened a few months in. The buttons aren’t the easiest to push either. Other than these issues the product works well."
"i bought this microwave in the end of 2022, just a few months and i starts having problem. i warmed  up my food for 1 minutes. i opened the door r.to remove food, suddenly the light turned of and humming sounds started, it was a continuous sound until i unplug it. i left it out, did not want to take a chance to hear this humming sounds again."
too big heavy
"Control panel is non-illuminated, and is fairly hard to read unless you bend down to read the faintly labelled buttons.  Button presses require way too much pressure to operate, and the pressure used often causes a double entry when selecting the cook time in 30 second increments.  Pushing pressure on the buttons causes the whole oven to shift on the counter because the unit's feet are not non-skid type. Awkwardly worded instruction manual: an example is ""In waiting state, put the food in the oven, press the menu key in the sensor cook"".  A company that had $32 billion dollars in 2020 sales, can't hire a proofreader?  No complaints about cooking performance, but I won't buy this brand again."
We were so happy with this microwave that I purchased one for my daughter. I liked the button options and it was easy to clean. But that didn't last. 18 months later it died. And warranty is only 12 months. Very disappointed.
I kept using it thinking it would stop making the burning smell after it had a chance to brake in but it got worse. The only reason I bought it is because I thought Toshiba was made in Japan. It was made in China.I returned it and bought a Hamilton Beach. It works great.
I loved this microwave when it was new!  A year later and the turn mechanism for the plate wobbles and makes all kinds of scary noises. I made sure it was level too. I’ve been using it without the turntable but nothing cooks properly.Looking for a new one today.
I bought this Toshiba unit twice.  Each time it stopped working shortly after one year.  After the first failure I bought the Asurion warranty.  I would have expected a longer life since it is only used by my wife and me for reheating and defrosting.
"It seemed to work just fine. The door opening is small for 1.6 cf. (more like 1.2cf) Once you get past the door, the sides and back are recessed a bit, but is still seems like a 1.4 cf at max. I returned for a larger size."
I like the microwave except for the fact that there is no popcorn button.
"Amazon technical support/customer service were extremely helpful in trying to help with this issue.  The microwave did not work upon set up.  And after calls to Toshiba and Amazon tech support and them having me try different things to get it to work it was decided the heating element was damaged. Amazon did not have any more of this model to be able to replace so  Keisha G, from Amazon tech support got Toshiba on the phone to see what  they could do for me.  They told me to submit a receipt and serial # and they would replace the unit.  Now ONE WEEK week later Toshiba said that they would be sending me a refund ck...that they don't send out replacements.  That is NOT what they told me on the phone.  I guess I will have to look for a new microwave and it WON""T be a TOSHIBA.  But I cannot say enough good things about Amazon's effort of trying to resolve this issue.  No problem with Amazon on this review."
"This is generally speaking a nice microwave. The buttons are not very intuitive but you can learn them.The reason I am writing now is that yesterday, I smelled smoke, looked inside and saw dark gray smoke. Forgot about it and heated my lunch today. Same thing. It was/is not coming from anything being heated inside. Smells like insulation being burned by electrical wires.--So I have to start the process of dealing with it. Should be in warranty.Plan to provide followup on here later."
"This microwave has good reviews, but this unit has been the worst microwave I have owned.  The control panel does not match up with the numbers/quick keys, is loud and vibrates, display board will not keep time and resets constantly, and has needed to be unplugged and restarted5-6 times within a year to get it to work correctly.  I would not recommend this unit and would not buy again."
"It is impossible to set the clock on this microwave. Pressing the Clock/Timer button once puts the microwave into Timer mode not Set Clock mode as the manual says it should. If you look through the reviews, you will find over a dozen other customers reporting the same issue.My other complaint is the poor quality keypad. The labels do not line-up with the buttons, and they are difficult to depress. It looks and feels cheap. You will find this is the #1 complaint of most negative reviews.However, if you search for this exact model # (ML-EM45P) on other websites (Walmart for example) you will see that the keypad looks completely different from the one sold by Amazon. How is this possible? Is this the reason for all the keypad and clock problems? Something is not right here, and I will be buying appliances in-store from now on."
Ineffective
It is very hard to press in the keys on the Key pad.  The connection is made when area above the number is depressed.  It has taken me weeks to figure out how to comfortably use it.  It's as if the front of the key pad isn't lined up to the connection behind.
"I’ve had no issues with this microwave, but the buttons can be frustrating. They’re not sensitive, so you have to press quite hard. It also feels like the buttons aren’t aligned intuitively with the electronics behind the scenes. Would be 5 stars if buttons were better."
"It takes too long to heat food evenly, and the control panel is confusing to use. The build quality feels flimsy and unreliable."
"This is the worst microwave I have ever owned in my life. Terrible heating. Cook/heat food ridiculously uneven. One third is piping hot, one third warm and what’s left is cold. You can’t just turn on for not even a minute and expect your food to be heated. You gotta do 30 second intervals were you stop and stir constantly. Sometimes with this so called new technology, the changes they make suck. Hate I bought this thing. Should’ve just sent with my first instinct and bought a regular old fashioned microwave."
"Do not buy this microwave for anything over $75.00 dollars. For one thing it's not even made right. The metal shield that covers the sides and top is not molded right. It is lifted on the top right front and back corner. The keypad is not accurate, when you press the number you want sometimes the number next to it comes up, sometimes the keypad resets for no reason. The microwave is so light that every time you open up the door the microwave moves towards you. You have to open the door quickly or hold the microwave so it doesn't move. What manufacturer in their right mind uses hard plastic as feet to hold it in place, I guess a softer material to hold the microwave in place was more expensive. The only thing this unit does is heat food. If you can live with all the things I mentioned above then buy it, but don't pay more than $75.00 for it until they fix all the issues."
"The key pad is very insensitive. The tech support is not very knowledgeable. Not impressed by it's sensor cooking.But once one gets past this, it seems to work ok although I've only had it a few days.  I bought is for the wattage and price."
I love the look of it and it works really well. We all have a hard time when pressing the buttons. I feel like I have to keep touching the area and finally it clicks on. I would not purchase again.
This microwave may have been damaged in transit but there was nothing visible at delivery. Upon first use it was obvious there was a problem. It has loose sides and back panel vibrates and creates a really loud buzzing sound not like a normal microwave. I tried to send it back but the box had been thrown away.
"Works well so far. However, the buttons on control panel are very difficult to use. Except for the numbers, the activation areas for the buttons are very small and seem to be above the actual lettering on the button. You end up having to push and clear settings several times to get things right."
"I just received this yesterday and to my disappointment, it has no popcorn setting.  The control panel is so strange, no one can operate it without the manual.  For pop corn you have to press the auto button 6 times.  It's easier to just enter the cook time.  Did I say ""press""?  You have to jab hard to ""press"" any button!  Also, the control panel is so small and dim we had to use a flashlight to read it.  I am going to use it a few more times, but looks like it is going to have to go back.  I don't think I can operate it.  One more thing:  The manual is written in such poor English it is difficult to understand."
"I ordered it on August 27th 2024, received it on September 25th, a month later, and 5 days ago it started acting up.  I tried to use it and all the display lights turned on, every one of them, it beeped and the time reset to 1:00...There is a short somewhere and it keeps malfunctioning like this.  Total waste of time and money.  Plus, now there is no vendor listed to even contact, just my luck."
The microwave oven works fine but pressing the flat buttons is very hard. I struggle to open the door after I've struggled to press the stop button to release it.
The quality really cheap put together to be Rca it came unbalanced and don't have the bottom piece to even it out but it works for temporary I guess that's why I don't like doing online purchases it's like Forrest Gump said it's like a box of chocolates u never know what your gonna get
"all the labels on the actual microwave are in French, although the instruction booklet is in English.  If I wasn't so desperate, as I don't have a stove in my studio apartment, I would have tried to return it.  Makes it VERY difficult to use."
This was a gift for my daughter and she just called me to tell me that The oven is working but it was mishandled by the delivery guy and it has a big dent. She sent me these two pictures.
"I bought this to replace an older RCA microwave I had but am disappointed with this new model. While it is the same handy size as the older model, the interior dimensions are smaller, and I can no longer use microwave safe dishes that fit in my earlier microwave. Also, the turntable is very unstable and often jumps off the little wheeled ring which is very flimsy.  Being able to just hit one number for a quick heating cycle, the only options are whole and half minutes. At least 2 of the products I use regularly call for a time with a quarter minute."
For the price it’s a nice handy gadget in a guest bedroom
Works good but have to unplug to open once food is warm
I purchased this microwave for my father back in 2018. I was hoping this would last at least 12 years like our previous one. Quite disappointed that it no longer works. Heated food well.
Door is hard to open the inside panel separated from the door when I tried to open it
The one I have doesn’t heat up quickly the food
"Used it twice to microwave raw potatoes (l and 2 on 2nd try)  Glass plate shifts back and forth, side to side.  Have adjusted the plastic rotatingarm and each time, within 3-4 seconds, it is hitting all sides.  Called in twice to service call to ask why.  No help on lst call (9 pm at night)No real help on 2nd call at 8 a.m. Sounded like same person from week before; He couldn't understand what I meant by glass platebumping all sides; first said there was supposed to be a rubber ring - I said there wasn't, please send me one. He indicated withoutoriginal order blank (Amazon) order, shipping confirmation, full description of model, S#, etc. they couldn't/wouldn't help.  On internet,found reference to NOT removing a cardboard liner as it was MIC treated.  I had  found a piece of cardboard inside unit, holding the glasstray in place on a styrofoam packing.  Watched a Youtube demo later of unpacking same microwave, American person speaking,there was nothing said about retaining a cardboard liner, nothing of a rubber ring. Looked at packing material again, nothing marked asneeded to be kept in microwave when in operation. Have adjusted the roller assembly multiple times  and within 3 seconds, plate sliding.  Again, none of the FAQ's address sliding plate. So far, I would NOT recommend the microwave, the manufacturer or the custom help division to anyone!Unit is black RCA RMW733, purchased 8-8,2017, delivered 8-10-l7, first tried 9-14 and again 9-18-2017.Also purchased extended warrantybut so far, the RCA warranty would suffice except it will be time consuming to repackage, transport to a shipper, etc."
Just got it today. Tried it out on popcorn. Didn't cook all the way and when I tried to open the door it wouldn't open. After a couple minutes of trying to open the door it turned on again by itself and wouldn't turn off. Had to unplug it to shut it off and broke all the guts out of the mechanism for the latch (springs and busted plastic). Finally got the door open and enjoyed a half bag of popcorn before throwing the oven in the trash.
Product won't stay on regular time
"I seldom give less than 4 stars and, even then, there must be something obviously wrong. I guess ""It stopped working!"" is wrong enough for just 3 stars. Let me explain. I bought the RCA RMW733-BLACK Microwave Oven about six months ago. Delivery was great, as expected with Amazon. I liked it when I got it. I liked it when I first used it. And I liked it for the next six months. At less than $10 per month, then, I can hardly complain about the price. But this morning, it stopped working. It just stopped. The LEDs went dark. The control panel wouldn't respond. I've been around a bit. The first thing I checked was the power. Nope. That was on. Externally everything looked OK. I'm not about to open the case to see what internal fuse needs replacing or resetting. And I'm not interested in packing it up and shipping it back on the hopes of some kind of warranty fix. It's not worth my time, considering the price. What I will do, however, is purchase another microwave oven. Just not this brand."
The item did not work properly. The help desk was of no service. Disappointed
It worked fine for a few months then beeped and went black. Huge waste of money. My return period is over so can't do much
"DO NOT BUY! I got this microwave and right away it was defective. Overheated and shut down the breaker if it cooked anything for more than 2-4 minutes. If you did more, the breaker would cut and the whole microwave would shut down. Very dangerous, and the microwave was properly ventilated in multiple locations, but still overheated."
"Issues with setting the clock on the unit reverts back to the timer device instead of the Clock device. Emailed the distributor or the manufacturer rather, and have yet to hear back from them. Amazon attempted and made every attempt to help me correct and fix the issue to no avail. Must  be a manufacturing issueThank you, Amazon"
Door operated properly when I unpacked it and set it up. I literally used this thing ONE time and the door refused to open. I ended up having to break the door open. What a piece of junk!!
Great little microwave.  Perfect size for our family as we don't use a microwave a lot but need one for popcorn and reheating leftovers.  This is just right.  Big enough to hold a bag of microwave popcorn!  Only thing that has been annoying about it for us is that it slides around a lot.  We are planning on putting some better gripping rubber feet on it but for now when you open it you have to push the open button so hard it slides around a little.  Other than that very happy so far!UPDATE: We have now had this microwave for 3 months and it has started making a horrible noise from the turntable.  It is like the plate is to heavy and the turntable has a hard time turning.  We are going to see if the warranty will cover a fix/replacement because the noise is very loud and awful.  Downgraded my review to 3 stars.
It is very very loud. And doesn’t heat food fast as a normal microwave
On first use door would not release. Just junk.
"My husband just used it for the first time, it partially cooked and the door wouldn’t open. Now because we ordered it so long ago and he just used it for the first time our return window has closed."
The product is not structurally sound the inner lining became loose and melted and seriously dangerous and caught burning if not noticed right away would of caused extreme damage dangerous. Fire hazard and dangerous microwave cause physical damage. Amazon Rep advised to give me credit for the purchase and to throw away and take photos. Amazon has proof and still is charging me.
Very small not the size I expected
This microwave will start running just by bumping the counter.  It also will glitch on/off for no reason.  Sometimes it won’t stop when pressing the stop button.  It was okay for the first month and now it is having issues almost daily.  We unplugged it as we’re concerned it will cause a fire.
"This came packaged fairly well, but when I took it out of the box, one of the little knobby things it uses for ""legs"" was dented up into the bottom of the frame, like it had been dropped very hard on that side. I ended up putting a piece of wood under it to level it. One of the reviews also mentioned that the heating tray inside would not stay in place and I find that to be true also. It has no notches in the center of the plate to hold it centered, so it clanks and pops when it is rotating. You can eventually sort of center it, but it's a pain!. I got it for my camper and I guess it will do for that, but I would definitely not recommend it to a friend! Its way to much of a hassle  for me to send it back so I will live with it. Just beware, it's not a great product!"
"This was for my semi truck. The description said it was 17 inches long, and that is why I bought this one, it was the only one under 18 inches. I have a space that is 17 and 3 eighths wide and now I measure this and it is 17 and 5 eighths wide. Dont help me any for the space I have. Wish they would have gave the correct measurements!!!"
This is not an easy microwave to set up. It does not have a button to push if you just want to reheat a cup of coffee for say 30 seconds. You have to just start it and stand right there until you want it to stop and then you have to manually stop it. I bought it mostly because the size fits on top of my compact refrigerator in my home office and I wanted to be able to heat coffee.
works fine but is pretty small actually. i can barely fit a large plate in the microwave
"It works fine, and I like the beverage and reheat options, but I feel like I have to stand by and watch because there's no ""time cook"" option for stuff. Also my last microwave had quick setting on 1-6 so all you had to do was pop something in, guess how many minutes it needed and then if it was 6 minutes or less tap that button. I'm not saying it's a bad product, only that it takes some figuring out"
It’s an ok micro. Good for small spaces and a regular size dinner plate fits inside. The control panel is difficult to see without light and a little confusing.
I had an engineer look at it and he said it was so used and broken he'd have to take the whole thing apart and if he failed it would not be returnable so he refused to repair. Makes the noise but no heat.
I needed a microwave to fit in a specific location.  This one was the perfect size and it still could heat a large dinner plate.  Unfortunately it didn’t last much more than a week.  We used it maybe 12 times.  Tried to exchange it for another in hopes this was just a fluke issue but now it is showing as temporarily out of stock.
"Pros: good for reheating foods, water for  coffee or tea. Cons:if you cook with a  microwave then this is not for you, Continues to beep after the oven has stopped ...this  is madding  if your busy doing other things  in the kitchen, most presets don't work on the one I ordered just the popcorn button"
"Purchased this for my office. Being that it was so small, I wasn't expecting a lot, but WOW. What takes a normal microwave 30 seconds to warm up takes this one about 3-4 minutes. It also is very loud and rattles. RCA should've stuck to making TVs."
Not white as stated . Black as coal.Only used for 3 months . Left for new owners. Did not want to keep since was such a cheap light weight micro. Slid around on counter due to slick tiny feet ;)
They don't even last a year I'm stupid don't buy
"RCA RMW733-BLACK Microwave Oven, 0.7 cu. ft., BlackThe sizes are off. for this model its about an inch less tall (about 10.25 tall), and an inch less wide(around 18.25 wide, maybe a little less). seems to work as advertised, I was just expecting something that fit the space that I have better"
"It would have got more stars if the turntable would stay where it was put and not come off all the time. Any weight needs to go right in the center, otherwise the turntable comes off the wheels. The rest is fine, still good value."
"The microwave stopped working after 2 months of light use, the Amazon return window had closed so I contacted the manufacturer and they only responded to one email and haven't responded in over two weeks despite my two emails asking for an update."
This mircowave keeps cutting off and want heat the food up and it keep sparking fire have to throw it away I sent the product back and they didn't send me the money back can u please contact me and let me know something
"I purchased This RCA microwave RMW733-Black 700 watt in Nov 2017. It is dead 7 months later.It was a waste of money! I should of spent the extra 30-40 bucks to get a better one.It is a very small apartment/dorm size microwave. Not for a family of 4 who will be using it often. It does takes a long time to heat things ( 700 watt) the glass turntable constantly falls off the track and will not stay level in the middle as it should.You can not cook a bag of popcorn without it getting stuck ( won’t spin) the single sever bag are fine but not reg size they get stuck and burn. This microwave is good for heating up small snacks, water, soup, and such. Not good for defrosting meat."
"We've had it for about 2 months now and when you press the button to open the door, the door seems to stick. So you have to press multiple times in order to get the door to open. Pain in the butt."
Just received this thing!  My opening is 17-1/4  Easy swap fit right.  Oh wait the unit is not 17 inches as advertised but 18 inches.  Total incompetence rears it head again.  Last RCA product I will buy.  if they cant get the dimensions right they sure as crap cant build a decent productOh just send it back you say.  Not in the cards when you got travel deadline todayThanks RCA for nothing
"Awkward is all I can say. Hard to manage without a handle on the door. Glass microwave plate has no notches to fit correctly without movement. Also seems off-center. But if you can get past that, it is working fine."
I  DO  NOT  LIKE  THE  PUSH  TO  OPEN  NOT  GOOD  FOR  ME
"Very Small, push to open door. Serves the purpose. I only use to warm up food or water."
could not use defective
"If you reheat left overs for supper, and have more than two items to reheat, you best let it cool for about five minutes or it will quit working till it cools down. I sent it back after two days."
"This is probably 1 of the worst microwaves I've ever had.  It makes rattly sounds when in use no matter what's in it.  You have to make sure you press the start button with the flattest part of your finger or it won't work.  The buttons seem to, even after only a couple weeks' use, develop little pin-like holes from use.  Takes several tries to get it even going."
So far the microwave is working okay. The only problem I had was it there was one little leg bent and I just didn't want to send it back because of that. Had to find a way to prop it up.
i literally only understand the numbers and pizza how am i supposed to use this if its not in english description didnt say nothing about different language
Good microwave. Only problem is that the plate moves around and don't get the smallest one unless you are not looking to spend a little more and you desperately need a cheap microwave. Get the bigger one.
"Bought this for my daughter  RCA RMW733-BLACK Microwave Oven, 0.7 cu. ft., Black        as she needed a quick replacement.....it's a nice enough item just very small...we chose one that was not the best size for her needs."
"It was fine at first until it stopped working after 2 months. It turns on and lights up as if it is working, but it no longer warms the food. It's too late for me to return it too. Not to mention it's so heavy I can't simply ship it somewhere. DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE; spend the extra $ on something of decent quality."
Product looks good and warms everything like expected but only lasted 45 days.  Woke up this morning won’t heat up and it’s only been 45 days sense I bought it.  So with all considered the product is junk and will not by again advise anyone else to do same.  Unless your microwave savy then you might get a few more days out of it
"This microwave is terrible. You can’t add time to it while it is going. It smells weird, I’ve never had a microwave have this smell before. It takes longer to heat food. The plastic that covers the buttons got messed up within a week."
"The front scratches and peels off in the first day, by just barely bumping it with a plastic bowl."
It's pretty dinky but it gets the job done for first-apartmenters like me
Marginal item buttons numbers coming off works ok but next time I spend more money on a better one.
"Honestly not as powerful as I expected, smelled a bit of styrofoam, not so much any more. Glad to have it now, Service Awesome, thank you Amazon!"
This microwave works well but mine arrived in a crushed box and the top of it it is dented badly.
"We bought this recently because our old microwave died, and it is an enormous disappointment. After having it for just a couple of months, with only two people using it in a household with no children, the lower part of the button panel has become faulty. Everything past the 7 (including the start button) now only works once in a while, and you never know when that might be. It sits on a table, not being jostled, has never been dropped or anything that would cause a malfunction. Faulty product, I guess. It's ridiculous to need to replace a microwave only a couple of months after we just replaced one!"
Kind of underpowered but it looks cool with the the RCA label
"Much as I expected. Don't like that there is no add time button nor quick 1,2 etc min buttons."
The microwave works but it’s loud and doesn’t make the food that hot on the first try.
It works fine there's no problems that way. It just that the interior is too small for my big hands.
"First of all, the glass plate that goes inside doesn't fit in a groove or settle into any area... Soooooo the glass plate is always off kilter and ""jumping"" around as it pushes off the side of the microwave (as the rotating arms spin around pushing it).  NIGHTMARE Microwave.The door is cheap and feels like it could break off and the buttons you have to really push to get to work sometimes.... I just hate it!  Spend a little more and get something that's worth it.  This was a total waste of money!"
I bought this to go into my semi I got it and put it in my truck and it don’t work it won’t heat anything so I bought a biggger inverter that’s cost me 300 dollars and it still don’t work so I’m done buying from amazon. I’m a over the road trucker I keep America running I’m very upset
Came in a different language and I speak English.The microwave is not heating food properly
"I received this microwave  a couple of days ago. When I tried to use it the third time, it just stopped working. I had only hoped it would last at least a year instead of a couple of days. It is a waste of my time and money! I'll have to return it and purchase a new one at Walmart."
HAD TO PUT A CARDBOARD UNDER THE FRONT TO KEEP THE DOOR FROM HITTING THE TABLE.
"This is the worst appliance I've ever owned.  If I heat something for 30 or 60 seconds (cause, there's not a button specifically for that) when I take the food out and close the door it starts back up again for an undetermined amount of time (usually about 5 minutes).  Nothing stops this thing from running, not the cancel button, not even unplugging it from the wall, you do that and it starts back up as soon as its plugged back in.  Don't waste your money."
"I was sent a microwave that does not work AT ALL. If you plug it in it turns on, but you cannot shut it off unless you open the door. The only way to shut it off is to unplug it. And when it is on you cannot set a timer and it doesn't even heat things up. The best part is that I'm being charged a restocking fee when I requested the refund the day the item arrived AND it doesn't work AT ALL!"
"Microwave came broken. It will not heat food at all. Going to return ASAP.Follow up: I didn't think it was possible to become more disappointed about this purchase, but surprise! Anything is possible. I received a replacement that worked fine for a little while, but it unexpectedly died for no reason. Mid microwaving my food, it just shut off by itself. There were no power or connection issues, it is just an awful microwave. Apparently this product is designed to barely outlive the 30 return window so that Amazon can keep your money. Thanks. Absolutely would not recommend, would never buy this brand of anything again."
This microwave is not working. It didn’t warm food and make a terrible noise. Can someone talk to me
Note: Missing a +30 secs button and speed dial buttons. User must dial in cook time.
"The microwave itself works great, and it was an overall great purchase. However, the plate inside does not have a way to stay on the spinner, it just slides off."
"I waited to review this item to give a true review of it's performance. I highly recommend saving your money and investing in another microwave. The plate never stays in place, it's very slow to heat up food and is inconsistent in it's heating temp and speed... Sadly we are stuck with it and make do with what we have but next time i will definitely spend $20-30 more and actually be happy with my purchase."
I am changing my review I purchased this back in Oct/Nov 2016 . It worked fine until today! Power source it dead  not the breakers in my house it simply just died. My last microwave I had was from 1989 so needless to say . I would not recommend buying this! Now I have to buy another microwave !
If you’re single and want cheap this is for you. Small this is RCA wow
"bought this in April, 2 days ago will not heat food up. Everything else is working. I should have looked at the return policy closer, I have to pay to ship it back and include 7$ money order for insurance. I got what I paid for............"
"This was a necessity for my new on-campus housing It is exactly that, a basic run of the mill microwave."
Works but you most definitely will have to ungrade because it doesn’t heat food well. 8 mins for 3 pieces of bacon ?!
"It was very nice, just much smaller then I thought it would be. I guess I didn't know what 0.7 cu. ft was."
This microwave takes two minutes to do a one minute job
"I bought this item only a few months ago and it hasn't worked properly in the past 3 months. To get anything remotely warm you need to put it on for at least 3 minutes, but if you are trying to actually warm up a whole meal, its like 5 or more minutes to get it warm. I don't understand why it works so horribly. Don't waste your money."
"I bought this microwave on June 27th and got it pretty fast but that's the only good thing I can say about it. It stopped working on July 29th(2 days after the return policy was void) and hasn't worked since. I normally don't post reviews on here but this purchase truly upset me and I'd like to prevent others from making the same mistake as I did. If you need a microwave, PLEASE buy anyone but this one. You'll be sorry."
Small. Hard too see the numbers for elderly.
I needed a 0.6 and I thought that was what I had ordered.  this is too large.
Too smallnot powerful enough
The turn table inside makes this rubbin together noise
I like but its a little too small
The box came in perfect condition but when I took it out of the box it had a huge dent on the side
"Met expectations, however, decals for the buttons were printed in French."
"A little part of me feels like this review is a tad unfair. First up - this is a perfectly nice, decently performing microwave. Nice functions, works great, reasonably easy on the eye for a big steel box. If I were rating this product on its ""microwave-yness"" then I'd give it 4 or 5 stars.  But most of me thinks that this oven, and Panasonic, throroughly deserve a 1 star for two reasons.First, there are the key words ""built-in"" in the description and spec, which is exactly why I bought it, as I need a replacement built-in microwave. This oven pairs with the NN-TK932SS trim kit, which I confirmed with Panasonic customer support is the right one. And when I look at the Panasonic website (see picture) there's a nice tight finish. But when fitted, there is actually a 1/2"" gap on all four sides of the microwave through which you can see the duct work and cabinet cavity. Seriously - the trim hole is exactly 3/4"" bigger than the oven. Ugly. I thought I'd bought the wrong kit, but no.Second, the customer support from Panasonic is ATTROCIOUS. Here's a fun transcript from my chat with them:Levon S (1/3/2018, 7:26:55 AM): Welcome to Panasonic Microwave Support Live Chat Group!How may I assist you?Me (1/3/2018, 7:27:19 AM): Can you confirm the correct 30"" trim kit for an NN-SD975S microwave?Me (1/3/2018, 7:27:49 AM): I bought the NN-TK932SS but it has a 1/2"" gap all around the microwave, looks ugly.Levon S (1/3/2018, 7:29:17 AM): NN-TK932SMe (1/3/2018, 7:30:22 AM): Really? And its supposed to have a big gap around the microwave? It looks terrible.Me (1/3/2018, 7:31:07 AM): Look at the picture at http://www.abt.com/product/64796/Panasonic-30-Stainless-Microwave-Trim-Kit-NNTK932SS.htmlMe (1/3/2018, 7:31:25 AM): With the 975S microwave it doesn't look like that at all.Levon S (1/3/2018, 7:32:15 AM): Then you need to contact a installer for unit was installed wrongMe (1/3/2018, 7:33:43 AM): Are you serious?Levon S (1/3/2018, 7:33:43 AM): yesMe (1/3/2018, 7:34:26 AM): There is no installing it wrong. Its a trim... it fits over the microwave. The hole in the trim is bigger than the microwave. ""Fitting"" it won't make the hole bigger or smaller.Me (1/3/2018, 7:34:51 AM): I'm not talking about the hole in the cabinet. I'm talking about the hole in the trim which fits over the oven.Levon S (1/3/2018, 7:35:30 AM): That is the correct trim kit as I have stated to you and you have enter it wrong because there is no spacing on itMe (1/3/2018, 7:37:17 AM): Is there a phone number I can call to talk to someone else. Either you don't understand me, or the product I was sent is defective. I can fit my entire finger between the trim and the microwave.Me (1/3/2018, 7:37:26 AM): All the way around.Levon S (1/3/2018, 7:37:34 AM): You can call 1-800-211-7262 but you will be charged $9.95 to speak with agent over the phone.Me (1/3/2018, 7:38:02 AM): You guys suck. I'm returning the microwave unless you give me a number to speak to someone for free.Me (1/3/2018, 7:38:27 AM): You call this customer service?Levon S (1/3/2018, 7:39:36 AM): Sorry there is no free numberI discovered that there IS a free phone service during the warranty period, but what the number is escapes me. The phone line that told me this hangs up before giving you the option of talking to someone about warranty.A second chat had similar, almost comedic results. The second guy had ME google product dimensions for his own products, in order to confirm that this isn't a fitting issue, and yes indeed the trim is 3/4"" bigger that then microwave."
"I live in a newly constructed house with a recent version of a Siemens AFCI and GFCI 20A breaker that's dedicated to the microwave circuit.  This microwave reliably trips the AFCI portion of this breaker when I try to heat less than 1 cup of water or equivalent.  It trips about 30 seconds in to heating a small microwave dinner.  It also trips about a minute or so into making microwave popcorn.  I've checked the wiring to the outlet and it's solid around the screws.  I've read every Reddit thread out there and apparently this is a common occurrence with circuit breakers that have AFCI.  While AFCI can detect electrical arcing that can cause a house fire, and is required throughout the U.S. by the 2014 electrical code, the current crop of breakers is also somewhat trigger happy, detecting an arc when in fact it's just the wildly changing current consumption of a kitchen appliance.  If the microwave oven's power supply doesn't take into account the AFCI and smooth out its power consumption, it'll trip the breaker.  I found that this Panasonic Microwave will trip the breaker repeatedly and reliably at the same time point for the same Microwave Power Setting and what I'm trying to heat.  Lowering the power level will enable it to heat smaller quantities without tripping the AFCI.  Knowing this is great, but why should I need to be aware when I'm trying to heat typically microwaved food and drink???After much reading, I determined that this situation might be helped by putting a surge suppressor with EMI/RF filtering.  One source suggested that the surge suppressor needed to reduce by 70 decibels the power transient frequencies of 100kHz to 1 MHz.  I tried my available ""Belkin 12-Outlet Pivot-Plug Power Strip Surge Protector, with 8ft Cord"" (available on Amazon) that filters transients from 150K Hz to 100M Hz by up to 50dB and is rated at 15 Amps (microwave is rated at 12.3A).  This Belkin outlet successfully reduced in half the amount that I could heat without tripping, making the microwave ""mostly usable.""  I did the same round of testing again and found that this Belkin outlet enabled me to successfully boil water down to 1/2 cup without tripping.  It does, however, still trip when the amount of water is reduced to 1/4 cup.  I also did the test with oil and butter and found that it will trip the breaker at about the 5 minute mark with 3 tablespoons, long enough to melt butter or raise the temperature of the oil to frying temperature.  I'm expecting that it'll also work successfully with a microwave dinner, since they have at least the equivalent of 2 tablespoons of oil along with more than 1/4 cup of liquid infused into the veggies, sauces, and dessert.Edit: 9/25:  I bought a Tripp Lite ISOBLOK2-0 20A surge suppressor and EMI a plugged the Panasonic microwave into it.  It lists 40 to 80db EMI/RF noise reduction.  The result is SUCCESS!  I'm now able to boil as little as 1/4 cup of water or 2 tablespoons of butter without triggering the AFCI.  I can now make microwave popcorn in it.I should note that this is on a dedicated 20A circuit with the Siemens Q120DF 20-Amp Afci/Gfci Dual Function Circuit Breaker.  My prior General Electric microwave that I had for three years never triggered this breaker.  The wiring run is 35 feet and the house was built in 2017, inspected by the county, my me, and by a professional inspector that I hired.  This wiring complies with current Electric Code.Panasonic is going to have to redesign its microwave oven to operate successfully with the Electrical Code required AFCI breakers.  You shouldn't have to plug it in to a high-end surge suppressor power filter to get it to work as expected."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update: The company finally responded once but has not moved forward with replacement after they said they would. After a week of waiting, my husband took the microwave apart and fixed it. The fan was dislodged. Would buy with caution but so far it has worked for an hour.Purchased for my new construction house. Construction was delayed so I am outside of my 30 day return window but it is unused- stickers still on. First time used, made a grinding sound and tripped breaker. Tried on other outlets- it is the microwave. Messaged seller twice with no response. Disappointed as this is a high rated microwave."
We didn't notice the plastic and aluminum inside the microwave oven till now which is after a few months of purchase. The product description deceptively says stainless steel.
"Highly Average, nothing special.  No change from prior model made 13 years ago except for door lock - which is a pain."
"Not worth the price ,I loved it in beginning but after a week it was keep tripping breaker (i had same brand micro. Use in same plug over 5yrs) and then it's was showing some err code not happy at all. I really loved the way it looks too easy to operate. they resolve the issue"
"I first bought the NN-SD975S in Feb '22, along with the trim kit. It didn't get installed until April, and lasted about 6 months before I was treated to a light-show as something went wrong in the electronics compartment. Panasonic refunded me the purchase price, rather that make me ship/carry the unit to the closest repair shop (~50 miles away), which was nice. Of course, the price for the replacement had gone up $70 over the summer, so it didn't actually work out to be free replacement.Since I had the sunk cost of the trim kit, I ordered another. This one lasted about 11 months before I got the same light show. The customer service process was even easier this time since I had been quick with the record button on my phone, and a video described the issue better than I could.When it's working, I have no complaints. I got it for the inverter, but I'm not sure I paid close enough attention to how much of a difference it makes. (That's a comment on me, and probably my old microwave, not on this one.)The controls are...interesting. I wouldn't mark off for them, but they're clumsy enough that they're not a plus. If they updated the model with current technology of equivalent cost, it would have a better display that makes it easier to scroll through the presets. As it is, if it's not one you have memorized (hello, soup!), you have to stop on the number, and wait for the text description to scroll across before seeing it's not what you want, and repeating the process. But to be fair, we all probably only use 2-3 presets, and commit those to memory in the first few days.It's roomy. Mine only cooks for one person, so I can't comment on how it handles large quantities. On the other hand, the reliability issues under a light load (relative to a family of 6, or something) does not fill me with confidence.Given that the keypad on cheap Whirlpool microwave that came with the house stopped working reliably after a little under two years--and judging from the uninspiring reliability ratings across brands from Consumer Reports--I'm wondering if this is the new normal."
"24JUL21 Model NN-SN97JSI'm not sure that it's ethical having a listing with ""Stainless Steel Countertop"" preceding the word ""Silver"" unless you're talking about a countertop made of stainless steel, upon which the microwave is sitting, but that would be deceptive too. There's much more silver paint than stainless steel. Please see the photo. The cabinet and door edge are silver paint. The rather miniscule trim escutcheon appears to be stainless steel. That's it! The oven interior is painted too. No stainless there either. I'm not sure whether anyone remembers this, but 'stainless', once upon a time long ago, referred to the oven's interior, e.g. early Amana's circa 1975. It was that way for easy cleaning. For the restaurant industry they were, and perhaps still are, models with stainless inside and out. Once again, for easy cleaning. Anyway, your stainless escutcheon, as small as it is, should be easy to clean. lol Luckily for me, most of the silver paint resides in hole in the wall where this oven resides. Our kitchen has black appliances, so the the black oven window and control panel looks good enough. Think about it - Panasonic could advertise this as stainless and paint it black too. They'd just have to put the word ""Black"" somewhere in the description. Wouldn't that be helpful?  ???Everything, with the exception of the paint job and trim, seems to work great. It's easy to use and heats things up quickly. Whether the 'cyclonic' magic is worth the extra $100 remains to be seen. I did notice that in the Panasonic videos about their Cyclonic Inverter microwave ovens, the oven was never set to full power for the demonstration. It was closer to half power. I suspect that 'cyclonic' may be an impossible feature at full power because, most likely, the headroom (or power above average power) isn't available, i.e. it's impossible to produce more than the most."
"This microwave was good for the first month of use. Then, one day, it started sparking while microwaving a ceramic bowl full of oatmeal. I contacted customer service, and they made the process of return extremely difficult. They made me take pictures of the microwave inside and all around each surface. They then referred me to corporate for ""escalation"" and it took them several days to reply. When they got in touch, they asked me to re-send the same information and photos I sent to the first agent, but their email was incapable of handling receipt of multiple photos, so they insisted I send the photos in 6 separate emails alsong with an email with the invoice. The mobile screenshots of my amazon invoice were inexplicably deemed insufficient. I was told I had to go to a computer and download the ""official"" invoice rather than a screenshot, which I did.  They took several more days to get back to me and agreed to refund my purchase price but ONLY if I sign a release of liability and mail it to them along with the sticker with the serial number from the microwave to them. When I refused because that won't cover my disposal cost, they said that if I provide an invoice for my cost of disposal, they'll reimburse me. I don't trust these people to do the right thing after the way they've treated me, and I certainly won't be buying another panasonic product if I can help it."
"This is not my first Panasonic.. they are usually good microwaves.  This one cooks ok, but it sounds like an airliner at full climb power (an L1011, specifically).  Not sure how long it is going to last.  And getting service, well.. that isn't easy where I live.  When this one dies I am probably not ordering from Amazon."
Loved this microwave until I didn't - first the door started to stick to the point that you have to use 2 hands to open - one to push the button and the second to then prize it open from the bottom. Then it intermittently started to make this buzzing sound and light flashing during operation. It did this on and off for a month and now it has completely stopped heating all together. Time to call the company and see if they will fix or replace this unit that is less than 18 months old.
"Like others' experience, the unit worked great until the magnetron began sparking and smoking and finally burned up--about 18 months after purchase. After supplying photos of burned out magnetron, Panasonic partially honored their warranty policy (deducted $60 dollars for ""depreciation"") while not disputing validity of claim/product defect. Could have been worse, as warranty does not cover labor after 12 months: they could have mailed a replacement magnetron and said good luck with installation labor."
"I have no real complaints.  Yeah, key pad could be better laid out and similar gripes.  The real issue is the inverter blew out at 3.5 years.  The spark of such penetrated the safety cover over the inverter and put a smokey smell into the room.  An earlier reviewed posed the question of whether it was safe to operate the unit without the safety cover.........nope (got a 1/2 hole in the metal to prove it).Use of the unit was not high.  We're a retired couple, with no kids at home, and we have both a toaster oven and a convection oven so don't need to run the microwave a lot."
"I wanted to like this microwave. I like my Panasonic toaster oven. This model gets top ratings in several reviews. But I'm not impressed, and Panasonic is certainly not encouraging me to keep the model or buy Panasonic.The microwave itself looks good, and after 2 weeks of use is relatively quiet, has a large interior, and heats things up quickly, if not uniformly. However, the beverage choice seems only time-based, so insufficient for larger mugs. The popcorn selection sometimes burns a standard bag of Kirkland popcorn. Hard to figure out other settings without the manual in front of you. So plan to input your own times and babysit carefully.Much more frustrating - we bought this microwave for a built-in install. It is huge, so won't easily sit on the countertop. We had chosen a trim kit, but due to the price (same as microwave) didn't order it until we knew microwave worked. Turns out the trim kit isn't available anymore. When I contacted Panasonic, detailing our difficulty finding the kit and concerns people had expressed re installation, I received a stock answer directing me to a link to find the correct kit. Thanks, way beyond that. Responded with all the details I'd previously offered, and after a week finally received a reply that the trim kit has been discontinued and perhaps we can find it somewhere. (Everywhere they recommended was sold out.) Next line in their response was, ""Due to the age of the product as well, no other trim-kits were manufactured for it.""If they don't support the model accessories anymore, perhaps they should discontinue the model. How frustrating."
"If you want to be able to visually check on your food while it is cooking or warming this model is not for you. The stainless model comes with a medium gray cavity and a small inadequate light. When the unit is running you can barely see the contents so checking for boil over etc. is nearly impossible. Panasonic support is no help - they rather rudely said “if you don’t like it, take it back.”"
"The keypad has white lettering. If the room has a lot of sunlight it is extremely difficult to read. I do not like the fact that the reheat cycle cannot be limited to specific times. I do like the keep warm feature however.  The interior light does not do a very good job of illuminating the interior while in operation , making it difficult to keep an eye on the items inside."
I would like this microwave if the interior light wasn't so dim and it had a white interior instead of a gray interior. Having a dim light plus gray interior = can't see your food cooking very well.
"NN-SN97JSI'm giving this 3 points.Subtract 1 point for using pressure sensors on the number pad when they clearly appear to be conductance or capacitive sensors at first appearance... wierd hybrid design to save money, harder to confirm a good press, hard to know the right pressure, worst of both worlds. I'd almost subtract 2 points for this.Subtracting 1 point because the interface is still 1990s tech. Everything is numbers, so unless you memorize the manual or open it everytime you cook, your never going to use the advanced features... imagine trying to program a 3 stage cooking sequence with nothing but the numbers 1 thru 9.All in all, disappointing. I'm hoping it at least cooks good... it looks great, it is assumed to cook great, but the interfaces is superunintuitive and I thought this was going to be top of the line."
"I will NEVER buy another Panasonic anything ever.My microwave is a little over a year old and we got a H97 error code, which is the the Magnetron Tube. Panasonic covers the PART only for 5 years, but nothing else. If you are trying to contact them after a year, then they are going to charge you 10$ to talk to a person. Luckily, I did have an extended warranty on it, and after chatting with an agent they were able to take care of the issue.It was great while it worked."
"Note that this review is for NN-SN97JS and NOT NN-SN966S.I'm not sure what the designers or testers were thinking with this microwave. While trying to decide between the two, I opted for NN-SN97JS over the less expensive NN-SN966S because of the ""cyclonic"" inverter and thought how bad could it be? After all, it's the more expensive one!The dim LED light combined with the grey interior not only makes food very hard to see, it also makes it feel like it's lit by fluorescent lights in a morgue...  The kids were excited to see the new microwave, and immediately upon seeing it, asked why the buttons didn't have any numbers on it.  Stooping down to their eye level, the glare is so bad that you can't see what any of the buttons say.  The button that opens the door is also loose and wobbly that I can't imagine that it would hold up well over time.We ended up buying the NN-SN966S instead and prefer it much more! If there were any benefits to the ""cyclonic"" inverter, we couldn't tell what it was. When we made nachos with NN-SN97JS for the first time, my wife asked me if something's wrong with the new microwave because only the cheese on the edge of the plate were melted..."
"We have had large GE microwaves for a number of years and either the quality has gone down or I have been buying the wrong models, because the are not as solid as I want and now break right out of warranty.  I wanted a 15"" or larger tray and that narrowed my potential choices a great deal.  I tried this Panasonic because of its size, and advertised unique Cyclonic Wave.  I was a little leery of the dial and lack of ""instant on"" buttons.  The dial seems fine, the machine is powerful, the sensor mostly accurate, I can live with it. As others mentioned the door button feels cheap and has to be pressed ""just right"".  And, as other reviewers have mentioned, it has terrible lighting!  I have no idea how such an otherwise refined machine can be put on the market with a dim bulb in one corner.  I know it sounds like a non-issue, but trust me, it will bug you. How much would it have cost to put led bulbs on 3 sides around the door? I don't know, but it sure would have changed the tenor of this review.Well, after a little more than a year, the Door Button jams. Shame, eventually, this sort of bad design will put this in the landfill much sooner than it should be."
"I've been using this for 2 months.  This microwave cooks way better then any I've ever used or owned.  Food doesn't explode or pop and heats pretty evenly.  I'm impressed.  I had a GE profile that was pretty good at cooking but failed.  I replaced that with a Kenmore Elite thinking all microwaves were just microwaves.  I spent 2 years with that Kenmore eating mildy warm food with cold spots on extremely hot dishes and constantly being frustrated.  I would have given this microwave 4 stars because the trim kit is so terrible to install and its not quite the right fit for the microwave, though it works and is acceptable.  Another annoyance is when you hit the 30 sec quick button you still have to hit start.  BUT because the microwave does its core job of cooking so well it's still at the very least 5 star.  I don't know if its the inverter, or the cyclonic jargon, but this is the evolution step that all microwaves need to take.EDIT UPDATE 08-2017:  Changing from 5 star to 2 star.  Microwave failed after about 6-7 months.  It no longer heated anything though appeared to function normally.  Repair was a huge pain as we had to unmount it, drive it a very sketchy place, and leave it for a few days.  It was now fixed at no charge, but in the months since then it doesn't cook near as evenly.  It's extremely aggressive at heating now and nukes things in like 60% of the time it use to.  Things pop and explode now.  Disk come out burning hot.  Sucks now."
"I’ve ordered refurbished items before, and never had a problem. Saving $60 on a new microwave sure sounded appealing, so I ordered this from Amazon in very good/like new condition..... the first time.Microwave #1 arrived, we set it up, and noticed two things: door spring mechanism was broken. You could tell it disengaged the latch, but then door didn’t spring open- you had to pull it open with fingers. Also, there was a gap over the door. Looked like the stainless cover had been removed and had been put back improperly. Sent it back.Amazon warehouse claims they check everything is working etc before shipping, so I figured maybe this was just bad luck.Microwave #2 arrived. After unpacking, it turned out that this unit had been returned filthy! Old, dried massive food explosion coated the inside!  We went ahead and cleaned it out, but when we tried to use it, we got the H98 error the third time we tried to use it- this means the magnetron has failed- microwave won’t work.Granted, these two items had been returned by others- but the construction on this model is flimsy and not designed to last.Amazon has an information video about amazon warehouse- how they test and validate items before re-selling at a discount. Clearly they DO NOT do this. Both these items were supposed to be in very good/like new condition. Old exploded food coating the inside- clearly it was never opened for inspection. Literally didn’t pass the smell test.  Neither of these ovens had been looked over before n the most rudimentary way.I’m very disappointed in amazon for this false advertising and for wasting my time! I’m very disappointed in amazon for this false advertising and for wasting my time! Packing and returning large items like microwaves is a huge hassle, requiring help from someone else because the box is so large and heavy. Getting it to a UPS store (doesn’t fit in my small car, again too big for me to carry) is a huge inconvenience and time waste of my time."
"The microwave works well but is SO dark inside due to the dark colored walls of the interior. There is no watching your food cooking like with white interior walls.Another downside is that it doesn't feel or sound solid. It is much lighter in weight than the older ones. There is an unpleasant loud ""hollow sound"" every time you shut the door that I almost dread hearing.One thing of concern is that our baby monitor 8 feet away from this unit will not work. Yet it works near a different microwave. ?  If I could do it over I would not have purchased this unit."
"The microwave arrived quickly as things usually do from Amazon. For 8 days, the unit sat in the kitchen looking modern and great. It was not too difficult to operate and got the job done although I, personally, don't think the recent Panasonic electronic advances make much of any difference. Speed and cooking efficiency seem about the same. One thing I did not like was the 'push-button' to open the door. The microwave tended to push back on the counter-top when the door open button was pushed. The door seemed to be a little less than sturdy and noisy.On the 8th day something was being heated. After a few seconds, there was a little abnormal noise, and the microwave shut-down. I tried resetting the time. I unplugged the unit for awhile and plugged it in again. Nothing would cause the unit to once again operate.Amazon permitted a quick return which is one reason I like to do business with them. Panasonic supposed has the best reputation even though most all microwave ovens are made in one of 3 factories in China. I, again, did a quick research trying to replace it with something I could count on. I decided I had to have a door with a firm, built-in handle, something that gives good control of opening and closing. Finally I settled on a commercial model from Sharp. I will review that separately."
"Bought this to replace an older model we had for 3 years. I saw that it would cost more to fix than replace, even though it was still under warranty. From what I can tell, some of the features that make this a great Microwave also means it won't last more than a couple of years. Seems to be all too true of a lot of appliances these days. I liked the original, and this one has the same controls, etc.,.. So, decided to try again and hope Panasonic has worked out the longevity issue."
"We've used this for several months now, and it deserves a review.Pro: cooks and defrosts well.Cons: There are several things we dislike about this microwave.1. The internal light is useless. It's a small LED light on the side. If I want to see if something is boiling or cooked well enough I need to shine a flashlight through the window or open the door to check.2. It holds odors. You DO NOT want to burn anything in this microwave or you'll smell it for days afterwards. If you cook something aromatic, you'll be treated to the smell again the next few times you use the microwave. We often find ourselves trying to microwave citrus peels in water to clear the smell.3. The alert noise it makes for timers or when something finishes is pathetic. It beeps just a few times, not very loud, and then the display just goes back to clock. If you're not close by, you likely won't know a timer went off at all. Our old microwave would at least beep again periodically until the timer was canceled or door opened. My wife won't use the timer function at all anymore.4. It's kind of difficult to have something cooking at set a separate timer at the same time. Odds are you'll mess up one trying to set the other. This was never a problem with our GE microwave.I would not buy this product again."
"First off, the light on the inside of this thing is an absolute joke.With modern LED technology, there is absolutely no excuse for this.I almost returned it because of thisSecond, no instant buttons?… Really Panasonic?I was born in the 60s and I’ve used microwaves since then, and my dad actually worked for Amana back in the 1940s researching the safety of modern microwaves, so yeah, this microwave is straight out of the 70s… It works great, just not easy to user-friendly.It’s also giant… I mean you could literally microwave a turkey if you wanted to try"
"This microwave oven is pictured on the Amazon website with a typical white, well-lit interior, but upon unboxing, we discovered its interior is almost black.  There is a small light inside on the right-hand wall, but it is so feeble and so poorly positioned that it is possible to see only whether there is something inside the microwave. I have the impression that it puts out less light than my mobile phone -- literally.  Worse, the dark gray interior also absorbs the bit of light available.  It's like peering into a dark, narrow cave.This microwave might be fine for reheating coffee or perhaps making bagged popcorn, where you can rely on sound.  But if actually seeing the food during cooking might be useful or necessary, this is not your machine.  Apparently, the design engineers have never cooked anything.Back it goes.  What a waste of time."
"I bought this because I like heating my food quick. Plus it has the inverter feature which sure did the job of cooking my meals. Unfortunately, though, it caused my breaker to reset after using it for a minute and a half to two minutes. I must’ve had to reset the dang breaker over ten times now. Tried having two electricians coming over and they said they couldn’t find an issue. My colleague suggested lowering the power level a bit and see if it’d cook my food. It worked, but I don’t want to have to push the power level and then click on the numbers all the time. Made me wonder if the microwave I now possess is just too powerful for my apartment to handle. Microwave: 15 — My Apartment: 1."
"I wrote a review for the trim kit as well. The fit is very poor. You will not be happy with the way it looks. I guess they wanted to have a lot of ventilation but the result looks like you got the wrong trim kit, even thought I discussed at length with Panasonic tech support and they said this was the intended gap.microwave seems nice. The internal LED light looks a bit cheap. the dial control takes getting used to but you might like it more in due time.little thing -- it has a 'quick 30s' button... ok fine, i prefer 'quick minute' but i can press quick 30s twice.. but then you also need to hit 'start'. why not one button that turns it on? is that so hard? does anyone not want the over to turn on the second they press the 'quick' button?given that touch/cell phone screens now seem to be pretty cheap, can't we have them on our microwaves? would be prettier and could even allow for multiple options like a dial control or key pad control. anyhow."
"This microwave heats well and is quiet and smooth. There are a couple reasons I am returning it:1) in the setup instructions it describes how to turn the beep off - the first 3 steps of that procedure activate the child lock and you can go no further to compete the steps to turn the sound off.2) once the microwave is running you cannot push any buttons to adjust.  This meaning, if I push ""add 30 seconds"" it will not accept an ""add time"" to add 10 seconds or subtract 10 seconds.  I have found that absolutely no commands can happen after the start button is pushed.  So fine adjustments have to be made with the dial which overshoots time easily and beeps like it is a time bomb."
"It worked great until it didn't. It only lasted 3yr & 3 months. The magnetron and the main board blew. The warranty is useless since Panasonic has pulled out of the US market now and there are hardly any warranty centers. I live in Dallas Tx and the nearest was 234 miles away. The magnetron warranty was still in effect but I will have to ship it to the warranty center at my expense. After an hour of back and forth I finally got Panasonic to agree to send the magnetron to a local shop I found who happened to have two others just like it there for repair too. Upon checking the unit the shop found the main board to be bad as well. Total bill to repair with the ""free"" magnatron and a new board was $290. He recommended I not repair it due to the frequency of failure of the inverter which was not part of this repair and could fail in the future. I do not recommend buying from a company that has pulled out of the US market."
"This is a big, powerful microwave that works well. My biggest complaint is that the keypad is difficult to see. Light grey text on a darker grey background on black panel. It does NOT light up in any way shape or form. Very hard to use in dim lights. I was also hoping the newer models would be quiter - nope. Or the door would have a soft close - nope again.  Thinking about returning it for something else."
"I just purchase an NN-SD975 microwave to replace an older Panasonic microwave #NN-SN936.  The microwave seems to work ok with a few uses.  But I have a bright, sunny kitchen.  The information in the display window is so dim that it is impossible to read.  Since I need to use the dial while reading the information in the display window, I find this to be a difficult to impossible situation.  I haven't found a way to make the display information brighter or more defined and readable.On the other hand, there is no way to run this microwave without the clock being set.  The clock display is too bright at night and shines into a bedroom and disturbs sleep.I know, too dim, too bright.  Customers, bah.  But this all worked out well on our previous Panasonic Microwave model #NN-SN936.  We kept the clock off on that microwave and the display was readable."
"I just replaced another Panasonic microwave we had for 10 years. I should have reordered the one I had because this one is very difficult to read. The numbers and letters are so light with no contrast that it is nearly impossible to read. I have to get out a flashlight and magnifying glass to know what it says on each button. I now have memorized the times I usually use, but very frustrating to not be able to read it. Such a dumb design and an easy fix for the manufacture."
I've had this microwave for only 3 days so I don't have much to say. I tested the sensor cook with soup and it took like 45 seconds and I kept seeing the edges of the soup bubbling from heat and every time I checked it was still cold. I finally put 30 seconds manually and that was enough to make it hot.  Also I put milk to warm for 30 seconds and 1 side was warm and 1 side was cold. Cyclonic inverter technology didn't do much. Not sure if I'm going to return or not. I still have time to test more.
This microwave is not quiet. There are cheaper alternatives on the market which use inverter technology but are way more quiet than this product.It does heat the food more evenly. It is way more spacious than I expected.
"I purchased this microwave model from Amazon in November 2020. Until recently it worked just fine, BUT an H98 malfunction code was displayed meaning (according to the manual that the re is a problem with the microwave generation system.) I realize no appliance lasts forever and so I am willing to have it repaired IF it is economical to do so. I went to the Panasonic website and tried to chat with an agent. Was informed by Google the servicer was not accessible. There is no telephone number. it is very frustrating. THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT BUYING A PANASONIC MICROWAVE."
"ordered and had to wait over a month which was strange because it was fulfilled by amazon. i was excited to finally receive it. i unboxed it and set it up. it looked awesome, really nice looking microwave. put in a frozen pizza and clicked sensor for frozen pizza and received an error. tried just doing a timed cook but received the same error , bummer. i didn't want to wait so i called an authorized repair shop since i just received it that day and obviously still under warranty and told them the error. they said it was the main unit and very common with this microwave, he suggested i just return it. i told him i had to wait over a month and i really liked it so would prefer him just fix it since i wasn't paying. he said it would take three weeks minimum to get the parts and this was a microwave that continues to go bad. THIS WAS A PANASONIC REPAIR SHOP !!!!!! i decided to return it to get a different microwave. that was 2 weeks ago, ups delivered back to amazon in 2 days but still no refund. i called today and was told they could see it was returned but because of the pandemic they don't know when they will process refund. they said they are doing their best. i don't know about you but i really can have $300 tied up for 2 months for a product i received bad.  no more big ticket items through amazon until we are back to normal and maybe longer."
"I've had this microwave for ~1.5 years at this point, in the last week it has started giving off a grinding sound when it is being used. While outside the one year manufacturer warranty I decided to call their support line anyway to see if they had any suggestions.I have tried calling a couple times...The first time the automated system told me the device in question is no longer supported and to instead try their online self help tool before being hung up on. I found it odd that it would not be supported because this is the number given in the supporting documentation, listed on their site, and on amazon and the product is still being sold as a new item.The second time, I tried calling a few minutes later thinking maybe their automated system routed me wrong. This time I got the suggestion to try their online support tool and that their call center was closed (6 PM Eastern) and of course again hung up on by their automated system. Their documentation mentions they close at 7 PM Eastern (good luck anyone not on the East coast if you need to talk to someone and work during the day).I will try again a couple more times to get some kind of response regarding this-- a 1.5 year life before failure is ridiculous. I have a number of products from these guys, but I will be rethinking future purchases and definitely will not be going for any additional appliances from them at all unless there is some kind of proper resolution."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Looks nice, but when the door is closed you can touch the bottom of it and it rattles like it’s not closed all the way which I imagine could be dangerous if microwaves are escaping. The push button to open the microwave appears to be seconds away from breaking. Both of these issues were straight out of the box. This microwave was not cheap, but based on reviews of microwaves across the board, both cheap and expensive, it appears that they’re all cheaply made."
"This review is not for the features and performance of the microwave; in fact, the oven likely performs awesomely. That’s why I ordered it. I bought this microwave to replace a built-in microwave that wore out. I ordered it not knowing that Panasonic does not make a trim kit for this model. It fits nicely in the cabinet, but my existing trim kit didn’t work with this model. No problem, I’ll just order a new Panasonic trim kit.NOPE… none available. WTF? Seriously?So now, it’s either try to modify my existing one, or custom build something that will work.Very disappointing, Panasonic."
"Liked the product but the microwave started sparking and showed an error code in about 8 months of use. Tried contacting Panasonic and was sent to a repair center in an awful part of town and the shop is always closed. No phone answered, no help from Panasonic. Home warranty won't cover it because it should be manufacturer warranty. Won't buy a Panasonic brand again."
I purchased this unit 1.5 years ago and now its not working. What a SHAME. Dont buy.
"Fortunately I purchased the Asurion 36 month warranty... Right at the 6 month mark it started shooting sparks and making popping and grinding noises.. then shut down - error code h98. After researching this on the net I find that due to an inefficient inverter design it is common for this to fail and make the magnet fail as well... So after a six months of regular proper use, it died... I loved it while it was working, so decided to roll the dice and let Asurion replace it rather than get a refund - I still have 30 months of warranty left and hope I don't need to use it. If so this rating will go to 1 star and a much more pointed review will be shared."
"As a microwave, this is the best one I've ever owned.  It does everything a microwave should, only better.  It may seem odd not to have a number pad, but the dial is actually much easier and faster to use.  A minor annoyance is that the big button you press to open the door has too strong a spring and the microwave is so light that it slides around on the counter and I have to straighten it up everytime I use it !So why did I give it such a low rating you might ask.  Mine leaks so much electromagnetic radiation in the 2.4GHz band that it totally disrupts any Bluetooth or Wi-fi enabled electronic device within about 20 feet whenever it's running.  If your life is anything like mine, there are Bluetooth and Wi-fi enable devices throughout your house.  The only electronics affected by this issue are ones in close proximity and mostly line of sight.  In my case, I've been able to shield the devices in my kitchen/family room by placing a homemade metal shield in front of the microwave when it's used.  I've contacted Panasonic and their response was that the manual clearly states that their product will do exactly as I've described.  Their solution was to move any electronic item affected to the other end of my house to get it far enough away from their defective product to not be affected.  This changes my view of this product and Panasonic.  I can no longer recommend either."
"I got this microwave two months ago. I wish I had returned it.  The tray sits on a flimsy roller and the tray is hard to fit in the center slots. We were constantly fiddling with it the trying to get it to turn, then the glass tray slid out and shattered on the floor in 1000 pieces.  I also don't like the knob vs a keypad. It actually takes a lot longer to dial in the right time. I miss the reheat dinner plate button on my LG the most.  The instructions are crazy complicated. I have to keep the manual next to it to figure out what setting I need to use. If we are streaming a movie we can't run the microwave as it will disrupt the streaming.  Clearly, the accountants and engineers had more input in this design than someone that actually cooks.  I can't wait till this one dies so I can get a different one."
"I purchased this microwave 18 months ago and it just died.  Powers on, panel works, but the start button won't initiate the microwave.  This is the third Panasonic microwave I've owned and they've all had problems.  They work wonderful while working, but the previous ones had door latch issues which are well known.  Searching the internet, Panasonic microwaves suffer from a myriad of common issues (esp. the door latch issue).  This time - this problem can be caused by Panasonic using too small of a gauge of wire leading to microswitch issues, or a couple of other ones.I'm going to buy another one.  Stupid??? yes.  But they're a couple of hundred bucks and if you look at the reviews of the other microwaves of similar size and power, they all suck - according to their purchasers.Do I subscribe that buying a $800 microwave from Dacor, Viking, Thermador, etc would be better?  Don't know, but I can buy 4 microwaves at that price.Will buy this one again and see how long it lasts - I'm not optimistic though.2 stars.  Good while it worked.  18 months... Terrible."
"This is a great looking microwave and worked great for few months.  Functionally it works now, but after few months, every time I run this microwave it will shut down all my internet connection.  It became progressively worst, first if I run for couple of minutes, my SmartTV would stop.  After few months, my zoom stopped working and now when the microwave is on, everything comes to a still. Seeing it progressively interfering, I am worried the leak radius has increased.  Considering the well being of the family, though it is functional I am going to trash this.  I would request the product team to take a look and inspect the device thoroughly for leaks."
Rotary dial control doesn't allow for second-by-second control past a certain point. Hard to make microwave popcorn.Look for the 1250 watt Panasonic oven with touch button controls and you'll be much happier.
"Worked well for just over two years. No error codes, and out of the blue started making zapping sounds with sparks. And now the united are $150 more than what they were 2 years ago."
"It is LOUD!  Everyone the power blinks, you have to reset everything including the child safety lock!!!  When will they give us a backlit keyboard.  Did I mention it is too LOUD!!!"
Stopped working within the year.
"We purchased this microwave in January and received it in February.  After two months of use, we can safely say that this microwave is NOT worth the price.  It cooks terribly unevenly.  For instance, if we put in something on 1 to quickly warm up, it's either piping hot or cold as ice.... and I'm talking about the same something, like let's say a cup of water.  It's either piping hot on 1, or hasn't even begun to get warm.  Then there's the actual plate of the microwave.  The holder in the middle of the microwave is soooo small and shallow, that the plate FREQUENTLY slips off and is a pain to re-align.  All in all NOT satisfied with this microwave, but recycled the box and now we are stuck with this super expensive thing that doesn't heat properly.  Also the lock mechanism for the door sometimes doesn't work, so the door pops open when its not supposed to.  If I could ask for my money back, I would."
Microwave does not reliably heat a simple cup of coffee. The door sounds tinny and does not close properly. It looks and sounds cheap.  There is only a small useless button size  light inside the microwave so you cannot truly see what you cooked without using a flashlight.  The clock would not work as it constantly loses time.  The numbers on the exterior are dull and you can barely see what they are to set the time or the item you want to cook.  It is just poor value and cheap construction.Would not recommend.
The older models had a sticker inside the door with all the preset settings.  Now you have to look up the preset in the manual or dial up through the knob till you find the one you need.  Ridiculously time consuming having to dial up through 20 presets and then wait for each preset to show up on the screen to see if it is the one you need.  Sorry but this is a big waste of time.  There is no way I could recommend this product.
"I would have given this five stars, because it's a great appliance and lives up to the hype and price tag. However, after only three months of use, the microwave has essentially stopped functioning. The timer will count down a few seconds, but it won't actually microwave. I've requested a refund and plan to re-purchase the identical microwave because my husband spent hours and hours creating the exact space for this microwave to be built-in and low enough for our kids to reach. Purchasing a different microwave with different dimensions is out of the question because the specs are so specific to convert it to a built-in within a cabinet. I'm hoping the replacement will last longer than 3 months."
"It came looking like it was dropped kicked !!!It would not sit level on the counter, and the door would not line up properly !The interior styrofoam was broken and just laying in the box !Ordered another, hopefully better results.It's just a major issue dealing with such a large and heavy item to return 😢"
"The microwave is spacious with good cooking features. However, it failed in only e years. To add insult to injury, Panasonic doesn’t sell the critical part required to install another oven, which is part of the trim kit. Buying an entire trim kit cost more than the oven itself."
"This microwave does a very good job at what it is supposed to do.  It is easy to operate and looks great.  The interior is easy to clean.  However, this microwave WILL INTERFERE WITH YOUR WIFI! I have several smart home products in my kitchen (Smart display, switches, echo dot) and they all go offline when operating this oven.  They do load back up within seconds of the microwave turning off, but this is a real issue for me.  If you have any smart devices in your kitchen, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
"There is nothing to dislike about this model, save for the common death H98 error. For $250 I thought this was a durable appliance, but after researching my options, I learned that these inverter microwaves commonly fail within 36 months, as mine did. The warranty options tend to place one in the position of a repair rivaling a new purchase and the addition of no microwave for the term of the repair. My last Sharp microwave lasted 10 years for around $100. $10/year vs. $83/year value in my Panasonic purchase. I am very disappointed in the Panasonic customer service experience. 15 minutes navigating the phone support to reach a person, only to be asked if my issue was a microwave with an H error code. Upon replying yes, the automated phone support instructed me to call my local service center and hung up. Unacceptable. I would not recommend anyone spend a pretty penny on Panasonic, since they offer no support on a seemingly premium item."
"I replaced an older same size Panasonic Inverter with this one. I wasn't sure about the ""Cyclonic"" feature, but went with it figuring it would be better.  Instead, what used to take a minute for coffee water now takes two minutes and re-warming food takes longer than before.  I'm not seeing any advantage from the ""Cylonic"" part of this microwave.  I have to wonder had I ordered the standard inverter if it would be performing the same as my older one."
We purchased this microwave after reading reviews and reputation.  Our previous microwave was GE and lasted 18 years.  This model was purchased in March 2019.  It doesn't have as many features we were used to with our old model and were disappointed with that aspect.  Performance otherwise has been acceptable.  Unfortunately it stopped working this week.  It's still just barely under warranty so not certain how this will turn out.  Overall I'm still giving it a 3 rating.
In four months it quit working (this replaced a Panasonic I had for 5 years). H98 code says the power supply is damaged. It heated great due to the inverter. This was the latest model to have come out. Panasonic is sending me a check so I can replace this microwave. I plan on buying another Panasonic but different model this go around.
Lasted less than 3 years.  Then it started sparking and almost caught fire.  Piece of garbage.
"Not sure what to think here.  Was excited to get this, but it has obviously been opened, taken out of the box, plugged in, and then repacked to be sold to me as a ""NEW"" item.  I'm not sure if there's something wrong with this unit, but don't think I'll keep such an item when I purchased something that was sold as new."
My older microwave is still going strong after 23 years.  This Panasonic microwave died after 3 1/2 years. I'm never buying another Panasonic microwave.
"I did really Like this microwave. I bought it February, 2022. Worked great. it started to make a really bad noise and looked like fire coming out of grail in side the microwave.I thought I would try to contact some one from Panasonic that there might be firer hazard and what I should do now.I don't think they have customer support.  Buy a Panasonic and if there is problem well tough luck.So I would not buy a Panasonic anything there is NO support at allI would not Buy this Microwave It might last a year and you could heave a fire too"
"After 11 months of light use (one person in household), the mica cover over the beam broke. Unlike other ovens, this is surface mounted with plastic plugs. The plugs break, the mica cover breaks, and cannot be replaced.Other brands do not have the same exposed mica cover. Do not buy or be sure to buy with extended warranty ONLY."
"Microwave shows error code of H98 in less than 3 years.  This indicates the magnetron or other critical parts which kills the microwave's operation.  Panasonics service location in 124 miles from my home, and the magnetron is covered for warranty for 5 years for parts only, nothing else is covered including labor.  I already had the magnetron replaced, and it still has the same error and is not functioning.  long term quality is questionable, would not buy again, especially since the current price is $399.  Mot impressed with product or Panasonic warranty/service.  Currently shopping for an non Panasonic alternative"
"Hi, Oven stopped working .  Amazon.com gave us  Panasonic warranty support information. We took oven for repair at Panasonic  Repair Facility  4900 w side Ave , North Bergen NJ 07047 Phoen number 908 355 4770. Their repair facility and support runs some kind of scam . They took oven  in Jan 2019. Its month of July 2019  and they refuse to return product.  Dont buy this product at all. It is piece of Junk and even if any problem comes Pansonic will  send you on goose chase. Company will tell you to talk to repair facility. Repair Facility would not return you product back if you drop off for repair. You are better of buying  some thing locally.  Amazon.com should not list  Such kind of product on their web which sells faulty products and steals stuff from you. I have left any negative review on  amazon.com  but i have no choice as  No would think  Company Like Panasoic would steal the stuff and wont return product you send for repair at their facility.Thanks but No thanks."
"The Microwave itself is fine, but they did something so stupid inside this thing that I only gave it 1 star.There is a Wave Guide Cover right inside on the right when you open door.  This thing is removable and dimension is 3x5 inches made of a Mica material which you can not clean if splatter gets on it.  I mean like red pizza sauce or whatever, it stains this Mica material permanently so this section of the microwave will eventually look the heck from all the gunk that hits it and forcing you to buy another piece of this material when you can no longer stand to look at this.I can not believe they designed this with this piece of garbage inside it to cover the wave guide instead of a piece of material that can be easily cleaned like rest of microwave inside.  Also you can break this cover if not careful as it is not strong like metal and once it gets so much Goo on it it might just fall apart.I might return it cause far as I am concerned it's defective.You been warned :)"
"It's official - Panasonic makes garbage microwaves and somehow they are getting more expensive! Had a Thermador (rebadged Panasonic) built-in unit, which had been problematic and finally crapped out after a few years. Not willing to pay $2k for a ""luxury"" Panasonic, decided to buy a real Panasonic which fits the built-in space. Same stupid loud troublesome door latch design and even less reliable. It started to cut the heating timer short just after the 1-year warranty period expired, soon progressed to not heating at all even if it completes the set duration. And finally it refused to start running period with a persistent H97 error code. Panasonic refuses to help with troubleshooting or compensating unapologetically. Will never buy their products again!"
"The door is difficult to open.  When the door opening button is pressed the door doesn't always open and it has to be pressed multiple times.  The lighting on the interior is very weak.  The interior is a dark color and it is very difficult to impossible to see things inside when the door is closed.  Why have a clear glass window if the inside can't be seen.  The numbers on the control panel are very difficult to see, poor contrast."
"This product failed unexpectedly after less than five months with what is evidently a common error involving the cyclonic inverter.  Of course, Panasonic does not make it easy to get warranty service, involving a painful and extended text chat.  They then determined, after some time that the two appliance service companies in my area that were listed under my warranty coverage would in fact not do my warranty service (presumably because Panasonic does not reimburse them sufficiently)Then after refusing to pay for my repair locally, they then refused to refund my money or send me a new product either.  My only solution was to wait for them to ship me a box and then ship the box with Microwaveback to them with my broken microwave for repair.  This process would take at least two weeks--but probably more--  we are a family with five kids and that is a long time to be without a functioning microwave.Avoid the product and the company, which will not stand by its merchandise."
"Everything works pretty good with this Microwave EXCEPT THE PUSH BUTTON DOOR OPENING SYSTEM IS SO POORLY ENGINEERED, IT ONLY WORKS HALF THE TIME.  BIG THUMBS DOWN!!!  We like everything else about this microwave but if the door doesn't open when you push the door OPEN BUTTON...NOT WORTH .02 cents.  Apparently this model is known for having this problem, already returned the 1st. one ordered, a brand new one straight out of the box with the same problem.  Not sure who got ""paid off"" on the Inspection and Quality Control line turning a blind eye and letting this issue roll out the door.  Really not useful if you can't open the microwave door only half the time...Thinking about returning it if the problem persists...."
Weird sustaining buzz noise sometimes and I have no clue what causes it. Cuts off blue tooth headphone signals when I'm cooking jn the kitchen. Wish screen was more efficient with how it does its blue text because it's distracting at night when showing the time. Still a great microwave so far just weird.
"I bought this oven because I wanted a really nice, large one.  It was top rated by Consumer Reports.It does cook nicely.  Originally I would have rated it 5 stars.But . . .In less than a year of use, the door opener is becoming very hard to operate.  I think it is probably just a cheap spring, but the latch does not move enough to release the door.  It is becoming more and more of a struggle to open the door.  UGH!"
"First of all this unit is expensive for the functionality:-no speed cooking  buttons,… like: 1= 1 minute, 2 =2 minutes,…- light is so poor, impossible to see anything inside cooking- inside cavity dark gray,… really? A white inside cavity make more sense- confusing description related to unit material: called a stainless steel unit/ silver. Stailess steel is just some of the front door face, everything elese is silver painted plastic and silver painted metal,…. LameBetter options out there at a fraction of price"
"I thought that I got a good microwave because it heats up well and it looks nice from the outside. But unfortunately, I bought it in April and it went totally dead on me after 5 months. Not happy about it because I thought Panasonic was a good brand.  I""m so disappointed  that it only last that long. Too bad, this microwave was pretty powerful and heats up foot really well."
these will still rust out on the bottom like all the others and the wear starts under the little roller wheels you know the circular track  I put a magnet all over inside and out and it is steel  they should noy lie
"Has ample power. Unfortunately the reheat function doesn't work. It is supposed to display the remaining time once it detected steam, well. I had to stop it several time with the dish steaming and being already starching hot and there was no remaining time displayed. Of course I had an appropriate microwave cover over the food with plenty of holes in.I guess the automatic feature just doesn't work, otherwise it would be 5 stars."
"I researched quite a bit and settled on the Panasonic Cyclonic Wave, ignoring the negative build quality reviews, and chalking those up to a few defective units.Loved the 2.2cu size, features and styling, however, on the 2nd item I attempted to cook in the unit I got the often mentioned DOOR error. I would close the door, press start and get a ""Close Door"" error on the display. Pushing the door latch and re-closing several times did nothing, even unplugging and re initializing didn't stop it.I decided to return the oven, since that same problem seems to be frequent and didn't want that hassle over it's lifetime. I chose another Inverter oven, though, as that technology is a huge leap over any others I've owned."
The door was not properly aligned and the Microwave worked well for a little over 2 years. It stopped working (started showing H98 error) as Magnetron and controller board were completely burnt out after 2 years.  Labor and Parts Warranty is only for 1 year and Magnetron is covered by 5 year parts only warranty (you pay for labor) but Panasonic won't cover the controller board under the 5 year Parts Warranty.  Their repair center will charge you additional money just to drop off the dead microwave even if they can't repair it.
"Purchased in 2021 with an extended warranty.  Product quit working within a year.  Returned,  Decided to go with the same one so purchased it again with an extended warranty  Product quit working again.  Decided I gave it a go twice and it quit working both times so I won't be purchasing it again.  Too bad because it is an amazing product and we really enjoyed it."
"Eight weeks after purchasing the unit, while heating a glass of milk, the machine started vibrating, then there was a flash of light, a poof, and smoke.  No longer usable.  Might be due to the Cyclonic technology."
"We have only used this microwave for about 4 months and the center wheel that holds the glass plate has melted.  Because it is under warranty we packed it up and mailed it to the authorized appliance repair place.  They replied and said that part is on backorder with NO ETA for when it will be received.  We just remodeled our kitchen and bought the cover plate to make this unit look like a built in because we didn't want to have an issue if the real built in had a problem and we thought this would last forever like most microwaves do.  Now we have no microwave, just a hole in the brand new kitchen and no ETA on when we might get this one repaired.  Because of the sizing of the cabinet we are stuck with this model unless I can find another one to fit. :("
"I purchased this Panasonic microwave (NN-SD975S) on Amazon.com on January 24, 2021.  The microwave stopped working a month or two after the microwave’s 1-year warranty ended.I spent more than I wanted to on this microwave ($232.78) because I thought I was purchasing a very good product made by a trusted company; I grew up believing Panasonic and Sony made the best consumer electronic products.  Panasonic is no longer a company that makes good products.  I bought a second Panasonic microwave on September 1, 2021 (before this one had stopped working) to use on a road trip; the second Panasonic microwave did not work.  Do not buy Panasonic microwaves…don’t be fooled by the Panasonic name!  Panasonic makes crappy products now!"
"This microwave cooks food just fine, but it's hard to use a microwave when the door won't open. I have had many microwaves in my life, and this is a first....never have I had a door release button stop working, much less after only 2 years of use! If you plan to have yours fitted into a dedicated opening (with trim) in your kitchen, choose something more reliable than this! We are now faced with a major undertaking to find not only a new microwave that fits, but also having to reinstall a new one."
Well just checked to see if I could return but too late. This microwave takes 3 times longer to heat even on high than my old microwave which was a Panasonic NN-SN966S Countertop  I use to cook instant oatmeal on high in my old microwave in 1:30. To cook this same oatmeal in this microwave takes 2:30 When setting time the option to increase cooking time by seconds stops after 1:00 minute then you can only increase time in blocks of 10 seconds. Using the dial to sett time reminds me of some of the original. I much prefer being able to punch in the time. Oh well I guess I'll try to sell it at a loss. Good example of bigger is not better!
"This is a 2500 watt microwave but didn't heat up as well as my previous 1200 watt Sharp.  Also, the inside light is not bright enough to see inside while food is cooking.  The trim kit that was supposed to fit this model did not fit flush against the microwave.  As another reviewer noted, there are gaps on each side between the microwave and trim kit, big enough to put my finger through.  I wanted a seamless fit, so this was not acceptable to me."
I need a medium size…it’s too big takes up a good portion of the counter 😞
"We liked the Panasonic brand and our previous model worked well for over 10 years. This model failed within 5 months. Panasonic customer support doesn't allow the microwave to be shipped back for repair but has to be taken to an authorized repair center---they are few and far between, but fortunately there was a repair center in my area. The repair center's report was ""Determined wave guide tunnel has been burned by a defective magnetron assembly."" and the microwave was judged ""unrepairable"" and they recycled it.As of this writing, two weeks later, we have not received a refund, nor a replacement microwave, nor any communication from Panasonic regarding this in-warranty product failure. Working with Panasonic's online customer service hasn't produced any results.We're disappointed in Panasonic and will be looking to other brands to replace this microwave."
Not as good as the Panasonic I replaced.  The factory odor lasted for four weeks +. Not only that the fumes hurt my nose and my eyes. Also this microwave is noisier than my last Panasonic microwave.
"When the product arrived, I plugged it in and it did not power up.  I had an electrician check the plug and circuit and everything was fine.  Microwave was defective.  I don't think it got damaged in shipping because the box and packaging were in good shape.  When I boxed it up to return it, I did notice that the stainless steel facing on the front was  slightly off and was holding a button in.  I couldn't get it to pop out and didn't want a bad microwave so I returned it.I had this same model before and was happy so I had purchased an exact new model of the same one.  But after this problem, I just went and got one from a local appliance dealer."
"The very large, heavy glass turntable is not fully recessed. Instead it sits on the same thin plastic wheels as a much smaller unit. We installed the microwave in a custom built in shelf slightly above counter level, but below shoulder level. Still, the entire glass tray slipped out and injured my 14 year old as they were removing a donut from the microwave, before shattering on the floor.Panasonic offered a shipping label and directions that instructed the microwave be  packed for shipping at my expense at a UPS store, so that Panasonic engineers could evaluate the possibility that such a heavy plate could slip from such a small plastic ring. The representative insisted no replacement could be made until the evaluation was complete, and that no waiting timeframe could be goven due to coronavirus.  Fortunately, Amazon accepted my return."
"The microwave began sparking after a 2 months and finally died with a ""H97"" error display-Fatal. Off to e-cycling it went.I was troubled from the start by how flimsy and lightweight the microwave was- easily held in one hand. It was off warranty; because, it was a Amazon Warehouse purchase (Prime- but post 30 days). Out of curiosity, I disassembled it... The microwave generator inside was tiny and very poorly machined. All the internals were also essentially crap.Moreover, it's performance was unremarkable as well. The Dial time adjustment did not work well and using it was actually slower than just punching in the numbers by keypad. It couldn't cook a chicken breast well for me either.Being off warranty, I disassembled it... The microwave generator inside was tiny and very poorly machined. All the internals were also essentially crap."
We ordered this microwave for our kitchen when we had to renovate due to a flood last year. It lasted less than a year. It just stopped working. This is a waste of money. Do not buy it.
It came dented out of the box from the top right side and the door doesn’t open unless I have to pull it with pushing as shown in the picture
"I bought this one after researching different air conditioners and liked that this one offered AC as well as heat, since we don't have a working central unit. I used the AC through the Summer and Fall. It kept the living room comfortable enough. On our 100⁰+ days, it was around 80⁰, which was to be expected. I kept the temp set around 78 - 80⁰ so the unit would cycle off and have a chance to cool down.Now its December and I'm hating this unit's heat function. It started out well enough and was keeping the room decently warm. I did have to elevated it to allow the tubing to drain into a jug so it wouldn't turn off because of a full drain pan and need to be drained every 30 - 40 minutes. However, even with it being allowed to drain, the unit freezes over far to easily and forms condensation on/in the exhaust hose. I have found frozen condensation on the outside of the exhaust hose numerous times, I have raised it and had (A LOT of) water run out of it, it drips the accumulated water all over the floor. You can hear the difference as ice begins to accumulate inside. You'll begin to hear what sounds like chunks of ice falling as it cycles on and off. It cycles on and off more frequently as it's not really heating the room adequately when it is freezing over. The only thing I can do when it begins doing this,  is turn off the power and let it defrost, sitting in a cold room as it does so. I'll now gave to find a different heater that actually works. I had expected with the Black & Decker name, this would be a unit I could depend on to work and do what it was supposed to with minimal frustration. Sadly, it has not lived up to the name, nor the expectation. Since only the air conditioner function has been useful for me, this was a waste of money and I can not recommend it."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            UPDATE:DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!  I made the mistake of not following the reviews & there are a lot of reviews talking about the leaks.. After 2 months I noticed water all over my bedroom, thank goodness I have tile floors OR I would be all over Black & Decker. I cleaned it up not knowing exactly where it came from & continued on using it.. 2 weeks later I see water all over my floor again.  OK now I am getting ticked off. I opened the bottom drain & nothing came out, no water at all. That is how the unit is supposed to work.  WELL I recapped the bottom drain & opened the center drain. Only to see water pouring out. I immediately shut the drain, got the hose ""which is too short"" & drilled a 5/8th inch hole for the drain pipe, SEE PHOTO.Now understand I am using the AC in COOL not DehUmidifier & when using DehUmidifier  mode you must attach the continuous drain. WELL AGAIN I am using it in COOL mod & yet the water is filling up a 96 ounce pan every 3 hours, comes to 3.5 gallons of water just over night & its coming from a place there should be NO WATER. OK so they are sending me a new one & actually I don't want it. After reading the reviews again, this seems to be a VERY COMMON ISSUE with this unit.. I guess I have no choice BUT to take the new one they are sending BUT if I see even 1 ounce of water again I am forcing B&B to take this back & refund my money.. At which point I will buy a second Midea just for the bedroom.This review is tricky, I had another brand ""starts with an M""  for my 800 sf living room that makes my room freezing. BUT I didn't want to spend that much for my bedroom which isd 350 sf.I must start with I live in S Florida where summers are just intolerable.. My building will not allow window AC units for insurance reasons so I needed to buy 2 portable AC units. My 2 ton central air is just not enough to cool down my place in the summer. After 5 years of summer suffering I bought 2 portables.,This Black & Decker 10K is OK & I mean just ok, see my UPDATE REVIEW ABOVE! . It does Cools down the room & makes it freezing during the night.I do have 2 issues:1) First issue is the Blue lights in the control panel, at night it is like a bright night light, way to bright to sleep, so I had to take a towel to cover the top so as to keep my room dark.2)  I have a sliding glass door in my bedroom I do not have a window. So I needed an 8 foot sliding door panel for the exhaust, Yep I have 8 foot sliding door..  the one with this unit only goes to about 60 inches or so.. I still needed 30 inches to cover so I took 2 USPS priority mail boxes & taped them to the door to get my complete exhaust panel to work..  In the photos or video you see what appears to be open air on the right sides, those are covered with 2 inch wide clear packing tape to be sure no hot air gets out..See attached photos.I did a ton of research because I did not want to spend as much as I did for the living room unit.OVERALL  there are better out there depending on what you need & your budget! I have not had this long enough to say how well it stands up to daily use..Maybe I will come back next spring and add durability. I will say this,  can keep my CENTRAL AIR at 80 degrees all of the time & my electric bill has gone down over $3/day1"
"TLDR:  New unit stopped working after 3 months of usage.  Customer support difficult to navigate and you don't get a response in a timely manner, but B&D did support their product and send replacement unit which works.Experience detail:Purchased this product a year ago and it worked great for the 3 summer months I needed it. Stored it for the winter and now brought it up to use this summer and it no longer cools....AT ALL. Compressor kicks in but no cool air comes out. Runs for hours but nothing. Currently contacting Black and Decker support to resolve. Will provide updates as they occur.UPDATE 05/17/2024: Have written support@blackanddecker.com for support on May 16th 2024 with serial number, model information and attached purchase receipt requesting support for air conditioner that no longer cools that's not even 1 year old yet. Response from them indicated they were not the correct department to support portable air conditioners and to reach out to service@equitybrands.com instead. Forwarded same information to that group.UPDATE 05/22/2024: No response from service@equitybrands.com yet. Followed up and CC'd original distro in which they confirmed again they are not the correct group to help. I was hoping someone internally at the company could help direct my request. No resolution or response yet.UPDATE 05/29/2024: Still...NO....response! Does this company support their product at all after sale? Sent follow up request and will attempt to call their support number again.UPDATE 06/03/2024: Received response from the support team that I need to file a 'ticket' via linkhttps://bdachelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us.  Submitted ticket with requested model/serial number information and attached copy of purchase receipt.  Received email confirmation of ticket being filed and was notified it could be 2-4 days before a response is received.UPDATE 06/08/2024:  Warranty support representative emailed requesting a picture of the serial number sticker from the unit as well as pictures of the unit and/or any damage to it.  There was no damage to the unit so sent picture of the practically new undamaged unit.UPDATE 06/10/2024:  Warranty support representative responded back stating that the unit was out of warranty.  I responded again with copy of the purchase invoice as well as copies of all communication with B&D customer support which began prior to the warranty period ending.  They concluded that since the warranty period had just ended that they would help correct the situation by sending a replacement unit, however, that replacement unit will NOT come with a warranty period.  I agreed to these terms.  They submitted instructions to cut off power cord and remove the serial number sticker and then mail those to a specified address (vs having to ship entire unit back).  Once those are received they would process the claim to ship a new unit.**Changed star rating from 1-star to 2-star at this point due to B&D supporting their product.  Issue still not resolved though**UPDATE 06/12/2024:  Shipped requested items to specified address and emailed the confirmed tracking number to the warranty support representative.UPDATE 06/14/2024:  Representative confirmed receipt of tracking number and they have processed replacement unit shipment to me.

Contacted warranty support for update but not response.UPDATE 06/25/2024:  Received email from warrant support that they have just NOW shipped the replacement unit and emailed a tracking number to confirm.  Estimated delivery 06/28/2024 per UPS tracking.UPDATE 06/28/2024:  UPS notification stating they could NOT delivery the replacement unit because when B&D shipped the unit it was missing the apt number.  Submitted address correction to UPS and delivery was rescheduled for 06/29/2024.UPDATE 06/29/2024:  FINALLY received the replacement AC unit.  It works and the compressor is pumping out cool air!  Although B&D needs to work on their customer service response times, in the end they did stand behind their product to make things right.***Updating review from 2-star to 3-star due to issue resolution and I am satisfied.  Would have been higher except some of the communication issues and it took 1.5 months to resolve***"
"This ac cools very well. I love everything about it, except for the noise. It’s almost unbearable.I bought another ac unit before this Black and Decker model that was defective (another brand). The first ac unit shut off after it cooled and never turned back on. So I bought this Black and Decker model since a friend recommended it.I’ll start by saying it cools my room VERY quickly. Like within 2 minutes my room can go from 78 to 75. It’s insane how quickly it works. That exceeded my expectations. I bought this unit because I overheat when I sleep and the person I live with doesn’t want me setting the house ac too low. I prefer 72-74 degrees, so that I don’t wake up drenched in sweat. I like that it comes with the remote.My grievance with this unit is the noise. The unit’s fan noise is good. It’s a moderate whooshing sound comparable to a typical standup fan. That’s great white noise.  However, when the compressor kicks on and the ac is actively cooling, the noise is unbelievably loud. It makes an incredibly loud, disruptive buzzing and vibrational sound. Imagine your neighbor standing outside your window with their lawn mower. That’s what it’s like.Another annoying noise is the beeping. Every button you press on the remote or the machine makes a loud beep. There’s no way to disable that. There’s no “silent mode”. That’s stupid product design if you ask me. It wouldn’t have been that hard to make a silence beep button on it.The instructions manual said it’s it makes noise, it’s on uneven ground. This is not true in my case. It’s on hard flooring and it’s level. The weird part is, if I prop the unit on an angle like the Leaning Tower of Piza, it runs slightly quieter. Another weird thing about this unit is that the lower I set the temperature, the quieter the buzzing noise is. I don’t understand why! So I have to run the unit colder than I would like (69-71 degrees). If I set it any warmer than that, the buzzing sounds like a lawnmower. I speculate it’s running at 60-70 decibels when it’s SUPPOSED to run at less than 55DB.I am no stranger to portable ac units. Yes, they all make some kind of noise. Of course they do. They are ac units after all. But this is the loudest one I’ve ever been around.It’s so noisy, it’s hard to fall asleep with it on. I have to shove my earplugs deeeeeep into my ears and sleep with a pillow over my head. Even then, I still sometimes have trouble.I don’t know how y’all other reviewers are saying this is a quiet unit. I think maybe the one I have is defective. Maybe there’s a loose or broken component inside it. I don’t know.On the plus side, the loudness of it prevents any other noises from waking me up. My family’s noises NEVER wake me, and that used to be a problem before. Neighbors don’t wake me up, knocking, or doorbells. So I guess being loud has some benefit.To wrap up, I don’t think I would recommend this unit unless noise doesn’t bother you and you sleep with earplugs. The buzzing is enough to drive me crazy. Then again, maybe my product is faulty. Even if that’s the case, not a good look for Black and Decker. I thought they had quality products, but I won’t be buying from this brand again."
"I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, this AC is simply fine. It doesn't excel at its job, nor does it really even meet my expectations, but it's also not disappointing enough to me to ask for a return / replacement.For starters, this thing is LOUD. There is no way I can sleep with it on (I have it in my bedroom), as it sounds like someone is running lawn equipment next to me. I have no way to measure the actual decibels, but it's too much. Also mine kind of grumbles a little bit? Like it has a motor inside that already trying to die, but only sometimes.I do like the look and size. It's unassuming, and despite being heavy it is relatively compact (at least, compared to ones with similar cooling ratings - more on that later). And setup was fairly easy - all I had to do was plug in the unit and go. I also appreciate the packaging - assuming your courier delivered it upright, the box slides right off and you're close to being done.I generally like the remote as well - most stuff is relatively intuitive, but I did have to consult the manual for a few buttons. However, it feels like most of the functions of this unit and remote don't actually do anything... For example, on the product page it lists ""Auto Air Swing"". I have toggled that on and off, and there is no distinguishable difference in where the air is blowing. Fan speed? Nope, moving through these does nothing on my device. The one saving grace is that On/Off works and the timer does as well.One of the big reasons I purchased this unit was both the manufacturer and the BTU rating. Black+Decker is a brand that I'm familiar with, and while they have been moving towards the ""everything is junk and replaceable"" model that so many brands are flirting with, I haven't had issues with them... yet. I hope this unit will be reliable, but I'm not impressed so far. The hose accompanying this unit is not well attached to the plastic connector collars, so when the unit is on it blows hot air backwards from the collar back into my room (I wrapped the area in tape, since - and I'm not an expert - hot air is the opposite of cold air, which is what I DO want blowing out of my AC into the room). On top of that, all their advertising uses the outdated and generally inaccurate ASHRAE system, since in that one it's easier to ""get bigger number, is good"". When you find the more updated DOE rating (8,400 vs 14,000), it falls short of some of the competition at the same price. In fact now that I write it out, I do wish that I had gotten the one from a certain wholesale store for the same price...If you don't have local options, this will do, but it's not a great deal for what you're getting. But it's fine."
"Loved, loved, loved this product for 3 weeks. It is quiet, cools quickly, and easy to clean...then our Midwest, high humidity summer set in. Catch basin is too shallow and about an inch off the ground, so removing the tray without spillage was impossible. I ended up placing the unit on a chair with drain hose emptying into a 5 gallon bucket, which had to be emptied at least twice a day. Unless you are okay with cutting a hole in a wall to drain outside, or using a big heavy bucket to catch the water, this isn't the AC for you, Portable, no. It is vented outside, so unless all of your windows are exactly the same width, then no, you can't move it from room to room."
"I bought this unit for a 500 square foot apartment. The unit cannot cool even drop the living room temperature below 74 degrees on a 88 degree day in a 12 foot x 12 foot with 8 foot ceiling while trying to cool the rest of the apartment. I was using box fans to draw air to other areas. After 8 hours I gave up and opened the windows since it cooled off already. The specification 8400 BTU DOE (14000 BTU ASHRAE 128) 700 square feet is not true. The true rating of this product is 8400 BTU. The 14000 BTU ASHRAE 128 rating is marketing to deceive customers and should not be used which is the reason for 3 stars. A good example is audio amplifier ratings such as: 300 watts maximum per channel x 2 / 100 watts RMS per channel x 2. The RMS rating is the true measure of performance in this scenario or example. In hindsight I wish I researched the specification differences of ASHRAE 128 vs DOE/SACC. I went by the square foot rating of 700. I would have picked a different item based on the actual output, but I now have to buy more units to make up for this. I will eat the sandwich I made. They do need to however get rid of the ASHRAE 128 rating since it is not a real-world rating. The good? The unit is pretty quiet actually and the remote is decent and can make everything function from the remote. The fan blows pretty hard, enough to get slight movement of my chandelier. A nice feature is the internal vent swing that you can turn on or off, moves air side to side continuously to get better air distribution. The touch controls are nice. The install required me to use a jig saw to cut some off a section of the second part of the plastic window mounting hardware. (the part that holds the tube in the window) They give you three of these parts. I have narrow windows so I needed a extra 6 inch piece to attach to the main part that holds the tube. This good as it is flexible for installation needs or for odd size windows down to nine or ten inches wide. The foam is cheap and the sun will destroy it to dust. I used the self adhesive rolls from the hardware store. (much better) Ultimately this unit is nice but, would be good for a closed off room or as a supplement assisting another AC unit for larger spaces. It will not do a 700 square foot space in the real world."
"I purchased this new portable Black and Decker air conditioner for my children after their old portable GE one had died after 12 years. Had actually gone through 7 exchanges with the GE model, that we decided when it died, we would try any other brand that hopefully would be out, and B&D was a HUGE welcome change!  When we saw the sale, Was shocked that the 14,000 btu AC was at the 8,000 btu price.It was not just the price that my family decided to give B&D a try. It was the fact our household has many of their products that the quality is so great, many of the tools purchased as far back as the 1980s still work and in perfect condition. Drills, saws, portable ovens, just to name a few. Once went to buy a non B&D radial saw and returned it 20 minutes later after the blade fell out due to the spindle not being welded correctly. That could have caused seriouse injury had not been caught.Anyway, went to use the AC for the first tine today in my children's room, and was shocked to see it was much better than the 18,000 btu AC we have in our bedroom window.The touch panel itself is extremely sensitive. None of that pressing hard like with other ACs where you know the keypad will wear out fast. The keypad is like those esd type light switches, or can even be compared to swipeing an icon on a smart phone. The only annoying part when discovering this was the buffer that stored every keypress that was touched. Imagine trying to set the AC up to the mode you want, but at the same time both children just happen to run their fingers over the keypad as they walked by because heck, thats what kids do. Took a few moments for the buffer to catch up, and was able to set the unit up temporarly until I got the remote unpacked, which was what blew my mind after using the remote to activate Max, which is also called Turbo on different machines. Way the house is made, during heat waves it gets almost as hot as inside a car and whats worse, the ACs that we already own work so hard, they dont cool and just keep the rooms tolerable. 10x10 and 10x20 rooms, and even with air conditioner models made for bigger rooms we hear overworking because the heat is just to much. Amazing, this Black and Decker model proved itself today by not just keeping my kids 10x20 room cool, with the doors left open, the other ACs were able to now keep up. As long as the price stays at $319, Im going to buy 3 more to replace the other window units. Looking at the meter I could barely see a difference, but once I get the electric bill, ill update the review questioner I couldnt answer today.The Pros of the AC are quick cooling, even in the worst of heatwaves.Easy to set up, though wrestling with the exhaust tube to screw on the heads on each end is a pain. No reason B&D not have this done unless it effects price drastically.The power cord is decent length.Remote and instructions easy to read and understand.Ac came with an installation package that has every part to make it easy to install into just about every normal type of window, including those tall windows which cant fit a normal AC in.The plastic adjustable tabs that came with unit were very heavy duty. From another review I read that said it was flimsy, the items included were very durable. Either B&D made changes since that review, or they got a return with wrong parts.Not sure why Amazon shows a seperate exhaust kit to be purchased as a recommendation, as the one included with the AC is definately good enough.Cons:Despite all the good mentioned above, I am forced to have to return this unit. The one shipped me has an issue with the fan inside on the left side. This wasn't due to damage during shipment. This was because someone failed to test the fan before allowing it to be installed into the AC.Ever buy a fan, or window fan and due to warped plastic, the fan hits against its own casing? Thats whats wrong with this AC. The fan is hitting its own caseing. Thats why I called it a Friday model. Had the unit been tested properly during assembly, it would never have left the door, which is very unlike B&D. Normally big items like this get tested before being shipped. Most likely, a tech left after failing the unit, but production manager saw to them what looked like a completed unit and most likely sent it off to be shipped. Seen this happen myself over the years.This is not due to shipping packaging being left inside which is also another issue I seen over the years, where instructions arent read, and items being returned as broken due to shipping foam and plastic being left inside.Sadly, a bad fan was used. Otherwise, this would have been perfect."
"I bought this in June 2019 and I live in Florida, so this this was a necessity in my room which had poor airflow from the central unit, and I have a computer in here so it's basically a space heater.I'll start with the good things:It works. I put it to a temperature, and it attempts to bring it down to that temperature. It has that ""mist technology"" so the drain rarely needs to be drained. I have only drained it once, and barely anything came out.The remote is basic, but works fine and gets the job done. It has 3 modes: Cool, Dehum, and Fan. It has fan speed adjustments that can only be changed in Cool and Fan modes, along with a timer and sleep option, along with a fan swing and C/F button. The unit itself has similar capacitive buttons on the top of it next to its screen.Some people won't like the noise, but I love it. I can't sleep in a silent room, so a droning AC unit is nice. It's not particularly loud, but not quiet either.Now for the negatives:The setup is an absolute nightmare. I have a vertical window, and the instructions say the exhaust is designed for both vertical and horizontal windows. The included ""slider"" kit is very large, with all 3 pieces attached, it probably reaches about 5 feet. They include some foam that they claim is enough to cover all of the edges when installing the exhaust, however, they only put in about a foot of this foam. Barely enough to cover the top and bottom, nowhere near enough to cover the sides. With only foam on the top and bottom, there are a TON of gaps for air to pull in from outside, and I was forced to duct tape all of the edges to make sure no air leaks out. Even the quick-attach of the exhaust tube has gaps in it for air to escape. The exhaust design is absolutely dreadful.The screen on this thing is so bright, and there is no way to turn it off or dim it. I had to put a sock over it to block the light. As someone who likes a very pitch black room to sleep in, it seriously stands out and looks like a blue flashlight lighting up the room. Some people might like the night light, I suppose. Not me.There is no way to have the fan off when the compressor is not in operation. When the unit is on, the fan is on. I would've loved a setting to have the fan turn off when the compressor turns off, so that when working in the room, you only have to deal with loud noise when the room needs to be cooled. There is an ""auto"" setting, that turns the fan down to the lowest setting when the compressor is off, and then turns it to high when it turns on, but I still would love the fan to just be off when the compressor is off.The temperature adjustment for the Cool mode is more of a suggestion than anything. I have a thermometer next to my desk and I can see what temp it is in my room. Sometimes if I set it to 74(F) degrees, it will not turn the AC on until it is 80 in the room. Sometimes it will be on too much and cool it to 70 and below. It rarely attempts to keep it around the temperature you set. This is my biggest issue with the unit, as I can't afford to have it running 24/7, but I would like it to actually keep the room cool.The Dehumidifier mode has no temperature selection, and just has the compressor on the entire time. This is incredibly odd to me. I haven't used this feature much if at all because it just constantly cools the room to whatever temperature it wants.All in all, I'm kind of half and half on this. I would never buy another one, and would never recommend this exact one to anyone else. But, it keeps my room cool (most of the time) and that is it's entire purpose at the end of the day. I just wish the setup and the temperature selection weren't so awful."
"I based my main criteria in buying this particular unit on the stated dimensions of 24.8"" x 14"" x 15.3"", mentioned in multiple places on their amazon ad and even showing the dimensions in an image. All wrong. They put in a disclaimer? ""Dimensions may vary by design."" What does that even mean? What is the purpose of dimensions except to be exact? I needed this to be 24.8"" high so I could store it under a table in the Winter time.  Without the wheels, it will just fit. The actual dimensions with wheels are 11.5"" x 16.5"" x 26"", if anyone is interested.Another thing is that the picture is not even of the unit I was shipped. The picture shows a bump out in the back of the unit. My unit is straight up and down. What is the purpose of pictures if they are not the unit you will get?It was missing the foam tape sealant and the screws. I tried calling the number they give before doing a return and what you will get a recording that says they will call you back in 24-48 hours. We will see.Probably the hardest part to assembling this is getting the ""hose"" hooked up to the adapter to the machine and to the window exhaust adapter. Quite hard to ""screw/turn"" the two adapters onto the hose ends.Other than the previous, I thnk I like this unit. It does throw cold air. The room temp was 76 degrees. I set the unit at 75 degrees and gave it some time to cool the room. I checked it in half an hour and the room was down to 75. I then turned the temp to 74 and gave it an hour. I came back and the room temp was 74 and the A/C just had the fan blowing and not throwing cold air. I'm actually kind of impressed.I do not trust any of these types of products to work good. I bought the 4-year extended warranty and I am glad because I do not expect any type of service from the manufacturer after my experience on the phone trying to just get foam tape and screws.I put a water sensor on my tray that holds the A/C."
I'd like to start by saying that I've ordered this a little over 1.5 months ago. So LONG term is yet to be determined. I'd say that it is definitely decent but don't think it's going to ice over your room. We have a small living room and kitchen that are somewhat adjoining. It's taken our house from 85 or so down to 75 or so on hot days. I would approximate the space to about 500sqft due to our entire house being 980. It has developed a slight rattle. I'm not sure how or why it's been stationary in the corner not moved since I installed it. It is pretty large compared to the other one we have to cool off our upstairs space. It definitely does a better cooling job than that one. The vent im not a fan of. It will point straight up or at a slight angle forward. Not down or straight out. Overall I'd say that I'm pleased but concerned about the rattling noise as far as the overall longevity of the unit. Something worth mentioning is that our unit did not come with the plastic insert for the window. I planed on making a permanent hole in our wall anyways so didn't affect me. But I looked into getting one and I either had to return the unit and hoped I got one with the next one that came OR contact black and decker and go through their customer service. Either way if I had planned on hooking it up through the window I would have had to get pretty creative for the mean time.
"Thank GOD i bought these units for my bedrooms for this past summer! Me and the fur babies really suffered through the heat wave the year prior even with a swamp cooler and double fans on at all times. So down the rabbit hole i went looking for portable A/C units.With the unit on the highest speed and coldest setting, it’s not that loud. I have standing fans that are louder than both my units combined. I can easily watch tv in my room on the low sound setting I normally use  (without the unit on) with the unit on high.My biggest complaint is you can’t really adjust the air direction (up or down, left or right). Also there isn’t a lot of a/c air output.  When I needed the cold air to be pushed around the room, I ended up placing an oscillating tower or standing fan in front of it to get the air to move throughout the room.Also when purchasing these i would recommend going up one more level than the recommended one.  One of the units I purchased was for a larger room and it worked so much better, then the second unit that I purchased based on the seller’s recommendation for the square footage. The temperature difference was really felt when it was time to sleep. One room’s temp (the higher powered unit) was cool enough to need a blanket and I used the sleep mode frequently so I didn’t freeze all night versus the room (with the recommended unit size) that just barely cooled off the room. And even some nights, the unit was set at 62 WITH a standing fan pointed right at the bed and it was still hot and uncomfortable.If you’re going to spend the money on something like this, it’s better to spend a little bit more, go with the unit for a larger room.  It’s worth the money when you can enjoy the benefits of a cool room after dealing with the heat all day.The units are easy to wheel around and set up wasn’t that difficult. But I also didn’t completely seal up my windows because I still use them during summer. I also was able to get the window adapter adjusted for easy removal and to put back in place.I’m not opposed to purchasing this brand again however I will be looking for something with a stronger air output and with the capacity to shift the air direction. I most likely will be purchasing a couple more units for next summer. This unit isn’t a complete “no”  on buying again but for the price,  i will definitely be looking (again, heavy sigh) at other brands to see if I can find an A/C unit with better air output and directional control."
"I am used to having window air conditioners that are $50 out of Walmart. They make a room ice cold by the morning. Unfortunately this particular model really just kind of takes the humidity out of the air, I have it on the highest level all night long. Sometimes an hour before I even get to my room. When I wake up in the morning. It's just pleasantly cool, not cold and if it's a super hot and humid day outside, it doesn't really get cool in the room. Just takes out the humidity in general. The draining on this is intense.You need at least a gallon and a half sized bucket for it to drain into continually, there are days where I know it's super humid so I had to get up in the middle of the night to empty the bucket out or it spills all over the floor. Lately I live Northeast and it's been very hot and humid, it's gone through  2 gallon size bucket One and a half times a night at least. Not overly impressed with it. I wish it was much stronger in the sense that it was colder. If I had the choice, I'd take the $50 Walmart window sized air conditioner. Unfortunately, the apartment I live in has ridiculously narrow and wide windows so it does not work"
"I have purchased this AC unit twice because it’s more affordable at the moment and I live in south Texas so a cheap ac is better than no ac when your low on funds. It works well enough. It cools if it’s below 90 degrees but once outside temps reach 95 or above there are some issues with keeping cold.HELPFUL TIPS FOR USUNG ( this does require a weekly upkeep)1. Don’t let it run for hours on end the tube will heat up and generate heat within the room.2. Dust and vacuum out the filters weekly so nothing gets clogged3. Drain the water at least once bi weekly if not weekly to prevent mod growth and use the fan cycle for about 30 min after.Step 3 is only needed if you live in very humid climates but they do require to drain at least once a month.The first time I got the ac it lasted a total of 4 months and customer service couldn’t help. Let’s hope the new model lasts longer.The three stars is due to the absolutely horrid customer service. You will never get anyone than a snarky man who can care less about the unit malfunctioning or not working. Asking to be transferred to a higher rep or the US office is impossible because they hang up on you. They will not give you a new model to send it just take it as you’ll never get that 400$ back and you’ll have to buy a new unit.Working in customer service if this is who black and decker have to represent them then this company won’t last much longer they use to be a respected brand with great quality products and what they have now is laughable.If your short on cash and need something simple to cool your room then make the most of it for however long it lasts. If you have more time and money to research and shop around then please do that anything is better than dealing with the sarcastic, condescending, rude customer service reps this brand employs."
"If you have a drafty house and you don't care about energy efficiently, or phone app control ,this unit could work for you.The room I aimed to heat and cool is exceptionally well-sealed. I applied caulk to all cracks which could allow any amount of air in (or out).I attempted to use this on a room with an extra tall ceiling and about 200sqft, which is smaller than the recommended size.The fan on this unit is incredibly powerful, and when turned on low, it creates so much negative air pressure that it forcefully pulls the seals back on the door and it caused a whistling noise (too loud to talk on the phone). Around the door, I could easily feel the outside air being sucked in.In addition to the disturbing noise of the door seals, when I opened the door, there was so much negative pressure created I had to be cautious to prevent the door from slamming into my face!This example demonstrates why single hose AC units are impractical!! They only work in drafty rooms (without the above problems) and are inefficient due to all the air they extract from the room, leading to outside air and humidity entering through cracks in the building structure.I replaced it with a Hisense dual-hose 10k BTU unit (with heat), and the noise is low (enabling phone conversations), and also the door seal did not whistle (thanks to the dual-hose design - completley eliminating room negative pressure).For the price of this B&D unit, I would have expected it to include WiFi control. I chose Hisense for its 2 individual hoses because I run the hoses to basically 2 dryer vents. If I hadn't needed to use dryer vents for exhausting the heat, I might have chosen the Midea since it offers WiFi and heat and effectively a dual hose design... but they have a single tube (tube-in-a-tube design) that wouldn't easily adapt to my existing 2 dryer vents.The B&D remote is infrared, so you have to aim directly at the unit (surprisingly outdated for 2024; why not control via a phone app?)."
"i purchased this unit over a year ago. i wish i could write a glowing review but i absolutely can't as i have been fighting with their customer service to get some kind of functional unit for over a year.this unit arrived without a hose inlet valve - i thought ok no  big deal, i figured i could just call customer service and have one sent to me or that i could purchase a replacement part. OH I WAS SO MISTAKEN! i called customer service and was told they had to make the part and that it would take about 2 weeks to get to me - again i thought no big deal i can wait its ok. the customer service rep told me to call back next week for a status update.i called in the next week and immediately realized this is was not going to be the smooth experience i had hoped for. when i called, the customer service rep told me they couldn't see a change in status, that the warehouse was very busy and that'd get to my order when they could but to call back next week to see how things were proceeding. so i did. i called in OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER EVERY WEEK FOR OVER A YEAR!after months of being stuck in a loop of weekly calls with black and decker customer service with no progress that was slowly driving me insane, i reached out to the asurion protection plan i purchased with the unit to see if something could be done. surely the protection plan i purchased could do something to help with this issue - if nothing else help me escalate this problem right? well surprise surprise manufacture defects (like no including parts) is apparently not covered. so not only do i have a non-functional AC unit but i also had a useless protection plan as well. i was sure the universe was laughing at me at this point.at this point in time its been well over a year that i have continued to call black and decker week over week for updates with no progress or help. i have NEVER received the part needed to make the AC functional or even an accurate ETA, which means for over a year i have had a useless/non-functional AC unit taking up space in my house. i have called customer service more times than i can count. i have tried escalating to see if there's anything that can be done. i've tried buying generic parts and rigging them to work with the machine. i've tried opening tickets on the black and decker website. i am at my wits end with this.i've reached the point of considering just accepting my loses and buying a new AC unit which is completely ridiculous based on the price of this unit and (i thought) black and decker was a good company.i wish i could leave a good review or write about a good customer service experience, but i can't. what i can say with 100% certainty is buyer beware - if your machine arrives without parts, or breaks, or has anything happen you are on your own. black and decker will do nothing to help make it right. i can whole heartedly say that after this experience i will NEVER purchase another black and decker product for the rest of my life."
"I bought this air conditioner in April 2022 because it was rated very highly on a couple of websites. I couldn’t use one of the more efficient dual hose A/Cs because of a small space and I liked that it was white (why are so many A/Cs black?) because it blends with the walls.For two years, I was pretty happy with it. It’s not as good as the dual hose unit I have in another room, but it served its purpose within my constraints. And then it started making an intermittent, but increasingly more frequent clicking noise. It sounds a little bit like someone tapping artificial finger nails. I think it’s because the little vents have loosened with time. I might try to superglue them in place to see if that works.Unfortunately, warranties for everything are short these days and this is no exception. I think that this is probably about how long they hoped it would last.Three stars because it technically works at cooling the room and at driving me crazy."
"I just received this air conditioner two days ago.  I'm in Louisiana where the heat index is 110-115 most days lately.  My central air just can't keep up (older home).  I was hoping this would help lessen the load on my central unit, but it isn't quite that simple.I initially put this in my living room with it pointed at my hallway where my AC is located along with my thermostat.  Basically after an hour or so, my living room was very cold, but that's where it stopped.  My AC unit kept running and the temp slowly went up in the other parts of the house during the day.I then moved the AC to my bedroom, which is closer to my hallway, and pointed it at my hallway to try to reach a little more area.  So far, that hasn't really worked out either.  But, it did keep my bedroom cold last night and I slept great.As for the unit itself, it isn't very loud.  I sleep with a fan on every night, and this wasn't much louder than it.  The touch buttons on the unit itself are very finicky.  If you barely run your finger over one of the buttons by accident, it will change your settings.  Remote seems to work fine.  My biggest complaint is the hose and window housing.  The hose is huge.  If you have curtains, it's not going to look good.  But, as hot as it has been, I don't care at this point.  I plan on removing it and storing it away as soon as the weather changes.  The window housing is ridiculous.  If you live in a high crime area, I don't suggest this unit at all.  There is nothing stopping anyone from just walking up to your window and lifting your window to come in.  Also, I suggest going to buy some weather stripping to use.  The stripping they provide does little to nothing (especially in an older home).Overall, it isn't doing what I had hoped it would do (help my AC out), but in the evenings, my bedroom is the hottest room in the house and this helps tremendously.  Basically, it's only going to cool the one room you put it in.  I guess I could put a fan up to push the air more, but I don't have the room for all of that.  I can't comment on the draining part, because I haven't done that yet.  I should probably go check that now though..........hmmmmm"
"Update: 8-9-2024 Disregard most of my previous review. It was partially operator malfunction. When I disconnected the unit after it's first use, I stuffed the foam seals into the duct for storage. It was preventing air passage so that's why the unit would only blow cool for a few seconds. Once I cleared the duct, the compressor engaged and stayed engaged. I still feel it doesn't perform as expected for a 12,000 BTU unit. I would say it's perfect for a 150sq ft rm. Not the 550 proclaimed.Previous review:I've kept this item in the box as a backup to my central unit. I finally need it 11 months later and it operated average for about 3-4 days. It was shut down for a week and needed again. Now no matter which mode it's in, it's only blowing ambient air. The compressor kicks in at random moments and only for a very short time. I placed a 15+ year old 5000BTU window unit in it's place and it's vastly outperforming the Black & Decker 12,000BTU. If you purchase this product I recommend removing it from the package immediately and utilizing it for a couple weeks to ensure it's going to work for you."
"I thought this would be an easy purchase and a slam dunk based on reviews and functionality listed but I am super disappointed.Pros:1.  relatively small and sleek considering that portable AC units aren’t very inconspicuous.2. Has a remote and a couple functions.3. Basically ready to go out of the box (after the recommended settling period of 6-24hrs to avoid damage after shipping).4. Sturdy telescoping window fin. Easy enough to install with two little screws.Cons:1.  It’s pretty loud as others have mentioned. I expect this from an AC unit so not a big deal to me, but for anyone who wants something quiet… a portable ac probably isn’t for you.2. The hose doesn’t snap or thread into the couplers provided (eg. You can just pull on the hose and dislodge it from the window or from the unit itself). I didn’t move the unit around  but it came loose and was blowing hot air into the room for hours.3. The air is just cool not icy cold. This is my biggest issue with this machine. I’ve owned many ac units both window and portable and I’ve never had one that lacked seriously cold air. Don’t get me wrong, the air is cool, but it’s not COLD and it’s certainly not cold enough to moderate any temperatures above 80. Perhaps my unit is just faulty but to send back this lug of a unit and package it back up is likely a far bigger hassle than it’s worth.4. Doesn’t switch to fan mode anymore once desired temperature is reached. When I first tested the unit a couple nights in a row, I didn’t really need the ac on, I just wanted to get an idea of how well it worked and if it functioned properly. The first couple nights ( between 60-65 degrees outdoors) I turned on my unit and set it at 70. Even though the outside was pleasant, our bedroom is upstairs so it is always stuffy and an ac is nice to moderate temperature. On these two test occasions, the unit worked as intended. In other words, when it reached 70 degrees, it switched to fan mode and would go back to AC to keep the 70 degree temperature when necessary. (This is a noisy function). Beyond those two nights, however, it now doesn’t switch to fan. (I’ve had this for less than 3 weeks). In the recent few days, I understand it not switching to fan mode however, as it didn’t cool the room at all. As soon as the outside temperatures reached 80, the ac is no longer able to cool the room because the air coming out isn’t cold enough to compete with 80 plus degrees outside. I’m not asking for a 60 degree bedroom but I should be able to achieve at least 75. Totally unacceptable.5. In order to move the cool air around, you will need a fan. When the room is just stuffy, you still need a fan to push the cool air around. Without it, the ac air seems to just disappear.- yes, I selected the correct size unit for my room. Yes, I understand the difference between doe and ashrae.Again, it may be a faulty unit but I’m super disappointed to have wasted a few hundred dollars on something that doesn’t work as designed."
"Listen, it’s been 90+ degrees for weeks and our window unit is very old. We eagerly purchased this promise of wearing clothing without pit stains and worked hard to wait for it to arrive (remember when prime was 2 days?). Anywho, it arrives and I am struck full of hope and possibilities. As I unwrapped the box, I see the instructional manual. I read her, I reread her. I even glance at the Spanish section just to make sure I’ve understood. I begin the process. First step? The hose is supposed to come preassembled, attached to the two demonic pieces of plastic that had my sweat mixing with frustrated tears as I desperately tried all things to get them to go together. Mine was not preassembled. It took over an hour, many words not appropriate for an Amazon review, and, in the end, duct tape to make this happen. With that being said, as it blasts beautiful air, I can feel my tears and sweat drying. I hope your hose comes preassembled, or that you are a professional wrestler, or hey, both. Wrestlers probably enjoy air conditioning. My geriatric dog has stopped panting as I type this review. I guess it works pretty well."
"tl;dr at the bottom:I think I expected it to be quieter than it is (51 decibels average over the course of 30 minutes), but it's not too bad for what it does. The main issue I have with it is that the coupler/outlet adapter that attaches the exhause hose to the exhaust pipe is darn near impossible to find. I think I found a similar adapter/coupler by Delonghi that may do the trick (sold by walmart), but frankly I'm really upset with how difficult it is to replace such an essential part. Heat makes adhesives falls off so all the duct tape in the world wont hold this bad boy on, although using a system of paracord, a few bandanas, and a liberal amount of flex tape seems to be doing the trick until the possible replacement arrives in the mail. Additionally, have a 3 gallon container on hand at minimum to catch all the water this thing generates once it goes past 85 degrees farenheit outside. You could bathe a small pet or child in the amount of water this thing produces over the course of 7 hours. It also dried out my nasal passage because it blows out dry air which has led to mild discomfort and a LOT of water being drank. The remote does work, but you have to click power once to turn the remote on, then again to turn the unit on. It seems to have gotten a little mixed up over the year I've had it and no longer changes modes or fan speed correctly, but the on-unit-controls still work just fine. Finally, the little wheels it has are fantastic, and the holding indents on the sides make lifting it a much less difficult task than it could have been.tl;dr The rigid exhaust hose adapter which connects the exhaust hose to the exhause port is very difficult to replace. Keep that [adapter] safe. It is not LOUD, but it is louder than an oscillating fan, generally remaining at 51 decibels. It keeps the room cold, but will also dry it out at the same time, which can lead to dried out nasal passages and mild discomfort as a result. Seems to generate a LOT more water once you put it below 70 degrees Farenheit. If you keep this in your room, I suggest putting a book or a hat on top of the lcd screen, because it is bright enough to disturb sleep if you prefer darkness when you sleep. Otherwise it makes a decent nightlight.EDIT: it stopped adjusting temperature after 6 months. Im looking into troubleshooting right now but as of right now it just does cool air at about 70°F regardless of what temperature you put it at"
"I have owned one of these units in the 14,000 BTU (cooling only) model since 2023 and was really pleased with the cooling efficiency.So when I bought another unit this year for my other floor, I expected similar performance. This time I bought a 12000 BTU (cooling only) unit as the 14000 was on back order for several weeks, but after comparing the two units specs and for my intended use I didn’t think it would make much of a difference. (about 150sq ft smaller coverage)Unfortunately I was incredibly wrong and regret purchasing. The parts for this unit are flimsy and cheap, the window kit doesn’t even use actual screws, just plastic peg pieces - and doesn’t extend as far as the other unit’s kit does.(2 panels instead of 3) It can’t even cool a tiny bedroom down, let alone anything else. While the other unit makes things COLD, this one is just kinda cool, if you stand right in front.Overall, feels like a massive waste of money for only a $40 difference when the other unit is so vastly different and better. Makes me kinda mad just seeing it in my house. I don’t think I’d buy another one of any model now."
"I got the 12000 BTU & it grinds my gears that a $400 AC unit can't include an extra hose extender, or make the hose a little longer. It won't even reach far enough so my window can close all the way to the window slider. I will be searching for a piece to either extend the hose, or will block the remiaing space between the window seal & the slider kit. However,  as far as cooling wise, so far so good. It has cooled both my room & me down right away. Let me tell you it took me a half hour messing with the hose one end popping off, then the other in an attempt to spring out the remaining rings to reach it further to my window seal. So I was hot af & mad af & it sure did cool me down quick when I gave up & just turned it on. It is too soon to tell anything else given that it's only been on less than an hour."
"Knocked down to 3 stars because I paid for a new unit but received one that was clearly used - an entire side of the box was cut off and ""repaired"" with packaging tape, the unit didn't have the shipping tape applied to its loose parts that I saw in unboxing review videos, and there was pet hair in the intake filter.  Due to the condition of the box it shipped in I don't really think I'll be able to return it for a replacement, and it works fine as-is, but I'm pretty disappointed in my purchase as a result of this and will not be giving this seller my business again in the future, nor can I recommend that others buy it from here.I bought this unit to cool off a ~300 square foot bedroom that my central air system doesn't adequately cover in the warmer months, it's perfect for that application.  Installation is very easy, you just need a standard size window that slides open (casement windows won't work with the provided equipment) - you might need a screwdriver and a pair of scissors.  The power chord isn't very long (probably around 3 feet or so) and it explicitly says not to use it with extension cords or power strips in the manual so make sure you've got a properly-wired and grounded power outlet within a few feet of the window you intend to use for the exhaust.  The noise level isn't bad, roughly about the same level as a box fan when it's working hard, lowest setting when it's just blowing the fan.  There is a noticeable increase when the chiller kicks on which might wake you up unless you sleep with earplugs.  I've only had the unit for a day and due to the used condition, I received mine in I'm not really sure how long it's been used for so I can't really speak to whether I think it's going to be something that lasts long-term.  Overall I would recommend this unit to people looking to cool down rooms the size of a bedroom or small living room, but I would strongly recommend getting one from an in-person store with a good return policy instead of buying it from Amazon so you can be sure you're actually getting what you paid for."
"In standard auto-cooling mode, the unit works well enough. The firmware implementing sleep mode, however, is hot garbage. The manual says that after the end of 8-hour sleep-mode cycle (in which the temp is slightly raised) the unit reverts to its previous setting. NOT SO. My unit simply shuts off, which is not what you want sleep mode to do.Worse, when I called product support, the phone rep made up a series of nonsense excuses. (Must be a defective sensor! That behavior is exactly what the manual promises!) He then told me to exchange the unit with Amazon for a new one, but it’s clear this is a control-software problem & every unit will have this same defect.On a separate note, the user manual does a TERRIBLE job of explaining how the two separate condensation reservoirs (and their associated drain ports) work. It’s not asking a lot to expect the manual to accurately describe how the product works … and yet Black+Decker fails to deliver. If you thought that brand name stood for quality, you’re in for a rude surprise if you buy this product."
"It cools and heats our 17' x 15' w/vaulted ceiling master bedroom well. As other have stated, it trips our 15 amp breaker sometimes. It really need to be on a 20 amp circuit. It's pretty noisy as well. I'd buy again if I had a 20 amp circuit handy. I wouldn't re buy to run on a 15 amp circuit though."
Got this to help heat/ cool my 600sq ft garage space. It works ok but not amazing. Thought it would do better.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The product description says this portable A/C unit is 12,000 BTU and will work for up to 550 sf room. I received the product and it says 5,950  BTU (DOE test standard); 12,000 BTU (ASHRAE 128 test standard) with Heat mode 10,000 BTU. The DOE BTU is considered most accurate and the size room this would work for is much smaller than what is advertised, other resources say up to 250 sf room. I have not opened the box yet because I may return product because it may not be powerful enough.I decided to give this a whirl and try it out. So far after two days I like it, we’ll see how it works when it gets hotter. The window kit slider was defective missing holes on one side to secure it together with the second plastic bolt provided, so could only secure with bolt on one side, but taped it together. The slider was too short for my window only extending to 49” long but my window is 57” high and slides open sideways so I made a makeshift extension. The weather stripping is very flimsy and easily breaks into tiny pieces on your fingers when applying it. But hopefully it will be ok."
"I've ordered 5 of these Black and Decker portable air conditioners.  The first one I bought 2 years ago.  I was quite happy with it at the price point and btu output.  Because of this, when my parents wanted new air conditioners, I ordered 3 more for them just last month, in May of 2024.  The price had increased a bit as expected but, I still bought the same model.  All three I previously ordered are great so far.  I then took my personal air conditioner, that I purchased 2 years ago, out of storage to use, only to discover it no longer pumps out cold air, likely because of a slow leak in the refigerant.  After much research, I determined that this seems to be an issue with every manufacturer having the occasional faulty model that stop working after some time.  So, I purchased the same model again (5th unit I have bought.)  Well this new one is a slightly different model and has a different style window kit that no longer fits correctly.  I have included pictures of the old model kit and the new model kit to show why, which is pretty self explanatory.  I even tried using the old kit with the new air conditioner but, the new hose is bigger than the old one so, it does not fit.  I contacted Amazon customer service and their only option for me is to return it.  To return the unit is far too much effort and a waist in shipping services.  I asked for a free window kit replacement or a partial refund/discount to cover the cost if a new window kit but apparently that is not an option despite the seller being the actual Black and Decker store (the manufacturer of the air conditioner.)  That being said I am extremely disappointed.  I will update this review if someone can address my problem without me having to return it.  Otherwise, at this point, I HIGHLY recommend finding a different model air conditioner from a different manufacturer.Edit: After reading many current reviews regarding how the AC stops working after some time, I returned it."
"I did read through a LOT about the Pros and Cons of a portable airconditioner. Unfortunately, I had no choice for basement cooling - even though the windows are new vertical sliders, the size of the casements only allow for a 10"" vertical opening, 3"" short of even the smallest window AC unit I could find on the market.First off - if you're NOT one to read the manual, please at least take the time to read the One Page Insert that fell out of the styro tray holding all the loose parts and accessories to this AC. Because it reads to the effect that ""You must WAIT TWENTY FOUR (24) HOURS after this unit has been delivered to you, in order for the refrigerant liquid to settle after transport."" Otherwise, immediately starting the unit will result in inadequate cooling performance.The window kit and placement are key. You need this unit to be unobstructed all around as the backside is pulling in the hot or warm air in your room, passing it over the coils and blasting cold air out the vents while expelling the heat through the exhaust hose.As expected, the window kit as delivered would need to be cut down. A hacksaw does the job on the plastic insert, but be sure to measure twice before cutting! I couldn't get the holes at the top to align (it comes with a dodgy looking plastic screw to keep it in place at the right length), so I just taped it down. The exhaust hose is very finicky even when you've screwed it into the connectors all the way to the stops (i.e., the last turn on the inside of the connector), and the connector on the back of the unit itself is slightly offset - there are stand-off flanges on the opposite clock sides of the quick disconnect tabs - but the one outboard is bigger than the one inboard - they weren't snapped off, so I'm assuming this is deliberate. As a result I spent a few more minutes trying to figure out why it wasn't a positive right angle attachment. The hose itself is relatively short - get this unit as close as possible to the window. Speaking of hoses, see next paragraph.Be aware that in the Product Page here on Amazon, they recommend a bundle where you can buy a longer hose made by KraftEx.The description reads: Air Conditioner Hose. Portable Exhaust Vent with 5.9"" Diameter, Anti-Clockwise Thread & Length up to 80"". Great for LG, Delonghi and Many More Portable Air Conditionersand the link is: https://www.amazon.com/Kraftex-Conditioner-Portable-Exhaust-Diameter/dp/B07KQDGFZH/ref=pd_bxgy_2/146-3160298-3225369?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07KQDGFZH&pd_rd_r=44d543e6-1ab1-4d1d-811c-7bbc1ecb2cb0&pd_rd_w=m1KFx&pd_rd_wg=MPI1D&pf_rd_p=ce6c479b-ef53-49a6-845b-bbbf35c28dd3&pf_rd_r=N56XTS9VN6RNQV3TR79G&psc=1&refRID=N56XTS9VN6RNQV3TR79GBe aware that recommended bundle hose is the WRONG diameter size. It's too big as a 5.9."" You need a 5"" I believe. I bought it because I had done some rule-of-thumb measuring before buying this unit and wanted the comfort of having a few more inches of play with a third-party accessory hose. Nope, that one's going back.So far so good - the cooling isn't arctic air, but it does cut down the temperature. I kept a small box fan running between my desk and where the unit is to help along the airflow.  I'll update this again when I have more humid days."
"I got this air conditioner back in early summer 2017. It ran great, got my small studio apartment well cooled in a short period of time. It's not quiet but it's not the loudest AC unit I've ever heard either. The window/hose situation was probably the one thing I would say isn't great, I ended up having to duct tape the hose on both the machine and window panel side because it just didn't want to stay ""clicked"" in to the plastic fittings. I've read lots of reviews about other portable AC units where the window mount and/or hose are much worse than that, so I'd only take about one star off for that. Definitely the machine uses energy but the bills in the heavy use months weren't double or anything. Probably would've given this a 4 star rating prior to a few weeks ago...A few weeks ago (end of July 2021) it was running one night, began to make a loud clicking noise, flashed ""LT"" on the LED screen, and after that never ran cold air again. ""LT"" is supposed to mean that the coils have frozen over and just need to defrost. This is not something that had ever happened before. That night I turned the machine off for 8+ hours to see if the coils would defrost then, it was definitely warm enough that they should have, but I don't think that was actually the issue. Also spent a lot of time trying to open up the machine as much as one can and making sure there was no ice, or dust or dirt buildup, there was not. The machine does run its motor when in the AC mode now, but even after some time there is just not that refrigerant-generated cold air, it's just more of a strong fan. Not worth it to run all that energy for just a strong fan.After checking around, I discovered that there aren't any repair places in my area (Seattle) that handle this type of machine. And trying to DIY repair it is not reasonable for an average person who doesn't have time, engineering/repair skills, and specific tools. So this is just something that I have to replace. Maybe one day some brand will make a model that can be repaired easily and safely, or maybe more repair techs will catch on and open up their doors for people who would rather repair than replace.Not sure how long the average portable AC unit lasts, would love to see some statistics on that now that so many people in places without built-in AC are now buying units like these. But thinking that I'm going to have to pay $300-$500 every 4 years to replace these machines is tough to stomach. Not to mention disposing of it responsibly, these things should not go straight to landfill. Maybe I got a lemon and they last longer - here's hoping that's true while I shop for my next one."
"This thing will cool a room super fast! It is awesome! However, mine started to cycle between cold air and warm air after about 2 months. All the filters were clean, everything was in tip-top shape. Now, 5 months in, it turns itself off randomly for no apparent reason. Looking at everything, it is clean as can be, so it isn't a clog or dirty air filter or anything.And because this thing is sealed up so tight, I can't even figure out how to get access to the inside to see if refridgerant levels are bad, or if there is leak or clog.Great AC unit, so long as you don't get a lemon."
"After weeks of research, we finally took the plunge on our first portable air conditioner.  With coronavirus, having it delivered was our safest option.We live in a very small home, about 1200 square feet.  We decided on the portable air conditioner as my husband and I are getting older and truly did not want to have to lift the high BTU window units, if we had a choice.  We were replacing a LG 12,000 BTU window unit.We received the air conditioner somewhere around the 2nd week of June.  It took me a while to get the hose attached to both the window insert and the air conditioner.  Although I loved the well-made panel that fits in the window, the hose attachment did not provide a secure fit and easily came loose.  BUT, with years of using window units, I have found that there has never been an ""ideal"" situation when it comes to any of the extensions.The first time we used the air conditioner, my first impression was that it was taking quite a long time to cool off our tiny space of about 250 square feet.  I kept asking my family, as I REALLY wanted it to work.  It did produce cold air, but I remember looking at the thermometer and wondering why the temperature wasn't going down.So, we didn't need to use it for about a week or so due to nicer weather. When we tried it again I actually took notice to how long I had it on and checked our thermometer often.  What I found was that it only lowered the temperature in the room by 2 degrees in 2 hours.  So, to make sure I wasn't losing my mind, we took one of our 5,000 BTU bedroom window units, placed it in another window in the same room and ran it for the same amount of time.  It reduced the temperature by the same amount in the same period of time.  So very disappointed.  At this point, the air conditioner was barely used and looked brand new.Within the 30 day return window that Amazon offers, we called up Amazon customer service and explained the situation.  Customer service was kind, courteous and agreed that it needed to be returned.  Although difficult to return, we decided it was worth the extra effort and returned the barely used, in brand new pristine condition air conditioner.One of the reasons we all love shopping through Amazon is their return policy.  We know that if an item isn't working as it should, they have our back.  But, a month later,  within days of the item finally being received by Amazon, I received an email stating ""We noticed that you have requested multiple returns in the last few months, and some of the items returned by you were not received in original condition.""  The only other returns I had made over the past 6 months were 2 bathing suits that stated free return shipping.  They did not fit, I returned them and ended up purchasing and keeping a larger size that fit.  I tried talking to 2 customer service reps, and there was absolutely no info or details as to why I received this email.  The second rep told me that this was a warning, insinuating that I could be banned from Amazon.  I tried emailing the ""account specialist"" who sent this email to me and received a generic response without any details.My only thought is that in the 3 weeks that it was in transit to Amazon, it may have gotten damaged and Amazon took a huge loss with a $400 air conditioner.  The reason I question the shipping carrier is due to the fact that I have had deliveries left on the side of the road, under my mailbox and boxes that literally look as they they were in a boxing match over the past several months.At this point, after 15 years of being a loyal customer, and having been complemented by Amazon customer service in the past, I am frustrated.  And, although this air conditioner seems to be one of the best for the price, I can't recommend it.  Maybe it was just a lemon, but it turned out to be one, big headache and left me with a tasteless, vague email from Amazon."
"Have not had a chance to use the heat setting yet so I can't speak to that, but have used the cooling setting in a 10'x14' bedroom and it does the job. The downside is that it consumes A TON of energy. I've had it for two years, the first year we turned it on only at night and it consumed about $150 a month worth of electricity. This year so far we left it on 24/7 for 2 weeks as an experiment, and that electric bill saw a jump of about $350.00!! Needless to say, we'll be looking for an alternate cooling solution before next summer.That being said, if you're willing to take on the cost it does work excellent."
Freezes up a lot not able to use spent all that money for nothing
"At the time of my purchase, the product specifications stated that the window panel could be adjusted to fit up to a 59” opening. This is not the case. Not only is the panel several inches short, but the weather stripping provided is several inches shorter than the panel, too. Only after hauling this upstairs and irreversibly opening the extensive packing did I discover this. The product does not match the description, and the accessories don’t match the product. What an outstanding misfire.Once I’ve bought my own weather stripping and shambled together an impromptu adapter to fill the gap not covered by the panel, I’ll be able to actually test the unit and review its cooling capacity. If it works, three stars. If not, one star.Edit:The unit itself does seem to work very well, even with the window-screen still in place. Added a star."
"So far, the 12,000 I bought is working fine. And so I purchased a 10,000 unit for the downstairs. Learned the hard way to TEST the unit before hauling it down a flight of stairs, because the 10,000 seemed to work OK - except it only blew warm air. Yes, the unit was allowed to settle upright several days and was vented to the outside. Furiously this had to be dragged back upstairs, repacked. It's not that light, either.I thought OK, I just got the odd bad one, so I tried again for an upstairs bedroom. THIS unit was blowing cold air about 5 minutes and I was happy. Then it began to make a buzzing noise and when I frantically shut it off, smoke - not water vapor - more like electrical fire smoke - billowed out of the vent. I was horrified and couldn't get it unplugged fast enough.I am so done with this brand as far as air conditioners go. Even tho the 12,000 seems to be working OK - although the hose pulls out of the window holder way too easily. Already purchased a store brand from a big blue box electronics store which so far has been trouble free, humming along, and is cheaper than B&D with some nice features.Giving this a 3 rating because the 12,000 works, and B&D did try to make the set up easy with good directions. The 12,000 would get a 4, so far - the 10,000 - a 1. I've bought B&D products for years - even have their washer as well as multiple tools - but UPS can't come fast enough to this 10,000 out of my house.Finally, I'd do research as to whether these portables will actually work for your situation, and depending, I'd have a PVC cutter, extra strips of insulation foam, and most of all duct tape in case you need to custom fit the plates that fit into your window.  No more B&D air conditioners for me, even if some list it as the best budget brand of ""portable"" (not really) AC."
"Based on my testing today (90-95 degree day, 42% humidity, main floor room) the 12,000 btu unit is appropriate for a 250 square foot room, not 550 sq ft room, as the product description indicates. With the unit on at the highest fan speed and set to 65 degrees, the temperature has been dropping at a rate of .5 degrees every 15 minutes, so it actually may be better for an even smaller room. It’s just not very powerful. I have a 10 year old window unit in my attic that blows this B&D away. That one is actually 12,000 btu, and cools off my crazy hot attic tv room quickly.However, this B&D is easier to deal with than a window unit, you just gotta understand that it’s not very strong.Lastly, the remote is slow to respond and will not let you set the fan to the auto speed. No idea why."
"Got this to attempt to cool down and heat up a ~150 square foot room, and I have been extremely disappointed in the performance of this unit. I have no idea what everyone is raving about, and I'm wondering if I received a defective unit or something? It clearly blows out some cold air, but it is quite loud, which once again confuses me because there are so many reviews here that say it's whisper quiet.I have a thermometer in my room, and gave it an overnight test running in A/C mode for 8 hours overnight with the thermostat set to 61 (the lowest possible temp).Overnight, the ambient temperature OUTSIDE started at 72F, got down to 55F, and in the dawn raised to 68F.The thermometer in my room read that the starting temperature in my room was 80F, and overnight the temperature in my room only reduced to 76F...It just doesn't make sense to me -- if I had it running at max settings like I had, something just doesn't seem to be adding up :-/Also, be very thorough when checking the item when you receive it. Amazon sent me a unit which had recently been returned. How do I know this? They left the Amazon return label attached to the unit, and it was missing the bottom of the box."
"At first the B&D air conditioning works excellent for the first 3 weeks. After that it started to cut off the compressor, no cold air just fan. Now the only way to get cold air is to use the dehumidifier but the fan can only be at low speed; it cannot be change. Also, there is a lot of water draining out and must be empty every 3 to 4 hours. Very disappointed. My 2 LG dual inverter air conditioners after 2 years still working great with no water to empty. Wanted to try B&D for another room. I hope others will have better luck."
Cons: it doesn’t dehumidify and actually adds humidity. It’s less energy efficient then the one priced higher. The back gets extremely hot and adds a lot of sauna heat especially if extended. The exterior fan blades don’t move so the air doesn’t spread effectively(add a fan across the room or a ceiling fan to circulate the air. The setup is harder.Pros. This unit is colder compared to the one priced higher and the fan blade faces down and that cools more efficiently then up. The remote control is ok if close by. The energy bill came down a bit but it’s not the full house so it’s comparable to central ac. The amp usage doesn’t blow my circuit breaker that shares multi plugs on a 20 amp breaker. Make sure you have a 20 amp breaker and whats on it. Love the two year warranty by company. The noise level on this one is less than a fan but it’s still loud.
"I insulated the hose, the hose was long but the heat it pumps out from the hose is a literal radiator, why don't they come pre insulated, frustrating. It seemed to be a net loss on the entire room, only benefit was right in front of it, blowing. I will try to shorten the hose. Uses a lot of electricity- 1600 watts, turns most of it into heat. I know thats the way these units workin general but this one seems much hotter, 140 degree pipe exhaust."
"Purchased in June of 2022.  Using in our living room (about 250 sq ft) and directing air towards hallway.We purchased this to help cool our home during the summer and to take stress off of our oil heating system .The AC works great and no complaints!  I do feel like it's a bit noisy, but this is fan noise and to be expected.  For heating, it also works as advertised.  Does a good job of taking chill out of the air during Fall and Spring, and supplemental for Winter.Inverters like this heat well down to about 40 degrees, depending on humidity.  Then it's less efficient but still does heat, but with more power consumption.When in use for heating or dehumidification, it condensation drain.  The unit has a plug and you can empty it regularly like a dehumidifier or hook a hose to it.  The homemade more sense for my area as it was filling up constantly.  I had to put it up on a stool for better drainage (like a dehumidifier), which is cumbersome.You should clean the filters (of which there are 3) regularly.  I try to do mine once a week.  Cleaning them are easy, but taking them out is also cumbersome due to location and having to remove 2 screws.  I think all portable units like this work this way though.Overall, it was worth the money, but could use some design tweaks."
"I wouldn't get this. My living room is 391sq ft. so I bought the 10,000 BCU. (You have to consider the amount of cool air a hot body will absorb so the 8k wouldn't work. It onlyIt only blows to the left (towards my TV) and forward. We sit to the right so we have to turn it around to feel anything.It does not cool the living room at all. Peak hours (3 to 7pm) we are suffering and my light bill doubled.Word of advice, unless your cooling a small room, fix your home or get a mini split.Pros: It's nice to look at. Not ugly.Cons: the hose that connects to the window is short.There are some small cracks between the seal and window so. Not a perfect fit.Vents only blow up and do not change direction."
"The product cools nicely, but it's way too noisy. I considered returing it due to the noise. Black & Decker should invest a bit more to make it run quietly, or at least make it an option for the buyer. Same as when you pay more for a dishwasher you can bearly hear it operating. As a consumer, I am willing to pay extra for less noise. I recommend only if you don't mind a noisy machine.To add insult to injury. I just found out, all models do not have the heat option. I was getting ready to see how well it heats up and to my suprises, my model does not have heat function."
"This was easy to set up and it does work given time, but it's SO loud. I can't take a call in the room where it's running. The heat output from the exhaust is also insane, so cool air is sitting out 1 side and the output house is like a little oven on the other side hearing up the room. Requires 2 layers of thermal wrap to manag. Since the intake is right above the exhaust/oven-tube, if you don't run a separate fan and/or wrap the exhaust tube, it will suck in that heated air - more energy/$$$ needed to cool. Will def be replacing it with something else before next summer."
"I wanted to love it, but it’s just ok. I live in a one bedroom apartment and wanted this to cool off my living room (with the hopes of some cool air reaching my bedroom as the window unit did in the past). Unfortunately, that was not the case as it struggled to cool my living room even with all the doors closed. Also, I had the hose attached for continuous draining and it produced about 5L of water in 24hrs, and it’s not even that hot and humid in my area yet. I ended up putting in my 8000BTU window unit which cooled down the room much better than this 12,000BTU portable unit. The good thing is that it’s easy to assemble and move so I plan on putting it in my bedroom which is much smaller. So, if you want this for a small room and occasional use (eg. while sleeping or in a small office) it should be good, but don’t expect it to cool down an apartment or even a small studio."
"Purchased 12000 BTU B & D portable A/C,w/Heater-10000 BTU, up to 550 Sq. Ft., on 6/17/23.  Used it for the rest of the summer then stored it according to B&D manual instructions; Pulled it out of storage spring/May 2024 and turned it on again and discovered that it wasn't cooling the room as before.  Did a little bit of trouble shooting, afterward the unit still was not cooling properly.  Called B&D customer service on 5/29/24 and spoke with a rep. who informed me that she would send me an email w/a return label to ship the unit back for a replacement within 3-days.  Didn't hear from her again after week, so I called again and this time I stayed on the phone with her about 13mins. to verify email again and ensure receipt of her email.  Finally received the return label via email on 6/6/24.  I shipped  my B&D unit to the prepaid label address I was given by B&D C/S Rep on 6/11/24.  I called B&D C/S again on 7/1/24 to check the status of my portable A/C return, the rep. informed  that it was received on 6/14/24***Still within the 1 year warranty period!!!  According B&D PAC Warranty email I received with the return label which stated: "" it may take 2-3 weeks upon receiving my item for a replacement item to be processed and shipped.""  I called again on 7/8/24 and spoke with rep. who told me to give it 2-3 more days to receive my replacement. I waited 7 more days and I called again on 7/15/24 and got no answer, only a voice recording telling me to text the issue to them for a quicker response...still no response...texted them again on 7/17/24 and I'm still waiting for a response to my many texted messages and phone calls to check the status of my replacement B&D portable 12000 BTU A/C&Heater 10000BTU...and its now 7/23/24????***8/23/24 “Update on Replacement A/C”**Finally, to my surprise, received my B&D replacement portable A/C today…and would be especially grateful if it were not for the fact that the replacement A/C B&D shipped to me is not the same model, quality, or size that I returned to B&D PAC Warranty, i.e. I shipped/returned to them a 12,000 BTU, A/C & 10,000 BTU heater combo they returned/shipped back to me a “oddly, strange”… 7,700 BTU A/C & 14,000 BTU heater combo?? WT*#!@$!  Nevertheless, will be either returning this one for correct replacement or asking for comparable refund.***Also, I attempted to post all the pertinent information about B&D offices I found online that would be helpful to others but Amazon wouldn’t allow me to post it.***Bottom line folks don't give-up/don't quit, you deserve justice and accountability for your hard-earned funds you've invested in their merchandise, so hold these people/companies responsible. Do your research, almost all businesses are online now, along with most of their contact information, i.e.,Corporate and subordinate offices address and phone numbers, and emails. Use the wealth of resources on the internet.  When they see your persistence and determination it will force their accountability!"
"This portable A/C works really well. I've had it for 2 months now and it keeps a large area really cool! No issues with cooling or weird sounds coming from it. It's in my bedroom and doesn't bother me at all. It also doesn't have the mold issue that my window unit had, which is why I switched to the portable unit.The only con that I was unaware of, when I purchased this unit, was that it is so much more expensive to run than my old window unit. My electric bill went up about $70 a month!!! This is a ridiculous amount."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            not sure why but for the last week, some days my boyfriend and I haven't been feeling like it's cooling down the room even though it's pushing out pretty cool air?? everything is hooked up right, our door is closed when in use, but sometimes I feel like its even warmer in the room than the rest of the house somehow - not often though!!! I've had it for exactly one month minus two days, and we've used it every single day.when I first bought it and started using it, it worked miracles - saved us from the last punch of summer heat. noise level is medium when using the cooling function, just like any non central ac unit. when using the fan, noise level is just the same as any other rotating fan... idk how better to describe it, just watch my video 😂. its definitely not quiet if thats what you're looking for, but it also is not obnoxiously loud.the ONLY downside to this ac my bf and I DO NOT LIKE is that there is not much mobility to the flaps that direct the air. I can move it half an inch up and down, and the air for some reason only blows out to the right side of the unit. it doesnt come out straight, and you can't direct the air side to side (also shown in video). we use another fan in the room to circulate the air. the plastic tubing is also flimsy lol, all the hot air travels through it so it sags unless you have something to prop it up if you want it to stay in a specific shape or area against the wall."
"Okay, so portable A/C units are known to not be very effective at cooling more than 100sq ft. However, that doesn't mean it's acceptable that the remote is often unresponsive and unreliable...The remote confuses the unit often leading you to need to cycle thru all the settings on the top of the unit directly to MAYBE get it back in actual cooling mode. Also, lots of shutting off from the power button to find any sort of success. It thinks the fan is all you need when it gets confused by the buttons both on the unit and on the remote. I recommend also purchasing vent duct tape to wrap up the hose because both ends leak high speed hot air, directly back into your living space. Lovely..Further, it seems to work best if you just cycle thru to A/C mode with FAN solely on LOW speed, then never try to adjust the settings ever again--besides turning it on and off. Now don't get me started about their customer service; nobody answers the phone number or gets back to your voicemails, so you better go straight to the WARRANTY CLAIM form online to get any sort of reasonable help. Funny enough, every number you call tends to lead you to various different companies unrelated to Black & Decker, then the people at that number send you to some other 3rd party company that doesn't really care about the GARBAGE products that Black and Decker sells. Black and Decker also owns Stanley tools. NEVER touch their products, they produce Chinese GARBAGE that is best sent to the local landfill. And I guarantee it will end up in the local landfill within a year or two."
"Let's get down to brass tacks. If you want to put this in your bedroom to sleep at night, consumers would like a nice constant humming frequency. Like white or brown noise. Like a fan in the background. Think ocean waves, or the wind. Shouldn't be to hard to engineer right?This thing goes from one frequency to another , to stopping, to high pitch whine. A good way not to get a goods night sleep. And the sleep mode does nothing to fix that. It just goes to dead silence to loud engine.It does cool though. So hard to judge it on that metric. 3 stars. Black and Decker, get your act together."
"The air conditioner delivers a nice cool air stream that definitely works as claimed to cool a small room.  We're very happy with this main feature.However the plastic parts for venting the hot air out the window are absolute crap. I had to duct tape all the parts to get it to hold togther. The connecting clips for the window panel are a total joke.The other broke apart from the plastic collar which used to connect to the back of the unit.Come on now Black and Decker, there is no way this could have passed any reasonable stress testing, Do Better!"
Advertised as 12000 BTU but doesn't mention that it's the BTU (Ashrae test) which is less accurate than the DOE test which is only 5950 BTU! Not even the advertised 7000 BTU!!! Long story short it seems the wrong size was sent.Update: It's been weeks and it blows cool just not cool enough for the size room I purchased it for due to the mix-up in BTU. I believe it'll do well in a small bedroom compared to the 500+sq ft/12ft ceiling room it's in now. I'd recommend this one for a small bedroom during humid high temp summers.
"I’m always very cautious when I buy new things, especially appliances, and i read the reviews religiously. This AC unit is rated highly and despite a few bad opinions, I decided to try it out. It worked great at first. It’s been a few weeks now and it’s making noises that it hadn’t before, as if the inner parts are already going bad. Not to mention, during the night it will shut off and reset itself. It will not turn back on until you click it back on, it’s not just short cycling. It’s very inconvenient and frustrating. If you are someone that gets overstimulated with clicky and grinding noises, do not purchase this model. I was planning on returning this but have yet to find a better replacement so I’m taking the loss and dealing with this through the “colder” season (I live in texas so I’ll probably only have to store this for a month or two), and invest in a better one come next warm season. Be smarter than I was. Trust the low reviews."
"The good:1. Unit arrived 1 day earlier than expected. I left it sitting upright overnight to allow the coolant to settle.2. Unboxing & setting it up was a snap, although I had to elevate it 3 ft on a stable platform so the exhaust hose could reach the usually high sliding window situated 5 ft from the floor. Then I glued 4 strips of molding around wheel base to keep it from sliding off (if the casters were removable, this would not have been necessary.)3. Turned it on from the front panel and confirmed it was coolingThe really bad:1. Unit keeps running even after the average room temperature, as sampled from multiple spots using an infrared temperature gun, reached the target setting of 77 degrees F. It doesn't automatically shut off like my other portable A/C unit  (Tosot) does.2. Neither TIMED START nor TIMED STOP worked after carefully following the instructions ... either from front panel or from the remote. Pressing all the buttons in the sequence as instructed produces beeps as explained but the final ""confirmation"" step LED  shows that the timed mode had NOT been set ... and indeed it fails to come on or off after the time I ""thought"" I had set. Since it won't shut off with temperature, and it won't shut off (or on) with timers, this thing has very limited utility. Strictly manual operations.3. Operation using the REMOTE produces different display results compared to the front panel, at least while trying to setup TIMED events. For example, the display starts out at 0.5 hrs when TIMER is pressed from the panel, but 6 when pressed on the remote. The UP/DOWN arrows increase or decrease the time on the panel but do nothing on the remote (fresh batteries, standing a foot away in front)I'm giving it 2 stars because, at least for now, it appears to be cooling.  But if I hadn't gone to the trouble of setting it up, and if I hadn't already discarded the box, I'd send this turkey back and replace it with another Tosot."
"I can honestly say this unit cooled my bedroom wonderfully, I loved it so much and I literally took three months to save up and buy it so I took wonderful care of it, the filters were cleaned every week and every time I tried to drain it there was no water which I liked. But there were definitely some glitches from the beginning the unit sometimes could change settings on its own or turn off on its own and honestly I didn’t mind because it rarely did it and my room still got so cold. I always set it to 64 and would have it running when I was sleep. I purchased this unit and July and it is now October and my unit doesn’t work anymore, I simply tried to turn it on and it made a very loud gargle noise and never turned on again, it doesn’t even light up and I tried everything possible to get it to turn on again, two days prior to it breaking it would go from high to low fan mode on its own and would only stay on high mode for maybe 30mins and also didn’t cool as well as usual. When the ac glitched I usually would clean the filters and it’s back to normal but not this time, I now wasted 350 dollars and based off the reviews it’s no use trying to contact customer service because they are no help and I refuse to wait a month for maintenance nor do I want or should have to pay return shipping (plus I’m a girl by herself so I can’t take this heavy unit to a shipping facility alone). I am so disappointed because I don’t have much and 350 dollars is a lot of money to me and now I’m not sure what to do because my room is hot once again and I honestly just want to cry. I really expected something that costs so much to last longer…at least a year or two. I hope whoever is selling these units realizes there are some individuals who save up and work hard to buy things, and the costs definitely effects them if the product doesn’t last. If your thinking of buying i truly hope you don’t have to same experience, it definitely works, but for how long…who knows."
This Black & Decker AC unit does a good job cooling. It's powerful.Also very loud. Much louder than the typical AC window unit.My only big criticism is that the window kit for venting the unit seems like it was engineered by someone who has never actually set it up and used it. The vent slats are too wide for a typical window -- I had to saw one side of the slat down to size. And it's very unstable and leaky. I needed to prop it up by the vent hose and tape the seams to seal leaks and prevent it from falling out of the window.What's wrong with the old fashioned accordion-style window kits? They work with minimal hassle. That would be infinitely easier and better.
"DO NOT GET THIS (OR ANY PORTABLE AIR CONDITIONER) UNLESS YOU ALSO GET SOMETHING TO WRAP/INSULATE THE EXHAUST HOSE!!!The exhaust hose gets so warm that it cancels a good deal of the cooling. In this case, the heat cancels pretty much ALL the cooling, wasting lots of energy in the process.I got some 6"" shiny thermal wrap (2 rolls of 25') and aluminum tape, and liberally wrapped and taped the hose. See picture. It's in an ""industrial"" setting, and the background ain't pretty.NOW the air conditioner is actually cooling the room it's in. Whew!BTW if you don't want to be regularly emptying a water bucket, make sure that the device is self-evaporating, as this unit is! The instructions say it will self-evaporate in all but the most humid environments. I don't expect any issues here in NYC. Good Luck!"
I think it works well enough. I feel like its loud and sounds like it is working really hard. Not sure if the room is ever really cooled down because it'll turn off for a min and then right back on.i like that it has a remote. I feel like other ac's might be able to cool the room quicker... considering how much it is i wonder if it would've been better to just pay less for something else. it's my first portable ac unit so i don't have much to compare it to minus my general opinion and what i was expecting.
"I did a ton of research about what size I needed. Info is all over the place. I went with the 14k for a 550 sq/ft room. You'll need more. All of the data I saw said 14k would cover 500 to 700 sq/ft. It doesn't. It will ""cool"" a room but I have yet to have it hit the temp it's set to and if the room is hot to begin with, good luck.The unit works just fine, it's just definitely not a 14k unit. If it is, then everyone needs to rewrite what btu can actually cool a room."
"While it did keep my living room/kitchen area (about 450sf) pretty cool during the 14+ days of 110 degree summer heat in Arizona, there are a few things that I do not like and therefore would not buy again. First, like may reviewers said and I didn't listen, the hose pops off way too easily. The slightest movement like barely turning the unit to blow a little in any direction, it pops off at the machine. The window side is pretty secure but the one on the unit is not. Even bumping it a little walking by causes it to pop off. Second complaint, there is no timer function on the unit itself. Supposedly you can set a timer (ie turn off after 2 hours) with the remote but I have yet to figure out how. Finally, I don't really like how where the air comes out is not very adjustable and mostly shoots straight up. You can't really get it to blow towards you. I had reservations about this when ordering because you can see that the louvers sit high on the unit, I just didn't realize how much that would annoy me. My fault for not going with my gut. My bedroom unit is a Honeywell and I love it, I just needed higher BTU's. I should have stuck with Honeywell. But like I said it did do a good job of cooling the area so if those other things are not an issue for you, go for it."
There is no 3.5 stars. Can't give it 4 as it did not include the drainage tube listing in the directions which will be a big problem soon when trying to drain the water out of it for storing to avoid mold and mildew. The directions say to only drain at the end of the season but now it gurgles LOUDLY usually only at start up and shutdown. When shutting off it makes a loud clunk with a heavy vibration. I'm sure my neighbor below me can hear it. I'm afraid to move it to see if it is leaving a condensation pool of water on the carpeting. See no evil. lol My landlord refuses to upgrade the condo's HVAC system which can only cool 10 degrees max and refuses simple window units. We used the window venting provided equipment but had to buy additional window foam seal and tape because the plastic slide is gapped. I will probably buy a 3rd party universal window vent for next year. My electric bill went up $100 the first month using this unit. Not energy efficient at all. We manually turn it on and off. It does a great job on lowering the air humidity! Making it worth being able to breathe. Was it worth the $600+ I didn't really have much of a choice at the time. Would I buy again? I'd probably buy a different brand that has the removable water bucket. Really worried about the mold possibility.
"I only use this for AC.So no idea how the other functions ( fan,dehumidifier ) work for now.If you are a light sleeper this unit is NOT for you. No matter what it keeps on going from loud to silence All NIGHT LONG. (and day)The display light on the unit is bright blue and it’s like having a night light in your room. So once again if u are used to having a nightlight in your room no problem there.The remote doesn’t have a display light at all.Very annoying and  small to read.-Installing is easy-Portable yes as long as you don’t have a lot of stepsWould I buy this again ? NO WAY. THE NOISE THIS THING MAKES !!!!  Check out some of the videos other reviewers posted and at that noise from there videos X10."
"This is a heat pump, takes about 5 min for actual heat to come out. once it starts coming out it is HOT! Had two issues with this unit. One I could not confirm because I bought this for my elderly parents. Making a constant loud noise after 30min or an hour of A/C operation. The second is the FT (full Tank) would come on. Since this is for my elderly parents, I didn't want them to have to deal with the reservoir, so this unit was installed on a level platform with a condensate pump below. ran Great the first month, but when the noise started FT started. to eliminate the FT I had to lean the unit backwards 10 degrees. Called customer service, took three times to explain how the unit is set up and then they finally issue a return label. Now I wait for the ""New unit"" or refurbish to get here so my folks can have heat. I will try to remember to update post.Controller, hard for my parents to understand due to it is pictures. the designers used a ""SUN"" for representation of heat instead of a ""FLAME"". Installation instruction is pictures, little words.UPDATE: After calling the warranty department 9 weeks later they issue a new unit to be sent. I received the new unit in two weeks. The new unit has been updated from the old. some features I like, others where okay.The Old unit had air filters for the condenser which I liked; my parents' house is very dusty. The bad is you have to disassemble the case a little to remove that filter. I only did this twice before sending the unit back due to the issues stated. the new unit did away with that filter. so now I am less impress, wish they made removeable filters for that. The new unit as screw caps with lines to the plugs for the condensate. However, directions are confusing on which one to use so. I am used to them both are tied together, and it doesn't say that. the new has a Velcro cord holder, NICE! the pieces for the exhaust air are stronger and the tube is better sealed. Sorry for the ones that want to lengthen it. Lastly, the FT code has been replaced with E4 and E2 for both revisors if needed to be drain. This unit was designed to not needing to be drain, it has a little misting pump in the exhaust, but excess humidity will overwhelm the pump.Cannot wait to get this set up and I will be reinforcing the window-vent holder when I install it.%#@%^&Well, went to set up unit. had it all install, went to turn on the heat....... NO HEAT OPTION!!!!!! Looked at the model, yep not a heat model. Hurried home relooked at the box. NO HEAT!!!! THEY SENT ME THE WRONG PRODUCT!!!! I will update further."
"This blows lots of cold air, no problem there. But, out of the two machines I bought one arrived damaged. I did not know this because I didn’t open the box for a few months as I did not need it yet. The outside of the box looked fine but the item inside was damaged and it smells bad when operating. Like musty. The other product started out great then began building up condensation on top of the control panel and now it doom scrolls through the fan speeds all by itself. I called Black and Decker and they were willing to replace the second unit but I have to send it to them first then they will send me a replacement. This will take 2-3 weeks. I can’t be without an a/c unit that long.  Disappointing that they don’t have a better policy for replacing something that is needed every day."
"I got this product almost a week ago in preparation for summer. Upon turning the cold air on, it does make a  rumbling noise for a few seconds, then stops, but as long as the cold air is on, it will have a noise to it. With just the fan, it's much quieter (no cold air blowing). During a hot summer, I doubt you'll be complaining about a little extra noise though. It does the job and does it well. If you need something quieter, look elsewhere though, You'll hear it throughout the whole room, and even the next room over, if the AC is on and not just the fan. I wish I found a quieter brand. However, I'm not returning it because I'm not that picky.  For reference, The black and decker's quiet fan is about as loud as my other air conditioner when the cold air is actually on..... so beware if you want peace and quiet in a small room with this AC. Edit: about a week in, I notice when I turn the AC, close the door, and leave the room. When I come back, the room as a musty smell. My room is freshly cleaned. I just drained a tiny amount of water out of it so maybe that will help? I will update in another week ): I  hope this wasn't pre-used and grew mold in it....Edit: So apparently the slightly musky smell when the cooling turns off and ONLY the fan runs is just from the special system this AC has. Instead of draining the water a lot, this AC will evaporate it and shoot it out of the exhaust, that is why it had a slightly funky smell when just the fan is on. It is evaporating the water that it's collected from the cooling cycle. Upgraded to 4 stars from 2, but then degraded from 4 to 3 because it came with no drain hose. I would prefer just to drain it myself without this wacky evaporation system since there is a downside to it."
"So I bought 2 of these AC units (a larger one and a smaller one). The larger one works fine and cools really well!! The smaller one, I used in bedroom, worked fine as well, but died after only 2 months. So, 3 stars I guess? I’m conflicted."
"It's loud. Connecting the ends of the exhaust hose - to the piece that goes in the window, and to the piece that goes on the back of the machine - is outrageously annoying. And I can just imagine how energy inefficient it is, although that's a trait common to all portable a/c units.I do not recommend this as a long-term solution. But if your central A/C or window unit is broken and won't be fixed for 2 weeks in the middle of the summer, you will certainly be happy to have it."
"The outside of the unit itself appears to be fine and not have any damage, but the fins on the inside of the unit appear to have been damaged at some point. Keep in mind Ive only just opened the box, haven't even gotten to install it yet and it looks like this"
"Bad design, unreliable & very poor build quality.1. Unreliable. Unit won't stay running. Sometimes it will run for an hour or two, other times it will run for less than a minute before shutting itself off.2. Bad build quality. It's rather noisy. Due to all the rattling & popping noises, It obviously has multiple loose parts inside of it. Evan a child knows that hardware needs to be tightened.3. It leaks water from the front of the unit (not the drain).4. Bad design. The water drain (in the back) is at the very bottom of the unit, a little more than an inch above the floor. I guess Black & Decker wants your floor to get wet. The only thing I could find to drain water into is a cookie sheet. Ever try to pick up a cookie sheet full of water & carry it to a sink without spilling it? Total pain.5. Missing part. The square adapter that connects the hose to the back of the unit was missing from the box. Had to use duct tape to connect the hose to the unit.I've owned 4 of this type of air conditioner / heater (all different brands), and this one is by far the worst one. Started have problems with it on the second day of use. After 4 days of use I threw it in the trash, exactly where it belongs. Downright pathetic. A total waste of $400. Not only would I not buy another one of these, but I don't think I'll be buying anything else made by Black & Decker. I'd give it a zero star rating if I could. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
"We originally purchased this portable AC for use in a bedroom. While the machine is pretty quiet when the compressor is off and does a good job at cooling the room, when the compressor kicks on it goes from being very quiet to very loud, which is startling when you are trying to sleep. We have had window ACs in our bedroom windows for years and never had a problem but could not stand having this one in our bedroom. None of the other reviews appeared to mention this when we bought this item.Besides this, there are other parts of the design that are not ideal:1) The unit has a bright blue LED button display on top, which lights up the entire bedroom unless you cover it.2) The plastic window sections for the hose that come with the AC are also a little bit of a pain to set up: They main part (the one with the hole) was too short for our window, so we had to cut the extension part, which, even though we were careful, we cut just a tiny little bit too short. It is hard to judge how short to cut it without the plastic fitting properly into the window. The material is quite sturdy, so we probably should have used an electric saw to cut it. Since we only had a little hack saw, we ended up cutting it in a slightly crooked way. Our windows are standard size, so we wonder why the manufacturer would not make the main part bigger in the first place. For now, it works with some foam in the sides of the window but again not ideal. Also, there is nothing to cover the hole in the plastic when the AC is not running. We are in a basement apartment, so animals aren't stopped from going right into the hose or rain might come in when the machine is off. There is a little plastic that could be used to cover that hole that came with the machine but as far as we understand the instructions, it is supposed to be used to screw the main plastic and the extension part together and this prevents it from sliding. We will need to find something else to close that hole when it rains or tape the two plastic parts together so we can use the slider – somewhat of a strange design.All in all, this is a powerful machine (it even seems to suck in new air from other rooms of the house through closed doors). We now have it in our living room, which is way larger than the amount of space the machine is supposed to cool. Maybe that's why now the machine doesn't seem to get the temperature down to the setting and practically never shuts off (unless you add 1 degree to the temperature setting). It is quite loud though if it's on like this for a while. We are quite happy with the way it's cooling the place but taking everything into account we would not buy this item again."
... underpowered for the claimed BTU level
"I loved the last version, but this model change resulted in a light, dimensionally smaller unit that adversely affected what I use it for. I question the quality in comparison to the last version and really would have appreciated better conveyance of the changes. Even the exhaust changed to a larger version. The older one seems to remove more humidity as well, suggesting a better cooling capacity."
"I bought this for my garage gym, and every outlet that I plug it into pops a breaker. I had an electrician come out to look, and they said it needs a dedicated 20 Amp circuit to run. If you don't have one, it won't work for more that 10 minutes. Had I known that very specific and important piece of information, I would have selected something that works better for my space."
"Im sure its a fine product, but I never received the item.  I was sent a printer instead, returned it the next day and havent heard a peep about a refund or sending the correct item.  Very disappointing experience."
"I purchased the 10,000 BTU version of this on June 12, 2023. I like my office being colder than the rest of the house, so I thought that this would be an ideal purchase.On July 20, 2023 I noticed that the unit would beep twice and shutdown for no apparent reason. It would run for an hour and then shut off. I ran through every troubleshooting theory I could think of: check the water tank, clean the filter (it wasn't dirty), try a different location to rule out ventilation issues (single hose AC unit so it creates a vacuum and needs proper ventilation to take in the warm air in the room), and a different outlet. After doing all of these things, the problem still occurs.I reached out to BLACK+DECKER for warranty information as it is clear this is a defective unit and I received this email back -**We want to apologize for the inconvenience that you are experiencing with your Portable air conditioner. I will be happy to assist you.The product you are referring to is handled by a specialized team.They would handle all inquiries requesting warranty, literature, or replacement parts regarding this product.I would also like to provide you with their direct contact information for future reference.Here is the contact information:W ApplianceEdit: Amazon won't let me post their company phone numberEdit: Amazon won't let me post their company email address (Equity Brands email)**After being provided with this information, I thought that it was odd that the email domain ""equitybrands.com"" was different from the company name ""W Appliance.""I researched both of the names only to find out that they're the same company, except ""equity brands"" has such poor reviews with the BBB that they registered themselves under a different company name ""W Appliance"" which, unsurprisingly, has just as many negative reviews on BBB, Google, Reddit, and a few other review based platforms that I discovered.It seems W Appliance/Equity Brands has a history of taking possession of products to fix/replace and then never sending the repaired/replaced unit back. Additionally, I saw several reviews of people reporting their unit has been in the process of being ""repaired"" for over 2 years without being fixed/replaced.After the extensive research I've done to determine if it would be worth me contacting BLACK+DECKER's ""specialized team"" per the abundance of negative reviews, I've concluded that it would be less of a headache to simply buy a new product from a reputable brand such as Whynter, which I've used in my garage for 4+ years without any issues whatsoever.Very disappointed to see how poorly the quality of BLACK+DECKER products have become."
I have a 7000 btu that cooled the 240 sq ft room to 88 with outside temps 105. Bought this one that stated it would cool a room of 450 sq ft (I think). It cooled the room to 86 when outside was 105. I started it in the am when temps were mid 70's and it did fine until the evening. In a cooler area it might do fine. seems quality other than the stated.
"For someone considering one of these portable a/c units I think there is something very important to know about how they work (this presumably applies to all of these not just this B+D model).  Because the compressor is inside the unit (which is inside your room) it has to vent to the outside to vent out the heat generated from the cooling mechanism.  This means that it is taking significant amounts of air and blowing it out through the vent pipe which is presumably installed in a window.  Well keep in mind that all that air that is removed from your room has to be ""made up"".  This generally will occur under or around your door with hot air from outside the room.  You can put draft blockers but if your room is 100% sealed then this unit will theoretically not work because it needs to vent the hot air and that air has to be made up.  So in short-  I'm ditching this for a window unit that has the heat dissipated out the back of the unit which is outside your room.  Wish I had known or thought all this through.This unit will cool a small room but because it is constantly drawing in hot air from outside the room it is always playing catch up and is a very inefficient means for cooling a room."
"This portable A/C until worked well for a little over a year. Then suddenly water just started pouring out of the back of the unit. The unit does have a dehumidify function on it, but I have never utilized the dehumidify function. For a little over a year, this unit has remained in the same spot during the summer months operating as an A/C and nothing else and worked well. When it started leaking water it eventually produced a code of ""ft"" which according to the user manual means that the dehumidify tank needs to be emptied and describes how to empty it. After emptying it, I was able to start the unit back up. It ran overnight and the following day it started leaking again. I once again emptied it. It then leaked three more times throughout the day, each time drenching large towels and then still holding enough water to drain out what I would estimate to be a few quarts. I also noticed that much of the water was not leaking from the bottom where I would assume the holding tank is. Instead, water was pouring out of the back unit at the air intake vents which appeared to be in front of the condenser.I am only giving this unit two stars because customer service is non-existent. The customer service number that is listed in the manual produces a busy signal each time that I call. I checked the internet for a Black & Decker customer service phone number and the one I called only handles small appliances. They transferred me to the number listed in the manual. I waited on hold for 20 minutes hoping to speak to someone. The hold message encourages Black & Decker portable A/C customers to go to a troubleshooting website. The web address given does not produce a functioning website. After being on hold for 20 minutes, I was encouraged to leave a voicemail message to receive a call back. I was never called back. I then attempted to use a customer service phone number that was listed on Amazon on the listing for this A/C unit. While the agent that I spoke with attempted to be helpful, she was once again from the wrong division of Black & Decker. She once again gave me the phone number for the company that Black & Decker uses for customer service for these portable A/ C units. She also gave me an email address to attempt to contact them. After transferring me, I again waited on hold but could not speak with an actual person. I also sent an email and still have not received a response or any indication that my email was read. I have also attempted to dial the phone number again myself and still continue to get a busy signal. The only time I have gotten anything other than a busy signal is when I have been transferred. At this point the unit is unusable and I have no way of rectifying the issue even though I still have another 10 months left on the warranty.(I have included a photo to show where the unit was leaking from. The unit was just drained so what is shown is the remnants)"
"On March 22, 2024 I started to clean ac unit for return for an attempt return for a new unit. Air conditioner started leaking water or freon from front to vent, side vent, and back. Then a loud noise started, sparks and heavy smoke started to come out from the back, when I tried unplugging unit I almost got electrocuted. I called back customer service to make them aware on May 22nd of unit catching fire.I was sold what appears to be a refurbished unit sold as a new unit with many issues from missing the window kit to heavily leaking water. The air conditioner was missing the window kit, but due to a having family and personal emergencies such as getting my mother who suffers from dementia in a nursing home, having an eviction case, and looking for a new apartment I instead used a second air conditioner that was purchased.On May 16, 2022 I opened a case for the missing window kit:0000 new ticket numberCase 0000. After getting the kit, two weeks later this monstrosity started leaking water, damaging my floor, I had to get a large bucket to keep the ac from leaking because the tank fills up quickly. I called customer service, opened a new case and started a return. They were of no help and did not provide a box to return the unit. I got very busy and fall came and I forgot about it because I couldn't get a box big enough. I have agoraphobia and I can't go out, and I tried finding a box online.Then in June, 2023, I got the unit out from the closet and plugged it in and started leaking again, I called customer service again and got a new label to mail the dreadful thing. Once again, I couldn't get a box to ship it back. Fast forward this year. I finally got a box, got the unit out, plugged it in to clean it and see if it would work. It started leaking again, and then it malfunctioned and smoke and sparks started to come out the back. I tried unplugging it and I got shocked and the plug and outlet caught fire and I almost got electrocuted. I was so scared I thought it was going to explode."
"It does cool my bedroom BUT- it's SO NOISY I can't sleep!  It's noisier than my dishwasher and washing machine put together!  It also has a very bright blue light that lights up the whole room.  The light is pointless because it only shows what temp you set it to.  The unit does not show what the actual temperature is.  I wish there was a light on the on off switch.  The remote control broke after LESS than a month. You can't direct the flow of air-it only comes out to the right of the unit. Every time you push a button on the unit to change the temp or turn it off, it makes a terrible high pitch sound that scares my dog.  It only goes down to 64 degrees.  You can't have it cooler than that.  It takes awhile to get the room very cool.  I have to turn it on a couple of hours before I want to use the room.  (This will vary with temperature of course. )  I wish I would have spent more and gotten a quieter and higher quality unit.  In the end it does cool the room though."
"I got this make & model AC unit since it seemed to offer the best value for the price point.  They are pretty easy to set up and for the first few weeks I was really happy with the product despite the fact that it makes way too much noise at night.  I figured I could live with that. But just two weeks into having this AC unit, it just started not working as well.  I would set the temp for 70 at night and my thermometer by my bed would read 73-74 degrees when I would get up in the morning.  Meaning that with this machine 4-5 feet away from me going full blast for 8-9 hours, it still couldn't reach the target temperature.  That's really disappointing. As others have said here, the customer support that Black & Decker offers for their products leaves a lot to be desired. I've gone through their main site and waiting for a long time to talk to someone only to be told that I have to call another number.  You call that number and they don't even try and help you.  They take your information so you can go through the hassle of boxing the old one up, sending it out and exchanging it for a new one. The hoops they make you jump through to spend it back is ridiculous and that doesn't count all the time in the summer months during fire season in California that I will be without a much needed AC unit. All this with your fingers crossed that the new one will work. So my advise for anyone who's thinking about buying this model is don't really.  I thought $400 would ensure that I would have gotten a quality brand & model AC unit, but that hasn't been the case at all.  At this point I would have gladly spent more money in order to buy something that didn't break down in a few weeks and buy from a company that sincerely cares about how their customers are treated and the experience they have with their products.Update: I finally reach someone at Black & Decker and was able to get the malfunctioning AC unit back to them. That was roughly 4 months ago. I know they got the broken AC unit 3 months ago since I kept my UPS tracking number and checked on it. But every time I call, I just get another excuse as to why a new unit hasn't been sent back to me. I have literally called 3 or 4 times to try to follow up and each time I talk to the same person, explain the same story, and get a new excuse as to why I haven't gotten a replacement unit.  And at this point I am just giving up since I don't have the time to keep calling and arguing with people about it. And even if they did send it out, it's about to be October and so how would I reliably test this unit out?So do yourself a favor and stay away from this item, I am not the only one here that has had this experience."
"Before we begin, this is a 2.5 star rating.  I couldnt bring myself to give it a 2 cause it works, but a 3 is just too kind.Lets get the good out of the way.1.  Its better than NOT having an air-conditioner.  We've had some really hot days lately and knowing we can retreat to the bedroom where its cooler (not cold) is a godsend.  Also makes sleeping at night easier.2. Once you've set it up once, its a breeze to take down and put up again (in that same area).  And the rolling wheels make the heavy unit someone easy to push around.3. Go out the back and feel the hot air coming out, its like a hair dryer set to medium.So now after using this for 1 year I have A LOT of design issues with this.1.  You can't set it to just ON, full blast.  It'll cycle periodically on/off which creates a large clunking noise, and since its in our bedroom wakes us up.2.  Jesus Christ the blue lights on the display illuminate the whole bedroom at night with a bright blue glow.  And yet somehow  if you walk up to the display at night you cant see any of the buttons to change settings.You will end up covering the display with something its just too bright at night3. The water drain is 1-inch from the ground.  So water doesn't drain unless your using a McDonald's tray to catch water.  Raise the unit up you say? well its on wheels and will easily fall and crush you.So to empty the water you periodically will to a 80 pound deadlift and wait for the water to drain.  Brilliant.4.  The lowest temperature setting is 64F ?!?!  Thats like 17C, thats not cold ! that's just below ambient temperature.  I want icicles coming off my unit or its not cold enough especially when advertised as 14000 BTU.5.  I think its added about 150$ / month to my electricity bill on heavily used months...thats a lot for slightly cooling down one room only.I know these stand alone units aren't great and have many design flaws and physical limitations.  But I just cant recommend this after having it for a year.  I am glad I have something to help on hot days but if I had to do it again I would consider a different option, though it may not be much better either."
Ac is great however it was missing the hose outlet. I tried looking for the piece separately on Amazon but cannot find it. Hopefully the company is willing to send it
"I let the unit sit for 24 hours before turning it on to let the coolant settle. It is pushing out cold air. But, its still the same temperature inside as it is outside. After researching, I think there are two design flaws in this unit that prevents this unit from cooling our living area.#1. The exhaust from the AC unit is extremely warm. My instant read thermometer read 102 degrees when placed against the exhaust hose. The exhaust hose puts out so much heat, that its warming up the room. I've got the hose as short as I can while maintaining the advised 12 inches distance from the wall, but it looks like I may need to insulate the tubing because its warming up the house.#2. The single vent hose rather than a dual vent hose is a huge problem. After researching the cause of the same temperature inside the house and outside the house despite the massive amount of cold air coming from the unit, I realized that creating an air deficit inside the house by sucking air in from our living area, and pushing warm air outside via the vent hose, is creating a air vacuum that is causing warm air to be pulled in from the warmer areas of the house. This causes the unit to be far less efficient than a window unit. My window unit is far more efficient than this unit and at many less BTU's.EDIT - UPDATE TO MY REVIEW: After my initial 2 start review and deciding to return the unit, I let it run all day to see what it could do if I left it running for many hours. I also turned on my window AC unit in another part of the house. After running for several hours, this AC unit managed to keep at least a 10 degree cooler temperature inside than it was outside with the help of an additional AC unit in the bedroom.I changed my review to 3 stars. It's OKAY. I feel comfortable and cool, although I wish it could get cooler. Overall, the unit is functioning well enough that I decided not to return it. I am disappointed with its performance, but decided to keep it because its working for now and I prefer the portability over the window units. It's got wheels and a pretty easy setup in the window for the vent that I can take up and down as I wish. Hopefully the decision won't come back to haunt me at a later date.Buyers need to be aware that it won't perform as well as a window unit, and the unit is loud and never shuts down because it will never reach the coolest temps you are reaching for. I estimate its 89 outside, and probably 75-79 inside."
"As far as dehumidifying the unit works great under that function. As far as the cooling function there is much to be desired. We were blessed with mild and great weather the first few weeks of ownership and did not need to use the cooling function or unit much at all. This week there has been higher heat and humidity (90degrees+, and 90%+), and we discovered this unit is just not able to fully cool the space. Set it to the lowest possible setting (61degrees) and been running it all week. The room is still above 72degrees. We've been keeping our house at 71-72degrees this week. There is a noticeable temperature decrease walking out of the bedroom suite addition (where the Black and Decker unit is being used) into the living room (main house).Got this unit for a bedroom suite addition on the house. The addition does not have central air, thus this purchase. The suite is about 500sqft and above an attached garage. We had a Midea unit for the last 5yrs that finally had to be retired. The Black and Decker unit is MUCH quieter when running than the Midea model we previously had. I purchased this Black and Decker due to high ratings and feedback. Unfortunately we missed the window to return the unit. I will have to look into what the warranty options are for this. For now the dehumidifying function is keeping the room we need cooled and tolerable, so that is helpful."
"After doing research and reading all of the reviews, I decided to purchase this air conditioner.  I wish I would have stuck with my window AC. This Black and Decker portable ac unit doesn't even cool my bedroom. My room is about 22x15 if that and the opposite site of the room is hot. It's nice in front of unit but when you step away it's hot. I have tube running to external tub that has to be emptied every couple of hours. This is not even on the dehumidifier setting. I can't leave unit running while away because of this ( bucket has filled up and over flowed. I've had it happen twice already). I have to have a stand fan placed right in front of unit blowing the air to other parts of room. The exhaust tube gets super hot and jist adds to the warmth in room. I currently have a towel wrapped around exhaust tube to cut down on warmth. My window ac was cumbersome to carry, a little laouder and ugly in the window,  but I will be going back to that next year (I might just dig it out this year to finish off summer). Don't buy unit unless you want hassles.I do like that I can look out both windows with this unit. The set up was super easy. I would not recommend."
I opened no screen plastic on board top and have scratched. One more thing this is no show model on it. How I know 10000 BTU or maybe 8000 BTU
"I've had this for a few years.  It never managed to get my living room COLD.  It wasn't able to handle the 90° heat.  This year, I upgraded to a Midea DUO 14k.  There was a significant difference.  The Midea was able to keep my room comfortable at 100°.  Here are the issues I had with the Black Decker.(Single) hose and humidity: The efficiency of this unit is only 8k DoE, I believe.  The reason is because it's a single hose unit.  It keeps drawing in air, which inadvertently brings hot(and humid) air from the outside in.  The hose adapter itself is #$%^.  It's rotated to fit into 2 clips on each side, but the top or bottom WILL tilt to allow a lot of exhaust to leak out.  The adapter to duct connection itself is not super tight.  As a result of the humid air, I had to open up the drain, and it dripped multiple buckets of water a day.Drain: the drainage design itself is #$%^.  My unit managed to clog or otherwise fail to drain from the drain hole(with hose attached) and would start to overflow and come out of the unit.  I had to elevate the front side by ~20° so that it would manage to drain while not coming out the back.  Obviously, this also left some in the unit at all times.  The drainage problem also caused the interior to rust.Filters: the filters are filmsy and can warp, but the filter keeps its form, and the spaces are too wide.  I feel like it doesn't filter well, and I had to clean the coils this year as well.  The bottom, compressor compartment filters actually can't be accessed without unscrewing the cover.  I just left it unscrewed.Front Blower: Since the first year, my front grille fins were dirty, but they're all the way inside the unit, so it's impossible to clean.  I actually opened up the unit(from the control panel), and it is actually a vent duct with the fins being controlled by a mini motor attached to the back.  The duct and grille themselves are very, very difficult to remove, and you'll probably break some insulation if you tried."
"Bought this item about 15 days ago. Moved into place, let set for 24 hours, then turned it on.  The unit operated just fine to keep the 98°F ambient temperature down to 85°F...for about 7 days. It's Texas; it's hot. I get it. But a brand-new unit should not simply kill its compressor for no apparent reason without giving at least SOME warning (compressor getting hot, alarm noises, indicator lights, blown fuse...something). If anything about the environment the unit was in could have caused the compressor problems, the obvious answer would be to put some sort of protective measure in to shut down the compressor and alert the user. This did not happen. Instead, this high-priced unit simply crapped out and kept blowing its fan like nothing happened.  The only indicator that was obvious (because the unit WOULD downcycle the compressor when the room reached 85°F) was that it stopped producing any condensate water.Never even removed the remote control from its bag since that thing is a pointless exercise in either laziness (when used) or insanity (when misplaced) and the manual controls on the unit made operation simple enough as it was.Black & Decker claimed this unit could cool up to 700 square feet of living space. I put it in a 350 square-foot room that was very well-insulated, gave it a short and direct outlet run for its hot air output to minimize backpressure, and carefully insulated the window adapter so there would be no warm air blowing back into the room. There was even a separate fan blowing to eliminate temperature differences in there and circulate air over the compressor so it WOULDN'T overheat!This was a defective product. Defects happen. It failed early in its life cycle, a so-called ""infant failure"". These are EXACTLY the sort of failures the customer should NEVER see! If proper quality assurance practices were in place, this product would probably never have even been shipped.  It is therefore a BAD PRODUCT. Like a bad dog, it deserves no biscuit. I'm sending it back to get a refund; Amazon is covering that part, at least, so I don't have to worry about Black & Decker's return policy about it.I won't be buying another one."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            There's a clicking sound coming from the compressor and it's super loud. This sound drives me crazy after a while, so I can't even be in the same room with it. I have 2 others units from LG, and they're nowhere near it. When they're working at night, I can sleep with them."
"It was very easy to install. It was sleek and design and looked nice . The remote worked great . I was trying to cool a room that was 300 ft.². I had it on high for hours and hours and it just didn’t cool down. It did bring the temperature down a few degrees but it just didn’t work well enough and I figured for the money I should return it. I will say that I did get my money back immediately, I will suggest that you should save the box that comes in just in case you do need to return it. Also, I suggest that you use the tube they give you and have it go into a bucket because I had a lot of extra water that went into the bucket , I have seen people say that they had water leaking and I think it could be that they did not use the drainage tube. I did not even set it on the humidity setting and still had water draining out of the tube into the bucket. If you were cooling off, maybe 100 square-foot it might do the trick, but it just didn’t work for me."
"So the item works great however, the first month of using it for the AC purpose only my electric bill jumped more than $150 extra dollars. My electricity bills is normally $120-$150 in the summer months running fans and a huge barn/ garage fan for my GSDs. Running this for maybe 6 days out of 1 month jumped my normal $120-$150 electric bill to over $300 and that was not constant running of the item. Just to prepare everyone because I was not prepared."
"I bought this unit because I'm a nightshift RN that sleeps during the day. I initially wanted to get a window unit, but felt that it would allow too much light to come in. I was excited when I found this unit because it looked to block out light super well. But it actually doesn't. Light shines through the plastic panels so I had to duct tape them (not the most ideal situation as it looks awful). Then, light also comes into the hose, essentially making it a nightlight for your room. Got a hose cover so this problem is now fixed. The plastic slide part is also frequently falling out of the window well because the hose weights it down. As far as set up goes, it was not as easy to put together as it claims. The hose does not connect very well into the slide part that goes in the window. I thought I was going to break it when I was trying to get it in there. The hose does not maneuver well at all so when you go to attach the hose to either the unit or the window panel, the opposite end usually disconnects. But the unit does cool my room well enough so I'm pleased with it on that front. It just looks awful. Overall, I wish I had just gone with the window unit."
I purchased this for my shop. There are three circuits that control electric for the shop. I tried every outlet on all three circuits.. even on one that was dedicated ( no other electrical on that circuit) and the breakers  tripped in every case. I’m very disappointed that this did not work out for me. I can only hope that others had successfully installed the unit and are enjoying the AC.
"To start with the pros:blows cold air, has wheels that allow for easy rolling, the window kit was very easy to install and there isn’t much of a drip when opening the drain valve.The cons: for some I guess the noise, but I’m not bothered. The biggest con for me is how bright the screen is and the wrong remote coming with the item. The 14,000 btu model I ordered shows a remote with an adjustable lcd/led button but the remote I received was for the 10,000 btu and does not provide that feature. Overall I love the unit, especially for these hot Texas Summers."
AC worked great for 2 months cooling a large open area with 30 foot ceiling. I was really impressed. The days ago the AC quit and it's nothing more than a fan. Customer support suggested unplugging for 4 hours to reset but it didn't help. About to find out how good the warranty is.
"Good packaging, decent instructions but it’s advertised to be able to cool a 450 square foot room, it can’t do that, maybe a 250 sq ft room but not 450. My living room is roughly 340 sq ft and this can’t bring the temperature down even 10° below outside temperature which right now is 90°f. Even though the air coming out is actually 58°f the fan isn’t powerful enough to circulate the cool air. Disappointing today the least."
Chinese
I was looking for a small a/c unit. It basically cools the immediate air just around it. (Two feet around it.) It’s a desk top cooling unit. Not what I needed so returning.
"Ordered unit from Amazon on 7-30-24. Got it on 8-2-24. Fast. Is it a 5000 btu, 5100 btu or a 5050 btu as the placard says?It came in a very well packaged box inside of an Amazon box that was too big and had no packing to keep the A/C box from moving around. The A/C box was marked with an ""UP"" arrow, this side up, but was upside down in the Amazon box. I unpacked it, righted it and waited 24 hours to see if it cooled before installing it in the window. It ran, got cold, but the compressor has a whine one can hear for a long distance. It had been dropped on the left rear corner bending it and jarring a screw loose in the top center of the unit housing. Good thing it had been packaged well in its box or the damage could have been worse.  The best I can tell the coils, lines, fan blades and such are not making contact with the case.  After a bit of running on low cool, the unit started a pinging noise as described in the manual. It was water rising in the pan and the condenser fan was picking it up and splashing it against the right side of the louvers and outside the unit. The manual states there is a small rubber plug under the unit. Removing the plug will drain the pan of water stopping the pinging and splatter.  However, the unit will not be as efficient. It won't cool as well, because the splatter helps cool the condenser coil. If that is true, the compressor should also run cooler with the splatter, but its life span might be shorter by removing the plug. This is not the way to design a cooling system. If your house is wood siding, that splatter will take a toll on it. The unit has cooling louvers to direct the cool air right and left.  There is no means to direct the cool air up away from the incoming warmer air below the cool air vent.  I am using this unit as climate control for a storage room.  I'm not pointing fingers, but Amazon could have labeled ""Fragile, This Side Up"" on its box and put in packing to keep the A/C box from moving around. Why did I buy this unit? The price was low, and I have a GE 5050 K btu unit made in 2013 that is still running fine.  Manufactures were using a non-flammable, R22 or the like back then and the units didn't need water splash to help them cool properly.  I should have spent a few more dollars and got better unit. Except for the above, the unit is fine for my purpose. I would not want it in a bedroom or any lived in space. If it lasts a season or two, I'll be surprised. Just my two cents."
"It does work fairly well. I would not recommend it for people who are susceptible to respiratory issues. I live in a humid climate which may play a part in the issues I have with this unit. If you leave the drain plug in like the manufacturer recommends for efficiency then the inside will get nasty faster. If you leave the drain plug out it will be easier to tell when the unit gets nasty on the inside because it will usually quit dripping just before it needs cleaned. You will have to pull this thing out of the window, take the case off of it, and clean the inside of it monthly to prevent mold and bacteria from growing in the unit. The drain is elevated above the bottom of the drain pan by about a quarter inch so the drain pan will never completely drain. It is difficult to clean because the way that the fan shroud is designed causes debris to get trapped in a small area that is hard to access without further disassembly. If you have someone in your home who is highly susceptible to mold then you will have to disassemble this thing beyond what the warranty allows in order to sanitize it. Make sure you take pictures at every step of the disassembly so that you can put it back together after you clean it on the inside because instructions for cleaning beyond just the filter are not included in the product manual. If you live in a home with older windows, the bottom of the window opening doesn't come flush with the interior window sill, or you don't want to drive screws through your window sill then you will need to get a stand for the unit. When using a stand you will have to cover the window sill with a board big enough to raise the unit above the bottom of the window opening to prevent window damage and use boards to fill the gaps under the outer shrouds so that you have a surface to attach the unit and the shrouds to. For that setup you will also need foam to close the gaps under and around the stand. At this point I wish I would have kicked out a couple hundred dollars more to get a unit that exhausts out the window instead of having to be mounted in it. The noise is comparable to any other portable unit so if you don't like noise then either pay through the nose to get a larger central unit for your house or get a mini split system so that the noisy part of the unit stays outside."
"I bought this during one of the hottest months this summer in North Carolina.  Installation was easy, but didn't fit properly in my window so I had to use insulation tape & other padding to cover the gaps around my window to keep bugs out.  Even with this unit installed & black-out curtains, it still didn't cool the room enough and thought the temperature decreased after only running 30 minutes.  This unit might be good for a very tiny room or closet, but not as described."
"This air conditioning unit kept a room liveably cool and dry during an unlivably hot and humid summer. So mission accomplished on that front.However, I was not particularly impressed and would have expected a better value for the price. The unit does not have a precise temperature control, and appears to use considerable energy judging by my electric bill. The unit is difficult to install and the side panels were poorly constructed, to the point that I had to use duct tape to ensure a firm seal.I don't not recommend this, but I would investigate other options before purchasing."
"I purchased this unit to fit my 36"" wide window, a feature advertised in the product description.  36"" is the absolute maximum width this unit will fit, with zero fudging.  The unit must be centered in the window and the accordion panels extended evenly.  Even so, I feel it's pushing the limits, so consider using it in a smaller window.Also, it's a bit louder than other window A/Cs I own.  There is no vertical control of the air and the horizontal controls help minimally.  Yes, it cools in that respect, it works adequately.  But, consider the space in which you want to use it prior to purchasing."
"This AC was just delivered. It was in a double box. The package was delivered with the shipping labels visible on top. There were no other markings. The inner box was upside down. When I turned it over the message read ""Always keep this side up."" The delivery person would have no idea it was upside down. The box appeared undamaged but the AC was dented on the side and the top was dented down a bit. I waited more than the recommended 24 hours to allow oil in the compressor to settle before installing it.  After all that the AC seems to do a good job cooling the small room. I like the ECO setting that  will turn off the fan when the compressor shuts off when we are not sleeping. We use a constant fan when we are sleeping. I would not say it is quiet."
"You get what you pay for,but works well in our little kitchen that the sun beats down on all day in the summer."
Ok so it was packaged well it has straps for easy moving.However my window sill has an edge that is higher than this is designed for.Will include photos so you can see what I’m talking about.I did place it in the window and removed it because it didn’t feel like it was very secure and the way you would secure it didn’t seem to work .That said I did plug it in and turn it on and while I felt some cool air coming out it was just that cool not cold and it had sat For over 24 hours after delivery so that everything could settle in case it was kept upright during transport.I would check your window ledge to make sure you have one that will work with this.
"This GE air conditioner is ok but not perfect. It does the trick in my bedroom but is noisy. The side panels are cheaply made and we had to improvise with padding on both sides, as well as top and bottom so it would fit the window. I do love the remote but next year may purchase another one?"
"The thing is basically a fan that blows “cold-ish” air when it apparently wants to at the floor to make even more hot air rise to the areas of the room that’s not the floor, you  know, where you want cold air to blow.  essentially running forever without cooling the room down. Ridiculous design. I can literally set the temperature and even decrease the temperature to try and get this thing going and watch in real time the temperature of the room rising on my rooms thermostat. They built in levers to change the direction of the air 3 cms to the left and right…but none to point the air from blowing at the floor?!  Eco mode is even worse. You could set the temperature to 72 degrees and come home to a 90 degree room and the thing still won’t come on. You’d think a home name like GE would stand for some long lasting quality but this thing is apparently junk for what I need an AC for. Is room temperature regulation really that hard? Who do they have designing this stuff? I could put a bucket of ice in front of a fan to do more than this thing bc I’d point the fan up where the hot air is. The fact that this is #1 in AC’s is beyond me. We need to do better. Thanks for wasting time and money."
"This ac unit has a hard time performing in the bedroom. Has to be at least on 68 to cool and keep a consistent temperature. Another thing is it doesn’t take the humidity down much unless you put it on 66 and close the door completely. I can’t afford that as I have another brand in my house that is 10,000 btu that cools and dehumidifies nicely. Even my old Goldstar (now LG) dropped the humidity without having to freeze everyone stiff. I bought it and it does keep it cooler than a fan but I learned a lesson."
For the price I thought could be a bit better fan on low you can barely feel and if it's raining it's worse also after rain it stinks! None of my other 2 brands have any of those problems I also noticed for the size the compressor is loud sometimes at night it kicks on and wakes me up. I wish I had spent a little more money on something else
"I had low expectations based on the price of this air conditioner. I received it on time, but it was very poorly packaged and half the box was caved in. It had one corner bent and the front panel was loose however the main components were fine and I was not about to go through the huge hassle and cost of returning it. Nevertheless I waited for the coolant to settle for 24 hours and plugged this little guy in to see off the compressor would kick in and set the thermostat low. It came on and blew out cold air, but I’ve found it’s a very weak fan and isn’t doing much to cool of a single room several hours later."
I borrowed a friend’s GE 5000 btu unit and it was amazing. This unit is also a GE 5000 btu but minus he electronic controls that the borrowed one had. It was a comparable price. The exact same model wasn’t available. This one is so inferior. It takes 2; hours to cool my very small space. I have to leave it on all the time. It’s disappointing
"I purchased this GE AC unit for my sewing room, and that means it was not going to be used every day. The AC works but it does not cool like the other units with the same capacity I have in other rooms. I purchased GE because it is a well known brand and been on the market for a very long time. So, I should known better not to change brands as the savings was not that great and saving a few dollars it does not make it for efficiency. Also, it came without a rail that goes on top of the unit to be able to install it; I have to call amazon, they told me to contact the manufacture and gave me all the information and I did. I contact the manufacture they give me no problem with the claim for the part missing but, it took more than 10 days for me to received the part. I was inform it will take from 3 to 10 days to receive it, it took 12 days, no biggy but it would be nice to have a better experience. I chouse to ask for the part missing instead of send it back because I didn't want to carry the AC to the store to return it as it's heavy for me, I am 66 years old and have no help but I am pretty handy and manage to install it.."
"This air conditioner does it's job. We purchased it to cool our bedroom but ended up cooling the entire upstairs. It wasn't cold but immensely better than the oppressive heat that we have had. Made sleeping obtainable. The drawback is that it is not quiet, it actually is fairly loud. If you have trouble sleeping with a constant noise, then this one is not for your bedroom. It is working well for us, and I give it only 3 stars due to the noise, especially since it is advertised as being quiet."
"The best part about this Air Conditioner is that it uses less energy than a bigger one.The coolant is flammable. That is not cool. They make them this way to save cost. It iscooled by some type of 'butane' derivative. I am using it in my generator shack so I don't care.I also have a cheap refrigerator and freezer that run on flammable coolant. Not CoolThis is America .... the Chinese get away with producing dangerous appliances. Well, that is my opinion anyways. Back in the day this would not have been allowed.The air blows cool but not like the vents in my car. You won't freeze with this unit.This thing works and I do not recommendit if you live in the desert or really high heat.I am using it to cool my inverter shack - 10X10. It brings the temperature down from 100 to 90F.So I waited for the worst part for last. This air conditioner does not work like my other window AC.It does not turn off and on when a certain low temperature is reached. It has Low Fan Only High Fan Only High Cool and Low Cool. So far as I can tell the fan just always keeps running whether or not the compressor is cooling or not. Shea Shea Shanghai"
"Check other reviews. I’ve heen using this ac for a fee days. It effectively cools a small bedroom, but this installation is sloppy. The pieces thatcome to fit the window sides are poorly made and break on installation. I even went as far as to buy replacement pieces on the GE website and they were equally poor quality.I guess this is the cheapest unit you’ll find that is a brand name, and the u it does work, but be prepared to DIY the install."
"We use this for our small kitchen in the summer.  It does help with the heat, but I severely doubt it's cooling at 5000 BTUs. maybe 4000."
I would give this AC unit 5 stars if not noisy it is. The fan is slightly noisy but once the compressor Kix on you know it.
The AC doesn’t really cool the space much as it’s not a large living room. I was hoping it was a great American product but compared to other AC brands it’s not performed as well.  It’s a bit noisy. There’s no remote control associated with this AC. It looks stylish in the window.
It's not very cold at all. At least it's better than the fan in my room. Little disappointed that it's not cold as it should be. Was easy to to install.Update: it took a little while after being installed but it got cold. My only problem is I can hear water sounds. Don't forget to pull out the little black rubber piece that is in the drainage hole. Otherwise the AC is rather cold in my bedroom. Happy with the product so far.
There were some considerably large dents in this window unit to the coils & the screws were missing!  I had some extra screws leftover from installing another window unit that we were able to make it work! I’ve bought used before and never been this disappointed!!
"I initially gave this product a 1 star review. The AC didn’t come with the top mounting rail, so I couldn’t put it in my window.  I reached out to GE and they weren’t able to help me get a replacement because they didn’t have any in stock. I managed to find the mounting bracket from a different website, so now the AC is in my window.I’ve decided to change my review because all things considering, the AC works great. The high cool setting is wayyyyy to cold for my 200sqft bedroom, I’ve been using it on low cool mode and it’s absolutely perfect. I will say that the high setting is a smidge loud, but that doesn’t bother me because it’s not as loud as a box fan wiggling on my wood floors.So far I’m about 4 days in to using the ac and it’s been a pleasant experience. I would give a higher rating if it came from the factory with all of the pieces, AND if GE was able to help me.I did not want to bother with a return because I would have to repackage it and lug it back to a place to ship it. I have arthritis in my spine so I’m not trying to carry lol"
I feel like the older models were better. My old goldstar goes all the way down to 60 and this one is 64. It doesn't throw as much air flow as I was expecting. Wish it would as also a little quiet. I like that it has a remote!
"While this A/C unit seems to be working well, it isn't the model we ordered. We ordered 2 black ones and got 2 white ones. We didn't return because the need was great and again, they work well. Just different than what was ordered."
"Very difficult to work. More complicated than it needs to be. Does not ""cool"" efficiently. Clean filter light refuses to go off. Very disappointed with this purchase. Not worth the money. Worst AC I have ever purchased."
"I know GE is a good product, but Amazon & USPS shipping is terrible. AC box clearly marked ""UP/FRAGILE"" so product is not shipped upside-down. Amazon packed that box Inside another box, but the Amazon box was not marked ""UP/FRAGILE"" so shipping company would know which side is UP.AC machine leak all its oil & freon out. Box was damaged & AC machine was damaged. Exchange it with another & explained packaging issue to Amazon. Amazon said they would advise shipper about marking the Amazon box. I received replacement, same issue with box not being marked ""UP or FRAGILE "" I let the AC machine set for 24 hours before plugging it in & turning it on. Turned on high cold, AC worked but not very cold. I let it run for 30 minutes, finally got cold. Installed unit, turned it open high cold. Still not blowing cold. Let it run 30 minutes & checked temperature with thermal heat gun. Temperature at vent 69 degrees. Turned on low & compressor turned off. Temperature at 90 degrees, AC compressor never came back on. Turned it off, let it set for 10 minutes, turned it on high cold & AC compressor came on. Blew cold. It ran for 5 minutes & AC compressor turned off. It never came back on. I returned product & spoke with Amazon. Explained my frustration about shipper. Amazon advised me they have no control on how/who will be shipping products. I explained USPS does not care about how the product is handled & the person delivering our Amazon products are elderly females. They have dropped many packages on the ground out of their vehicle to the ground. Suggested how to fix this issue to Local USPS, but frustration has fallen on Deaf Ears. I ordered a different unit & hope someone will package the replacement AC unit correctly."
"The electronic window air conditioner is disappointing. It’s noisy, inefficient, and struggles to cool the room effectively. The controls are confusing, and it doesn’t live up to expectations."
"Wonderful AC, but the remote doesn't have the setting lights on it. The lights for the settings are on the AC, not the remote. You're good if you can see the AC, but I can't, so I'm up and down to manually set the AC. Hard to explain, but I'll never buy another GE AC like this one, simply because of the almost useless remote."
overall i love the temperature...but after it being on for a few hours theres a popping sound.
"Not too crazy for  these noise makers , they tend to change sounds on different modes - these will be a short term fix to get me through the summer heat , they will be trashed in the fall when I install central air."
"This does help get things cool but only after a few hours of being on. It was more like a fancy, powerful fan than an air conditioner. Like I said it helps get things cool but not as strong as I thought. Perfect for a small room."
We just installed it yesterday and it cooled the room nicely. I love the eco. setting on it so when the room gets to the right temperature it stops running But it is really noisy I was hoping it would be quiet or at least quieter. Unfortunately for me it’s heat season and we need it now or I would have returned it for something quieter.
Description could be better.  Didn’t realize was manual operation but works good.
Should be cooler but it does it's purpose for now thank you
"The unit definitely worked, kept my room cold. Also don't touch the back of the unit, I cut my fingers not realizing trying to install it. Downside was the noise. It was very loud, like i would have headphones on and playing music and could still hear it. Making going to sleep impossible."
"I received the ac, however the wings to it were torn. Is there a chance I could get 2 new ones sent to me ..no charge. Right now using cardboard to it."
Packaging was horrible. Put it in and continual tap is heard. So I have to push on the styrofoam to make the noise stop. Temp is good.
Missing parts to install in window. Top mount rail not in the box. Now I have to order parts to install safely.
"honestly, was so proud because i was able to install it myself but wish I paid for a better, more expensive ac. It’s on par to a fan to be honest. I have a pretty small room and it keeps my room maybe at 84?"
"It was fairly quiet and easy to install.  We don't have a big bedroom by no means, and we had it as high as it would go but the  room never moved from 66 degrees.  You can only turn the thermostat to 64 or higher.Unfortunately, we are returning it."
"This isnt a bad unit, but it just wont get cold enough. I like to keep our bedroom at about 61 in the summer, and this wont even allow you to set it under 64"
"I was in a hurry, 104° in the hot Texas summer, and I went with GE thinking a reputation for quality meant something. I can’t say for sure this unit was used/returned but it was certainly damaged. After cleaning it up and straightening as many condenser fins as I could I tested it to make sure it turned on and cooled. Next, I installed it in the window of a 12x15 bedroom. Storm window involved so installation is quite a pain, hence the quick test. Miserable experience followed. After a couple of days of experimentation , it turns out the unit only operates on ECO mode and AUTO or LOW speed without the temperature of the air it puts out rapidly shooting up. If I try to use a higher speed or put it in cool mode it is almost immediately overwhelmed and the temp shoots up as well as the humidity. This usually indicates a blockage so I can only assume the fin damage it arrived with was too great. Again, very hot here and packaging was history so I tried to make it work. I shut down the unit and ran the central air, cooling the whole house to give it a good starting spot. I started it up, turning the central off and I was able to maintain a room temp around 80° in the day and 75° at night. The whole point of the bedroom A/C is to keep my bill down during the summer months. I checked my energy company site this week which gives me daily usage numbers and using this unit DOUBLES my daily kilowatt hours! How is that even possible?! Not only did I basically flush $200 buying the unit, it is pulling almost the same power as running the central A/C in the whole 1200 sq ft house! Everything about this unit and this experience was a massive fail. I will not be buying a GE product again. The unit in the same spot that actually ran and produced very cold air consistently for three years+ and kept my costs down was a Frigidaire. Lack of availability and my desire to hurry cost me, but lesson learned. A new Frigidaire is on the way."
Got this AC unit for my mom. was easy to install and seems to work well but is very very loud which troubles her.
It makes a lot of weird noises.. almost like it's about to breakdown
"Had a handyman install the unit and it the boxes, it worked. Put in a 200 square. Ft. Room. Blew cool air for a week! Just long enough for me to throw the box away!!It's been nothing more than an overpriced fan since. Nothing makes it provide cool air since. I would strongly recommend others to NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
Did not come with remote control
"I want to love this AC. I bought it for my daughter's room that is less than 1 years old. It's the hottest room in the house. As you see in the picture, it runs fine, but then at some point in the night, the AC just doesn't kick back on. I'm Constantly monitoring and setting an alarm because I don't trust this AC. You can see that it cycles on and off, and then at some point doesn't. I have wake up in the middle of the night to turn the level up to get the AC to kick back on. I've tried different settings. I'm on the brink of returning even though I wanted to love it. It's lightweight compared to others and fits just fine in the window. I wish it cooled consistently."
"I purposely chose a unit that used manual controls, but unfortunately the quality of plastic used is subpar... after a month's use the control that turned device on or off broke. Even if the price is right for a small room, the fact that the control knob broke makes this device unreliable. Right now it keeps the room cool but for how long (?).  To make matters worse, it replaced a very old unit, using similar control knobs that never broke in over 10 years of use. Just pathetic quality and would not recommend."
"I had the same issue with a previous 'non remote control' AC unit. This one is fine, don't get me wrong; it's not crazy noisy, the price was great and when it does blow AC air it's cold and fine for a small room. The only issue is that sometimes it simply will not kick in to AC mode even on the 'Cool' setting, it's just blows nasty humid fan air so I end up having to open the window next to it so I can at least breathe in here. When the AC compressor kicks in (no way to know why, when or how it 'decides' this since there are NO energy saver controls or any settings other then the 1980's dials) it performs fine. It's usually if it's sunny and daytime and over a certain temp outside, but the entire thing is slightly insane. Nothing in the manual that comes with it addresses this.Next AC I buy will not be this 'lo tech' yet somehow sentient in its ability to decide when the climate is suitable for me to deserve air conditioning. It's not worth uninstalling and trying to return it, but whatever, I'll live, lol."
"Updated (see original review below): not only did they give me a used AC, the AC doesn't work well. After 1-2 months of usage it cranks very loud, blows out some moist air, and stops working in the middle of the night, and I wake up sweating. I have to turn it on and off for it to work again, which is annoying. ALSO, it spits orange liquid out of the side and ruined my window and parts of that side of the house. And it’s only been 1-2 months that I used it; compared to AC’s I owned for 1-2years that have not done this. Contacted Amazon and GE and only been getting run arounds, and now it’s been getting later and later and way past the return window, which I have already passed when I found out what a scam this AC is… I’m not sure how this AC has so many good reviews, was I just the unlucky one in the batch? How unlucky of me… or it’s just bad, cause I saw someone else with these same problems.Original Review: The AC looks pretty modern and is small like how I wanted, so it fits perfectly in my room. That I like. I just installed it, and it runs alright so far (only turned it on for 30mins). So, we will see how it goes. However, I am super DISAPPOINTED as I bought it new and I got a USED one!!! So upsetting, because if they were going to give me a used one, they should say it and charge me less for it and not the full price of a new one. I had scheduled someone to help me install it the day after it arrived, so I cannot even return it/exchange it, because then I would have to cancel the installation and reschedule. Plus, the AC itself might not be bad, so we will have to see. But I still am upset because of the principle of it all; how can they give me a used one?! I uploaded some pictures here to show the blemishes on the sides and front, and dirt and scratches on the bottom. It is very minor details and some can be washed off, but it shows that it was used. Or else it wouldn’t have those marks. I had to spend so much time wiping it down and sanitizing it, because we’re still in the midst of a COVID-19. If I didn’t mind a used one, I would have clicked the option for “used” and gotten a cheaper one!!!"
Does not have a good blower but cools a extra small room ok
It is loud and it really only cools one room.
"Out of the box I turned on the unit and there was a very loud noise due to the blower fan hitting the back of the styrofoam housing. If I pushed a little on the grille the noise would stop. I reinstalled the grille as the instructions said and the noise went away for a while but would come back once I tried to install the bottom grille screws. It looks like the grille pushes back the styrofoam so I had to rig up something on the inside to get this to stop.While this looks nice and everything seem else seems good so far, I would not recommend this product."
"Opened the box to find a dented A.C, registration card showed a card to scan. Warranty costs additional money. So far I'm not very impressed.  GE is a good brand and I expected more."
Didn’t install it because my console start working after an AC technician put gas on it
"There was one for 130 dollars. I am like I am not going cheap on this. That one had a remote control and temperature control, but it was ugly looking and cheap. This one is absolutely useless. I has no features. You have to manually do everything. The insolation that comes with it is so useless you have to add some materials to it to work. First problem Noise.... I am not talking about the machine's noise. I am talking about it has no noise insolation. Now everybody can hear you. second problem the Unit has holes where you can literally see the outside world. This means that when you turn it off. The hot air from the outside gets in the house beating the purpose of the machine in the first place. You will have to buy a front cover and a back cover to protect yourself during winter. I paid $ 200 dollars for the color basically. No temperature control... what were you thinking"
GE air conditioner is too noisy.
"This unit cools a much larger area in our home then it said it would, which is amazing! We also have vaulted ceilings and keeps the kitchen, dinning, and living room nice a cool! It is a little loud when it is running, but you do get used to it and becomes background noise. The remote has worked great and makes it even more convenient. The unfortunate thing was that we are on our third unit as the previous units all came damaged. The third unit that we kept came damaged too, but we settled with keeping it and getting some money back. The unit overall works great, but the three units we received were all damaged."
Could be colder
"I bought this used in great shape. When it was delivered not in manufacture box, it looked good. When I plugged it in to test it the fan mad a bad noise like it was hitting something. I shut it off and looked in through the vent slots you could see some broken plastic in the bottom under the fan.  So I boxed it up and sent it back. I'm not sure if they sent it out broken or it was damaged during shipping.  The Box was in good shape."
"This is used in our bedroom.  It fits nicely in the window.  However, to get coolest air it has to be set at max control (10) and high air fan.  Anything lower than 9 is just a fan room temp.  Not very satisfied with the quality of this air conditioner.  Would not buy this brand again."
"I just got this unit maybe 4 hours ago and already love it. Its pretty quiet but not THAT quiet. Its cold and easy to install. 10/10Edit: its not that cold. I had a 5000btu one that had me freezing, but this one is not cold at all and its 6000btu. I dont know if i got a faulty one but im gonna ask for a replacement.Edit 2: got a replacement after sending the faulty one back, and this one came in much better shape than the other one. The other one was banged and the coils in the back were hit too. The new one is good and works as expected, which is great. And i must say, its way quieter than the one i got prior. 10/10."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            First the delivery guy was great but the delivery was not. I ordered the matted A/C then I received this one and it's all scratch up and banged up, I could see if I had ordered a used one this would probably be acceptable but I ordered a new one and this is NOT acceptable wow this is sooo frustrating because I was really awaiting for this one especially because its been so hot n now to have to spend  more time to return it can't believe this."
I bought 2 of these units. Both are cooling a 200sq feet room. One blows cold and the other not as much.
"The unit cools great, but for some reason it retains water and makes a constant loud water sloshing sound, like a loud water fountain in the room. I removed the plug and even drilled another hole, but it didn't make any difference.  Waste of goodmoney because of the constant annoying sloshing."
"It cools very well and very quickly. I have a small bedroom and this indeed perfect. However, the noise is ridiculous! It’s louder than my old, larger units and I specifically bought it because one of the photos said it was “quick, quiet cooling.” The higher you put the louder it gets and already loud on the “low” setting. The cooling is exceptional. If you don’t mind the noise. For me, when I’m in it for any amount of time, I have to turn it off. Counterproductive to me"
"I’m incredibly disappointed in this purchase. I had it professionally installed, so, I can’t return it; otherwise, I would. First, I don’t mind a consistent noise to sleep, too, even if it’s relatively loud. But, this air conditioner sometimes sounds like there are rocks being thrown around inside. Other times, it blows quietly, then it will suddenly change to a noise like a train going through my room. It’s awful! It even scares my animals, who are very laid back. I like having them with me for safety and comfort, but they refuse to be in the room when this is on. Finally, it takes forever to cool my small bedroom. I have use window, air conditioners for many years, and this one is the absolute worst!"
This is a very noisy air conditioner even on low. I am surprised because I experienced a GE at a friends and asked her how is her apartment so cool. She pointed to her very quiet GE air conditioner. She also had it in her open kitchen/ living area.I have this ac in a small bedroom using suggested BTU. I have it at the coolest and is has yet to feel really cold and we haven't summer yet. So I don't know how well it will handle a heat wave.The noise is too much though.
The problem I had was with the flimsy accordion side panel.  It ripped before i even installed it so now I have cardboard on the side until/if I buy a new panel which is another expense.  The compressor never sounds like it kicks on so I am not sure if its ultra quiet or not working.  I would send back if shipping wasn't a hassle.
"Even on the highest setting, it struggles to reach a comfortable temperature. The installation kit was confusing and not user-friendly."
"I bought this unit and installed it two weeks ago. Even with my curtains drawn, all trouble shooting completed, and my bedroom door closed to make sure it’s an enclosed space.. it does not cool my bedroom. It blows slightly less hot air than the temperature of the room. After running for 30 minutes there is not a noticeable change in temperature."
The A/C works good enough and is rather quiet in my opinion.
Loud. Doesn't cool for long. Cheap product. Doesn't cool even a very small room with the door closed.
Well this is barely day three since I made this purchase. Day one was amazing I had it on low cooling and I thought this little machine can blow and my apt felt cold and amazing 😳. Day two had me thinking wait it me or was it colder before. Now on day three I have it on high cool and maximum 10 and my apt is barely cool….not freezing cold as it should be on maximum high. I plan on returning this for hopefully another that works better but I don’t want to sleep in heat and it’s still hot 😩 anyway I read other reviews about the same concerns but looked over it because of the price….You get what you pay for pretty much so don’t expect the best.Hope this helps!!!
This was very upsetting. I got this on one of the hottest days of this year. Putting it together and one of the side extensions was broken then once we went to put it in the window (willing to use a cardboard in place of the broken extension) the other side breaks….. to weak.
"it cools the room, doesn’t make it cold ."
"I gave this 4 stars because after the initial install after a couple nights of running it there would be this ticking noise but after a week of use I haven't noticed it or I have gotten used to it! It does chill our bedroom very fast (12x11)  and by the time we wake up I am freezing I have to keep the door cracked, I know you can change the fan speed and cooling but it doesn't really work well when doing so, so keeping it on the highest setting is best for the most optimal chill. For the value of this AC unit it is a good deal...so far. Also setting it up was easy/putting it together , I do wish the curtains and the support for the curtains was a little sturdier but we have made it work!EDIT: after week one it sounded like a faucet was running and I tried all the remedy’s and missed the return date although I’m not sure that would be a fun return , it still sounds like a faucet is running/water running  right when I turn it on so I’m sure something is broken! Not sure who to contact! Great!"
"After barley use for 1 year , this start making extreme noise with Fan or whatever soooo loud , very loud for some reason, and ECO setting working very weird turns off the AC when room is like very hot and didnt cool off enough , super not happy and very upset with this AC unitTried to contact support and nobody helped me , so that is that , its BAD"
"It cools my son's 11' x 14' room amazingly well, but it makes a very annoying, metallic clatter when it's on Low Fan and Low Cool.  It sounds like the fan might be hitting something as it spins.  I exchanged it for another of the same, and that one did it, too.  Really disappointing for an A/C that actually does the job well."
"Unfortunately, the left side panel of my air conditioner arrived broken so I had to use cardboard. It was unnecessarily difficult to install and requires two people. It works well for my studio apartment. I get cold easily so I don’t need to have it turned up all the way to feel it. I would not recommend this for anything bigger than a 500-600 sq ft studio apartment, or anywhere the temperatures exceed 95 degrees fahrenheit. I would have given this air conditioner a higher rating if my panel didn’t arrive broken and it was easier to install."
"I bought 2 of these. 1 arrived with the box soaked in oil and did not work so I returned it, the other one worked by makes a load rattling sound when the cooling is on. Once I got my replacement for the defective one, it too arrived damaged and would not work. Skip these and just go to your local store and pick one up that works."
"The unit itself works great but you have to assemble the curtains onto the AC and into the panels. The curtain plastic is very thin and broke trying to slide it into the side of the ac unit due to the unit being slightly pulled in the center. The other curtain that didn't break wants to pop out of the panel it connects into for the window, lots of small gaps for night time insects to get through where curtains attach to the unit so you will be using plenty of foam."
The ac works but need a small room I have a 12x12 and it doesn't seem to cool the whole room. I only need it for night so it has to run all night to keep the room cool. It is reasonably loud not as quiet as the previous one I have. It says the eco will kick off and on but it does not it stays running. It would be good for a small space not a room like mine.
"This air conditioner fails to cool the room effectively and is excessively noisy.I purchased this air conditioner hoping it would keep my room cool during the hot summer months, but it has been a major disappointment. Despite following all the setup instructions carefully, the unit barely cools the room, even after running for hours. The cooling power is simply inadequate, and the room remains uncomfortably warm.Moreover, the noise level of this air conditioner is quite high. It makes a constant loud humming sound, which is particularly bothersome at night and disrupts sleep. I expected a quieter operation, especially considering the price.I have tried adjusting the settings and ensuring that the filters are clean, but nothing seems to improve its performance. Given the high cost, I expected much better quality and efficiency. I am returning this product and would not recommend it to others."
This product worked great for the first few days of use. Now it work on LOW cool but doesn’t work on HIGH cool anymore. I recommend spending more money on something better.Plus side-easy to install-it fit nicely in my tiny she-shed window-low cool works goodNegatives-High cool doesn’t work after a few uses
The cooling isn’t a problem.  It’s very noisy when compressor kicks on.  All you hear is the plastic vibrate terribly and it just sounds like it’s struggling on any fan speed.  I’ve adjusted it 4 different times in the window and the end result is it’s still noisy.  Not good for a bedroom.
"Product seems good and pumps out good cold air. The downside is that the fan is louder than my old AC so keeping it on at night makes it a bit harder to fall asleep. If you plan on keeping this bad boy on at night, you might consider a quieter unit. I won't be here more than 2-3 weeks so I can live with it while I'm visiting. But for a permanent solution I would replace it. As a day AC it works good, but again, loud. YMMV"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I totally understood what I was receiving because of the price but I did not know it wasn't going to blow no cold air and that's what a little unhappy about cuz I let it run for 3 hours or more when I first got it it did nothing but blow hot air you know I'm stuck about air conditioner I would really counting on y'all though pull through for me I guess but it didn't happen but thank you
This was a disappointment. It came broken with screws sticking out of places that screws should not have been. Then screws were loose this product was sold to me beoken and the seller knew. I have this already installed in anothwr room and it gets 🥶 COLD. So that was a big disappointment especially being so hot in our house due to our central AC unit quit on us so it was kinda vital to have purchased a broken product was very irritating and super frustrating. At least AMAZON stepped in and helped me out here as THEY ALWAYS DO! Thats why i always go w AMAZON as my first choice.
"The AC worked great for around 60 days. I was actually surprised at how well this little unit worked for cooling my office. I've now had the AC unit for just over 2 months and it is already having issues. It emits a near-constant squealing noise whenever it is on. The noise level ranges between mildly annoying and ear-piercing even if you switch off the AC entirely and just run the fan.I understand it is a cheap AC, I didn't expect it to last me 10 years but I think it's fair to expect a $200 AC unit to at least last one full summer. I guess now I get to find out how GE's warranty support is. If it's adequate I will update this review but as of right now I am very unhappy with this purchase."
"Bought this AC window unit for my room and I’d give zero stars if I could. Things slowly went downhill as soon as the package was received. The manufacturing box had a large liquid stain that appeared to be some kind of oil. While installing, it was clear that there was shoddy manufacturing as well. One of the accordion plastic flaps that pull out to cover the gap between the window immediately broke when lightly pulled and detached from the unit so I improvised and nailed it into place. Once the unit was turned on, it blew outside temperature air. I figured that it might need a a few minutes to cool down but even after hours of being on, it still was blowing warm air. Very disappointing. The low price was too good to be true."
"Apartment doesn’t have central air so I bought a box fan, temps were staying in the 90s so I ordered this window AC unit, the box fan was doing a better job of keeping my room cool. Maybe I got a defective unit but it looks fine and the box looked fine."
"I have 130 sq foot room.  Installed this today with no issues, however, it couldn't bring the temp below 85.  To be fair, it does get to 115 outside where I live, so probably too much heat for it.  Ended up returning and ordering a different window unit."
Make sure you size your window correctly. It didn’t fit properly and it leaks water on your carpet and/or carpet. My carpet is soaked and I have to get a wet/dry vacuum to get it all up out my carpet. I was told it should’ve came with a drain piece in order for the water to run out of the window. I’m sending it back and going to just get a portable one.
Put it in our bedroom and is awfully noisy!!! But easy to run.
"I’m definitely not impressed with this model versus the two older General Electric Air conditioners that I own. One I bought in 2007 and the other 2013. And both work great. However I can’t say the same with this new one.  First off I can’t understand why an air conditioner would be designed that the airflow comes out at a downward angle towards the floor……  with now way of changing it.  You can change the direction from side to side but not up and down.  Why would they remove this option???secondly, I don’t know if it’s because of the airflow being Angled down and basically being sucked back in the return vent, but I have it set on 70F and even though the room is 80F plus degrees. I have to keep it set on 65F  or the unit shuts off .  Could be A thermostat calibration issue or it could be that all the cold air is basically getting sucked right back into it.  Or could be both.  Idk for sure.  I shouldn’t have to diagnose what’s wrong with a new air conditioner. I’m most likely going to be returning this unit and purchasing another brand.I’m definitely not happy that I’m going to have take it apart and box it back up drive to who knows where to ship back.My next purchase will be local . That way I know exactly what I’m getting.Very Disappointed in you General Electric.Things just are not made the way they use to be."
"I bought this in late July 2024 and installed it around the hottest time of the year, august. Now it's November, colder. I wanted to experience using it in both hot and cold weather before writing my review.It worked great as an AC and heater. I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet and efficient it is. It is noisier when using for heat as the heatpump seem to rattle when starting up. Once it is running for a few minutes, then it quiets down.The temperature sensor does not work. It seem to use the outside temperature and not the inside. In summer, it's 95+F outside, I have to set it to 75F to keep it from getting too cold in my office. In the winter, I have to set it to 72F as the outside temperature drops into the 50s to keep it from making my office too hot. I have a temperature sensor in my office that measure 78F degree, but this unit kept outputting heat.I had it set to auto and 74F, and one cold winter morning, I came into my office to a very hot 80F! Reducing it to 72F stops the heat.So it looks like this unit is using outdoor temperature to decide when to run.2024/12/16 update - in heat mode, there is a deep bass hum from the unit. It works well though on cold days. It struggles when outside drops below 41F, but above that, it works well. Once Midea fixes the temperature sensor, I'll raise the rating, otherwise I am happy with it."
"I love this little thing, but she’s disappointingly cheaply made. The quality of the electronics is poor and I would look to see if any comparable competitor products come on the market before buying another. The entire right side of the touch controls has never worked / is totally unresponsive to touch at any level of pressure (I remember seeing another review complaining about this too so it seems like there is a pattern of faulty control pads), but I didn’t try to exchange it because I control it with the app anyways (not sure if the remote works because it did not come with batteries and I haven’t gotten around to buying any) and cannot really lift it myself. This worked amazingly well the first few weeks but  became a little more erratic after that, in that it seems like the temperature sensor fluctuates and it’s active more than I’d expect… when I first got it my apartment would feel cool with it set at 76-78, and more recently there have been times where I had it set at 74 auto and came home and it was 79 degrees and humid like it hadn’t been running all day (this has only happened once, but after it happened I found that I needed to keep the temp lower than before around 72 to be comfortable (which is what I’ve generally had past ACs at, but for the first few weeks 72 for this unit felt like 65). It seems to be on constantly, but it is pretty quiet and my electric bill is somehow lower than it was before summer so that is great.The ability to control it via an app and the heat pump functionality were big selling points for me… the app works well enough, but it was confusing to know where to get it (the app is not made by midea, which is actually a violation of Apple’s developer rules/it could easily get kicked off the App Store for that), it keeps bothering me to clean the filter every other day (since the first week I turned it on) even though the filter is always clean/unobstructed, sometimes the app will not be able to connect to the unit, it randomly turns off eco mode/resets things for no reason, the UX is poor, etc.This will give you the features of a mini-split in an apartment without hiking your electric bill, but there are clear quality issues and defects that make me afraid about its longevity."
"Ordered new, received a used unit that was repackaged with zero care whatsoever (see photos). It surprisingly survived the trip despite being put in the box upside down and had everything rattling around inside. I double checked that all the hardware was present and took my chances with installing it. I prayed that it would work because I wasn’t keen on carrying a 55lb box of bits to the UPS store. The good news: it works. And it works decently. The instructions are horrible and have you install the whole thing just to take it out so you can put the insulation in, doesn’t explain where the insulation is supposed to go, and doesn’t include enough insulation for the many gaps that I ended up with. The accordion sides don’t fit properly into the window channel so there’s gaps that I had to tape up there. There’s HUGE gaps underneath that I need to stuff some insulation into once I get more, and the clips that were provided for the bottom sill are much too tall and just barely serve the purpose they were intended for. App setup was a breeze but unfortunately it only works on a 2.4GHz network. Matter setup worked fine with Google Home but not with Alexa so I had to add the poorly rated Smarthome skill to get it to show up. The Google/Alexa integration is mostly useless because it doesn’t have all the controls available that are in the app. The remote control works sometimes. Add to all this that the price dropped TWICE by the time I ordered and received the beat up AC yet Amazon no longer does post-purchase price adjustments. Needless to say, I’m a little bitter. But at least I am less sweaty now, I guess.Day 2 update: Everything seemed okay until this evening. Temperature has been set at 73, auto mode, auto fan speed, and ECO since installing. The room was reading 76 so I went to check to make sure it wasn’t broken and discovered it running the heater! It’s 83 outside!"
"I was optimistic, but like many others, my unit arrived damaged.  It's unfortunate that these units are just not properly packaged for shipping based on their weight/size.  The unit I received has very obviously been dropped during shipping on its back where the coils and lots of other soldered components are located.  I went ahead and installed it because replacements are not currently available.  I elected to let the unit sit unpowered for 48 hours after install to allow the compressor oil to return to it's intended position since the unit was clearly not kept in the proper orientation during shipment.  Some of the softkeys on the unit itself don't seem to work well, or at all for some of them, but other than that, so far it seems to work ok though I'm honestly concerned the damage that occurred during shipment may cause premature failure.  I contacted Amazon and CS was very helpful.  Because there were no replacements, I ended up receiving a partial refund after sending photos (this was maybe the most painful part as the email size is very limited so even 2 pictures per email was too large and zip files were equally problematic).  The phone App seems to work very well to the point I only played with the remote once (the remote is also damaged where the front top half looks like it was crushed or overheated to where the top and bottom don't meet on the sides and it feels like the top is flimsy/will separate if used a lot, but it seems to work ok at least based on the little bit I used it.  It may just be poor quality control.).My unit has quite a significant low frequency vibration to it when the condenser fan starts up/stops (shakes the walls and sounds like a car idling outside) but once it gets up to speed it's not quite as noticeable.  I don't know if this is normal or if it's from being dropped during shipment?I've had the fan setting on Auto during operation and from a noise perspective inside, I don't find it too annoying at all, and it's quiet enough to me that it doesn't interfere with normal TV volume or bother me when I'm sleeping.The side curtains don't really seal the sides well when attached, especially in the lower corners where the unit sits on the window sill.  I ended up caulking my unit in and I ordered a window AC insulation kit that I'll be installing this next weekend to help seal things up and provide a little more finished look to it.I wish it weren't damaged during shipment, as it would help me better estimate whether it's operating as intended and I think it could've easily been worthy of a higher rating, but it seems damage during shipment is the norm based on other reviews I've read here.I'm in the second week of using this unit since receiving and installing it.  Overall, I think I would buy this unit again as it seems to cool well, and I hope the heating function is as effective down to the 41F outside temp limit for supplemental heat."
A/c work great as far a cooling not a problem. Heater works fine UNLESS outside temp goes below 41 degress than it defaults and say LO on the tempature screen and will not come back on until outside temp is over 41. So not good if that is the main heat for the room it was purchased for. Purchased in July was a 5 star on the cooling side and a 3 star on the heater.
"If you are looking for straight up cooling without anything fancy, and dont mind the noise, then you cant go wrong with this small AC unit. It cools a medium/large sized room very well and even the hallway starts to cool down. My gripes are not about the cooling, but instead about its features. You cannot move the vents up or down, only left or right. You cannot choose a set temp as it only has a dial and you kind of have to guess. When it kicks in, it is super loud along with a unique gurgling sound and at times it even dims my lights in the bedroom. Not sure what that is about, as it only happens between noon and 4 pm. Overall, I might make this sound terrible, but its not. For cooling, it does the job quite nicely for its size. It simply lacks features and is noisy. So if that doesnt bother you then save some $$$ and grab this. However if you are looking for more control, then this might not be your best option. This is a great garage or shed AC unit or something extra for your PC room in the summer."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Is extremely loud.It became loud in cooling mode after a couple of weeks of use. In cooling mode this dribbling motor sound comes periodically .Now when we switched the heating mode on, it is constant.The sound level is about 68-70 DB measured 2 feet from the device.Contacted support, they issued a refund (mailing a check, no Amazon refund).This is appreciated. It took about a month to get the check though.And they stopped responding to follow ups, when we asked where the check is.They responded only when I published a negative review on Google maps.The check was mailed on November 1 and not on October 21 as they said. We have the envelope with postal stamp."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was disappointed in this AC. The previous 6,000 BTU model (pictured) MAW06R1BWT worked sooo much better. This one doesn’t blow nearly as cold enough and is also louder. It doesn’t rattle so the noise is tolerable but overall the cooling quality is a bummer. I’ve had it down to 62 and my apartment is still fairly warm. The previous older AC unit (pictured) cooled my entire basement apartment. This one only cools the room it’s installed in and not even as well as I’d like. Water does NOT drain on either of these AC units on its own, even when properly installed, so you have to use the “gauze trick” which works fine if you don’t mind swapping out often (pictured) or void the warranty and drill a hole (which I finally gave up and did with the old one). But once I did that the old unit was great! I wanted a second one but it wasn’t avail so I got this one. The exterior of this newer unit also runs a lot hotter than normal and I was concerned of its longevity. Disappointing overall compared to the previous model, but if you buy at an inexpensive price point, it gets the job done for a small room."
"Normally, an air conditioner cools and dehumidifies at the same time. Not this unit!  These are 2 separate settings: dry and cool.When the cool setting is selected, the unit will work to maintain a set temperature in the space. Let's say for example that we set it at 74. The unit will monitor the room temp (though it will not display said actual temp anywhere, including in the app) and cycle on and off to maintain that temp. Great. However you will notice after a while that the space is becoming more and more humid. Why? Well, it turns out that the cooling function isn't actually removing any moisture from the air like a normal AC unit.Okay, so let's switch out over to the 'dry' mode instead. This is great! The air is coming out much drier and still cooling. But wait, why is it still running after 30 minutes? And why is it so cold in here?! Turns out that the 'dry' mode doesn't self regulate to maintain the target room temp! So it just runs and runs until you switch it to another mode. I'm the user manual, it says that the dry mode doesn't actually cool, but that the air coming out might feel cool because of the dehumidifying... Okaaaay? Except despite the summer heat, that dry mode cooled the space down to 60 and would have kept going if we hadn't shut it off.So, moral of the story is that with this unit, you can either cool your space to a specific temp and have all the humidity, OR you can have drier air and an indeterminate temp. Yes, you can program a schedule using the app so it switches back and forth between the modes, but it's a pain in the @$$ to get it just right so you're not freezing or sitting in a swamp. This really shouldn't be an issue in the first place. The unit should be able to cycle itself on and off during dry mode according to the thermostat that it clearly has. This is just bad design."
"The room it's cooling is a small, corner room with a dormered ceiling that receives sunlight almost the entire day - and we live in the south where the heat and humidity are excessive - needless to say, it gets very hot. The unit does  cool the room down and keep it habitable as the sole source of cooling.The installation instructions covered several different models and could have been clearer, and the unit we received looks to be used and not new. It was very clear that someone had already attempted to install this unit and returned it, as there were tool markings and some bent areas that showed wear. Had we not already had the window open, modified, and ready for install, we would have returned it, but I took a star off for lack of quality control. Buyers should thoroughly inspect their units before getting ready for the installation, so don't be like me.The noise of the unit is louder than any other window unit we have in the house, including some much older units. I don't have to yell over it while on conference calls, but it's definitely louder than a big box fan, certainly louder than white noise. It's annoying, but broiling in my home office is infinitely worse.One other thing to note is that despite being installed and having weather stripping all the way around it with no gaps to the outside, bugs have managed to find their way into my home office. I've made the acquaintance of more than a few since installing, and the only way I can see them coming in is through the unit itself. There are external mesh A/C covers sold on Amazon, and I'd recommend that highly with this particular unit."
"Update: I have received a replacement thru Amazon. The ""NEW"" unit appears to be really new and functioning mostly ok.  Moved up to 3 stars. The reasons are, the thermostat is not very accurate and I have to set it to 78 and end up with 74 actual degrees in the room. Also, the dry function (dehumidifier) doesn't allow control for fan speed or temperature at all. The only thing you can do is shut off the unit to stop it from running. There is also minor damage to the fins on the back of the new unit. I have also tested the heat function briefly and it appears to work ok. Overall, I would still keep this unit. I hope that it will last a few years._______________________________________________________________________________________________Original review:There was a prior customer shipping label on the box (still partially visible) and my shipping label covered the one from the old customer. The sender's address appeared to be some distribution center but not an Amazon warehouse.  The unit had scratch marks on it but was quiet during operation and had a good cooling capacity. However, the first time it was turned on the ""Clean Filter"" light was on. Sure enough, the filter was really dirty. (like it had been used for a while) Anyhow I decided to test it for a few days to see if there were any issues. After a few hours of use, the unit went to the highest fan settings and stayed there. There was no way to stop that unless it was turned off or unplugged.  At least it was cooling and maybe that is why they pushed it back out the door. But this is no excuse to send a used unit and try and pass it off as new. I have already ordered a replacement/exchange for this unit. As long as the replacement functions correctly, I will keep the ""NEW"" one as it still appears to be a good unit."
"bought 7/19/2022, AC cooling part died today 6/8/2024, only fan now works.. was protected from weather, filter was regularly cleaned weekly, i never had it running above low cool and it was in a small laundry room so not much to cool off; so no reason why it should of died after not even 2yrs…but, i suppose it should of been expected for it to die early since this AC never actually shuts totally off unless you shut it down. when it is powered on, the fan runs the whole time even when not cooling.. I suppose for its low price of $150 new, i still got a good deal for 2 summers and almost one month this year."
"This gets 2 stars because it does what it says it'll do, which is push cold air and that's pretty much where the good stops.However, to get this to work in a standard window requires modifying the unit into un-returnable and likely warranty breaking conditions. Other features of this unit make it a very niche use-case and be aware of some design flaws that may give you an unpleasant experience, as it did for me.PROS:+ Cheap for a window unit and small rooms for spot cooling.CONS:- Bottom feet are wider than window groove. It will not rest properly inside the window.  Other brand units I've owned were a standard size and fit. This one does not fit without taking pliers and bending them to a point that they will fit within standard window grooves.- Top bracket is too narrow for a standard window to slide into and seal.  Again, with other brands, the top bracket on the unit is deep enough for the window to seat fully into, but not this one.  Once again I had to use Pliers to pry apart the top bracket so it was spaced enough that the window could properly seat into and secure the unit in place.- Air filter slides out to the side.  If your window is very wide this may not be an issue, but if it narrow, you will not be able to remove the filter for cleaning as the window sill/frame will block it from being removed.  This is a cheap design probably to save a little manufacturing money, as other units i've had featured hinged fronts that can be pulled out to clean the filter.- Vent direction/Flow handle is very flimsy and thin plastic, and it's very tight to change direction side to side.  I can forsee a near-future breakage since the operation of this mechanism requires a decent amount of force and it's not build rugged enough to last a long time.THOUGHTS:If you're looking to skimp and save a few bucks, just don't.  get a name-brand window AC unit that at least fits and seats into the window without having to mangle the unit to get it to do so."
I've had this for a few years and it was always a struggle to get it to fit correctly when I re-installed it after the winter (I have to uninstall it because I need to be able to open my window in the winter because our internal heating is too strong). There's always a gap between the AC and the window it rests on.Also the mounting accessories are not durable - the plastic stuff at the side that fills out the remainder of the window will break after a few years due to weatherizing.
"First, the unit and the packaging arrived damaged (see photos). I believe the damage was caused by poor handling during shipping.Secondly, the Amazon page state that the 10000 BTU mode requires 14 inches of window height. The package state that 15.5 inches is required. The package is correct. I got the unit installed but it required some modification of my window.Thirdly, it is advertised as a dehumidifier. However, there is no way to set the desired humidity level. I am not sure if it continues to run at cooler temperatures in the ""dry"" mode or whether it cycles off the compressor if the temperature is below the set point. I will have to wait for cooler weather to discover thatFourthly, it states it comes with all required mounting hardware. I guess that is true if you believe that five #8 by 3/4 inch screws screwed into a vinyl window frame are sufficient to prevent a 60 pound air conditioner from tilting down. I can assure you they are not. I added support on the outside window sill to hold up the back end of the unit. I am currently pondering a better long term solution to replace the lumber I used initially,Finally, there seems to be no set place for the water to drain from the unit. Currently it is pooling on the back of the bottom. There is one hole it can drain from but it is not at the low spot and water will accumulate and remain in the low area. I am sure after some time this will cause rust issues. There is also no way to connect a drain line if you want the water to go anywhere else except your window sill.It cools and is reasonably quiet so I generously gave it three stars despite the very poor design. I would not buy this brand AC in the future"
"This is my second Midea unit, the first being one of the U-shaped types where the window can mostly close. The second is this unit. Both are inverter models, which I understand are quite energy efficient. I was especially intrigued by this one because it has a heat pump. Granted, the heat only works at temperatures above 41 degrees F, but that's fine. I only need supplemental heat for a spare room. Both units work within expectations. The U-shaped unit will rattle/vibrate periodically and is louder than expected, but it's not overly concerning.The one thing I've noticed about both units is how they're assembled. The sheet metal is warped on both, and you can see poor attention to detail during the assembly. In the unit with the heat pump, one side is completely dented in, with the coils actually outside of the unit, beyond the cover. There are absolutely no signs of damage during shipping (i.e., no broken foam or box damage—shipping/logistics aren’t the issue here). They're being boxed poorly assembled or significantly damaged.I ended up prying things back into shape as best as I could. Hopefully, internal components are being handled differently. I'm slightly concerned that something could fail prematurely after the fact."
"It’s true, you get what you pay for. If you want a very quiet, easy to use, remote control/app friendly air conditioner, get the u-shaped Midea. This one here is for those who want to save money and that’s it. This thing is noisy, unattractive, has no remote control or app capability - you can’t even set a temperature on it. It’s just “less cool” or “more cool.” It’s a bottom of the barrel option. However, it does work. I have to turn it off for conference calls because it’s so loud, but at least I’m not sweating."
"I REALLY wish I could get past the condition this unit arrived in and just rate the unit itself.  Amazon advertised ""Open box. No visible damage"".  It was beat up front to back and top to bottom.  Had to bend mounting rail in a vice.  Glued some plastic covers.  Banged out some dents.  Fixed the vent cycle movement.  A return by any measure.  The box was in better shape than the unit!!!  But I'm relatively disabled and fixing was a lot easier than a return(and it was HOT here when purchased).  Amazon was NOT helpful since I did not buy it new and would not even offer to give me an additional lousy discount.  The discount for ""no visible damage"" was not significant............. The unit itself I'm VERY satisfied with.  The AUTO temp is a little tricky to set.  NOTE that the heater mode is not intended as sole means of warming a room.  This is a heat-pump and If the temp is too cold in the room it won't even try - ""LO"" is displayed.  This is a powerful unit and handled the Texas summer very well.  But Amazon has ruined me on purchasing ""open box"" items.  Beware."
"I wanted a small ac unit to cool a small room. I have 3 other ac units from the same brand for larger rooms. The are great. Very quiet and energy efficient.This ac unit is horrible. It will cool a small room down but It’s REALLY loud. Also, it never turns off. It just runs constantly.Go with the Midea ushape or Portable Air Conditioner instead of this."
"Easy setup, very straighforward instructions. Fits right in my windowlooks nice, functions fantastically. This thing gets PLENTY cold. I went from waking up in a pool of sweat every morning to having goosebumps and needing a blanket in July. The fan moves air quite well even without the AC. and the AC gets ice cold even at the lower settings and circulates around my small bedroom beautifully. Its not NEARLY as loud as the people in these other reviews are complaining about. Its fine. Its not distracting or bothersome, you dont have to talk over or listen over it, its not annoying at all really just background humming that youll naturally tune out. From a performance standpoint I couldnt have asked for anything more.Why did I dock two stars do you ask? Well heres why. The genius who engineered this thing forgot to include bottom vents. The portion that sticks out the window and is exposed to the outside has vents on the sides and the top, but not the bottom. Which means THE THING IS LITERALLY A GIANT RAIN BUCKET. You cannot make this up. The unit is essentially a box that just collects rain water. Every time it rains you have to wrestle it out of the window and tilt it forward or on its side to drain all the water it collects. If you dont youll hear the fan sloshing all the collected water about. Unbelievable that this item made it through testing and quality control and was ok'd for mass production and NO ONE caught this critical design flaw.Explains why a unit this powerful and effective is at such a killer price i suppose. Theyve gotta get some value out of these before they completely discontinue them."
"Did the job for quite some time, not the most silent window ac unit, but cools nice. Would probably last much longer with proper maintenance, but mine gave out after 2 years. Nowadays there are better looking and more efficient ones around this price, but if you’re in a rush, this one will do."
"I was so pleased with my Midea 8,000. I thought I'd get this for a small bed room.There is no way to tell what temperature on this one is at as it changes?I am never too worried about noise. This thing is LOUD. It sounds like tank.It does cool.... it never shuts down. Just throws out swamp air between it's banging.I do not recommend!"
We ordered this unit specifically for air and heat. Low n behold the heat pump dosnt work below 40 degrees. What the point of it having heat? That was the main reason we bought it.No where did it state this when we bought itOnly in the owner Manuel.  What a waste of 500 dollars. I do not recommend this brand
The machine is fairly quiet. With the temperature setting it cycles automatically.The energy efficiency rating on the box was slightly lower than I expected. Whether that is due to the company or my fault I’m not sure. The fins / vents do not seem to be movable.I have had the ac on for a week. It seems to vibrate a bit more than my old one
"This is my THIRD Midea air conditioner in a year. I've gone through two Midea 12kBTU U-shaped air cons as well as this.My first Midea U-Shape worked great for a few months, but then the refrigerant line blew and the unit had to be replaced. I did a warranty replacement and got a new one, but that didn't cool my 150sq ft room below 75 degrees, even when it was 80F outside.THIS air conditioner is no different. It's been running in a 150 sq ft room for THREE HOURS and has cooled the room about 4-5F. Sometimes it cools better on ""dry"" mode, sometimes on ""cool"" mode, but it never actually gets below 73-74F.I will be returning this and switching brands - though so many other brands have the same issue.I have no idea what's going on with Midea but their window ACs don't seem to cool well despite racking up the power bill."
"Works good enough for small room (bedroom)  However, the accessories (foam) did not work well, nor did the extensions on the side of the AC unit -  did not fit properly and I had to buy other type of insulation for the sides of the AC and underneath the AC"
So far I am satisfied with this unit. It does what it's supposed to do. It's quiet and cools room quickly especially with the 🚪 shut. Only down side is it doesn't have the energy save mode to set it like a thermostat to cut on and off when selected temperature is set and no medium just high and low but for the cost... IM SATISFIED
"Box and AC arrived undamaged. Installation easy, fit window wonderfully. Noticed chemical smell, cooling was working fine. Over a couple of weeks the chemical order got stronger and the cooling got weaker. Was able to return and received refund without a problem. The reviews for this product are great, which makes me think this was just an odd occurrence. Received refund, applied it towards a different AC Unit from same Manufacturer, still think this was just a one off."
"First thing: If you are buying this to put in a bedroom, be aware, this thing is LOUD. The fan only set at the lowest setting is very loud. I can generally sleep in a noisy environment, but had a very difficult time sleeping with this noise.Second thing: Check the thickness of your window sash. if it is thicker than 3/4 - 1 inch, it won't fit into the Top Rail as it should. I have an older house with original wooden windows, and it rests on top of the Top Rail, which leaves very little wood for the screw that holds the air conditioner in the window.It is a good thing they supply plenty of foam for insulating, you'll need it when you see all the daylight after installation.I have only run it last night, and the weather outside had cooled off, so I can't speak for the performance.Bottom line: if you just want a window AC that's below $200 and you're not worried about how loud it is and your windows aren't too old (thick), this unit will probably work well for you."
"Yes, it works. However, the cold air doesn't circulate. My feet and legs are cool, but the rest of my body is hot. I use govee and my bedroom temperature stays over 80 degrees with this machine at high levels. I am buying another but this time I will spend a little more money and make sure it has a thermostat and a remote control. Installation was easy It is not quiet."
"Easy installation as advertised. Cools down the room as expected, ideal for a small room but very loud, the compressor never stop making noises even when running on low cool. Would not recommend for those who can't endure noises very well."
This AC is not silent whatsoever. The Auto setting waits far too long to kick in. I would not purchase again for the noise alone.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Instructions don’t help you to understand how to install the unit into a window they sent screws that were too small to even drill into the window. Pretty noisy as wellOnly thing good about is exactly what’s it’s for and that’s to cool a room
Not very powerful.
"I really want to love this unit but no matter where I plug it in, it trips the GFCI. The electrical in this part of the house is less than 10 years old, so I know it's not that - and we've run an 8,000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner for about a year on the same outlet with NO issues...I love that I can check the temp from another room, but I'm mostly checking to see if it's online. Very disappointing! When it's on, it works great, but I can't be constantly worrying about whether it's tripping or not!"
I’m super disappointed that the thermostat does not turn the unit off and on according to temperature. It only turns the compressor off/on. The fan has to be running all the time for it to work.
This little unit worked well the first couple of days. Then the air started to blow mildly cool instead of cold. I tested out this unit and another portable a/c unit and have had much more success with the portable a/c unit. I still use this unit every night in our living room much it isn't much help during the 80-90 degree days in the south.
"Item was an easy install and it worked perfectly, however, through human error, the unit was too big to fit my window seal and had to return it. It is kind of loud and weighs about 40lbs. The temperature of the air was nice and cool. Appeared to be a good quality machine, but definitely measure, measure, measure everything."
Not quite like it was said to be. When compressor kicks on make a lot of noise. Was also bent in two places when delivered
I've installed window units before and never had so much trouble. Usually they pop in easy. This doesn't sit right and had to take it out and get boards later. The accordions are the most flimsy I have ever seen on a unit. Instructions are ridiculous. I hate this unit so much at this point that I don't care what I paid for it I want to set it at the curb for trash. I wish I never bought it. There are plenty of other brands with inverters and seems the heater on this is junk anyway
"It's good if you have a small room like me, but don't expect it to do a whole lot without sounding like an airplane"
Didn't know the heat will not turn on in winter. Took it out of the box and it said the heat will not turn on if it's below 40°F outside. So it won't turn on when it's cool enough to need the supplemental heat. It is quiet. The fan mode and AC mode work nicely. But if you're looking for a heat mode to help warm a room. Look for a different one.
"Works ok, it's noiser then some other options, basic functions, not poor or great"
"Although the AC is good and works well, it seemed like I was sent a used or customer returned unit. It had a lot of scuff marks on the bottom and some things were missing - a plastic cover that usually covers the electric cord. Even the foam padding tapes seemed quite short.Thankfully Amazon was helpful in setting things right and now it works fine. I will update once I really begin to use it as the weather gets warmer."
This air conditioner doesn't cool a room down quickly. It's in a small room and it takes a couple hours to cool it down even with my central air on.
"This ain’t conditioner is NOT quiet! Also, the controls are very hard to read. I would not recommend."
"lllI haven't found anything to complain about... yet. 8 have had the a/c for one day. Maintenance had no issues installing it, I turned it to 74 and automatic, it comes on and off to keep room temp at 74. Fan is good and of course the weather is perfect to not use it. I'll have to check in again when it's 98 degrees and 95% humidity... Who knows? The shadow do!"
"This is more of a review of the used system than the A/C it self.My unit was delivered on its side and it had a large dint in the side that looks like could not be from shipping because the box was fine and the foam. I think none looked at it before shipping it off. I left it upright for maybe 8 hours before plugging it up, but it did make a horrible sound of like a card rubbing a fan but it was coming from the compressor. After I let it run for a few minutes it got quieter, now I can barely hear it.It is missing two of the 3 dran plugs.The AC it self seems like a good performer. On high it only pulls 600w with a moderate temperature difference, with a 1,400w heater blowing hot air in the front the most I saw it pull is 1,000w and still blowing ice cold air.I need to see if they will send me the plugs, because the efficiency should go up with them. Otherwise, I might just return it."
"I bought this for my small bedrooms. I find it to be quiet on the low settings, which do not cool the room.  It is very loud on the high settings which do cool the room.  I would strongly recommend buying a different AC, unless you like very loud air conditioners."
It takes all night to run in Premier to make our trailer living room cool
The AC portion works great. However the heat pump doesn't work when the outside is below 50 degrees not 40 degrees as stated.
"This brand new air conditioner (bought end of May, 2024) is so VERY loud it cannot be used when you want to listen to anything else (music, TV program, human conversation)."
"The product was in original manufacturer packaging only without extra box. The foam protecting the AC is about 1/2 inch thick which is not enough. Rear right corner was damaged significantly. The copper pipe inside had a dent as well, though it doesn’t seem to be enough to cause flow issue.Regarding noise level, I measured about 50 dB being away from it in the same room and about 53 dB when I was next to it. These are much higher than the advertised 45 dB. That said, it is one of the quietest AC I have had, and my bathroom fan makes the same noise level.I have yet to try the heating function. But I am happy with the user experience so far. I like the smart app control feature of it.Would have given 4 star if not for the damage during shipping."
"Cools as it should, but, it has no remote, no thermostat, no timer, no auto shutoff etc.  So it runs continuously until you shut it off.  Its a no frills ac unit.  Read the specs and reviews before purchase."
"The dial with various numbers is misleading and they might as well not bother at all, because there's no point: this thing either blows ambient-temperature air as a fan, or it freezes the bejeezus out of you, and nothing in between. There is no gradual ramping-up of the coldness. You can't make it ""slightly cold"" or ""moderately cold"". There is just ""damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead freaking cold"".If you like your home at 60 degrees without having to fiddle with the controls, this is the unit for you: just set it and forget it. It'll crank 'er up and permit you to freeze sides of beef, if that's a hobby you have. However, if you-- like me-- prefer to have a more moderate temp of 70 degrees or so, you are SOL with this bad boy.On particularly hot and humid days (90+, high humidity) when it's either have it on or roast alive, I find myself pulling out the winter clothes and bundling up so I'm not shivering (and I mean that literally). Long pants and sleeves, thick socks, a sweater... and outside, people are melting into the sidewalk. At night, I huddle under my winter duvet and ponder the ridiculous nature of life.This air conditioner has sent me into a full-scale spiral of existential dread. At least it was under $200? I'm mean, I've spent way more for my nervous breakdowns in the past. This is the most cost-efficient way I've accomplished it so far. *confused thumbs-up*"
"Bought 3, received very FAST. Heatwave upon us - kept our guests COOL. Low noise levels"
"I should have gotten a stronger one, I  thought it would be good for the bedroom,  but it should have been stronger.My fault."
"It seemed like a great AC. Difficult to install because it's so big and I'm on the 7th floor of a building. But after 2 years, somehow moisture got into the buttons and it doesn't work. This happened within 2 days time. To spend over 300 on an AC and put all the work into installing it for it to only work for 2 years is ridiculous. Of course the limited warranty is only 1 year. Don't buy if you want something long lasting"
"I purchased this unit a few months back thinking it would be perfect for our nursery. While it's advertised as being very quiet, I found that when starting up or switching from cool to heat, it makes loud crackling noises and vibrates excessively. I also noticed a strange odor sometimes."
"Efficiency, quiet, value, all I read about this unit is true, however there is one more point not discussed. When the unit is in the window and off you can feel so much breeze coming thru it from outside.  I am not sure why Midea does not seal the internals better. I have to actually cover the unit when it is below the 42 degrees required to operate."
"My stars are because 350sqft is really the top end in an ideal world.  In a less insulated space it’s not cooling 250sqft and I probably should have gone with a 12000 btu unit that at the time was only $30 more.  I was stupidly concerned about energy draw, but if it can’t cool the space or lower it a single degree… it doesn’t do much good.The air is cold, but I really thought it should handle my garage.  So, partially on me but also, if in doubt and you can, go bigger. This is only useful if I stand in front of it in my space."
I just installed today but the fan speed doesn’t work on the remote .
You can only set the temperature down to 60 degrees and I’m not a fan of the cold but my living room still feels lukewarm at 60 degrees. I need something colder.
"I didn’t have a ton of trouble installing, so that’s definitely a plus. It does a good job of cooling my bedroom, no issues there. But it’s very loud. I’m someone who likes to sleep with a fan on or some white noise, but even having this on low was too noisy. It’s got a sort of irritating ring to it when the cooling element is on. I bought this specifically to cool my room during the night so it wasn’t the best choice. No way could I sleep with the machine on high—it’s way too noisy. If you’re buying this for night time, I’d consider paying a little bit more for less noise. I normally would return but too much of a hassle to uninstall at this point."
Does not adjust automatically.  You have to adjust manually.  Will freeze you out of the room.
"This has been the most frustrating experience ever, The cooling works just fine but I will have to admit I did not check the heating right away so if you are unfortunate to buy this awful product check everything right away. It makes the most horrible noise so if it gets cold in the middle of the night it is so loud it will keep you up. It does not turn on all the time, it does not heat up and it leaks water. Now I am having a terrible time with my Amazon prime and A-Z guarantee because I am stuck with this thing now"
"Midea 5,000 BTU EasyCool Small Window Air Conditioner-Fins in the back are so fragile you leave your fingerprints on them, permanently.-Back of the case is bent like the Am smile )-The grooves don't fit a standard modern window frame properly-- yeah, sure, you can shove it there and slam it shut.-Pleats in the curtains with giant gaps-- you can see outside through them!-The ""firewall"", or the barrier between the inside and outside is a semi-transparent piece of styrofoam-Cooling in OK-ish. Nothing to write home about... May be OK for a really small room."
I ordered one it was severely damaged. Had it returned ordered another one it’s slightly damaged.
"Having an old, heavy A/C unit in my livingroom forever that started making noise a couple of years ago, I finally decided to upgrade to a more energy efficient and, more importantly, a more QUIET model. I researched online, read all the reviews and saw that Midea A/Cs were supposedly the most quiet ones on the market.So, despite never having heard of the company before, I decided to take a chance. I also decided to get the BTU rated model that was the next level above what my square footage called for because I wanted it to get cool quickly.I paid to have this professionally installed and after sitting down on my couch and turning it on, I was I shocked to discover that it is absolutely the NOISIEST air conditioner I have ever owned!At its lowest fan setting, you can barely hear the living room TV over it. And on high, it sounds as if you're standing behind a city bus.As if that wasn't bad enough, my old unit rated for less BTUs was FAR more effective at cooling down the room more quickly.This model is a complete disappointment and a waste of my hard earned money. And sadly, it wasn't actually cheaper than the more well-known name brands, so it's not as if I saved money going with a lesser known brand and got what I paid for.I wanted a quiet A/C/ unit and was willing to pay premium price to get it, but instead got a noisy jet turbine that does a poor job cooling my living room. And the directional flaps on the vents that are supposed to let you choose where to point the air are useless. The air still comes out straight forward from the vent, so you'll need to block however much of vent you need to in order to avoid getting blasted by the air flow.Such a disappointment... Sigh.."
"The upper dial is sorta placebo. The actual cooling only has 2 settings, on and off. There's no actual levels, the cooling only kicks in when the dial is turned all the way up.So you basically have a choice between room temp air, or ICE cold. I mean this things cools like it's looking for it's super suit, and that's the only reason I didn't give a lower score. 250 sq ft limit? Yeah it'll turn your 250 sq ft into a walk in fridge if you leave it on all night.It's also LOUD. I mean if you're planning on reading a night before Christmas while this little beast is on you better have some BOSE (tm) noise cancelling headphone because this will make your eardrums wish they were not eardrums. Plus side is I can no longer hear the traffic outside my window when this thing is on.Overall 3 stars5 stars for cooling ability1 star for noise1 star for ease of control3 stars for installation (pretty standard, leaves some gaps in the windows)2 stars for air directionability (only adjust left and right, tho you can use blinds to deflect the air up and down)2 stars for filter (doesnt take regular air filters, had it's own washable meshy filter that imo isnt very filtery at all)4 stars for overall construction"
"Air works great but if you’re counting on the heat I would not buy this unit. When reading what it’s equipped with on the ad it says 12000 BTU smart inverter air conditioner window unit with heat and dehumidifier, so please read closely because heater doesn’t work if 41*F or colder outside. I believe this is really misleading customers because they should have that right up front with the picture and ad. Please Note that they will not refund your money and I believe that Amazon should drop them for false advertising."
"Within a couple of months severe internal rusting is everywhere and I did not notice the rust build up until it was too late. The problem could have been easily avoided if they had a properly located drain hole at the lowest point where water accumulates. *after looking into it more i learned that keeping the water inside helps with cooling efficiency, but it shouldnt be causing it to rust so bad*"
This ac was working great until it wasn’t. For the price I’m extremely upset that it stopped working after 3 months. What’s even more upsetting is that I live in south Texas and I haven’t even come close to trying the heat portion of it. It stopped cooling and gave me a leak error. No cool air. So upsetting. Will never buy from this brand again. I have other brands that have lasted well over 10 years. The only reason I replaced it was because it put its time and finally gave out. What a waste of money and time. Manufacturer wants me to take the whole unit out and wash it and then try again. I’m sorry but if I paid to install it I’ll have to pay to uninstall and reinstall and spend even more money to see if maybe it works again?? What a joke. Never again Midea!
"I do not know why this is recommended by Amazon as quiet. It's super basic and loud. I was trying to replace a loud A/C in a small bedroom of my rental apartment at my cost. This is louder on the lowest setting and is manually controlled. The one they hauled away had a remote. Totally disappointed. I am happy with the 10K BTU unit that replaced the one in my common area. Do not recommend unless you are on a budget in which case you will stay cool, but buy some ear plugs."
"we installed this in the window of a small bedroom. The noise from the machine is so loud that my son wanted ear plugs. The settings are odd, just two dials that adjust for low/hi cool and low/hi fan, with a range of cool options.I thought this would be as high quality as the split compressor U-shaped Mideas I have, but it seems like a different company,"
"The ac turns of but the air swing flap gets stuck and have to use the hand to put into place or else air wont come out of the vent. The plastic is slightly bulging / bent and fitted very poor.The same issue with the air filter horrible fitting of the filter.Surprised, that they make such a nice air conditioner but they cheaped out on the simple things. Making it feel like a toy."
I'm trying to use this 6000 BTU unit in a 250 square. Enclosed room does not cool the room at all. I have a GE 5000 BTU and a room the same size that will freeze you out. I don't understand what's wrong with this but I guess I'm going to have to send it back. It's not fair. Two have to suffer through this heat.
"This thing runs just as long as my little Window Unit @ 5000BTU.There is no way this thing could ever produce 12,000 BTU EVER.The Window unit I took out was much smaller and would still cool this room but run what seemed to be to long so I figured I get a larger unit and fix the problem but not this unit!! It is just as noisy and runs just as long.I would stay away from this!! It is GARBAGE!"
It has no weep hole on the bottom of the AC to release the water. So when you take it out the of the window it runs out all over the floor. 😡 I use it in my 10x12 She Shed. When it’s really hot. It runs way too much. So for me. Not the best little AC. Especially for the price I had to pay for it.
"It works well in my son's small room, but it did fall out of the window even though we put it in correctly.  (It's not the first one we have put in).  I would not use this for a big room, and it is a little noisy, don't know if it is from the fall or not, but it does still work.  Can't comment on the remote since we don't use it."
"It cools, but it's pretty loud, and is definitely an energy hog like most window AC units. A few weeks into owning it I noticed the styrofoam on the inside of the unit was starting to crack in a certain place. I contacted support who asked me to send a picture of the crack and he would call me back once they received it. I sent the picture IMMEDIATELY and didn't get a call back until the following week. At which point they told me just to return it. Today is the last day of the return window, and I had already thrown away the box it came in. So now I would have to remove it from the window, and find some way to pack it up and send it back. To me it's just not even worth it. I used a bunch of foam insulation that I purchased along with cardboard and air sealing tape to make sure it's a good seal around the ac unit. It's simply too much of a pain to have to remove it and send it back when the unit is working. I'll just continue to use it until it breaks I guess. Midea customer support is terrible, and I won't be purchasing another product from them EVER."
"Box appeared to have been previously opened and then resealed with packing tape.Unpacked the unit and immediately noticed wrapping was ripped. Batteries were installed in remote. Black insulation foam stuck on unit. Hardware package was opened and missing pieces. The filter door was opened and hinges were cracked. It is obvious that this unit was previously bought installed and then returned. I paid for a new unit not a return  That being said I plugged the unit in, turned it on, tested it out. So far it seems to be working OK. However I am very disappointed."
"Have had this unit for a few years now in a small office. It is very effective at cooling, even on a lower setting. It is, however, quite loud and can be a serious distraction if you are near the unit or need focus. The compressor is far from the quietest, even on the 5000BTU model. The fan settings are mostly useless and just a reminder, there is no remote on the small unit. Recommend getting a winter cover for it to protect from the elements. Installation was average, taking 30-45 min."
Bought two of these for small bedrooms. It cools them down very well at high fan speed and 2/3 cool thermostat. What I hate about it is the blower fan never turns off. The cooling compressor will turn off when it reaches the appropriate thermostat but the fan keeps on blowing. So these only get turned on about 30 minutes before bedtime and then turned off in the morning. I will not be buying these again when they go out.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            2 5 stars actually. I purchased this unit in July and used very rarely until the last 2 months. At first it was perfect but now it has developed a very high pitch chirping sound that is really, really annoying. Makes it difficult to sleep if it's in a small bedroom which mine is. I only noticed it in the last month. It sounds like crickets chirping every second. It is even louder than it sounds in the video. It will randomly stop and start again. I think I will have to find another solution for this room as I am going to be renting it out soon and nobody will want to sleep in here with this noise. Pretty disappointed. Other than that the air conditioner and the heat elements both work well so far, remote and wifi are fine...If noise is not an issue for you you can try it. If anyone knows how to make it stop please let me know!"
I bought this unit during the summer and it seemed to work fine until the winter set in. They advertiseit as a Heating unit as well but unfortunately it will not HEAT if the out side air Goes below 40 degrees.It should not be sold as a HEATER!  I would suggest not buying this unit just because it is falsely advertised as a HEATING source.  BUYER BEWAR!!!!!
This unit wasn’t too bad when I first got it. You can tell right away that it is pretty flimsy and cheap. It started off pretty cold but after a while it started getting warmer and warmer until eventually it just did nothing but blow warm air around. Wouldn’t recommend.
"Please read the entire description.  Since I was buying an item that is supposedly a heater as well, I would expect it to work in cold temperatures.  Come to find out, this item does NOT work in temperatures lower than 41 degrees.  So if you are looking for a true heater that works no matter how cold it is outside, this is not the item for you."
I have a similar window unit in my living room it’s a little bit bigger but that unit cools down my living room and my kitchen and it blows pretty far back I can almost fill it to the hallway where the bedrooms are. And I bought a smaller one for my bedroom that has a king size bed and the nine dresser drawer with my TV on it because I thought the room is smaller and so this one will cool it down and keep it cool and unfortunately it doesn’t I have to have a fan to circulate the air that way I can get fresh all the way around the room or I have to keep my door completely closed the whole time in order for it to even cool down I have to have it on for like 30 minutes before I can feel any kind of temperature change in the room. I do not recommend if you’re in an area with high temperatures triple digits I haven’t used it up until recently I just had it installed and I used it because it was 108 here and I think it probably dropped the temperature in the room to 105 maybe it was still very hot
This unit was perfect the first two years. Turned it on a week ago and the compressor for Freon will not kick on. Only had this 3 years and it is stopped cooling. The one we had before we had for over 10 years and was still working awesome just wanted a new one. How do we make this cool again??! Not worth the purchase if it only lasts 3 years
I really like this AC it works great and the options on it are nice. It is very quiet I keep forgetting it is on. The down side is that it is very hard and not easy to install. The remote only lasted a week. I wish there was a lock on the panel covered the grill as my cats like to sit on it and closes it. I put a plastic door stop to prevent it from closing but my cats like to play with the door stop so I cant always find the door stop.
"I got it today and been running it all day on the highest settings itll make it like an okay...temp but youre not getting a comfortable frost at all. And my rooms only 10x15.Its also SUPER loud for how little it cools which is wildSo kinda dissapointed esp since I like the cold. I you just want to make it not quite as hot outside go for it, but it barely pushes out cold air if youre like me and enjoy the cold. It was cheap tho I guess 🤷, def gotten better cooling ACs for cheaper tho."
"Mine worked great for ~225 days spread out over 3 years before the capacitor failed. Capacitors for window AC units aren't supposed to fail for 5-20 years, so this is a bit disappointing... Sucks because I liked this unit, but it is annoying that more and more corners are being cut with inner component quality these days."
"The air conditioner component works really well, but don’t expect to use it for heat. Unfortunately, I cannot return since I bought it in the summer when I only needed the air. Now it is winter and the heat does not work at all. I would not waste your money. They also have poor customer service."
"Received the unit.  A/c works perfect.  However, after receiving it, the owners manual says to use the heat pump in temperatures no lower than 42 degrees.  If I had known that at time of purchase,  I would not have bought it."
I have a 10x13 room. My AC was set at the  lowest setting with a 80 degree temperature outside .. Took a temperature ready with my trusted thermometer inside my room  and it wouldn't go lower than 72 degree..  not cold enough for me.
Started using this product on June 14 of this year stopped working December 3. I reached out to the company for assistance. They asked me to send them my receipt and other proof of purchase. I did so yesterday early morning they have not responded.
"Works fairly well as an ac unit, I find it lacking in the heat department. Won't work at under 45 degrees or so."
The heating feature does not work in temperatures under 44 degrees.
"Bought this 5/2022 & it stopped working 2 years later.  Hey, it only cost $85 dollars a year.  This is really suckee!"
"First off, I should explain that this AC was intended for a very small bedroom, 9X 14, or only 126 ft.².  It was intended to replace a very similar GE AC unit, which lasted three years, but which just 'gave up the ghost' two weeks ago.  I had frustrations with his new Frigidaire unit from the very beginning, first of all the manual was very much lacking compared to its comparable GE cousin.  It was not clear how to best said it for regular day-to-day operations.  The previous comparable GE unit had directions that were much clearer on this all-important point.  So, I just did my best to set it in the same way that I would set the previous unit by GE.  Doing this though only gave me cool air when I was literally sitting right next to the AC at my computer.  Anywhere else in the room, especially when laying on my bed I cannot truly air at all, when temperature is a medium, 5 and mode dial is set to low cool.  With the previous 5000 BTU unit from GE this setting made my small room nice and cool but without any harsh blowing air.  No such luck here though.  In order to get me air to reach my bed, which is 11 or 12 feet away, at most, this unit must be set on high cool at all times and very near Max at 7.5 or so.I feel that this is very unacceptable and risks the unit bring out before the summer even ends.  By the way so far we have had an exceptionally cool but highly humid summer here in N.J. if this air conditioner has to work this hard cool my small room under these conditions, I would hate to see what it has to do when the daily temperature starts actually getting really summary into the eighties and nineties.  Right now I am only asking the AC unit to lower the temperature between four and 6° tops.  So that I don't get hot and sweaty on humid nights.In conclusion my advice to readers is bypass this unit and look for something comparable by another manufacturer.  Having said this, I have to say that I have had good luck with Frigidaire window ACS in the past and I don't know what is the problem with this particular one."
"This works, it was a decent price for the size area it covers. My bill is lower than an older model I have, but man this thing is loud. And it’s not the white noise of the air hum or even the condenser kicking on, it’s additional noise. Honestly it creaks and sometimes I think someone is walking around my room but it’s just the random extra noise this thing makes.  It’s like a “house settling” but the AC."
"By far this is the cheapest option you have out there among in-stores or online. It definitely gets things cool quickly (I have a very tiny bedroom, about 8 x 14 ft).  My frustrations include-1) poor window fitment- the slide-out sides do not go flush to bottom/top OR sides- huge gaps even with the insulation strips they provide and stuff I had to buy on my own.. Even with using tape, there's visible gaps, insects can freely come in, and it sounds like all 3 windows in the room are wide open sound-wise.2) temperature regulation- (this applies to being on low or high cool)- If I set it to 7 out of 7- the room will quickly go to 68 degrees. Over the course of the night it will occasionally drop to 64 (which is nice I'll admit, but not nice enough for me to want to pay for that!) so if I nudge the dial to 6, it will within 30-40 minutes hit around 76 (NOT nice).  The temperature really swings wildly so there's no one setting I can keep it up and have to get up when I'm sweating or its too chilly- I don't understand the poor regulation3) After minutes of running, it will, with an enormously loud sudden sigh of exhaustion/expulsion, stop running, BEEP annoyingly, pause for a few seconds, then start running again. It does this continuously when running.This is incredibly high maintenance, I know it can get my room comfortable but it sure can't maintain it in a comfort zone (or do so with just normal/acceptable running noise).  I'd like to say had I know how wishy washy it was I would've spent more for something with true temperature settings or a remote, but I'm really cheap and I'm stuck with this one. (Not saying if I didn't win the lottery I'd huck it out the window and get one in the $200-$300.I have it plugged into a very expensive APC surge/brown-out/battery back up unit in which a lamp, my Echo Dot, and my cell phone charger are plugged in (8 more outlets available).  I cannot plug in/run my 5.7 amp Bissell Pro Pet Spot Cleaner without tripping the whole thing (as I found out a few nights ago when my puppy threw up several times in the middle of the night).I wouldn't recommend this unit unless you a) are cheap/broke like me or b) are not temperature swing sensitive and sleep like the dead straight through the night"
"I've had this AC for a year now, and it's not too shabby! Works well and definitely keeps the room cool, however the AC itself feels pretty flimsy or cheap in my opinion. Sometimes the refrigerant system doesn't kick on at all, which defeats the whole point of having an AC. It's not because the AC is too cold or frozen over inside, because I'll have the AC just on the ""fan settings"". I've checked for water build-up and there is none, I've cleaned the AC, cleaned the filter, etc.. When the refrigeration system doesn't kick on at all, I just turn the AC off for at least 15 minutes, and when I turn it back on the AC usually works again. Just pretty upsetting that I have to find workarounds to make the system work properly when I need it, especially in the heat. Overall, I'd say this AC is okay in a pinch and has held up decently over time, I just wish it worked better and more efficiently."
"Bought two of these used price.  First one arrived on Memorial Day.  It was in all original packaging.  The reason it was returned is because the bottom carboard designed to protect the unit can actually bend in and damage the fins.  The first unit looked brand new except one little two inch area where the fins were pushed in.  I used tweezers to straighten them out.  Very pleased with the price and condition of the first unit.  The second unit arrived a day later, and was beat to death.  No original packaging.  It had been previously installed.  The dent in the side is way worse than the picture portrays.  The directional vent is also broke on one end.  I installed both units in small bedrooms, 130 square feet.  Both units blow very cold air.  Overall I am please with the purchase."
"Package arrived in undamaged box, unopened, on it's side.  When installed, the fan was hitting the shroud and blew out my breaker while it tried to turn but could not.  I had to tilt the ac unit 45 degrees inside the house to get the fan to spin without hitting the shroud.  Because I needed the ac unit, I live in Tucson and it was over 100 degrees, I opened it up to find that the fan was missing a screw to hold it in place without sagging.  I was lucky to have an old Frigidaire that I was replacing.  I used the screw on the top back portion of the old unit to anchor the fan in place.  Now it works perfectly.  I really should not have to fix a brand new ac unit.  Better attention to assembly of products would be appreciated."
"I moved into a smaller bedroom, thinking the smaller air conditioner would work. It was very easy to lift and install and fit nicely in the window. The problem is it is very loud and therefore disrupted my sleep. It does keep everything cool and works in a small room, other than the noise. It is a good air conditioner and serves its purpose. I don’t think I would buy it again unless there would be the added feature of a temperature control and the volume of the air conditioner was somehow regulated. It is a small air conditioner for a small room that makes a lot of noise."
"I don't even know how this is possible. When we turned on this unit it made a very concerning flapping sound; as if the fan was smacking the side of the unit with every rotation. I couldn't bear the idea of removing it, boxing it back up, carrying it to the UPS store and exchanging it, so I did what I thought was most efficient: I opened up the unit to see what the problem was.With the top of the cabinet finally off I ran it again to see what the guts were doing. And what did I behold?  The motor that turns the fan was completely unscrewed from its housing. It was just wobbling around on a couple plastic pins, making the fan blades rub against the styrofoam enclosure. Now, I thought i had heard a rattling sound when I first unboxed it, but brushed the sound off as some of the components knocking around as I jostled it. That ominous rattle turned out to be the three screws that were supposed to hold the motor in place. Somehow either they had backed themselves out completely, or someone at the factory never installed them in the first place. Luckily I had a little right-angle screwdriver that I was able to use to fasten the motor back into its housing, but it was still a pain in the ass.So I have no idea how that happened. It works fine now and doesn't make any strange sounds. I'm just irritated that I basically had to finish assembling the damn thing before I could use it."
"I had it tilted back a bit so it would drain. And as others have said, there is no drain. It just fills with water. I had to dump out like a liter of water and drill holes in the bottom of a new ac unit. How dumb is that. Why is this an issue? Incredible. There is no plug or holes or anything. Im not sure if mine and the other people who complained about this just got bottoms that were not cut or installed with a drain or if they all are like this. But literally insane. I noticed the fan was spitting water up onto the window and sounded like water was in there. I checked for drainage, none. So i took it out of the window, looked for any drain on the bottom, non. I tipped it forward and a liter of water poured out the front face of it onto the floor. Then i looked at other reviews and questions and noticed some other people didnt have a drain. Had to drill holes in it like someone else did. Wow. Just wow.Besides that. Its a cheap AC. It gets cold but takes about 15 minutes to blow nice cold air, a bit loud. Other settings are useless, basically just have it on high cool.I guess it does the job but for 170 (thats tax included) and another 30 for buying a mount, so for 200 im dissapointed to say the least.Too lazy to return it."
"I recently purchased a Frigidaire window air conditioner to replace my old unit, hoping for enhanced cooling and quieter operation. While the unit functions as expected, it hasn't quite lived up to my expectations.Compared to my previous air conditioner, the Frigidaire model generates more noise, which can be noticeable, especially during quiet times. Additionally, I've found that it struggles to maintain a comfortably cool temperature on hot days.I was hoping for a more substantial upgrade in terms of cooling efficiency and noise level, but this unit hasn't delivered on those fronts."
"I have used this product for a couple months now. My room is about 170 sq ft which is only slightly larger than the recommended size for this product (150 sq ft), and yet keeping it on all day MAYBE gets the temperature down a couple degrees. I have properly installed and insulated the unit from the outdoors. As a controlled experiment, I had two 80°F days here, on one day I just left my windows open and did not run the AC, and on the other day I closed my windows and ran the AC on the coldest settings - ""max cool"" temperature and ""high cool"" fan setting. The difference between the two days was minimal. With my windows open my room got to about 84°F and with this AC unit at full blast all day it didn't manage to go under 82°F. Running my unit constantly brought my electricity bill from about $40/mo to about $80/mo for the month of July. So basically I paid for the unit plus $40/mo to lower the temperature in my room by a degree or two. I would expect that this unit at full blast in a studio apartment would at least lower my room temperature by 5-10°F compared to just leaving my windows open, but instead it struggled to lower my room temperature by more than a few degrees. Would not recommend unless you have an extremely tiny room like <100 sq ft that you are trying to cool."
"So far I have no trouble with the functioning of the AC unit. However, it’s not the strongest or quietest I’ve experienced. It gets the job done. The only problem I have is that when it arrived, it was missing crucial parts listed in the instruction manual like the screws needed for the top attachment and the waterproofing material. It won’t go into a window without those parts, and the chat support wouldn’t load for me to get help replacing those parts."
So I spent some time getting this all installed. Holes drilled. Window gaps sealed up. It looks good and this is just to cool a small room in the middle of the house that gets no cool air from the AC at the far ends of the place. Let's do a test run for 5 minutes. Everything checks out and I feel like my expectations are met as I'm not expecting miracles at this price point.I come home later that night to turn it on again and all I get is a buzz. I mess with the temperature control and can hear the compressor. It sound like everything is functioning EXCEPT THE FAN.Next morning when I have light I investigate further to find some kind of putty has been lodged behind the fan. This has to have come from somewhere in the unit. I think this stopped the movement of the blade and burnt out the motor. I end up play a game of Operation with a coat hanger to get out whatever is in there but even after it's been removed looks like the damage is done.I'm returning it for another one since I've already drilled holes for this model AC. Hopefully it have a better outcome. My advice is is to inspect the interior through the slants regularly just to make sure there's nothing blocking the fan.
"Bought to supplement a larger unit in the living room for my bedroom on the opposite end of the house.  Did have issues installing because of my window having a very steep pitch in the sill area, nothing to do with the a/c unit.  Once in started right up.  A little loud for a bedroom on the high cool setting.  Quite acceptable in the low cool setting for sleeping.  Had a rattle when first put into low cooling that was not there in high but went away after a few hours and has not returned.  My biggest issue is the rotary directional flow control.  Works great for left or right direction but pretty poor for up and down.  Up being important to me since I want the cool air going up and settling down."
Work ok but after 5 months it started to drop in the front where plastic meets metal on the right side.
"LOUD A/C but works well enough.  Can't talk on the phone in the same room as unit, though.  No remote, no ""change filter"" indicator, no numerical thermostat."
"First. It does cool the room I bought it for.It surprised me to find it came without a filter. This should be made clear so you could order 1 when you order the unit. So you can use it as soon as it's installed. I have filter midea on hand so I was able to make 1. But honestly how many people have that option?It's so noisy! I bought an LG unit for a different room at the same time. It came with a filter and is much less noisy. I have a Db meter and it confirms it. If it wasn't so hot,  and so much work went in to installing it. I probably would have returned it. I thought about it seriously.Here is a personal problem but may help some of you. I placed it between where my head is and where the television is. It is so loud and it cycles on and off constantly. The fan automatically changes speeds. So I was turning the volume up then down, up then down, up then down. To the point of extreme annoyance. So. I spent another $150.00 to install speakers by my head. It works. However the speakers are a bit unsightly.It does the job I bought it for, and now, after more money and more work it's tolerable.I hope this helps."
"Product arrived and bottom is scratched up. Vents bent. Appears to have been previously used. The AC does work and appears to work fairly well. It’s being used to cool our storage shed for the summer.Make sure to purchase if your window opens to 13in+. Although the measurement of the AC is 12 inch tall, the additional pieces to hold it in place take up additional space. Took three people to settle this into place and the side panels did not work great. Did my own sealing around it."
Frigidaire 6000 btu window A/C received and installed today so this is an immediate reaction reviews. The unit is noisier than expected and the claimed 51db on low setting is inaccurate. Seems to produce a  reasonable volume of cool air but it is not a particularly hot day. Remote is basic but you have to look at the face of the unit to know what settings have been selected. Automatically goes to eco mode when the A/C is turned on so you have to manually change if you don’t want that setting.
"I ordered two of these.. both arrived with issues. One had the back all crunched. It still works, and I didn’t want to deal with lugging it to the post office to return. The other one has an issue with the removable tray in the front.. the tray gets stuck and cannot be removed to clean. Again, didn’t want to go through the trouble of returning after this was already set up in my window.Annoying.Works fine besides that. Not WOW impressive, but not terrible either. Cools enough to not be uncomfortable, if you’re on a budget. Otherwise, I’d suggest a different brand."
"i had to buy this as my usual 8btu fan conked out and made a grinding noise. so the best feature of this 6btu is how quiet it is. my last unit, whenever eco mode turned it on and off, would wake everyone up. this transitions modes quiet and generally runs smooth and quiet. however its not as COLD as i expected it to be! i had an 8 previously and this is just a 6 but it does seem a huge difference. ive had it running on cool at 66 degrees for 2 days and my thermometer says its 74 in here."
"The box was crinkled upon receipt, didn't notice until unpacking the unit that  it was damaged on the top right corner but to return it would be such a hassle it runs great but the fact is I received yet again a damaged item that was probably returned once already completely unsatisfied."
You get what you pay for. I have this for my bedroom. I live in PA and we’ve been having hotter days and this doesn’t do much of anything unless you’re standing right in front of it. When it’s in the lower 80’s this works okay but not in the 90’s
It came fast in the mail. My kids room is not that big. Our central AC went out. Got window units for each room. Her room feels like it's 85 even though I have this window unit on 72 cold full power... So not very impressed. 😕 I guess it's better then nothing.
The auto shut off mode does not work at all. You have to keep it in Eco If you want it to shut off. Even at that point it don’t keep it cold enough unless you have it set at 60. Does blow very cold though but pretty upset with this specially with it being $200 it should work properly.
"This is a very noisy a.c. - I use it in my bedroom, so I run it to cool down the room before I go to sleep.  It works okay, but not great, for that.  It's a small room, and to get it cooled down, I have to turn the AC to its maximum; anything less is very unsatisfactory.So, it's better than no AC, and so far seems to work, in its own noisy way, fine, but I would not buy this kind again."
Is pretty  loud for an small run I had it on for over an hour set  on hight and the room didn’t get cold it felt like I had a fan on is 67 outside and humid maybe that’s the reason since is not very hot it didn’t do the best job so I will wait until is very hot outside to compare it but what I can say is that if you can’t sleep with noise then don’t get it because it is very loud
Nice air conditioner.  I ordered 1 and it was nice so I ordered another one. The box was left next door. After seeing picture I went to get it and there was only an empty box there. Was promised a refund in 2 to 4 hrs but that was days ago and now I can't get anyone to respond to my texts calls or emails! What's going on??mmk
"I would like to first say, I’m super disappointed. The hassle to get it was incredible. I called off work. Ups lied saying that they tried to deliver it. Lies after lies, I had to call both Amazon and UPS and be a little prick in order to get them to deliver it. Such a hassle.Now, when it got here… box was all beat up, and black. Like full of dirt and tarnish, like humid. I was lowkey disgusted. I let it be and assumed that as long as everything is fine inside it should be okay. Welll I was wrong.The pictures don’t do no justice, sorry for the my bad pictures. It was all beat up. I am super amazed and how they plan on selling that.I gave it a try, connect it, before I even tried placing it in my window.I am an engineer by trade, so I know about machines and especially HVAC. Well this machine is good for a pond. I am aware of the drips of water that it should have as any other unit. However, these are not drops. It’s more of a pond.When it comes to noise, I once worked in helicopters and planes, it just took me back to those times. It’s an air field.I don’t recommend or suggest for someone to buy this. I will send this piece of garbage back. I am really disappointed. Amazon should do some quality control.Don’t buy, save your money.I apologize that the pictures aren’t as good, but this is really beat up."
"The window AC does work well enough, however, the thermostat control dial does not work and has never worked since I got it.The back of the AC unit had some bent-over coil fins which must have happened during the packaging process because the box arrived undamaged.The thermostat control dial ranges from 1 to 7 ( 7 being max ).The problem is the AC pump does not kick on unless this dial is set at or above 6.The problem with that is the AC pump just runs 24/7 and doesn't cycle on/off.So your room becomes a walk-in freezer, my room temperature sensor showed it at 35 degrees when I woke up.So basically you have to turn the blower controller from low-ac to low or high fan mode to manually stop the pump off and let it cycle every hour or so. etcI'll most likely have to replace the thermostat inside the AC unit with a 3rd party part since it's defective.It did come with everything to install it properly and the installation was extremely straight forward and easy."
"My older AC 5000 BTU was cooling my small room much better then this one, but it is a little quieter"
"Installation is a problem. I had to fabricate two pieces of wood and one of metal, to install the AC. Also, there’s a large bump on the bottom left (as you face it), and that tilts the unit to the right. So in addition to the pieces above, I had to use two shims, should have used three.  It is effective. It cools a 1000 cu ft room quickly. The thermostat setting goes from 1 (warmest) to 7 (coldest), and is poorly designed. At setting 4, the compressor never turns on. Even at setting 5, the compressor still won’t turn on at 76F (tested for 30 minutes). About setting 5.6 keeps the room about 72-74F. The hysteresis seems a bit wide. I haven’t needed to go above setting 6. We can only presume setting 3 must be for Venus, setting 2 for Mercury, and setting 1 for the center of the Sun. It’s likely the reviewers who state the unit does not cool have defective thermostats – probably poor quality control.  But it is LOUD. At a distance of 1 foot, it is 64 dB. At a distance of 8 feet, it is 55 dB.  I have had it installed for two months, and not yet figured out where the water drains. I sure hope it holds up over winter.  Note to manufacturers: the world needs more ACs for narrow windows, even narrower than this product."
I don’t know why.I’ve only used it for two months. It’s not as cool as when I first bought it.and the sound has become louder
"We have it in a small room thinking that it would be powerful enough to keep the room cold on hundred degree days. Maybe no window air conditioner can but this is the second one that has failed to keep the temperature below 72. If you’re not experiencing, extreme heat this might be for you."
The number one thing I dislike is how impossible it is to control the air flow direction.The second thing is that it is difficult to get the right temperature. It got way too cold the first night. The second night I tried “low cool” but the humidity skyrocketed in my room.
"This air conditioner is not effective. I have used it three nights in a row now and three mornings in a row I have awoke in a pool of sweat. I have the unit set to the lowest setting, 60 degrees, and my room is quite small. When I feel the air it is lewkwarm half the time. I was replacing a 6 year old unit that would freeze the room out but it had black mold coming out of it. I’ve had three miserable mornings drenched in sweat being waken up hours before my alarm. Do not purchase this. I would recommend a non temp specific conditioner."
"scrapping or grinding sound every time the compressor comes on..  The noise will last 5 to 10 minutes...I thought maybe the noise would go away, but that's not gonna happen.. I'm gonna pack it up and send it back for a refund..."
"Bought this for our 160 sq ft bedroom to replace a 10 year-old 6,000BTU GE A/C with mechanical controls.  We like it cold at night: 55-58 degrees (what can I say; we're Mainers - our bedroom windows are cracked open even in January).  Every Summer, the old one got the temp down easily even on really hot nights, but just wore out.Imagine my surprise when I plugged in this new one and found that the absolute minimum setting is 62.  On top of that, this unit could not get close to that temperature even on the mildest nights.We pulled this out and I'll use it in my shop where I need cook not cold.We dusted off and installed another old mechanical control A/C that is doing just fine.Truly, they don't make 'em like they used to!"
I bought this because I had an old air conditioner but this one doesn’t cool the room and it feels like it isn’t throwing any air. The compartment where you move the airs directions doesn’t work because no matter where I move it the air keeps flowing in the same direction. This is the same size as my old air conditioner and it throws a lot less air. I regretted buying this because of the bad quality. I also don’t like that when I turn it off I have to press the off button twice.
"Purchased this unit in May 2022.  Previously, I had a Haier unit it worked for about 4 years and had to change. I purchased these units in May of 2022 and very quickly realized this was a bad choice. First, the fitment is not the best. Second, and noticed immediately in Alabama heat, the unit does not do a good job of cooling. I tolerated it and with the use of my ceiling fan, my small bedroom's temperature became manageable. Third, the unit leaks terribly and I have hardwood floors. Now, in July 2022, I have noticed something black (not mold) pouring out of the front of the unit. I am horrified, to say the least.I have 2 of these units and while I have noticed the black stuff coming from the second unit. It does not cool the small space it is in very with either.Of course, Amazon can not or is unwilling (understandably outside of return window, but its not like I have had the units for years) to help. Have been advised to contact the manufacturer. Wish me luck.****4/22/2023**** I purchased 2 of these units and my experience with the first unit was terrible but finally got a partial refund from Amazon for the first unit. Well, it is starting to heat up here in AL and now the 2nd unit is dead, still within in 1-year warranty and Frigidaire is really not trying to help with this unit as it is currently just blowing hot air (fortunately, I have not seen the black substance seep from this one yet). I attempted to contact Amazon for some support in speaking with Frigidaire and every Amazon agent has told me to contact Frigidaire and I keep saying that I have. I have clearly asked if they can perhaps contact Frigidaire and I continue to get the company line about the Amazon 30-day policy. I understand that and am not asking for that but support with Frigidaire.I am surprised at the rating of this item. I have had 2 die within the year. Perhaps the reviews are initial and they have not used the units very long.By the way, Fridgidaire (Electrolux) has over 3k negative BBB complaints. So if you are someone considering this or any item from this company, consider very carefully."
The product is okay but the upside down placement upon delivery could have damaged it. Thankfully it's working right now.
"Like the title suggests , I tested this unit on a maybe upper late 60s day ( on a mild day , not hot at all ) It did not raise the temperature inside a van more than a few degrees . It was damaged in transit , there were dents in the condenser side face so that might of been the reason and it leaked water from my failure to tilt it back and the van was not insulated . However I don't feel those test conditions changed the fact it was not putting out cold air anywhere near a freezing level . When I first tried it out it was in a connex box that was very well insulated and felt mildly cool but not cold even after 15 minutes . Im not sure how long it takes any kind of air conditioner to amp up its performance and put out very cold air .  im not a refridgeration technition so don't know if there is any prep time for it or is thats just the way it functions  ? Tha6 be8ng sad and said  , I wouldn't recommend this air conditioner to anyone ."
"First off the package got lost. it's an a/c unit, not an envelope, how could you misplace it?Second, once installed, plugged it in and turned it on to an awful noise!,  Double checked I got all the packaging out. Fortunately I am handy so I took it out of the window and pulled the cover to find THERE WAS NO FASTENERS HOLDING THE MOTOR ON. It was loose in the unit. I grabbed some screws and put back on, then put it back in the window.Third, the sides are not flat, so the accordion side seals do not touch the unit on the top and bottom, huge triangle gaps.The unit itself, is quiet, and powerful."
"This air conditioner cools the very small room as expected, but it much nosier than my previous units."
"Am I cool, yes, are the pets comfy too, yes, but wowza is this thing loud."
"We bought this when temps in Seattle were going to be 109 degrees. It was a record setting week and no way would we have survived without buying an AC. I also bought another one around the same time by a different company and because I can compare the two I feel like I can see the faults with this one. Mainly, the fact that if you don't leave the knob setting at 7, just turn it down to 6, that is the difference between a cold room and a not cold room.You would think that the knob settings would be something like 7 cools down 50 degrees, a 6 cools down 45, but there seems to be no such logic. With 80 degree and higher weather most days of the summer I alternate between High and 7 during the day and Low and 7 at night. Using any of the other numbers will not cool down the room. More like a fan blowing.I also feel like the coolant energy efficiency of the other one I bought that is the same btu's is much better. The ac is loud, but they all are, and I sleep with ear plugs anyway. The unit was easy to install and I even placed it in a vertical sliding window. I added thermal insulation to the open part later.If the other brand I bought was not available, and this one was on sale and I REALLY needed an AC, I would buy this one again for a small bedroom."
It cools a small room. A little louder than expected but good white noise for sleeping.
Barely cools off a very small room. Would not order again
It’s loud and doesn’t get my little room cold enough
"This AC lacks luster. On an 80 degree day, it only blows cold air on the max setting. On a cool night, the air outside is cooler than what this is blowing. It’s also loud on the max setting, and the fitment is low quality with the accordion edges.It was one of the cheapest units on Amazon, but I still expected a brand new AC to be able to blow cool air on a low or medium setting. I put this in my child’s room, closed the door to keep the cool air inside - and this morning his room was warmer than the rest of the house.If you enjoy running up your electric bill for very low performance - this is the AC unit for you. But if you actually want a cool, quiet room… keep looking elsewhere!!"
"I have another similar one with same BTU from a different brand that's a few years older and it cools better than this new one.. not sure if I'm just unlucky and got a a bad one, but if I could exchange/return it, I would. Sadly I missed the return window, so now I use it in the smallest room in the apartment."
Ac cools just fine. Is very noisy. Sent first one back because the unit would not cool and something was scraping against the fan. Return was very easy.
"I installed the unit yesterday. I have a hole in the wall and wall mount it. I only have one window in the room I use the AC in. The room is 240 sq ft.It does cool the room in about 10 minutes as opposed to my old 5000 btu unit that did it in 2 hours.The problem I have is the ECO button. When the room cools to my desired temp, the fan shuts down. With out air passing over the temp gauge, the room gets hot before it pops on again. I don't see how that's economical because now the unit has to work harder in order to get back down to the set temp. I never use ECO. Not only that, the temp sensor is on the evap coil and that stays cold for awhile after it shuts down. Maybe put the temp sensor on the remote and have the AC monitor the ambient temp from the remote."
"I needed an AC for a small guest room and landed on this one. After I installed it and extended the side panels I noticed how flimsy and insufficient they are. The accordian plastic hardly stays within the track along the top which allows for a huge amount of air to flow, and any number of insects to find their way inside. I know its not meant to be airtight, but this is beyond what I would call acceptable. I had to cut out and tape cardboard pieces to cover each side panel."
"Spent the extra money for the digital readout with Auto temperature. Never actually reaches the temperature in the room. Thermostat in room and fan with built in thermostat both read 78, when AC is set for 71. The room is hot. Only way to cool the room is to use the manual features."
"This is a really good wall air conditioner!  It cools for sure.  It arrived on time, not damaged.  It was easy for me to install it all by myself.  I was so proud, LOL.  So at the height of summer in Florida, this cooled my place down running 24 hours a day.  But the noise level...ugh.  It is defiantly louder than a library.  It is so loud and I am not sure that I can live with it.  It just makes a noise and that is louder than I want it to be.  To be honest not sure if I can live with it.  I have to put my TV so loud, not sure, just not sure."
"If you want a real air conditioner don’t buy this one. It doesn’t even get cold cold. You can get kinda cool but if looking to cool a room down on a hot day in high 80s and up, this isn’t it. I’m very disappointed. Also, not really loud but quiet either. If you’re looking for white noise, to drown out some surrounding noise, this is it. Size is okay. Installation way but not what I’d expected to cool my bedroom or from the company nor for the price."
"Got mine in June of 2022. It worked well for one summer. Last year it wasn't doing as well. Now, running nonstop on high won't cool a small bedroom."
"Customer service helped me it works good,  but had a dent on arrival."
It cools my room good but after a while the fan makes a squealing sound
I purchased this item as a gift and only know that it works. I have no other ratings to offer
"This air conditioner arrived 23 days ago and was installed 20 days ago. I didn’t have to use it at first because the weather was cool, so it’s only been operating for about a week.At first, it was fine. It cooled my decent sized bedroom quickly. And the noice level with the fan set on LOW was acceptable. I was happy.But today, I’m far from happy! Day 20 and the FAN SPEED controls no longer work, either manually or remotely! The fan is stuck on AUTO. Obviously, this is completely unacceptable in a gently used, brand new product! Buyer beware!"
"I didn't realize until after the unit was installed that the light display goes out after 60 seconds of inactivity. And my question is why would it do that? My bedroom already has very poor lighting and I have to use an external source because their is  no over head light. How am I suppose to see the buttons on the display if the light goes out due to inactivity. Would if that happened when you drove your car for 60 seconds and the dash light go out. Now I have to figure out a way to be able to see the display after the lights go out. This makes no sense, what's the rational behind it? Unfortunately I can uninstall and return it because we had to do modifications to make it fit in my bedroom window. I need a unit where the display light turns on, so come next year I will be throwing this  almost $400 unit in the trash. I COULD NOT BE MORE DISSAPOINTED IN AN AC UNIT. I DON'T GET WHY THE COMPANY WOULD DO THAT. NOT EVERYBODY HAS EXPERT VISION. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND NOT GET THIS AC UNIT AND INFACT MAKE SURE YOU GET ONE WHERE THE DISPALY LIGHT TURNS ON."
"A NEW UPDATE: Frigidaires warranty process is a complete and utter joke. I have spent 2 months going back and forth with them telling me  they will get it replaced and I will hear back in X amount of business days, never hear back and then am told its because I didnt' give them some weird document I was never told about. I suspect I will never get this refunded or replaced and am just out some money. At least it was 'only"" $200. DONT BUY IT.Well, after writing this update the unit stopped working entirely and can’t get it to work again. After less than a month of use. Don’t recommend.For the price, it works just fine to cool off my bedroom. However it’s a bit loud. The only other window unit I’ve used is the Midea U shaped which I didn’t want to get again since mine developed mold (and based on reviews, a common issue), but this is much louder. So if you’re sensitive to a fairly loud hum of AC this may not be the right fit for you. But it works well and was light!"
"This went into a 10x10 shed to give climate control for storage. It cools the space like it should in the FL sun. For my purpose the installation took extra prep and when I got to the point of installing this unit I could tell immediately the box had been resealed and then saw packaging material noted in the manual was missing. The condenser fins had noteable dings and damage, but it was so much work to get to the point of putting this in I just went with it. It works, but I feel like I paid new price for used equipment.***Update: Amazon accepted my review, but based on other buyers who also complained about damage I am not expecting a customer service follow up."
"this is an old , heavy modeltoo late for me to returnwish i read description before buying"
"Not great not terrible. It gets the job done somewhat, it doesn’t make a huge difference."
Did not feel it was worth hassle to return it but some of the grating on the back was kind of bent when it shouldn't be.  Maybe I should have returned it but I cannot wait since the hot weather is upon us and it does work well.  I wanted a small one for my mom since I don't want it really cold in the house just some cool air coming in enough to keep things reasonable as my mom gets cold easy more than she gets to hot easy.  So something that isn't too big and doesn't overdo was what I was after.  Even with the lower house only having that conditioner it keeps it reasonable enough on a hot day.
"When I first took the unit out of the box I noticed a sizable dent in the metal fins, but I didn't think it was that big of a deal, it's on the outside so I'll never see it. I then started the 3 hour long process of a failed installation. If your window is not perfectly flat on the bottom, and all contact points that the unit touches aren't an inch and a half thick, good luck putting this thing on your window. Even if it does work with your window, this is the most poorly designed thing I could imagine. You have to have someone on the outside holding it, because the only thing holding it in the window during the install is the closed window, and my window is 13 feet off the ground, so that was super fun. It also includes a grand total of zero handles, so it's essentially a big slippery 200 dollar box. In the installation instructions it basically says ""if it doesn't fit in your window, slap a 2 by 4 on the bottom and see if that helps"". I understand this is a pretty cheap product, but I hoped that would just mean it would only last 2 years, not that it wouldn't go in my window. I'm insanely disappointed because it's the middle of July in Texas and I can't sleep because of how hot it is. I wish this didn't suck so bad. I'll be returning this, and I'll be sure to steer clear of Frigidaire products in the future."
"Bought this for our bedroom, unit makes a rattling noise when on the highest cool setting. The unit blows cold air for a couple hours than blows room temperature air.If we turn the cool setting down to 5 or 6 the rattling noise goes away but the air temp isn't great.Overall I am disappointed in this product, we have a different brand unit in our other bedroom that works much better."
"Ordered this air conditioner for my daughter. But upon receiving it, it was noticed that there was a dent on the lower right rear of it. We thought that maybe it would still be ok but it wasn't, thus it was returned."
"The good: unit works well after installation with no issues so far.The bad: the unit came in a poor packaging and and during the inspection I found a huge bend on the frame. No good! I’m a handy person so I decided to take a shot and took apart the frame to look for any internal damage due to this dent. Fortunately I manage to straighten it up and no internal damage was present.Conclusion: I don’t know how the seller store products, but this type things should be inspected before delivering. I shouldn’t have to deal with damaged products or returns because of this type of negligence on the seller’s end, that’s why a 3 stars for now."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Air-conditioning!
"For the most part, the window a/c unit works and puts out cool air. The unit often makes a scraping sound which is noticeable. In the middle of the night it can keep me up because that is all I hear. The scraping noise doesn’t happen all the time but when it does it’s irritating."
"I had a choice of several units.  This one had a view of the back that showed a steel surface. That is not the case.  I wanted this to install this AC in the bed of my pickup camper shell to allow camping in Texas this summer.  Avoiding the chance of crushing the cooling fins was the goal...  I though wow... Frigidaire has it figured out!  The photo was doctored and should be fixed.I don't know that I would have chosen this unit so fast.At this time, I am going ahead with my plans...  can't let this stop the adventure."
"So loud, cannot sleep with the unit on, even tried ear plugs.  This replaced our old unit and this one is incredibly loud.  Would not recommend for bedroom. Also when the unit is off I can clearly see through the unit into the outside sunshine.  Not very insulated at all."
"Amazon Resale (previously known as Amazon Warehouse) offers great deals on quality used, pre-owned, or open box productsGot this at a good price and once I received it I found out why. The cabinet was dented condenser coil fins in the rear were badly damaged it looked as if it fell out of someone's second-story windowWith that being said I plugged it in and she ran but using a laser temp thermometer the unit never got colder than 74 degreesopened return the same day I received and now they are making me wait 30 days for a refund with the possibility of no refund if the unit is damaged problem is this was already damaged before I received it. NEVER AGAIN would I purchase anything from Amazon Resale"
"If I'm looking to waste money on cheap equipment, it looks like this will be my go-to brand. On top of just feeling like weak construction, it's noisy and doesn't continue running long enough to effectively cool the small room I have it in - the thermostat just trips off way too early. I had a refrigerator by the same brand die the same day I purchased this a/c unit... I won't be surprised if this suffers a similar fate in a month."
"I live in Florida and it's been so hot my central A/C was running all the time. I bought this unit for my bedroom, but it's so noisy that I can't sleep next to it. I'm so disappointed. I didn't see the noise complaints before buying it. If I had I would have bought a different model. I hate to do this, but I will be returning it.That being said, it does cool well so would be fine for someone if noise doesn't matter."
"my bf was set on this unit so we got it even though i read another review talking about how there's small gaps around the opening and that you will need extra stuff to better block the window opening and that the coldest setting gets super super cold but anything under it basically feels like nothing and that after a while it makes a terrible loud noise that shakes your bones. well. that person was right and now we just have this ac unit in our only window in the bedroom and the airflow is bad and it gets stuffy in here unless we open the door. he also doesn't wanna smoke in the room either as the smoke and smell just get trapped inside.it does work and has been keeping us cool on the hottest days so i dont hate it, but i feel like there were better options for us out there. the loud noise also does stop if we turn it off for an hour or two as well, it's just startling when it starts up."
"Got this because the price was good, damaged upon arrival but needed it asap. The sealer foam is VERY cheap and rips easy. Also is not long enough for my SMALL window. This means that there are gaps in the little side flappers where insects get in. Instructions were very confusing, thank god there were assembly review. It is a multi person job for sure. Cools well and is quiet enough. Will need more supplies to seal the window though. Over all ok for a quick fix if you need the cheapest product but if you have a bit more money, I’d go for something more high end for quality!"
"First let me say that the unit itself is great. The air blows out nice and cold and it's perfect for a small room. But the unit I received was not new and clearly a returned item. The bottom of the original box had been sliced off and repackaged and there were scoff marks all over the bottom. On instillation I see why. One of the mounts that sits in the window sill is slightly crooked preventing it from having a clean and level resting space. To be honest I should have returned it straight away seeing the scoffs, but it's a heavy item and I didn't want to repack and a haul it somewhere for a return. So now I have a nice AC unit that sits slightly askew.My advice is check the bottom before you open it all the way. And if you see a bottom of the original package cut, like mine was, just return it. There is probably a reason someone already sent it back."
Headline says is all. WAY too noisy.
"The unit came without the third prong on the plug, which is mentioned as a very important safety feature in both the instructions and on the bright orange tag attached to the unit.The filler pieces that are meant to be installed on the sides of the unit did not install correctly because they were the wrong ones. How do I know? Because they have screw holes and the unit does not.The number of screws included was incorrect. It was supposed to include 4 small and 7 large screws. I received 5 large and 11 small screws.Was dented despite being well packaged. Gills on the back were also bent.A peek inside the unit showed that the fan inside was covered in water spots as if it had been used. There was a small dead fly as well.Return initiated, but I have to schlep this thing either outside my house or to a UPS store."
"First things first: it does cool a small room down pretty well. But this thing is LOUD. I got used to it after a couple of nights, but the first few times I used it the noise level was bothersome. I also can only use the Low Cool setting, because the High Cool setting sounds like a fighter jet is flying inside my bedroom. For the price, it’s fine. But if you need a quiet unit this is not the AC for you."
This AC doesn't cool very well. I am very disappointed.
"The unit cools a room 15×12 just fine, but the side pieces meant to keep the outside out fail. They are too short, cheaply made wafer thin pieces of plastic, you stretch it you break it. Mine cracked so I taped both sides of the unit right and left using clear quality shipping tape, dont want bugs in and i dont want my cool air going out...did the best I can. I bought another for a different room before I installed this one, sending it back. Otherwise it works very well."
"It seems to cool better on ""Low"" than on ""High"", which is not so cool. Makes weird noises when left on. Very disappointing."
"Today most Air conditioners are lighter.Beware this air conditioner requires 2 people to lift but even then a back breaker!Worse if returned to UPS Grove St Braintree, MA! If Amazon requires their printed label and your printer not working UPS Braintree will charge you almost 3x/the cost of Amazon charging $1 for a label! Go elsewhere or wait for Amazon label!"
"I was very disappointed after the hassle of getting it installed in my window, that the compressor is very noisy. It was installed to the specs so I don’t know why it’s so bad. It cools great but the noise keeps me awake. I guess I will contact the manufacturer, but I really hope I don’t have to pull it from the window."
"This air conditioner is really bad, it never cool a small room, always working on fan and the compressor starts working and stops less than a minute. Call the brand to get support they promise to send me an email and a replacement and the email never came. I will return this for a second time because I doesn’t work"
Doesn't feel like it gets as cold as it should for being in a small bedroom.
"Very loud for a small room or bedroom , better in a workspace . Also there’s no thermostat to regulate temperature, so either it runs constantly or shut off . But noise is a huge problem . Other than that , it works well and cools . But put in a workshop space ,"
I bought this in a rush. It’s extremely loud and takes a good 2 hours on high to cool my small studio apartment. I’ve had it 3 weeks and it’s now making a noise when it runs. The noise gets louder for about 20 seconds when I turn it off. Returning it
"AC works in okay in 80 degree weather however when you really need it in the 90 degrees, it pushes as if it’s a fan. I have to buy a new bigger AC unit."
Fins were bent and unable to remove filter because inside of air conditioner is bent pressing on filter. Makes a really loud thud when switching to cooling. Barely cools the room. This has to be the worst ac I have ever bought. Couldn't return because it was severely needed during the heat wave.
It cools my apartment down well but it very loud
Sent to sister in La who needed sn additional cooling unit. She says that it  works great. Only issue is that it was packaged on its side and had to sit for 24 hours to allow freon to right itself. Should have been packed better. would have given 5 stars if it came with mounting bracket and was shipped correctly.
"The side panels that slide out on each side of the AC unit do not fit properly.  There is some kind of ridged molding on them that will not allow the panels to slide flush with the window frame.Very very poor design.  I had to trim them and they still didn’t fit flush.  I’m surprised to get this kind of misshapen junk from a major brand name.  I still might return it, what a hassle!  I’ve put in plenty of these over the years and have never seen an idiotic design like this.I see from the pictures that others have had this problem too and had to use tape to seal the edge.What a crock!"
"I really can’t tell if I missed a step in the setup …. but I was so desperate for air in the sweltering heat that I kept the fan. It was a very good price, super easy (as in you can push a button — jack it up to five, choose the swivel option, without ever having to look at a book of tiny instructions). HOWEVER, for a fan that has chemicals known to cause Cancer (ooops!), I want more. It has the MOST UNSTABLE base you can imagine — barely clicking into two hemicircles of plastic — my dog just once again knocked it over, and I was reminded to write a review. The base gets no stars. The fan itself gets a 4. It blows cool-ish air most of the time. If I’m wrong about the base, I’d love to hear from the manufacturer … but I see nowhere to complete installation besides awkwardly setting the tower in a shallow divot — like playing a toddler playing a game of shapes."
Honestly I like it but only if I’m sitting in front of it. I turned it one and left for a bit and closed my doors to my room which is where the fan was to be able to have a cool room for when I can back and went to sleep and it was still hot. It don’t feel like it cools the room down at all it’s just blowing air. The air isn’t weak but it’s also kinda loud for when you are going to sleep unless you have it on the 1st setting which you won’t feel anything. The weight isn’t too heavy but it’s also not super light. The size is fine I assume they are all around this time but it’s a powerful wind that blows it’s just not very cool. I thought you could adjust the temperature to blow a cooler temp and you can’t. Or maybe I just don’t understand after reading the directions 4 times and watching videos on how to do it. I’m probably gonna return this and get something else the amount wasn’t crazy high but it also kinda shows because it’s still hot and I don’t want to use my AC at night just to cool every other room in my house.
"The fan has a faint ticking sound and the electric motor has a drone. If you have good hearing and keep it in the bedroom, then this is not for you. It looks nice. It is way to operate with or without the remote."
"This is the same thing as a regular fan it's just slender, and comes with a remote. I think you're just paying for a more ""appealing"" looking fan."
"I was super impressed with this fan the second I opened it. I mostly use fans to have noise for sleeping to drown out my jerk of a cat who doesn’t understand humans sleep at night, but also because I tend to be a hot sleeper. I was intrigued by the ocean surge feature and when I turned it on, I was truly blown away (no pun intended). However, the first night I put the setting on 12, turbo mode and out the sleep mode on so I didn’t have a bright light shining at me from the end of the bed. I was not under the impression that sleep mode automatically turned the settings down to adjust to make you not cold at night. I woke up in the middle of the night every time the fan would lower its settings and I woke up extremely hot. When I read one review before buying, the individual said they were mad they had to go get duck tape for the display because they couldn’t shut it off and I was so confused because there was a sleep mode that turned it off but now totally get it, you cannot have the fan stay on the setting you want AND have it on sleep mode to shut the display off. I would have totally given it 5 stars, sent it to everyone I know and recommend but this feature honestly grinds my gears. I take my fans seriously."
"It’s a fine fan, compact and moves air pretty well.I don’t like that it’s so tall, but it only blows air from the most middle portion of it, so it’s sortof taller than it seems like it needs to be. It was misleading as to how wide the area was going to be. It doesn’t direct upwards, because the upper portion only looks like a fan, it’s actually solid. So if you have tall furniture it won’t get to you well. Same thing with the bottom piece.It’s fine. Not a purchase I’m excited about keeping though."
"Remote barely works. Fan speed won’t stay on max, reduces to mid speed very quickly. Kinda disappointing. Won’t buy again."
"The fan is strong, tall and seems to work well.  It's moves smooth and is not loud. However the ""plastic nut"" that holds the fan to its base was damaged upon arrival. Since there was no shipping damage and it was packaged well it had to be a manufacturing issue. Amazon only offers returns/replacements of the whole item(not parts only, which I understand) and Levoit only offers communication via email or phone. I'm not looking forward to spending time I don't have to get this fixed."
"The light on the front is really obnoxious at night in a bedroom, and sleep mode doesn't work for what I need. I want it on the same speed all night to keep me cool into the morning. It worked great for about 14 months, and now its been making a little more noise and sometimes changes speed randomly, but overall still works well. Kind of a pain to clean, but not the worst. I wish I had purchased a taller one."
"Is just a fan with a remote, fan size it bigger than expected"
So based of the reviews I bought this fan thinking cold air would come out of it sadly that’s not the case it’s a high tech normal fan 😭 definitely not colder then my 30$ fan from Walmart it’s a nice little breeze but in most likely gonna return and look for a real cooling fan definitely wouldn’t say worth 70$ I still was too hot last night on the highest level (5).
This Levoit fan is quiet even in oscillating mode. It does have an external converter at plug. The fan speeds are probably twice as slow compared to the Genesis fan. This fan speed at 7 is approximately equivalent to Genesis speed at 3. This most annoying feature is the bright display which is hard to turn off. It requires you to hold the oscillating button down for 3 seconds in order to turn the display off. No confirmation that the display is turned off and it takes 1 minute to actually turn off. Also awkward to hold oscillating button when it is oscillating! Bad feature!
"The descriptions and reviews of this fan are not accurate. I was contemplating on this fan for months (this was around June) I finally got the middle model fan and I really honestly tried to like it, but at the end of the day it really just blows the air around like all the others. Now I do have to say, it is super quiet and that says a lot from me because I have super sensitive ears, and the remote is handy. The settings are a tad confusing, and the oscillating range is indeed accurate to the description. All in all, at the end of the day, it still just blows around the air in the room."
It's a good fan with good features but I can't get the room temperature to show on the display consistently. It only shows room temp when you first turn it on.
"I’m going to be the oddball here and list the things about this fan that are annoying. I don’t like when I set it to 5, that it automatically adjusts to 2 or 3 in the middle of the night. I need lots of air blowing on me to sleep well. I also don’t like that I can press on or off more than one time and it won’t do either one I need it to do unless I press multiple times. I also have this problem trying to either make it oscillate or stop oscillating. I need a second fan but won’t be purchasing this one again."
"This fan cools my place in FL very well. The fan only works for me with remote.  If i lose the remote, then what?"
"This is a great oscillating fan. Love all of the modes & is relatively quiet for the most part -- but this fan is not cooling. If you're looking to purchase a fan that will circulate the air & be cool in the sense that a ceiling fan might be cool -- this is a good purchase. If you're looking for cooler air temp wise though, this won't satisfy you."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This was a great fan for the first 6 months, then it started humming. Ok, no big deal. A few months go by and the noise gets louder. We take the back off, but there’s nothing glaringly wrong. We make sure to clean it routinely but it doesn’t help. It is more noisy than it’s ever been and I can’t stand it lol so I’ll be purchasing a new fan unfortunately. Maybe we got a dud :/"
Air flow not as expected
"I bought this based on the reviews.  Currently we use a vornado which cost more than this fan.  Our vornado doesn’t oscillate and it is very loud.  We have gotten used to the noise.  I bought this fan for my son’s bedroom thinking it would create a nice wind and really circulate air, but it didn’t.  This fan is blows but the room is not any cooler or the air still feels stagnant with this fan.  Many people said that this fan actually cooled their rooms. I read that in several reviews.  However, we live in a northern climate in October and this fan has not cooled his room at all.  This fan is so lackluster.  I won’t be returning it because I tossed the box, but listen to this review, if you want to really move air and cool off a space, this is not your answer."
It was great I was quite but lately every time it ocolates side to side it starts making a noise like it's straining. Nothing is around to block it and it goes back and forth just fine it only makes a noise when it reaches the turn. Other wise it's great
"The overall quality of the fan is great! It’s sleek and modern. The air for me was not as loud as I nearly wanted, granted that I will have multiple fans on normally…As I am trying to condense, this fan is good but did not sold for me."
I should have read the information better because the fan is like 3 feet tall and if you want to return it you have to print a label out. So think twice before buying it if you think you may have to return.
The fan was not as sturdy as I expected but other ways it does the job
"It’s a decent fan. I’ve had it for a little over a month with no problems, until it started changing speed by itself. I would set it on speed 3 just for it to change to speed 1 randomly. I read other reviews and apparently this is a common problem. It might be a safety feature but I don’t see it disclosed anywhere."
"Not amazing, but does what a fan does. I have to come to grips that no fan can replace an AC/CA lol.It’s definetly not quiet once you get passed the 2nd fan speed.The fan seems to pick up on RokuTV remote sensors. So every time I use my remote, the fan shows it’s display screen. It’s not annoying, but it’s annoying that it happens."
Didn’t have the remote
"I kind of hate it. I appreciate the remote control but an app would be better. Overall this item is a 2 out of 5. It provides the one service a fan should provide: blows cool air, but that’s about it. The noise when it’s rotating is maddening. Not sure it’s worth it!"
"I read other reviews that said this fan blew cool air rather than just circulating the same warm air, and that is 100% not true. It’s a good fan and helps if it’s blowing right on you, but it isn’t going to lower the temperature of the room."
"The fan looks great and was easy to assemble with good controls. However, it only gets 3 stars because its performance is weak at max speed. If you’re looking for a fan that can cool a room or replace AC at night, this is not the one."
"Easy setup, fan looks nice.  Fan is quiet when not oscillating but quite annoying humming sound when oscillating.  Trying to decide if I should return the fan.  I suggest you look elsewhere if oscillating is important to you."
Only good if u have ac already though. So if you have a hot room this is not wat u want. This is more of a support fan
"This fan works well for a small room,,, I said small room ,, the fan is quiet up to three speeds the 4th and 5th speed can be a little noisy"
Fan is good and powerful but it’s hard to get the fan in the stand and not able to move it from place to place
I expected this to blow cold air but it basically blows the hot air that’s in the room.  Not very cooling at all
"I like the design of it, but I’m kind of disappointed. I thought it would blow out more air than it does. I’m using it for my bedroom and I already have a regular fan in my room but because it’s the hottest room in the house I need something extra it gets cool in the middle of the night as it cools down, but it’s not giving what it supposed to be giving, so I just don’t have a five star review for this fan."
"This fan is a good size, has quite the output, has intelligent design, and was perfect for what I needed it for. Unfortunately, after about a month of daily use, the little motor that turns it is making a loud knocking sound, so it's no use leaving it on rotate during sleep. It's still good for a standing fan, but I need the quiet, so I can't use the rotation anymore. Oh, well, still a good standing fan."
Not sure if this is happening to just me but I put the fan on 5 speed when I go to sleep and in the middle of the night it switches to 3 speed by itself every single night. I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong or what? Not worth $70.
"I bought this a month ago and the fan performance is beginning to freeze. I was trying to return it and I missed the return window by one day. Easy to install, good fan power, the size is a decent height, but im not sure why the fan stops and goes, stops and goes."
"Not actual insects. The fan just randomly decides to start oscillating or turning off all on its own. The remote doesn’t always work and it can be frustrating to try and figure out exactly how to aim it. Other than that it does exactly what you expect, blows air."
"Like that it is quiet, doesn't prevent me from sleeping. Has good airflow.Do not care for the control panel on top of the tower. Also it does not lock into the base. Tips over easily.Have had other brands that I like much better."
"The fan moves air, fits in corners very well. looks good. The issue that i have with this fan is it is not very quiet. anything over 1 is annoying in my office setting. based on the that i would not recommend this product.."
"Like the fan.  Missing remote.  Amazon resolved the problem.  Great customer service.  As sometimes happens, products get removed .  Usually because of a return or original box damaged and when removed some parts aren't included.  The fan is great. Just no remote."
"This tower fan works great most of the time, but at some point every single night while I'm asleep, it randomly turns on the ""rotate"" option (even if I have it turned off), causing me to get too hot & wake up, then manually re-orient it in the direction I want, and turn off rotate again.This means that even if you align it to point towards you in the exact position/direction you want, it will not stay in that position indefinitely. I don't know if its a short, a glitch, or what, but it's definitely very annoying."
"Got it, set it up, did not work. Call customer service - the phone just rings, listen to music for nearly 45 minutes give up hang up."
"From the product description:Advanced Sleep Mode: The display and sound will automatically be off in 5 seconds.a) Within the first hour, the fan does not oscillate. The starting fan speed is determined by your current fan speed when you select this mode.b) After one hour, the fan oscillates and decreases speeds - to keep you from getting cold from the constant wind.c) Then the fan speeds will change by temperature, giving you a comfortable night experience.I purchased this fan because I want the fan is quite and could turn off the display during the night, which the sleep mode works well.The only thing I missed is that the sleep mode is too advanced. It also controls oscillating or not in its own way.I don't want the fan to oscillate at all, but I have NO WAY to control it. At the end I have to put the fan in the sleep mode and set the timer to 1 hour, which limits its function significantly."
"Pro:  efficient and performed as describedCon: One so far is making an irritating noise.  Unfortunately, it is in my bedroom  Will wait and see if one other will become noisy too.disappointed the first couple weeks it was very quiet"
Keeps me semi cool just wish the air blowing was stronger. It definitely is for one person. It’s smaller than I thought and just doesn’t cool me off like I need.
"It’s okNot as cool as advertised .Remote worksNot sure about battery life , I don’t use the remote .Air flow and power could be better!"
"1. Does this product make you cooler when it blows at you? Yes.2. Is it relatively quiet? Yes.3. Can you adjust it from an app or remote? Yes4. Is it the same app as your other Levoit products? Yes.If only the first three things matter to you -- there are much cheaper alternatives, and in my experience this expensive version does no better that those. Save yourself money. Buy a similar model from a budget brand and stave off this summer heat while keeping some cash in your pocket.If the fourth thing matters to you, then this is the product for you. I thought that same app efficiency was what mattered to me. But I ended up returning it, because I could not justify the increase in price associated with it being a Levoit branded fan."
"Functional, looks well but produces excess noise. It works decent, would not say that it makes the entire room cold but it does okay."
It works good not all that tho you better off going to a store for a fan like this it works good tho
My house is old and gets very hot even on Only moderately warm days. I thought this fan for the price would have great blow. The highest speed is like medium. For the cost I expected to blow more and further distance. I have it about 4 feet from my bed and barely feel it. But overall it's a very nice fan but just Not as powerful as I expected.
"This is a great fan, I love it.. BUT it came missing the remote."
Good for small spaces
"Based on all the reviews that I got, I was really excited to get this product. My daughters room gets very hot and I was trying to find a way to keep it cool needless to say this product does somewhat lower the temperature, but it has to be a full blast, and doesn’t really make a difference or a change in the room very disappointed"
"I got this for a bedroom nook that has no windows because of the reviews.The fan is good, but it's not going to replace an AC or anything. The room was 79 degrees today and that was with the fan on circulating on turbo.Not sure where the 'cooling' part comes into play."
This fan is not very powerful
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The fan itself looks nice appearance wise. But.......the air flow and power not so nice!It doesn't have enough power to feel fan when oscillating. You ONLY truly feel the air when it's stationary. The remote works great! I wouldn't buy again nor recommend it🤷
"Was really excited to receive this product, but after receiving the product and putting it together, notice that it was missing the remote. it will be nice to control it by the remote"
"I just received the fan about 2 days ago and I am already having issues with it. It worked perfectly at first, but now, the fan is unable to stay consistent. The power, size, and remote control were all good at first. However, after 2 days the power setting automatically switches to different settings continuously within a couple settings. Over and over again it switches from level 2 to 3 to 4 to 3 to 4 etc in a matter of seconds which seriously hinders its ability to blow air out properly as it must pause for a second, “reboot” and switch the air settings. It’s also annoying as I constantly hear the flow of air changing from strong to weak. I can no longer use this fan because it’s just not effective anymore."
I like this fan however i can’t figure out why it randomly starts rotating and lowering its speed level.
"It’s a mostly good fan but has a mind of its own. You put it on one setting and it’ll stay there for a while and then all of a sudden it will shut off or switch to a completely different setting - like lower speed and oscillating- of course middle of the night in summer when it’s hot! At this point, I’d rather just have a box fan that I know won’t “change its mind” in the middle of the night"
This fan is awesome and sturdy and very cooling. The thing I hate is the lights are so bright. If you like a dark room this will not be the fan for you.
"The fan looked nice and had great features, but there was a noise that I couldn't not stand. It was not related to the spinning blades, but something else. I had to return it the same day it got delivered."
The remote doesn't work.  The highest setting isn't very high. Isn't particularly cool air. There are much better fans at similar price points available
It’s a normal fan. Not really that powerful or mind blowing. Definitely not worth the price.
Somehow blows pretty cold air. The top area came scratched however.
"Loved it when I first purchased about 6 weeks ago, that’s right I said 6 weeks…. But now it’s making noises. Took it apart and cleaned it per video instructions and still making weird noises. This fan was quiet and worked great. Will figure out how to contact customer support, a life span of 1 month is unacceptable."
"The remote works about one fourth of the time. Disappointing, since I like the Levoit brand and the remote was one of the reasons I decided on this product. Good fan otherwise."
"Terrible. I bought this item because of all the good reviews however this fan isn't  nearly as powerful as it needs to be. My small fan has more power, so I'm super disappointed. I'll be returning this fan.Sidebar: if you decide to return this fan YOU will have to pay the shipping cost for returns which ends up to be the price of the fan basically"
"Fan isn’t too bad but I hate 2 things:1. The remote is awful, it has maybe 10 feet of range and continually doesn’t work when I press a button2. When you turn it on, the fan will automatically oscillate after about 10 minutes. Makes it especially frustrating when you try and use the remote to remedy and it doesn’t work.Only reason I give 2 stars is because it is just like every other tower fan but a bit cheaper."
"Nice fan however, it does NOT ""cool"". This fan is not designed to lower the ambient air temperature in a room. It circulates whatever air temperature exists. Unfortunately I thought it may slightly lower the air temperature based on the product marketing description and, customer reviews claiming that it lowers the room temperature. I still slept hot as ever. It's just a fan although, it does not sound like an airplane and has a slim design."
"I bought it for the sleep mode, because I'm sensitive to noises. However, it started to noticeably buzz when turned on, which I did not like and started needing to wear my earplugs again, which I don't like when it might make me miss my work alarm. Filter was clean so I don't think that was the issue. (The back panel was pretty difficult to remove as I didn't know if yanking it off would break the fan somehow, lol.)"
"I couldn't wait for this fan to be delivered. When Alexa told me it was delivered I was like a kid on Christmas morning lol. Firstly the delivery guy left my Package in the lobby which is No Bueno, I'm on the ground floor smh. Anyway got the package and opened it, beautiful looking fan. We set it up and ... the breeze coming out of this is just minimal. We cranked it all the way up and it was like, MEH. What the hell!Now we have a Vornado, that packs good breeze, but it's hell to clean. Hence this purchase. Maybe I'm just spoiled from the Vornado."
"I should’ve listened to some of the reviews. I would not waste my money on this fan. I bought two & returned both. I was looking for a Bladless fan, that way the fan doesn’t get all junked up with dust. I’m a super clean freak and it’s so annoying when fans get junked up with dust. However, this is extremely overpriced and does not put out very much airflow at all. We also like to hear the sound of the fan and the fan is super quiet. If it would’ve actually put out the air flow we would have dealt with the quietness of the fan. It definitely sucks."
I bought this Levoit tower fan for my daughter's room to be cool.I had air conditioner.my daughter's room is bigger than my room and I turned on this in her room with box fan in the window.her room wasn't getting cool enough. I gave her my air conditioner I used tower fan in my room alongWith a box fan it gets so cool.it comes with a remote so you can make it cool as you want and it's oscillating.if you want it to oscillate it will or you can stop it. On the back of the fan it's a space you put your remote in so you can always find your remoteI find in real hot days to use with fan in window keep doors closed.its great in smaller rooms not large rooms
This is not the fan you want it you desire high movement and across the room gust of wind... this is now in my son's nursery just to have air circulation but it's not a cooling fan at all.  Looks great but it has a really bright blue led screen at night that stays on for a few minutes before shutting off it you adjust anything. Shows you the temp for a few seconds but the main screen is just the level of speed. Wish it was the other way around. Temp is more important then fan speed. I would of returned it if I had kept the box. Plus side it has a remote and looks nice.
Very disappointed in the airflow produced
"I figured for this price tag the fan would be stronger and actually work at helping cool rooms down, but nope. Going to return."
"When turning the fan is making a sound like wood cracking on a ship annoying at night,,"
It was missing the remote but everything else worked fine. It was a used product so I guess that’s why it didn’t have everything in it.
"The fan will rotate if you set it to do so but you can also lock it to stop the rotation but after an hour it will automatically unlock and start rotating which is absolutely annoying. The remote also kind of sucks you have to press a button once to “wake it up” even though it’s already on. (Mind you its not on night mode). Sometimes you even have to press it multiple times for it to work. Then theres the buttons on the fan, it took me multiple tries to just lock the fan from rotating by just using the buttons on the fan itself because they are the opposite of sensitive."
"I have 2 family members with similar fans.I was excited to order one.This one does not put out the power theirs does.?.It has 5 speeds, but not strong wind output."
"The fan worked fine, but at the six month mark, it started to make noise and needed to be forcefully, turned in order for it to rotate"
DO NOT BUY!!! The motor is weak!! Within two weeks the motor showed signs of poor quality. I would turn the fan on and the motor would not spin. It would work most of the time but not every time I powered it on. After two months the motor no longer worked. When it did work the air flow was not strong or refreshing. Waste of money.
"I bought this in July 2023. I had a Lasko for years, loved it, and only got rid of it because the base broke during a move. I run a fan every night for a consistent stream of noise of the air and to keep cool.I almost didn’t buy this Levoit because of the bad reviews and that would’ve been the smart choice. The “sleep mode” is necessary because the digital face is too bright. However, on sleep mode the fan only runs your setting for about an hour before it lowers the fan speed and starts oscillating. This change in noise wakes me up, or it makes the room too hot which also wakes me up. The oscillating has gotten noisier and noisier in the 5 months that I’ve had it. I think this fan will be unusable by the 1-year mark, if it lasts that long."
"This fan is incredibly easy to assemble, and it looks good. It’s more high-tech than any fan I’ve had, it even has some automatic features. It can tell you the temperature of the room and adjust speeds while you’re asleep. That’s not something helpful to me, but maybe some people like that.For me personally, this would be a two star fan, but I can see how others might enjoy it. It’s just very quiet, which I don’t like, and it’s not nearly as cold as my Lasko fan. I bought it because it looks pretty much the same as my Lasko fan, but you can feel a huge difference."
I would give this 5 stars but i dislike the auto sense that will turn the fan to a lower setting if it gets under a certain temperature i like to have my fan on high while sleeping but i often wake up to it on level 3
Air flow was less than expected and right out of the box the product didn't oscillate. So that was a bummer. I definitely send it back.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I’m not sure if I got a defective item. The actual fan blows really well, but it has a mind of its own. It seems like it always wants to change the power level that I had set it on by itself. Like if I have the speed on three, it will put itself back down to one.Yesterday the LCD screen quit working. As well as the button sounds.Screen comes on When you press the buttons, but then goes off, which makes it difficult to visually see if the fan is even turned on. I might recommend another brand."
Seems to be a short somewhere. Turns on and off at random times. The beeping was annoying. Tried it on multiple outlets.
This is just a regular fan. Description and reviews made it seem like it blew cool air but it does not. It
"The packaging is huge when It comes to you, it’s. A Nice fan but I wish you could adjust the height and It tends to change back to oscillating throughout the night. I’ve had to wake up and adjust the settings a few times. Learning curve I guess? Either way. It’s nice but idk about 60$ worth. Get this on sale."
I've been using the fan for almost 1 month. It does put out a good strong breeze but a few days ago it started making a horrible rattling sound. It's very loud and annoying. It does it on all 5 speeds. I only use the fan at night time while sleeping so I'm disappointed in this. My return window is closed otherwise I'd be returning it.
"Is too short, does not rotate enough, aire is not strong enough, is not good for what I need it"
You have to set it on a timer to keep it on...does not keep running unless it is on a timer. Air flow is not good at all. I had it in my bedroom and seriously it did not cool the air. I threw the box away or I would have returned it.
"I put this fan in my bedroom, hoping it would live up to its expectations of whisper quiet. The more I use it the louder it gets and now it’s starting to squeak. Sounds like I have a little mouse in the corner if I didn’t throw away the box I would return it."
"Update: I had to send it back. Went to Lowes and got a lower BTU window unit. Easier install than getting the hoses set up in my windows with the Wynter. It did the job all summer. It will do, but I have to say, it does not blow air as cold or cool down the room as fast as the Wynter did.I did so much research before making this purchase. I learned way more than I ever wanted to know about portable and window ac units, amps the units pull, amps on a circuit, how to calculate amperage 2 hoses vs 1 hose, etc. This unit was rated highly, not only on Amazon but other websites and YouTube reviews.Long story short, I have the ac set up and running after way too many aggravating considerations, modifications and headaches. Good news is it cools my bedroom addition, that is not well insulated, beautifully. Larger footprint and sound are not an issue for me but it is pretty big and maybe 2x as loud as my air purifier? I like the white noise bc it is loud enough to drown out noises outside of the room,  but not so loud I can't get to sleep.Now, the long story and multiple headaches. First hooked it up, kept tripping the breaker. In all my research on the product, I missed that they suggest the unit go on a dedicated circuit. Idk about you but my house is not wired with a bunch of, at least 15 Amp circuits (unit needs 11. something, lets round up to 12 amps) that can be dedicated to one appliance. Doesn't that kind of cancel out or at best, severely limit the portability? So, my not soon enough to be ex husband (Headache number 1) comes over, switches out the breaker to a 20 Amp, turns the unit on, texts me and says it's cooling. Great!Totally worth the headache of having to ask him for help, right? Um, no. I get home and only the fan is on. Turn the ac on, flips the breaker.Meanwhile, my favorite uncle got wind of my issue and is straight freaking out bc just changing out the breaker is a fire hazard. The Headache is all, ""if you don't trust my electrician skills...."" Not really bruh. You didn't even know how to test the ac my dude. Back to YouTube trying to make sure I don't burn the house down. It most definitely is a fire hazard because a 15a breaker uses 14 guage wire and the 20a uses 12 guage. You can't trust that just bc the wire guage at the breaker is 12 that 12 guage was run all the way to the outlet. So, without my xray vision spectacles, I have no way to know w/o ripping out walls or something. Hazard is because, if the various things plugged into that circuit go to pull more than 20 amps, any section ran and inspected for a 15 amp breaker could catch fire. Apparently, please dont take my word for it. Please consider consulting an actual electrician who probably doesn't want your house to burn down with you in it.Ok, what to do? Headache with his superior electrician skills, says only the bedroom is on that circuit. If I am not running anything else, it will be fine. Ok, make sure nothing else is running in the bedroom. Turn it back on flips the breaker and my son, in the room next to mine, yells out, ""are you doing something mom?"" Why? His whole pc gaming set up went off when the breaker tripped. Strike 2 for Headache's alleged ""electrician skills.""What to do? Check outlets and discover 2 of the 3 in my son's room are on the same circut. Locate, purchase, pick up a surge protector with a cord long enough to run all the way across his room to the outlet not on my room's circuit. Get that all set up, try again. Ac runs a while, it's cooling, no breakers are tripping! Perfect time to enjoy a nap in my properly air conditioned room! Settle in, get comfy, about to doze off....ac cuts off. Bad words are said, throw the sheet back go to get up and notice, there is a red light blinking on the unit. Look it up in the manual. Don't I remember something about that being missing from the manual from a review I read? Yep. Not there. Google to the rescue points to the drain tank being full. Why would the drain tank be full on my self-evaporation, no drain needed PORTABLE AC? Back to the manual.2 possibilities, humidity is too high or loose wire. For humidity issue, disconnect intake hose from window frame so it is using air from the room, in my air conditioned, humidity controlled house. So, wait dual hose is better though, right? No time for that now. Drain the tank (not easy bc the drain is practically on the floor. And, I'm doing this by myself bc, remember,  Headache doesn't live here, I hate asking for his help and now he is all weird bc my questions have apparently insulted his ""electrician skills.""). No worries. I am resourceful, find a collapsible bucket, tilt to drain. Try again. Not extremely humid in here, should be fine. No need to admit defeat to my makeshift, questionable electrician who wanted to know why I got that instead of a window unit and wondered how it drains (still appearing a bit cocky when I assured him I know condensers do whatever it is they do and water has to go somewhere but this unit is self-evaporating). Runs a while, turns off, red light flashing. Did this cycle with draining a few times...got old quick.Ok, not the humidity then. So, loose wire. Manual says contact customer service. Must be pretty common since it is in the troubleshooting guide. Reassured bc there is a warranty. I'll be hot flashing in a nice, cool, refreshing 68° instead of 80° in no time.Sent the email a week ago. No word yet as to what to do. Contact Amazon 3 days in, still in their 30 day return window but it took a hand truck to get in the house and the box is almost as tall as I am. Guess who I have to ask to help if I have to send this thing back? Yup, Headache to the rescue, full of smug, ""I told you so,"" no doubt. Amazon did offer 30% discount, if I keep as is, which doesn't impact the warranty. I elected to wait to see if iI hear back from Wynter.Meanwhile, said self-evaporation, portable, dual hose unit on casters, is atop a strong acrylic storage box I had, with a child's stepstool cramed against it that is somehow keeping it from rolling so I can keep the plug open to drain it and empty the water about every 2 hours.2 stars because it is running, cooling my room and Headache, the wanna be fire hazard creating electrician, doesn't know it is not evaporating properly...yet.Wynter, please email me.I will plan to update whatever inconvenience happens next. Cannot recommend as is and it pains me to say, but Headache may be right....the window unit may be the better option. At least it drains outside (I guess?)."
"SUMMARY (final update 8/17/22):I recommend the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 instead.  You WILL thank me later.  With the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001, I can now turn off my other Whynter ARC-14S even on 90 degree days, unless it's around 100 degrees!  It's so cold on 90 degree days I have to turn it down or off in the mornings and evenings!Anyways, I purchased 3 of these Whynter ARC-14S units, so read my review carefully as I have more experience than most reviewers.  My first purchased in 2017 was good, and lasted me until 2022 when the fan started making a grinding noise.My second purchased in 2021 immediately started tripping the same circuit when I first tried it where my first unit wasn't having much problems.  After tripping the circuit, it goes into this mode where the compressor runs for 2.5 minutes with cold air, followed by the compressor off for 7 mins and blowing warm 75 degree+ air.  I had to swap my first unit back, which immediately began cooling the room.  The second unit doesn't blow cool air all the time.  It mostly does better on less hot days, but struggles on hot high 90s days, especially if humidity is over 60%.  In the evenings, sometimes even when the temperature outside goes down below 70 degrees, it was still struggling to keep the inside air under 77 degrees due to it blowing warm/hot air, so then I have to shut it off completely and use a fan to blow air from the outside.  When it's working well, the compressor appears to be on most of the time.  When the compressor turns off, sometimes it blows 70 degree air for about 7 mins before the compressor kicks back in.  On some hot and humid days, it blows 75 degree warm air for 7 minutes while the compressor is off, basically warming up the place.  However, I keep this 2nd unit in my bedroom to help me sleep at night on warm nights so I've learned to deal with it.My third unit purchased in July 2022 showed the same symptoms as the second unit.  However, it runs the compressor for 3.5 minutes and then blows hot 84 degree+ air for 10 mins.  To be fair, it starts blowing 70 degree air after the compressor turns off and starts warming up to mid 80s after a few minutes.  This obviously causes the place to warm up and ambient temperature to go as high as 80 degrees (while the outside can sometimes be only 85 degrees, or sometimes even cooler).  Although, for one day, like a miracle, it kept the ambient temperature around 75 when the outside was 100 degrees. I noticed the compressor wasn't going on and off in that mode support claims is normal for that single day.  But that was only for 1 day.  After that, it couldn't keep our place cool, even if the outside air was only 80 degrees because it goes into the mode of 3.5 mins compressor on and 10 mins compressor off blowing hot air.  See images I posted.  As a workaround after thinking about this Whynter unit somehow detecting the ambient temperature or environment and behaving a certain way, I decided to loop a hose from the vent to the back where the air intake starts.  I was hoping to trick the AC into running the compressor longer.  This seems to mostly work.  Sometimes when doing this, the compressor stays on for 10 mins, and then hot air for 10 mins with compressor off.  To resolve this manually, I set a 10 min timer to turn on the AC for 10 mins with the compressor running cold air, and then turn it off manually for 10 mins.  Rinse and repeat.  Yeah, yeah I know this is annoying, but it seems to work better than only 3.5 mins of compressor on.Anyways, I couldn't live like this because that's still 10 mins of no AC, and manually having to dink around, so I returned this 3rd Whynter ARC-14S for a refund.  Amazon sent UPS to pick it up.  The shipping boxes were destroyed so I had to go to Home Depot to buy a 24x24x46 box, along with a sturdy chalkboard, which I had Home Depot cut into 23x23 to place at the bottom.  That cost me about $29 total.  I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this Whynter ARC-14S to anyone because 2 of the 3 I purchased blows warm or hot air intermittently, especially on warmer days when you need it most!  I've changed the stars down from 5 (for my first unit) to 1 (for the warm/hot air my second and third units blow, heating up my place).I purchased the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 ( Item B09L15X5MD ), which is a dual hose system inside a single hose, to replace a Whynter ARC-S14 I returned to Amazon.  OOOOMMMMMGGGG.  It's like night and day, like going from an abusive relationship to a loving, mutual-respect, healthy relationship.  I can cook food on the stove and turn on the lights now during 100 degree days!!!  With the Whynter ARC-14S, I had to turn off all the lights, sit in the dark and heat because the Whynters (plural, two of them) couldn't cool the temps down, and only eat cold, easy to make food.  The DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 screams quality.  It's like a Mercedes vs a Ford.  It doesn't go into a mode of compressor on/off blowing hot air like the Whynter ARC-14S.  It's constantly blowing cold air like those A/Cs you find in good hotels.  In fact, the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 kept us so cold in the mornings and it evenings (even as it's 84 degrees at midnight right now), I had to turn it off or from 60 to 70 degrees.  Today, the outside temp is 98 and it kept us around 74 degrees all day (as opposed to the Whynter that usually struggles in the evening, raising our room temperature to 76 and as high as 80 sometimes).  In the evenings during hot (and sometimes only barely warm) days, the Whynter ARC-14S almost always goes into this 3.5 min compressor mode on, 10 min compressor mode off, blowing hot 80+ degrees air.  But, not the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 as it blows cold air non-stop.  My only regret is I didn't find the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 sooner.  It comes with a bar code to extend warranty to 30 months, with free shipping for repairs, etc.  I haven't scanned it yet though.  I'd recommend the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 over the Whynter ARC-14S any day.All those years and hours of sitting in the dark and heat, like primitive hunter-gatherers around the fireplace that I can never get back, while TWO Whynter ARC-14S units were running full blast, wasting electricity, where only this single DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 is able to do the job much, much, MUCH better, makes me sad-happy.  Sad for a wasted, suffering for nothing life all these years, and happy these insane days and nights are finally over.Having one Whynter ARC-14S off most of the time should save a lot of electricity, more than switching to Geico, and pay for itself in no time.DETAILS:I've had this unit for THREE+ years as of July, 2020 (purchased March 15, 2017).  It's the best portable A/C unit I've owned.  I've owned 2 other units in the $300 range to compare.  I like that it's a two hose system so it's a little more efficient.  I did notice however, because of the way it sucks air in one and out the other, it'll allow insects and spiders into the home.  How I solved that was we bought some ""Earthwise Reusable Mesh Produce Bags"" from the local grocery store and simply put it around the outside of the hose (before plugging it into the circular holder piece), kinda like you would wear a sock.  That solved the problem.  No more spiders and stuff the second year around.UPDATE 7/22/2020:  This unit has finally started to show it's age.  This is the first year it's not kept us cool.  95 degrees outside and it's 80 degrees with this thing running full blast.  Before, it was keeping us at least 5-7 degrees cooler.  Going to see if I can troubleshoot it....UPDATE 7/26/2020:  I purchased a second unit (for lack of any good 2 hose units on the market at the time).  The second unit looks identical to the old one, with the old hose system fitting it perfectly.  To my surprise the new unit runs the compressor for about 2 mins and 30 seconds, and then shuts off, and runs at room temp air for about 7 mins before running the compressor again for 2 mins and 30 seconds and then shutting off again.  Reading the reviews, this appears to be ""normal"".  However, my old unit I purchased more than 3 years prior didn't behave this way.Differences:The exhaust on the old unit is really hot, meaning it's doing it's job.  In fact, it's so hot the exhaust can burn you.  Instead feeling room temp air after 2 mins and 30 seconds, I still feel cool air.  The exhaust on the new system is on the higher warm side.  The air is cold for 2 mins and 30 seconds, and then the compressor turns off and all I feel is room temp air for 7 mins.My room thermometer kept going up with the new unit, going to 82 degrees (100 degrees outside). I switched back to the old unit, and within 5 mins (the compressor is still running or whatever is happening, the cool air is still blowing), and the temp is now down to 79 degrees.  Within a few mins, the old unit cooled down the entire place because it isn't spending 7 mins doing jack squat. I know this because when it's turned off, there's ZERO AIR FLOW on the exhaust hose.While I recommended this unit years ago, now I cannot, without any good conscience, recommend anyone buying this unit because it will not cool you on a hot day.UPDATE 9/16/2020:Originally when I replaced the old unit with the new one, the new one tripped my circuit breakers within a few minutes.  I didn't think much about it, but I put the old unit back (and it worked w/o tripping breakers), and moved the new unit into the bedroom.  I noticed after 1+ day of not using it, the new unit started behaving much better where it could actually cool the room.  I'm not sure why.However, fast forward to almost 2 months later, and my old unit started tripping the circuit breakers multiple times a day (originally starting when it was close to 100 degrees outside and now even when it's only 80 degrees... or in other words it's getting worse) where it had been sitting and working for 3+ years without issues.  This is with minimal power draw from anything else, perhaps 2-3 lights on only.  THEN... the new unit (which worked without tripping anything for almost 2 months) started tripping the circuit breakers on a totally different circuit.  AFTER the new unit tripped the breaker, I noticed it's back to that 2 mins and 30 seconds cold air, followed by 7 minutes of warmer than room temperature air.  I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT THEN, BUT I THINK TRIPPING THE CIRCUIT SOMEHOW ""BROKE"" THE NEW UNIT just like it did the first time I used it on the old unit's circuit.  It's been a few days now and the new unit is still ""broken"".  Worse, the old unit is now tripping the circuit even with EVERYTHING ELSE turned off (in sometimes as little as 15 mins after I reset the breaker), so we're like basically SITTING IN THE FRIGGEN DARK as evening comes and it'll trip the circuit.  I'm not sure if something electrical in my house is broken, or if it's the AC units themselves.  I've since disconnected both ACs and turned everything on and nothing's been tripped, so definitely the ACs are contributing.Note:  It's loud as heck, but you get used to it.  It's like a louder version of white noise at the office.UPDATE July 12, 2022: My first unit purchased 2017 finally starting to show its age with just cool (not cold) air coming out, and grinding noise when turned on for a few weeks now. Today it got so bad I turned it off and the grinding noise continued 30+ seconds until the entire fan unit came to a standstill.The second unit purchased 2 years prior is still doing great, very cold air, with no problems or electrical tripping of the circuit in our bedroom.  I suspect now the reason it had trouble initially was the first circuit couldn't provide the unit enough electricity, manifesting in it only working for 2 mins and 30 seconds, and then the compressor turns off and all I feel is warm, humid air for 7 mins.Also, in case I forget to note, this second unit turns itself off (most of the time) when the room gets cold.  It'll turn itself on when the room gets too warm beyond what I set the temperature.  The first unit just kept blowing the fan regardless of setting.  Good for when I need to keep the place cool while I leave for a few days.Update: early July, 2022:  I'll be purchasing a 3rd unit to replace the 5 year old 1st unit.Update:  July 20, 2022:  3rd unit arrived.  Upon turning it on, the compressor kicked in and it was cold for a few minutes.... until it tripped the circuit.  After tripping the circuit, it went into the mode of turning on the compressor for 3 minutes and 30 seconds, and then blowing a funky smelling nasty humid, slightly warm air for a good 9+ minutes or more before turning on the compressor for 3 minutes and 30 seconds again.  As a result, it did not cool the room as many have complained about.  My 2nd unit ran for 2 minutes and 30 seconds with the compressor while in this mode.  Anyways, I think my suspicions are confirmed.  If it trips the circuit, it goes into this mode where after the compressor runs for a few minutes and turns off, warm 80 degree F air gets blown out of the vent and heats up the place for 10+ minutes.  Anyways, I tested a different circuit using a heavy duty extension cable (not the weak type, but commercial type meant to handle the juice), and it did not trip that circuit.  If I unplug the power cable to the 3rd unit for a few minutes, it still kept it's 3 minutes and 30 seconds cycle, and in fact after starting it ""for the first time"" after plugging in the power, the compressor didn't come on.  I left it unplugged overnight.  After doing that, it was able to run the compressor upon powering it on for a few minutes before the compressor turned off.  I suspect this mode has to do with not having enough juice from the outlet.Having said that, the picture showing the 1250 Watts at 10.8 A is the 1st unit I bought in 2017.  It rarely tripped the circuit just by running, although did a few times during 100 degree days, but does so especially if we use lights and devices on that same circuit.The picture showing the 1300 Watts at 11.6A is the 3rd unit.  I don't have an image of the 2nd unit because it's currently against the corner of a wall and I don't want to go through the trouble of getting to the backside.  But as you can see, this is the typical problem with Amazon allowing sellers to simply switch products or update them.  They get to keep the reviews and Q/A, which may no longer be valid to match their current products.  Some sellers go as far as switching products entirely so reviews are completely bogus.  Keep this in mind when you're reading reviews from 5+ years ago.  Most likely they are no longer valid.  Even my 2nd unit I purchased a year prior was running the compressor for 2.5 minutes while this 3rd unit runs if for 3.5 minutes.  I'll update the review once I can get the 3rd unit to run the compressor continuously.Update: July 25, 2022.  No go.  3rd unit still doing 3.5 mins AC compressor cold air (ice cold like my 2nd unit), but then 10+ minutes of room and then very warm air (mid 80s F air) and chemical smell.  2nd unit in comparison does 2.5 mins AC compressor cold air followed by close to 10 mins low 70s F air. Not good at all for this 3rd unit.  See images.  I have it now on a dedicated outlet and it's not tripping the outlet.Update August 15, 2022: I've decided to return the 3rd unit before my 30 days is expired. I bought a different brand dual hose AC and will update here with that one in a few days. I didn't have the original boxes so I had to buy a 24x24x46 shipping box from Home Depot, along with a strong quarter inch chalkboard was support for the bottom.  I had Home Depot cut it into 23x23 for me.  I secured the unit with light, hard foam from other stuff I've purchased over the years and taped the foam to the fridge sides of AC unit to secure it against all sides of the shipping box.  I also put a 2 inch thick soft but sturdy foam between the chalkboard and the wheels that coincidentally is exactly the size footprint of the AC unit.Amazon is supposedly sending UPS to pick it up but CS said they can't send anyone to pack it up for me (guessing due to size), so I had to pack it myself.Anyways, good news and bad news. Good news, this unit was able to keep the temp around 75 degrees F for most of the day when it was 101 degrees outside. I had to turn the unit on all night before and woke up to 69 degrees temps.  The compressor appeared to be on most of the time, and not giving me 85 degree warm air.  Very strange this intermittent working issue.  The bad news is we had 3 days in a row of 100 degrees so as the night temps remained around 70 degrees F outside all night, the ACs struggled and kept doing the 3.5 min cold + 10 min warm mode.  The second and third days, the morning was fine, but both ACs went back to the warm air mode, usually in the late afternoons.  It seems when there's higher humidity outside, they struggle more too.What's really bad is even after the days were only 85 degrees, the ACs sometimes go into this mode, much sooner than later afternoon.  The 3rd unit also did the warm air mode some nights, all night despite outside air being 60 degrees, so I had to just turn it off completely and open the windows instead to blow outside air in.I notice when it's cold, the unit works better (unless it's not working at all....), with the compressor not going off. However, sometimes the compressor goes off and the Whynter blows hot air, even when outside temps are in the mid 70s at night, so no exact rhyme or reason. I also noticed once the room temp goes above 76 or 77 degrees F, the 3rd AND 2nd units start going into this 2-3 min compressor cold mode and then 10 minutes of compressor off mode. The 2nd unit blows slightly cooler air during compressor off mode.  The irony is these units work well when the temp outside and inside is generally cold, but not so well when hot, exactly the opposite of what you need!  It's like a broken phone or car that works when you don't need it, but doesn't work when you absolutely need it to.I read something in the manual about depending on the room temp so I did a test be looping cold air from the AC back to the air filter suction area (see images).  This appeared to help the 3rd unit keep the compressor on for 10 mins before blowing hot air for 10 more minutes.  So I had to use a timer countdown to manually leave the AC on for 10 mins, and then shut it off manually for 10 mins so the AC unit would hopefully start the compressor again, and keep repeating this non-sense.  Very annoying, I know.  Otherwise it's 3.5 mins compressor followed by 10 mins warn air.  I timed all this down to the second so I'm not making this up.  If you open the air filter, you'll see something behind it.  I'm guessing that's the temp sensor.  I'm guessing it you can loop cold air back to that exact spot, you can trick the compressor to stay on longer.  But, the hot exhaust is next to it so it'll suck hot air in, which is a poor design and is the cause of this problem I'm guessing.  But, this is a pathetic workaround so I decided to return the unit.  Inconsistent results was very frustrating.  I bought a DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 to try.I had emailed Whynter support.  They are completely useless, use canned responses and didn't answer my questions. This is also a factor for returning the 3rd unit. I will not buy this AC again, or anything from Whynter.  As for my second unit, I'll see if looping back cold air directly to the temp sensor helps.  So far it keeps us cool at night in the bedroom, which is a good thing.  But it'll go into the slightly warm air mode too, just not as bad as the third unit.I'll update the DREO TwinCool DR-HAC001 unit in a few days."
"Failed Compressor: warranty refusal-----------------------------------I bought one of these units and used it for less than a week while mycentral air conditioner was being repaired. The unit was able to coola small room and that was enough until the repair was completed. A yearlater at the beginning of summer I tested it and it still worked. Thisyear I tested it and it did not work. So, I emailed Whynter CustomerSupport and this is my account of what happened.Summary-----------Whynter refused to honor the three-year warranty on the compressor. Beforethat became obvious, Whynter Customer Support did every thing they could todelay, frustrate the process, and waste my time. Most of the questions andinstructions from Whynter Customer Support were virtually non-sensical,designed to obstruct, nearly absurd. This went on through many emails,many questions, including instructions for taking the machine apart for internalcleaning. I was able to get the machine about 90% apart for cleaning, but itwas very difficult. After that, Whynter support asked me to try the unit outin a larger room. The unit does not blow cold air and somehow moving it intoa larger room is going to fix it? Then they wanted a picture of the unit andits setup in the window. The unit does not blow any cool/cold air at all.Adjustments to the window, the room, or the exhaust/intake hoses are notgoing to change that. At that point I could see that Whynter is adishonorable outfit and they are not going to honor their warranty. Theyjust tried to waste my time until I went away. So I am posting this here. If youinitiate a support request for your Whynter machine, you are likely to gothrough something exactly the same or very similar.These are the saved emails in chronological order as best I can arrange:1) Original support request---------------------------Hello support@whynter.com,I have a Whynter ARC-14S portable air conditioner. The serial number is:I bought this Whynter ARC-14S from amazon. Amazon charged me for it on 1August 2020. I'd like to register a warranty/support request. The user manualsays that the unit's compressor is under warranty for three years. I am stillas of today within that three year time frame.The problem is that the unit does not blow cold air. The fan runs but theunit is not cooling.Here is what I've checked so far:* filters are clean* air intake and exhaust are not obstructed* room temperature is about 81 F degrees* cooling mode is on* internal water reservoir is empty* unit's cooling temperature is set sufficiently low* time delay read out is 0:00hrThe unit does suck air in from the intake and it does blow air out theexhaust; however, no cold/cool air comes out from the top and the air blownout the exhaust is not hot/warm. When it was working properly, the air blownout the exhaust was hot/warm. So, I'm guessing that the compressor is notactually turning on because the exhaust air is not hot/warm.I have a second Whynter ARC-14S unit that is working properly, so I prettymuch know what it's like when the unit works properly. I have central airconditioning here at my home. I used this unit in a small bedroom in 2020for about a week when my central air conditioning unit needed repair. I didn'tuse it again, but I periodically tested it and now it has failed. My secondWhynter ARC-14S is a backup unit in case both my central air conditioner unitand the first Whynter ARC-14S fail.I think that this unit's compressor may have failed. Can you help? Please letme know what I must do to get the unit repaired.Thank you,---------------------------2) First Reply from Whynter---------------------------Thank you for contacting us about your Whynter ARC-14S portable airconditioner. We are sorry that your air conditioner is not cooling properly.Please let us know what temperature the air conditioner is set to, yourcurrent room temperature and the square footage of the room.Please make sure that the filter is clean and that the unit has been drainedof any collected condensation. Also ensure that the exhaust hose is as shortand straight as possible and that there are no bends or leaks in the hose(s)Please unplug the unit for 3 minutes to reset it; afterward, please provideus with the following information:1. Set the unit to COOL mode and to the lowest temperature.2. Confirm the compressor comes on after approximately 3 minutes.3. AFTER the compressor comes on, confirm that the unit is blowing cool airfrom the front air output vent and warm air out of the rear exhaust hose.4. If the unit is blowing air from the front and back, place a thermometerinside of the front air output vent and provide us with the temperaturereading after 15 minutes. *Note: The unit has a 5F temperature cushion whichwhen the unit achieves 5F within the set temperature, the compressor does notcome on so please make sure that your room temperature is above 67F. Thissaves energy and extends the life of the compressor.5. If no air is blowing from either the front air output vent or the exhaust,please inspect the fans for rotation and any visible damage. *Note: Theexhaust fan only operates when the compressor is running.If the compressor is coming on and the unit is cooling some, the evaporatorand condenser may need to be cleaned. Please use the attached instructions asa guide to open the housing of the unit for maintenance cleaning if you feelcomfortable doing so.You can vacuum the condenser and evaporator to clean and dust; please makesure that the fins are dry when vacuuming.You can also use an evaporator/ condenser cleaner available at most hardwarestores for the condenser and evaporator, if they are really dirty.You can clean the base with a vinegar and water solution and draining.Please register your warranty by providing the following:A copy of your purchase invoice or 'Final Order Details' page if the itemwas purchased from Amazon.com.Please reply or refer to your case number if you have any questions.Thank you and stay safe!---------------------------3) My second email to Whynter---------------------------Hello Jose G.,I've attached a copy of my amazon purchase invoice for the Whynter ARC-14S,serial number XXXXXX.> Please let us know what temperature the air conditioner is set to,  70F> your current room temperature  81F> and the square footage of the room.  90 square feet> Please make sure that the filter is clean  OK, yes, it is clean.> and that the unit has been drained of any collected condensation.

We recommend you clean the unit internally and let usknow if the unit still not cooling. If so and for testing purposes, pleaseremove the intake hose and cover the window intake port with the coverincluded. Set the unit to the lowest temperature setting and please confirmthe temperature reading on the front vent after 15 mins of running.Please note that we did not receive a copy of your purchase invoice fromamazon to register your warranty.

It is as described in previous emails, both hoses connected througha window.> Also, please try to relocate the into a bigger room location and let us> know if the unit is cooling.With all due respect, a larger room will not fix the compressor.8) Whynter's final response---------------------------Thanks for your reply. We're sorry to hear that the unit still not cooling.For further assistance, can you please provide us with a photo of how theunit was set up at your location?Please reply or refer to your case number if you have any questions.Thank you and stay safe!Jose G.Customer SupportWhynter Innovations Group"
"This product claims to be able to cool 500 square feet. I am trying to cool an area that consists of small living room/dining room, a connected small kitchen and a hallway. Ceiling height is 8 feet. The total square footage is around 450 square feet. I've used this product for over a month now, in a variety of different temperatures, and I can say that it cannot drop the temperature in this area more than 2 degrees. So if I start at 82, and run it constantly for hours, the best it will do is drop it to 80.Of course there are many factors associated with the area, besides the square footage, that will determine the needed BTUs. I have several things going against me. It's a mobile home, so I'm sure the insulation isn't great. I have old single pane windows. Part of the area is the kitchen, but we rarely use any heat creating devices during the day, and I still observe the poor performance. However you should also consider that I don't live in an extremely hot climate. 90 is the hottest it will ever get, and thats pretty rare. A hot day is 85, humidity 40 to 60%. All I was expecting was to be able to keep the area at 76, even 77 would be fine, but it can't. I do try try to turn it on early, before the area starts to heat up, and that works better, but the temp still creeps up throughout the today to over 80 degrees!Before you wonder if I'm using it correctly, I'm sure that I am. I have both the intake and exhaust hoses setup and sealed at a window. The unit is on the a/c setting. Temperature at the vents averages 50 degrees, which is good. I've tried all 3 fan speeds. It just doesn't have the capacity. I even tried wrapping the exhaust hose in insulation, to prevent radiant heat from escaping into the room, but it didn't seem to make too much of a difference. I have a fan near the unit to direct the cool air towards the living room area, which is where we are most of the time, and that helps. I'm sure in a normal to large size bedroom it would do fine, maybe a room around 250 square feet, but forget about 500, unless you have ""ideal conditions"". What do they consider ideal? A room insulated like a liquid nitrogen tank, when the outside temperature is 75?Because I haven't used it very long, I can't attest to the quality/endurance. But it appears to be fairly well constructed. Many people complained about the window kit, but I believe they upgraded it. The hoses and window piece are high quality durable plastic. It wasn't long enough for my window size, so I had to extend it with plexiglass, which took a few hours and 2 trips to home depot to figure out how to cut plexiglass with out breaking it, drill holes, bolt it, and then I applied adhesive weather stripping around all the edges of both the plexiglass and the window kit to seal it.I've never owned a window a/c, but I've been doing a lot of research, and they appear to be far superior to these portable a/c's. Far fewer reviews complaining about the inability to cool the area, and I've read multiple articles claiming that window units do much better than portables. Although I don't understand why. A BTU is a BTU. I know it has to work harder to pump air through the hoses, so engineers would have to design beefier components relative to a window unit to get to 14000 BTUs. But if a portable and a comparable window unit are both rated at 14000 BTUs, they should both be capable of exchanging the exact same amount of heat. One shouldn't significantly outperform the other. I suspect they are overrating these. Or if I'm missing something, someone let me know.Also realize this thing is big, especially when you consider the bulky hoses coming out of the back. It's all inside your house, so it's taking up usable space, whereas a window a/c is occupying space that you wouldn't normally use for anything else.I want to clear up some misconceptions many seem to have about the dual vs single hose units. I've heard many say that dual hoses seem inefficient because ""why would you want to cool hot air you're pulling in from outside."" This is not how it works. Any a/c system has two distinct air circulating systems. One pulls in air from the room and runs it over evaporators, where the heat is extracted out by the refrigerant. Its called an evaporator because the refrigerant heats up and evaporates into a gas. The now cool air is then blown out the vents. We should all know from high school physics that you cannot just destroy energy, that heat has to be transferred elsewhere. The now gaseous refrigerant is run throw pipes to the condenser. This is where the hoses come in. In a dual system, the intake hose is drawing in outside air to blow over the condenser. The heat from the refrigerant is extracted by the air. The now hot air is blown out of the exhaust hose. The refrigerant cools, returns to a liquid and is pumped back up to the evaporator to continue the cycle. In a single hose system you are drawing this air from the room, and pumping the hot air outside. This creates negative pressure in the room. This causes air from outside to enter your home threw gaps in doors/windows to maintain equilibrium (if it didn't the negative pressure would get greater and greater, until the energy required to pump the air out would exceed the capacity of the a/c and it would fail!) So while you are running your single hose a/c you are actively drawing in hot outside air, this makes single hose systems inefficient relative to dual hose. Dual hose avoids this because its drawing in just as much air as its exhausting, causing no net loss. You might argue that the air drawn in from outside may be very hot, and that would prevent as much heat from being extracted from the refrigerant. This probably could be a factor, however for me the outside temperature is never really ridiculous. Also note that normal split a/c systems use outside air to cool the refrigerant, just like dual hose portables, and they seem to do fine.In summary, unless you absolutely can't, I see no reason to choose this over a window unit. It struggles to cool an area below the total square footage it claims to handle, it generally costs more than comparable window units, and it takes up usable space.7/15/16 UpdateI've resorted to using this like a cold air fan. I have it right next to my couch, blowing directly at me while I sit on the couch. This creates a 70 degree micro climate, as long as you are on the couch. And you also get the benefit of the noise drowning out your thoughts and being blasted by a wall of 90 degree air when you stand up to go somewhere else in the house! Because the vents give you so little control of air direction, I created a cardboard add-on that directs the air straight ahead, instead of blowing up towards the ceiling.I'm pretty sure this creates a good amount of negative pressure, despite being a dual hose. I noticed air flowing in from a crack under a door while the a/c was running. I turned off the a/c and the airflow under the door stopped. Maybe it reduces the amount of negative pressure relative to a single hose (I can't say for sure) but it definitely doesn't eliminate it. This might partially explain the poor performance. I'm sure I have everything hooked up properly so I don't think it is user error.It still runs and no components are broken or malfunctioning. I don't need to use it that often because it rarely gets hot where I live, so I don't have a ton of hours on it. But when I do use it the compressor never turns off because it is so terrible at cooling the area it will never bring the temperature down to the thermostat setting. I'm wondering how long it will last.8/14/2018I've switched to using this in a 210 square foot bedroom. This is a normal house with decent insulation and good windows. It's performance is acceptable in this room, in that I can set it to 74 degrees and it will get the room down to that. This is with outside air temperatures in upper 80's and sometimes low 90's, humidity usually 40 to 60%. Without a/c the room temperature would be in the low 80s.Another annoying factor is the noise. It's pretty dam loud when the compressor is running. Definitely interferes if you want to listen to something on a laptop or TV, Especially in a not huge bedroom where it may need to be placed within a few feet of your bed (remember it has to be within a foot or 2 of a window, which limits placement options). And don't discount the size, it is very big and bulky, so use in a small bedroom might be difficult."
