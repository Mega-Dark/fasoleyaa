It was great for two years and now the charging port won‚Äôt work. I didn‚Äôt even use it that much.
"Bought this to replace a 10 year old Toshiba Chromebook that no longer gets updates. Was instantly startled by the screen. No matter how you angle it, any black looks like you're looking at it from an angle. I don't know the proper term to describe it, but think of you looking at a screen from the side and the blacks are a bright reflective look. It's like that from all angles. It legitimately hurts my eyes. I never once had a complaint about the screen of my 2014 Toshiba but this was an instant ""oh no."" Other than that it's a Chromebook. Keyboard was acceptable. Track pad wasn't perfect but it worked. Loved that it charged usb c and not a proprietary cable. But ultimately I ended up doing a return because of the screen quality."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I absolutely love everything about this laptop, except... The frame around the screen is so thin and is built so poorly that the plastic cracks very easily. Once that happens... the hinge underneath separates and it is a nightmare to open and close everyday.If you buy this laptop you will love it, as long as you treat it very gingerly. Do not go by the rugged description given by the manufacturer. Hope that helps!"
"Not a touchscreen, even though it says it is in the specs"
"So I bought this Chromebook shortly after my old Google Chromebook died... I'm looking through when I see Asus, ""ooh, I like them!"" Have lactas products for a long time, ever since I bought a little netbook back in 2008... I bought most of their phones, admittedly there's zenfone 9 was less than ideal.. But surely that was a fluke right?I like to do art... Writing, actual drawing... Things like that. I don't do that on my normal computer cuz I will completely sidetrack myself...So my old Chromebook died. This was the choice... It finally came in and I was so excited to finally get started. Oh, it comes with a mouse! I thought that was unusual, I guess I should have taken that as a red flag.By the time I had logged into my Gmail account, I had figured out that this phone doesn't have a touch screen. I haven't even tried anything beyond this, I can't believe they're still making Chromebooks like this... It blows my mind... Bad enough when I'm at work and I try to hit the screen to make something happen, and forget I have to use my mouse... Not doing that at home."
"When filtering for touch screen chromebooks this was Amazon's pick. Even when on chat with customer service they recommended this one...it is NOT touch screen.it seemed nice, rugged and durable.. but I returned it due to needing a touch screen."
"I am not crazy about this touch pad. Last Asus Chromebook I had did not last as long as my first purchase. The touch pad went and had to use mouse instead. This may need to get broken in, but touch pad is not always responsive. I hope this will last awhile. I got lucky with my first Chromebook, it lasted a long time. I like the Asus products, they usually hold up well."
The item is false advertisement. I bought it because it says it‚Äôs a touchscreen and it is certainly not. I bought two of them. And my sons keeps freezing. Thinking about returning them after this mess but I‚Äôve already got them set up.
I bought this as a gift for my husband. I use it more than he does though and rather than doing what it was purchased for (an online start up) it‚Äôs only used in conjunction with a Bluetooth speaker (at its loudest it‚Äôs just too quiet) to stream Hulu. I feel sad it i wasted the money because  it‚Äôs just not good enough to do much more than I‚Äôm doing with it. It‚Äôs ok for streaming though ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"It's not for me. Chromebook limits downloads, takes up way too much screen, and really limits my browsing. We couldn't download Roblox and that was really the reason we sent it back. I just felt like the set up was too limiting and it was too much work to figure out how to make it fit our needs."
I bought a new Chromebook computer and now I'm regretting it. It won't work with my perfectly good laser printer and now I can't get any bluetooth pairing with my headphones. I bought this because I thought it would be easy and cheap and to try to avoid frequent updates and problems with viruses inherent with Microsoft products. Now I'm annoyed.
This is a tablet not a computer you can not install programs is just a tablet with keyboardDon‚Äôt like it sending back.if you looking for a tablet with keyboard this is itI meet a computer. A 60 tablet does the same
"Not even a year old. My husband has been consistently disappointed in this laptop..it's constantly freezig and has to be restarted. Goes very slowly. He only does basic tasks like surf the web, pay bills, watch YouTube. We have multiple Chromebooks in the house and this one is the only one that's complete trash."
"I dropped a glass of liquid on my HP Chromebook so I needed a replacement. I didn't take the time to read but this Chromebook does not have a touch screen, which is fine, but not for me. I like the way the keys are raised, but the layout of the keyboard wasn't working for me. I still think this would be a good beginning for Chromebook users, it just wasn't for me. I do appreciate the return policy."
"I realy wanted to like this chromebook but cant get past the keyboard layout, has extra keys where the enter button is and extra key where a left shift is.  Really wanted to keep this but cant get past this.  Other than that, it is a good working device for the money.  Keyboard is not what is in the pictures."
"I got this for basic writing purposes. This Chromo Book is extremely finicky about the Wi-Fi it connects to.I use Google Docs offline when I can‚Äôt connect and am satisfied with the end result.It‚Äôs important to note this device does NOT support Microsoft apps. You can use the Microsoft online Office however you MUST have Wi-Fi access to do this.Im happy with this purchase because it allows me to work on writing during breaks at work, but I am dissatisfied with the Wi-Fi potential."
"Upon receipt of my purchase, I opened the box and took my brand new Chromebook out of the box it was shipped in and pressed the power button only for it not to turn on. I retrieved the charger from the box and plugged the Chromebook in but still no luck. It would not turn on. I will be returning this piece of crap and purchasing from a more reliable company. Very, very dissatisfied! I wish I could leave zero stars"
It's small
"it works and fully updates, but its slower than molasses, it barely even can run youtube, like at anything over 720p, also the speakers are awful battery life is great though. but i would recommend looking at one of the ones that costs a bit more, for 50 or 100 more probably worth the price"
The mouse pad is small and it takes forever to move the arrow across the screen
I received a used Chromebook that had someone else‚Äôs password protected profile on it. This is very unprofessional. Overall the Chromebook is decent but does have a cheap feel to it. It would be fine for kids to do school work but that is about it.
doesn't work and  amazon no return and Asus no customer service and no return
"Everyone needs to be aware of the Auto Update Expiration (AUE) date, this device will not get updates after 2025 I wish it was disclosed on the item description very shady practice support from component manufacturers. When a device reaches AUE, automatic software updates from Google will no longer be provided."
"It has no dvd drive, no printer usb, and I cannot download msn on it. It is not supported so you have to use the google spyware program."
"My son ordered this Chromebook mid-October 2023. Today is about a month in a half later and out of the blue the laptop stopped charging.  We tested the charger on another Chromebook and it worked fine. The laptop is otherwise in very good condition and has been well cared for.  This was my son‚Äôs first purchase with his own money he had been saving up (he‚Äôs 11), so he is very disappointed to say the least."
"It worked well enough until the screen broke. It‚Äôs a mystery why the screen broke. It was working fine then the screen was broken. I bought it because it was supposed to be durable, so I‚Äôm disappointed that the screen is now broken.Customer service wasn‚Äôt to helpful and was even sarcastic. They asked me if I could prove it wasn‚Äôt dropped. How can I prove something like that?They would fix it, but I they wouldn‚Äôt know how much it cost to fix it bc it‚Äôs not their department."
"I guess many would know that a Chromebook isn't Windows compatible, and restricts you from a lot of actual laptop/desktop work. Now I know.Good unit for basic web browsing and emails, Google Apps. Worked great for that."
"While the computer doesn't cost much, one of the two we bought stopped taking charge after about a year. The other one still works but it is a very basic laptop."
"I'm having a hard time with the Chromebook, it seems to me like a walking advertising portal, I would always prefer a Windows 11 laptop.I wonder what could be better than on a tablet, which is much easier to use."
Durable built: yes.  Sadly description does not include the type OS.  Chrome 32 bit OS NOT 64 bit.After 2025 end of service for Google on this device if one wanted to change OS to Linux 32 bit is prohibitive.
It functions. Its laggy and slow. Other then that it does well for what I use it for.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I ordered this to travel with. It's partially worked two of the four trips. You had to use it as a guest, which limits  it functionality. Now it's not cutting on. Fortunately, my main laptop (not the same brand) is still working. It is lightweight and rugged looking. However, it's not powered by looks. I'm glad If you plan on trying it, I would recommend you purchase the warranty.In addition, use it frequently in the begging to report more accurately what's wrong with it, if problems occur."
"Like many other reviewers, I got a ""Chrome OS missing or damaged"" error after 5 months of use. Sent it to get it fixed under the warranty and they sent a blurry photo of a piece of paper citing it as their ""evidence"" of hinge cover, main board, lcd case, and bottom case damage and demanded $265 to fix the physical damage before they would fix the operating system error (and don't bother trying to download the OS onto a flash drive, it doesn't recognize the file and the screen will go dark). I wish I had read the 1-star reviews before buying it. It was a good laptop for the 5 months I had it but that doesn't really matter when it won't last and the company doesn't honor their warranty."
Great laptop. However if you are buying this to run splash learn for school aged children it will not work asus does not support or allow this app to be downloaded.
Easy set up. Enough storage for what my son is using it for.
"We ordered this computer based on the description, which states that is has a touchscreen.  The product does not have a touchscreen."
the laptop was acceptable as a laptop about two months after purchase I started noticing problems starting it.  that quickly progressed to it becoming completely dark.  I called customer service and a poorly trained person had me try several things. none made a difference.  when I get back to the US I plan to send it back to ASUS.  I would not recommend this chromebook!!
Does not have an HDMI port as advertised.
Never got to use it.  Tried for days but couldn‚Äôt get it to work
Security updates only good for 2 1/2 years. But it'd a good little chrome book hardened.. u get what u pay for...
it‚Äôs very slow and low quality
"Purchased for my daughter, for school who in the third grade, when I purchased, it stated it was new , has last me 9 months , now fight with the seller and Amazon, just terrible, who buys a coomputer for 9 months , and to make matters worse can‚Äôt get it repair by Asus cause has no warranty, might be 5 years old , no idea ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm done with Amazon and there 3rd party seller no accountability, At least Walmart will stand by its stuff or give a full refund ."
Doesnt work on battery only. Battery showing 95% charge.  Barely operates when plugged in. Bit of a joke that i only get max $20 for return shipping. Will be out of pocket $100.  Get treated better purchasing direct from China. Thanks jeff b
Great computer and basic but zoom kept crashing and shutting down not enough memory I guess
Item would not cut on a week after purchase.
"Not worth the price. Horrible screen quality, the worst I have ever seen, especially for a relatively new model Chromebook. Text looks pale, gray and washed out, and will likely be unreadable for ebooks. Colors are also washed out and bluish. I tried changing some of the settings to improve the visuals but nothing helped. The processor is Media Tek, not Intel, so is very slow loading web pages compared to other Chromebooks I have owned. The mouse pad was indented more on one side and makes a hollow clacking sound right out of the box.It feels like it won't last. Will return."
Bad experience..Laptop is very slow and the physical condition is really bad.Amazon should not allow to sell laptops like these..
"I expected good quality Chromebook, but the web camera keeps freezing during the video callsAs I have many online meetings, it's a nightmare("
"Worst gift I ever bought. By the time I realized the return window had closed. Won't let you do Lexia which was the whole point. [Which could be a Lexia problem but point is it won't be recognized as an apt browser, but Chrome will tell you it's up to date.] Every time you have to go through a whole rigamarole just to get to the main screen. Time consuming and burdensome. Not touchscreen and screen quality very low. I will throw this against the wall and spend the money on something that actually works."
What waisted time and money
"Had a few Chromebooks over the years, mostly Acer as they seem to be one of the best. Not impressed with this Asus, screen is washed out, colors are weird, bluetooth won't stay connected. Rest of it seems OK. Maybe I just got a bad one? I'll stick to Acer in the future"
Was not a touchscreen
"Learned the hard way to not buy a Chromebook.  Barely used it before it had issues with connecting to wifi in a way none of my other devices has.  And since it won't really do anything without an internet connection, you get something that is of little use."
"i bought this item in February, and by mid-May the touchpad had stopped working properly, requiring me to move diagonally rather than up and down. Very disappointing."
The computer is slow but that's ok since it was a chromebook for my son to play video games on it. But I expected it to last longer than 2 months. The cord doesn't work nor will the chromebook hold a charge. I tried reaching out to the company but the form you have to fill out asks for a model number before you can submit a help request and it won't recognize the model number. I've tried several codes located on the computer but nothing is working.
"I bought this during a Cyber Monday deal.  The laptop is light in weight and easy to use.  I used it 5 days a week at work for the months of December (Minus Christmas break) and January.  Then, halfway through February it stopped working.  When I press the power button the chrome symbol flashes across the screen and then it powers off.  The tech guy at my school said I probably need a new battery.  I didn't even get three whole months of use üòí"
"I was disappointed when I received the ASUS Chromebook. The speakers, internal and external, and the microphone did not work. I even reset the device and they still did not work.This was not my first ASUS. I have had 2 laptops. The current one is 6 years old."
"ASUS will not warranty this product as a 3rd party seller sells it. I got less than a 30-day warranty on a new Chromebook. Buyers be aware. ASUS considers it a refurbished product, so there is only a 90-day warranty after two days of contact with ASUS support. It should clearly state that in the description, as ASUS can not verify that it is new."
"This was a great laptop and I got it for a wonderful price. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. It stopped charging completely after 3 months of use."
Lasted a little over a year. Just tried to plug in to charge and smoke came put of the charge port. Bummer.
Screen died soon after unboxing. Have to return it
"I found this Chromebook unusable. The keyboard, in particular, was definitely not user-friendly. Amazon will censor this review if I say it's taken me two weeks of repeated attempts to return it.  Nevertheless, reviews should reflect the service Prime clients receive. T"
This product worked fine for two months and suddenly stopped working all together . Just dead üíÄ.
"I didn't expect much for the low price, but a cellphone operates faster than this."
"This is junk, unfortunately.  It stopped charging when it was three weeks old.  Amazon at first would not help, because it was sold through a third party.  Now they agreed to send me a new cable, but will that also last three weeks?  Then what?"
It's not an iPad!!!
"The tamper proof seals were cut open and the laptop had no other protection on it. When I turned it on, the battery was drained and not recognizing the charger."
"If you are considering buying  this system take care. I got this for my wife at Christmas since it was small portable and had fair battery life, it worked fine plus or minus some minor quirks up till yesterday when the whole operating system crashed. Went though the whole restore process to no avail."
Under product details - connectivity it clearly state that the laptop has Touchscreen; unfortunately it does not; the other issue delivery kept delaying it arrived 14 days from order day.
My first unit failed not long after I bought it. Asus has a good reputation for reliability and the reviews are highly favorable so I thought I'd give Asus a second chance. I sent it back and purchased another.  Today it too went dead. It is very disappointing.
Paper weight would've been a better purchase. Really can't do much of anything on it. Bought 2 returned the one that we never opened. But my son was already using one when he found out he couldn't do most of his projects on this. Cannot download windows and can't pay bills. Useless.
Hard to use. Only good for internet browsing. No delete key. Generally not easy or comfortable to use.
"was good for only 6 months then just died, no drops or damage just died. Piece of junk if it only lasts that long. Dont buy this piece of junk even if you are desperate. I ll never buy an Acer product again"
Worked good for almost thee months. Than the screen developed lines and became unusable. Sent it back to ASUS. They said screen was damaged. Unit was never abused.  They want $136.00 to fix it. That's more than I paid for it. Just my experience.
"Its heavy, and its security protocols are not stable."
My sturdy C203XA crashes often after 60 days of use. I am very disappointed. I can not contact the tec help b/c I do not have the original box to get the tec information about the model number.
This was a great price but i learned my lesson to NEVER buy a refurbished product again. Wasn't worth anything.  Money in the trash.  Bummer.
The description photo clearly shows an HDMI port. The one I received doesn‚Äôt have one. The keyboard is hard to use due to extra buttons and a weird arrangement. Display not great. Not happy at all.
Kept freezing or going to black screen. Had to return Chromebook.
"Touchscreen is False Advertising, this screen is not touch."
Stated this laptop was touchscreen. It's NOTI will be returning it.
So disappointed! The description says touchscreen but it‚Äôs not!!!!
"Bought ‚Äúnew‚Äù paid MSRP, got used Chromebook with no box, no warranty card, and someone else already registered as a user, not even power-washed!!!!  Not happy."
This computer is absolute junk. They are old K12 computers they run slow and are constantly restarting
"Bought for our 7 year old grandson, he was so heartbroken when it wouldn't even boot up. Waiting for the replacement to arrive. Hopefully no issues"
"Bought it because it had a HDMI port which is it does not, disappointing"
SUCKS ASS!!!! No Windows operating system.
Very disappointed not what I expected at all
Less than 2 months of use and it's dead.
"I like the size, but when typing the keys are more than slow. I have to stop and wait for what I've typed to catch up. Then have to go back because it seems like it misses some of the letters typed here and there."
Only one real way to try out and see how you like something like this and I'm not a fan of this system. Too many things are forced on you that the customer should have the option to use or not use. I would not buy this again.
I bought 1 then ordered another 2 for Christmas gifts.The 2 items were supposed to arrive at the same time in one package but only 1 item was delivered.Then I received a notice the last ordered would arrive in a few days but did not.Company kept systematically delaying the delivery from a few days to a week to weeks to almost over a month so I ended up canceling the last one.The Chromebook was good in the beginning but it started to reboot itself several times while being used. It's annoying and unreliable.I will update here to let people know so they can make an  informed decision before buying.
Purchased this for my 6th grader. Worked great until it just stopped working one day in the middle of class. Screen went blank and that was it. She maybe got two months at most out of the purchase.
This was a nice little computer. We got it for one of our kiddos to use at school. Sadly after 4 months it stopped turning on. Don't waste your money.
"I purchased this Chromebook from Asus and after a few months , it stopped working. I called Asus customer support and was informed it was under warranty and I should send it to them for repair. They sent me a link and it promptly informed me I had to pay $28.00 in order to receive the shipping label. A call to Asus confirmed this was true and they would not provide a shipping label until I paid their ‚Äúfee.‚ÄùLesson learned‚Ä¶Asus does not back their products and will extort you if you try to return defective products. I will not purchase anything from them again and would suggest you steer clear."
"Don‚Äôt ever buy this pos. The OS will randomly fail and give you a ‚Äúmissing or damaged OS‚Äù.Even once you obtain the,‚ÄùCHROMEBOOK RECOVERY TOOL‚Äù from another computer, it won‚Äôt work. It‚Äôll give an error message.Don‚Äôt waste your money."
Haven‚Äôt had it but a few months and the audio stopped working. Even with headphones it won‚Äôt work.
"I got this phone when it was 'on sale' for around 800$ (I forgot the exact amount but I payed 940 in total for a phone case as well. Not really a bad price compared to Samsung) I use this phone nearly everyday ranging from 6~8 hours of listening to content or doing something on here. The battery life is really good for what I do needing to charge it every now and then. The pictures that can be taken on this are pretty nice. I love the amount of details. look up YouTube videos on this phone. I don't use all of the features on this phone but I use most of them. As well as game just a bit.I've also got pretty small hands so the size and weight of the phone is a bit to big for me but the screen is really what I got it for when I'm outside. It's easy to use as well and simple. I wish there was more to the flash light because you can dim the light to a low level.I'll probably update this more as I use it but if you want a phone forever I'm keeping this.Update 6-29After using this phone more I've noticed some bugs/problems.If you're using developer mode I've noticed after a reboot it turns off certain things.One time the battery couldn't read its own percentage and the screen wasn't working (if this happens hold power and up volume for 10~20 seconds) but still phone shouldn't do this.People have said about this found that there's a problem with infinite loading, close out of the app.7-25I don't really know how to feel about this phone. It's buggy with certain apps, it crashes on its own installed apps. I enjoy some of the features of this phone but I'd actually want a phone I can use. I hope google keeps their word with the updates they're going to give. But giving it's google.Been having so much trouble just transferring files onto a USB stick. Errors after errors, at one point I sent 110 files through quickshare onto it and 90 of them were corrupted on the computer. It's a bit disappointing since these were photos. I had more of a better time individually dragging each file and making sure it transfers. I didn't have the patience for that. I'll do it again another time but here's your warning for if it happens to you. This phone is both smart and stupid at the same time. I dislike most AI models even Google's had some controversy in the past months for telling people to put glue in their pizza from a Reddit thread. You can text the AI it's good for small things like asking a questions. I don't know how smart you can get with them but always fact check. It's horrible with conversations, it's okay at first it shows interest like a person asking questions about what you're talking about then if you reply wrong it throws a monkey wrench and goes based on the new thing you typed.Typing... Everyone says typing is really good on here. Yes and no. Yes in the way that it's smarter because of some of the AI and the proof read. Voice typing can be amazing but it has it's problems that make me a bit frustrated. I hate when I'm doing it and it mishears me or it doesn't get what I say. You're still better off if you can type. But about 85% of the time it works right.I don't absolutely hate this phone I just have my slight annoyances with it. I love how fast it is and the camera is amazing (not the selfie camera.)8-25 update: with the Google pixel 9 out hearing that there's more problems and the AI is just so  stupid. It makes me hate how companies put AI into everything nowadays. This phone is great sometimes. Takes good pictures. Rarely gets slow but it does have its problems. I've had inconsistent camera issues, the battery isn't really the best. There's cheaper phones that have good cameras and upgradeable storage. I recommend looking for them."
"I really, really wanted to love this phone but honestly, having experienced both, Samsung does Android better than Google does which is pretty sad.I'm coming from an S20 so much of my review will be in comparison to that.Pros- Screen is very bright- Face unlock is very good- The glossy back is beautiful and not such a dramatic slip-hazard or fingerprint magnet as online video reviewers make it out to be.- That's it. Seriously.Cons (brace yourself)- Absolutely no idea how they managed this, but there is not even half the customisation ability as Samsung's version of Android and the stock Android experience is uglier and less logical than Samsung's version of it.I cannot express this enough, it's unbelievably irritating. Things you could change on a Samsung you're stuck with on the Pixel and many of these things look ugly or make things inconvenient. For example, want to quickly turn on/off mobile data? You can't with a easy button in the quick settings panel, you need now open a submenu called 'internet'. Want to change your quick settings tab colour to anything other than black? Too bad. Want to quickly switch your phone to vibrate? There's no quick setting for that either, it's a 3 step process now....You can't get rid of their mostly-useless 'at a glance' widget or even move it anywhere.- Entire UI on the default launcher is almost deliberately unintuitive and clunky. To change the brightness you have to swipe down twice, whereas it's right at the top with a single swipe on other phones. Just imagine the most logical place you'd expect something to work, and it'll be the exact opposite on this phone. e.g. do you want to clear all the recent apps? It won't be on a convenient button as soon as you press the recent apps navigation button, no, instead you have to swipe aaaaaaaall the way to the left through the 20 or 30 or so apps you may have opened and then the 'clear all' button will be at the end of the list. Seriously, has anyone who designed this launcher spent even 10 seconds thinking about any of these things before they implemented it???- The only option for a torch shortcut function is to double-tap the back of the phone.... it's exactly as reliable as you'd imagine - so absolutely terrible - the action you need to do leaves you teetering your phone in your hand so it's a huge drop risk and it actually responding to those taps only works 10% of the time at best so you just end up hitting your phone like a nutcase trying to get your torch to turn on. Samsung lets you double-press the power button - how much simpler and more logical is that?!- Battery doesn't have a charge limit feature like Samsung and other brands do. Instead it uses 'adaptive charging that forces your phone to charge suuuuuuper slowly when it thinks it's appropriate to e.g. in the evenings so that it's only fully charged by morning. Fine, except if you plan on topping up before you go out, you have to keep snoozing the function. If you happen to forget to snooze it, you'll come to grab your phone after an hour of sitting on charge and find it having gained only 5%.... brilliant, thanks Google... I would rather my phone charge super fast and stop at 90%. Give us the option at least. If I put my phone on charge I want it charged ASAP so it's ready to use when I need it. What's the point of rapid charging if it hardly uses it.- Basically the exact same dimensions as a Samsung S20 except for thickness and weight. Those differences are noticeable though as this thing feels like a brick in the hand. Feels very thick and very heavy whereas the S20 or even S20FE feels super sleek and light in comparison.- Despite the extra thickness and weight, the Pixel 8 is objectively worse spec'd and featured than many other flagships on the market, even some older phones. It doesn't even have a dual-SIM - I knew this before purchasing but it's standard on many flagships and laughably even mid-range phones have this so be aware of that if you intend to use this for work.- The screen has a nice subtle roundoff at the edges....that leads straight into a pointy raised metal lip of the chassis the whole way around. It feels sharp and unpleasant to swipe off the edge of the screen in any direction. It's already accumulating dust and I imagine it will get gross over time because it's nearly impossible to clean properly. It's such a large lip I can literally pull the phone along the table with my fingernail using just that edge.- The camera visor edges are also very sharp and can be uncomfortable depending on how you hold it, and when gaming. They are also easily scratched with how it sits on the very edge of the visor on the table.- The camera is missing a whole tonne of features qnd settings that again, are present on other phones. It doesn't even have an anti-flicker correction so videos with LED lighting in them will look like you're at a rave...The quality is also decidedly average, night mode is significantly worse than Samsung's and barely an improvement over regular mode. They have a night mode for video but software lock that to the Pixel 8 Pro just to make the 8 Pro more desireable. Why should 8 Standard owners get less features when it can handle the software just fine???- Thick bezels around the screen edges. Nothing major but most phones have managed near edge-to-edge screens 6 years ago... These bezels are actually slightly wider than my HTC One from a decade ago.- Doing intensive tasks or asking much of it will get it hot. It also freezes and becomes unresponsive while doing average things like browsing Chrome. It'll suddenly freeze for a solid 10 seconds for no reason.- Every time you enter your PIN you have to manually press ""Enter"". Coming from a Samsung you just typed your PIN and it unlocks instantly. This may not matter to most but it's a minor annoyance and adds seriously minimal additional security.- The alternative is the fingerprint sensor which flashes this large, insanely bright dot to illuminate your finger which if your finger is even slightly not covering the sensor will flash you with the power of 1000 suns which is the absolute worst at night. It's also not very reliable in the first place, the face ID is significantly better.- The only SMS app is Google's intrusive one which switched RCS on despite me specifically chosing not to.- Google's phone app is clunky and unintuitive. There's no way to make the default page the dialer instead of your contacts list.- Notifications in the main notification tab don't even use the whole screen real estate even when in landscape. The whole screen is filled with the tab background but the notification itself remains the same width as in portrait which ends up looking like a novice wrote the code for the UI.- Always-On homescreen minimises the huge clock numbers if you have notifications come in...or it's supposed to. This works about 50% of the time so you end up having to wake the phone to check for new notifications anyway.- No 'routines' function like Samsung has where it will automatically switch certain settings on based on a GPS perimeter e.g. arriving at work will put your phone on vibrate, switch the background and change other settings - don't expect that here, logically of course, the makers of Android give you LESS features in their flagship device running their own flagship software. Thank you, very cool.I'm sorry if this sounds like a rant or like I'm fanboying over Samsung. I seriously wanted to like this phone and was so excited for a flagship compact phone, but I'm going to tell it how it is, I don't care about the brand I care about a phone being worth the money we pay for it and this has been a thoroughly disappointing experience. It's like the software was designed by someone who's never used a smartphone in their life which is utterly baffling for the company that MAKES Android. This should be the epitome of the Android experience but that title goes squarely to Samsung.If you're a Samsung user I think you would have a very good chance of being disappointed if you upgrade to this. You are literally losing features and functionality for absolutely no reason. It's genuinely not any better than the A34 I use for work and that's half the cost. If you're an iPhone user, or someone who's a basic user that doesn't do anything other than browse Facebook, Chrome and make calls, you'll be fine. It's probably closer to an iPhone experience than it is to a version of Android from any of the other manufacturers.If I experience the shutdowns and freezing any more than I already am, I will be returning this because it's the topping ontop of a totally average phone.In summary the phone is average. It'll do its job and nothing more and it's definitely not worth the price. It doesn't hold a candle to the other flagships and Google's software-limiting of certain features to the Pro for no reason other than to split the product tiers is incredibly disappointing too. This is the first Pixel phone I've ever bought and without a doubt the last I will ever buy. A thouroughly rubbish experience.Considering the phone is physically subpar spec'd compared to the competition of compact phones like the Zenfone 10, Xiaomi 14, Sony 5V or even the now older Samsung S23 I would highly recommend looking at competitors' offerings before buying a Pixel 8. In fact I would just say buy a Samsung and enjoy your purchase. The Pixel 8 should be very last on your list."
"This post is about disappointment. Below, I will describe all the problems I faced in a month (a little more) of using the Google Pixel 8 PRO with 256 gigabytes.I'll try my best not to be bitter, but I'm not sure if I'll succeed because I expected something completely different from a $1050 phone.I bought the US version on Amazon. As a pre-order gift with the phone, they offered the Google Pixel Watch 2. In total, all this pleasure cost me $1050. I wasn't particularly interested in the watch and planned to sell them, thereby reducing the overall cost of the phone. In fact, currently on ""Black Friday,"" the phone on the official website costs $859. So, there was no gift in the form of the watch, and I paid for the phone + watch.I consider $350 for the Google Pixel Watch 2 an absurd price because there are many cool watches on the market cheaper.Let's start with the most important: Calls. In ""vibration"" mode, there is no audible notification in TWS headphones. The call volume in the headphones is tied to the ""ring volume"" in the ""sound and vibration"" section. Before switching to the Google Pixel 8 Pro, I always used the vibrate mode, and I could hear all incoming calls in the headphones. For people who talk a lot on the phone, this will be a very unpleasant moment. This problem extends to all non-Google TWS headsets. Next, take Pixel Buds Pro, connect them to the phone, and encounter the following problem: the audio notifications during incoming calls work only the first 3-4 times, then disappear. You need to disconnect the headset and reconnect it.The side buttons are not tactile.Weak processor. In synthetic tests, the processor delivers 1K. I consider this a very low indicator for a phone that positions itself as a flagship. Currently, it doesn't feel noticeable, but the fact remains. There are Chinese brands that have Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. There, the performance is approximately twice as much. If you are taking a phone for a long time, such a performance indicator is not great.Accessories. No charger and SIM ejector tool. SIM ejector tool, seriously. I opened the SIM card slot with a needle and a door frame catch. I just have no words, only emotions.Battery life. The phone is new and lasts for now. My Xiaomi, which I used for 3 years, held up about the same. If you look at reviews comparing battery life with other phones, it's all sad there.Charging time. My previous Xiaomi phone, bought in 2018, had a 38W charger. Besides being included in the package, it also charged faster.Raw operating system. Approximately 2-3 times a week, I reboot the phone. The notification shade doesn't come down, the button doesn't respond, black screen during incoming calls, and there are just tons of such bugs. To understand how tragic everything is, you need a month with this phone.Rattling. If you shake the phone, you can hear the optics (lens) hitting the phone's body. And this problem is not only on my phone. A friend has the same issue.Speaker sound. It's not bad, but on the iPhone, it's better. More midrange and low frequencies.Wi-Fi problems. Doesn't always want to connect to the access point. No matter what Wi-Fi standard it operates on or the authentication method on the access point. It might disconnect from the access point, might say the password is incorrect. A friend has the same issue. This problem was detected on Mikrotik access points.Well, there are a bunch of downsides, but now I can't remember them.Well, and I want to highlight a couple of positives so it's not all that tragic.Camera. Beautiful photos, very good in night mode. Magic erase is a cool thing. It doesn't always work 100%, but sometimes it really surprises with what AI can do.Conclusion: Before switching to the Google Pixel 8 Pro, I had the Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite 5G. I bought it for $260. For that money, I got an excellent phone that worked flawlessly for 3 years. MIUI shell, in my opinion, is much better than this Android on the Pixel.I'll probably sell the phone. Even if all the software problems are fixed, the impression of the phone is not very good anymore, and I don't want to use it."
"I've been using the Pixel 8 Pro as my primary phone for just over 1 year now, after previously using the Pixel 5 and Pixel 2. The Pixel 5 was amazing, so I am extremely disappointed by all the problems with the Pixel 8 and will consider switching to another brand for my next phone.The biggest problem is the Pixel 8 freezes and restarts randomly while using it. This happens seemingly at random times, sometimes not happening for 2 or 3 months, and other times happening every few days. I did not root the phone or do install anything outside of apps from the Google Play Store. I'm mainly a PC user so the only apps I use on my phone are Chrome, the Google news feed, a few messaging apps. I also have a few games installed like Genshin Impact, but I only open it on my phone rarely to make purchases for bonus Google Play points and I do all the gameplay on a PC. The freezes happen seeminlgy at random, including with Google maps and the built-in camera app that comes with the phone when I was trying to take a picture.The Pixel 8 also heats up a lot and burns through battery very quickly when actively using it, even though I disabled the full resolution and 120hz. When travelling and constantly using my phone to look things up, the battery couldn't even last a whole day from morning to night. The Pixel 5's batter was actually better and could last a whole day. With light use though, I can get 3 days of use before having to charge my phone - my Pixel 5 was the same when it was new, but after 3 years the battery could only hold about half as much charge since I had used it for gaming before switching to Android emulators on PC.The fingerprint scanner also doesn't work well in completely dark rooms, or right after picking it up after a few hours of inactivity. It seems like it always fails the first try or two. I registered my both my thumbs twice, which normally works fine throughout the day.I considered trying to upgrade to a Pixel 9 to see if it wouldn't have as many problems, but it would be a gamble as well and Google's trade-in only offered $200 for this $1000 phone 12 months after launch. Guess you don't get anything for brand loyalty lol.I'll probably stick with this phone for another year or two since when it's not freezing and I'm not using it heavily, it works well. However, I feel like all the problems are unacceptable considering its premium price point. I definitely do NOT recommend getting this phone at this price point - try your luck with the Pixel 9, or try another brand."
"The first 6 months of owning this phone, connecting to anything with bluetooth was a nightmare. They finally fixed it with a software update in June. But now the Internet connection (any wifi network or data in any location) will randomly go out for just my device and no one else. I have to turn off the connection for a minute to reset it and then connect again. It's 2024 and these should be basic features that just work. Yes it can be corrected fairly quickly but I really shouldn't have to deal with this whatsoever. I still love pixel phones, but would not recommend the 8 to anyone."
"After 6 months having this crap, I really wanted to dump it. it's not worth it. I regreted that not buying iPhone. This Pixel 8 pro keeps dropping mobile network, no matter how many time I restarted the phone. Bluetooth is acting up and down, on and off with my car. You can't just restart the damn phone 3-4 times a day. It is not designed like that. Not sure how Google can sell this phone to people. The most important thing about the phone is connecting to the network, not the CAMERA!!!"
"DIFFICULT TO LEARN HOW TO USE BECAUSE IT'S LESS INTUITIVE. STARTED DOING TUTORIALS TO UNDERSTAND IT. SMALLER SCREEN THAN PREVIOUS PHONE...NOT GOOD. SHOULD HAVE PURCHASED THE PIXEL 8 PRO. TAKES GREAT PHOTOS. DOES WEIRD THINGS WHEN YOU DON'T EXPECT IT TO...LIKE LISTENING TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND TYPING IT ON THE SCREEN. HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TURN OFF. HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET IT TO READ ARTICLES I SEARCHED FOR, UNLIKE MY OTHER PHONE THAT DID IT AUTOMATICALLY, ALTHOUGH IT DIDN'T READ LONG ARTICLES...BUT WOULD GIVE ME DEFINITIONS OF WORDS. FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE GOOGLE. CONFUSED BY GEMINI. HEAR IT'S BEING DISCONTINUED. I HAVEN'T FOUND IT USEFUL. NOT LIKE TALKING TO A REAL PERSON. I SHOULD HAVE PURCHASED THE PIXEL 8 PRO FOR THE LARGER SCREEN....THAT I'M USED TO. WHY PEOPLE LIKE SMALL SCREENS BEATS ME."
"I own a pixel 6 pro. The battery would no longer last a day so I decided to upgrade to the pixel 8 pro during prime day.ProsThe camera is improved, I have a 2-day battery life with my usage.ConsThe negatives with this phone have made me almost want to go back to my six pro. I can be using an app or on Chrome, and all the sudden I pressing on app buttons or on website links or scrolling quits working. I or will need to close and reopen the app to get a screen press to work again. This happens a couple times everyday. I also do not think the processor is any faster than the six pro.I bought this phone for improved battery life which I did get. But if I could do it all over again I would have bought a different phone due to the issue. It's very frustrating."
"The Pixel 8 Pro XL was not a bad phone, but I just upgraded to the Pixel 9 Pro, and it is so much better!!!I wanted the smaller 9 pro vs another XL which is just too large for my very small hands. Everything about the 9 is very nice.  I was able to get a substantial trade in on my Pixel 8 Pro. I highly recommend the Pixel 9 and the Pixel 9 Pro XL."
"Heads up that I am posting this review a fourth time after it was removed by Amazon.  This could mean that the seller is attempting to remove bad reviews of this phone, but I cannot be sure.  Here is the email I received:""Thank you for submitting a review of Google Pixel 8 Pro - Unlocked Android Smartphone with Telephoto Lens and Super Actua Display - 24-Hour Battery - Bay - 512 GB; we are sorry you did not have a positive experience. We investigated your concerns about product authenticity, and the information we have indicates that the product you received was authentic. As a result, we removed the review you submitted. This ensures that customer reviews remain as accurate as possible for the benefit of future customers.""The color range and depth of the Pixel 8 Pro is remarkably bad.  I have seen better screens on $200 phones, and I'm not making knee-jerk exaggerations about it.  I really want to love this phone, and I do love most other aspects of it.  But for some reason, Google decided to put a screen on it that's so bad, I wouldn't trust that I'm taking good photos until I saw them on another phone or a computer display.I understand that this is a bold claim, so let me prove what I'm saying in photos.  In each photo, the Pixel 8 Pro is on the left, and a OnePlus 7t is on the right, both at 100% brightness.  The photos were taken with a OnePlus 8t.  Keep in mind that these are photos of screens, and cameras aren't fully representative of what we see.  Additionally, screens emit some light that gets picked up by cameras that we cannot see, and you (the reader) are looking at these photos through yet another screen.  Regardless, I believe that these photos do a satisfactory job of displaying the the poor color range of the 8 Pro.I included three photos of a website displaying pure primary colors (red, green, and blue), and included one more photo of an image that displays a range of colors.  Both of these phones use OLED displays, so the ""red"" areas contain pixels where only the red subpixels are at 100% brightness, while the blue and green subpixels are fully off, for example.  I verified this on both devices firsthand with a jeweler's loupe, just to be sure.  Primary colors are supposed to be ""pure"" colors, meaning that the ""red"" photo is the phone attempting to produce the most ""red"" color it can, for example.I really don't need to explain much more, since the photos deliver some pretty solid justice.  Notice that the red especially looks like tomato paste on the Pixel 8 Pro while they look like ""pure red"" on the 7t.  And the blues and greens of a ""good"" OLED screen almost look ""fake"" from so much color, but again, this is with the primary subpixels of their respective color on full brightness, so the ""redder"" the red is, the better the color depth of the red is.  Additionally, dark colors on the 8 Pro are much too bright and washed out.Needless to say, it's lousy.  What was Google thinking?  I am so disappointed in the screen, that I'm returning the phone on this basis alone.  I am distracted by the screen quality anytime I use the phone for any occasion.  Returning to my 7t feels like a breath of fresh air.  This screen simply should not be sold on a ~$1k device."
"I bought this as a gift, so it's been somewhat stressful first day.It does feel and look good. UI very responsive.It took forever to sync from old phone. Installing and setting up old apps took forever.My migration from a Nokia 8 Sirocco (Android One), to Xiaomi 11T Pro a couple of years ago was FAR faster and smoother.I wanted pure android and a good Android One phone is nonexistent anymore.From unboxing and first power on it was advising there was dirt or moisture in the USB port.The camera is good, but does not seem to save every snap. Would take several pictures and some did not seem to save.The finger print reader almost always requires a second attempt to unlock. Using a pin requires hitting enter to submit. Previous phones never required this extra input.The most concerning point - It would not charge over night. I woke at 4am to find the phone had not progressed past 10%. Had to power off device to initiate charging and then power back on. Once rebooted it would detect the power cable being connected / disconnected a couple times and start charging. This was after a system update was performed. I'll try disable adaptive charging if it happens again. If this persists it may need to be returned.Battery only really lasts a day, I'd expect closer to two, if not more like my 11T.We'll see how day 2 goes ... Started the day with a message saying the phone was 0 days old and required a security update.So far not overly impressed, especially with this being a Google product.Follow up review:After a week it has grown on the person I have bought it for. Intuitive UI and easy to use.The biggest failing point is the battery and really slow charging. Struggles to last a full day. Coming from a near 4-5 year old phone that still allows you to skip a day and charges significantly faster.The person does not like charging over night and has still not gotten used to it. These big brand ""premium"" phones need to adopt 90 or 120W charging. It's pure and utter freedom and peace of mind. Zero stress life. But then they'd need to package an included charging brick ...Tl;Dr - would not buy product line again unless much faster charging technology adopted."
"I don't care if the tech specs claim the Pixel 8 is superior to the Pixel 5.  I'm not seeing it.Having had it for less than 24 hours, I'm shocked at how not-better it is than my Pixel 5.  It seems like the same exact phone.  Only worse.I can already say the camera is not better.  I take a ton of pictures for eBay listings.  The old Pixel 5 didn't have great close-up (macro) range on its lens, but it focused quickly and took great photos.  The Pixel 8 struggles to focus, is slower, and produces way more out-of-focus pictures.  The megapixel claims are ridiculously false.  The sensor may have that many pixels, but that absolutely does NOT result in a higher-resolution photo.  It may make it more sensitive in low light.  Quality is not better.Nor is the crappy on-screen fingerprint unlock.  The old sensor on the back of the Pixel 5 was significantly more sensitive, fast, and reliable.  Most of the time the delayed response on the Pixel 8 results in having to enter my PIN instead.  Terrible design, and for me that is already a huge negative.I enabled the facial recognition to unlock the phone.  That works a little bit better, provided I don't have my glasses on.  But that is just another way they are taking personal information and doing ??? with it.  Also, not that I am a criminal or anything, but having facial recognition allows the authorities to access your devices without your permission, just by holding it up to your face.  Not cool.My Pixel 5 was four years old, and the battery life wasn't what it once was.  It was time to get a new phone.  So far I'm not super happy with the Pixel 8.  Glad I bought it on sale and didn't spend much.  Probably should have just found a super cheap Pixel 5."
"Pixel 8 pro, flagship, top phone, best of there best and Google has chosen to omit message reminders from this phone. I had spent a lot of time trying to find this feature through the vast amount of settings options. 3 support chat attempts, one request for a phone call which I didn't receive. Last chat person confirmed what I suspected, some morons omitted this feature. This is cell phone basics. So if you miss a call or text you won't know it until you pick up your phone and have a look. And take a good look. The dots on the app icons are small showing you there is a call-text for you.  To me this is a big deal since I don't care to have a phone on my body at all times. With this basic mode being ommited I have to wonder what other ilogical choices have these developers made. I do like that the phone can be set to flash when receiving the initial call or text, but that's all you get. Phone functions fine otherwise. Can't say I was blown away. Coming from an old, outdated, Samsung 8 active. I had no issues with Samsung just thought I would give this a try. The camera on this phone is wildly over rated. It's good but with all the hype I was expecting to say wow. In fact I said that's it. My old phone must have been leap years ahead of its time.  Battery life is fine for me. Pandora will run on my phone most days all day. No a huge battery drain there but it's not better than my old dated phone. And I decided to replace that phone because the battery is showing the signs of its age. If this is on par with my old phone now, what will this phone be like I in 5-6 years... I knew I would not be crazy about the camera lens bump and ya I am not, at all. I went with this phone for the photo editing. Reviews put it a bit more user friendly than s24. Again not impressed. And since I was directed by this phone to a 3rd party app, what's the point. Finger print reader is nothing more than annoying once a screen protector goes on. Really like the speed at which the phone powers up. Charges fast with a faster charging block. Had to buy that since it doesn't come with a charging block. Not a big deal to me. Everyone should have charges around by now. Not a fan of the key board. No long press for a dual purpose letter. Such as letter sharing a symbol of you press and hold to get the symbol. So many setting I don't know what a lot of it is for. That maybe the norm these days. Long story short, good chance I will send this back. I am completely hung up on how dumb are the developers to get ride of message reminders, which I guess Google calls Nudges, and concerned about long term battery life."
I like the phone and the ease of use.Battery still kinda sucks on this one but not as bad as the 6  pixel proA lot of the google features don't actually turn off when you tell it to.There's a bug that silences incoming callsI've turned off all the settings that would silence calls but still no luck
"use within one year occur the problem like the photob(white line cross from  top to bottom) ,google didn't respond to my request of repair cause i live in the place without dealer ."
"I admittedly didn't do much research before buying this phone, but I've been quite disappointed.  I previously had a Moto X4 with Android 9 but wanted a phone with esim capability for a trip I was taking.  I've been using this phone for about 2 weeks now and the only two new features I've found helpful are the esim capability and when receiving a call being able to send it to an automated assistant (I haven't actually had a use for it yet, but it does seem like it could be really handy to find out what a call is about while occupied in a meeting).  Everything else has pretty much been a disappointment.When setting up the phone it was supposed to be copying my settings from my previous phone.  I'm not sure what copied, but it didn't copy many useful settings, it didn't copy any apps,After setting up the apps I typically use, they didn't work as well on this phone as they did on the 5 year old Moto X4.  When I open Google Maps, it won't let me type in to search for something.  It has a voice option, but never opens a keyboard.  When I receive email messages they often show up as separate notifications for 1 email message each instead of showing one notification that there are 3 new email messages (all the email messages are received in the same account).  When playing music in my car with a bluetooth connection, the old Moto X4 would display the song title, artist, etc on the car display; the new phone plays music, but apparently doesn't support sending that additional information.In addition, the defaults for the phone seem to be trying to imitate an iPhone which I find obnoxious.  If I wanted an iPhone interface I would have bought one of those.  I also found it very disappointing there is no headphone jack or slot for an additional memory card.So overall I've been very disappointed with this phone and would not recommend it.  I'll likely go back to my Moto X4 and see if I can get a few more years out of it."
"I'm not a fanboy of any particular brand and have had many over the last 15 years. However, Pixel is definitely a disappointment, even after coming from a 2018 Samsung device.The good is limited to the hardware advancements after a 6 year jump in tech for me:The camera is great, not even worth comparing to my previous one.The fingerprint sensor is far more responsive (That was noted as a common complaint but no issues here)This version of Android is lighter, not loaded down with weird Samsung apps that can't be removed.The bad consists of the features I most frequently used or relied on before:Chat bubbles are a mess and seem to lack the seamless flow I am used to.The blinking LED indicators for power and notifications I relied on for so many years are non-existent.Closing out of all apps at once is a chore, requiring the user to scroll across everything open.Just getting to Settings or simply adjusting ring/notification volume is a multi-step task.The vibration (Even at max) is so weak I don't even notice it.In short, this phone lacks what I want most from a device and doesn't have enough advancements to even out the losses."
"Bought this phone 10 months ago. Now my screen starts flickering green then goes black. Apparently it's a known issue and had to send it back for RMA. Other than that the phone is ok, nothing crazy in terms of performance. Pictures are quite beautiful."
"I've had this phone for 11 months now, and I can finally say that I truly hate it. I tend to hold onto a phone for 5 years, coming to the Pixel 8 Pro from a Galaxy S9+. I'll be switching to an iPone as soon as possible.The first major issue I had was upon opening it and starting it up. It took hours, and nothing happened.  None of my apps transferred, nothing was downloaded, it was a mess. It two 3 calls with their online support to find that there was some sort of Google Play Store bug that locked me out of being able to install apps. After a few days of not being able to use the phone I was finally reinstalling apps one by one. The gesture controls are truly terrible. The button use for pulling up the assistant is annoying as hell, and now after a November 2024 update, I have an extremely annoying haptic response on touching the screen that can't be turned off. This has been the worst phone I've in decades."
"I bought this phone and thought long and hard about keeping it.  I shouldn't have.  In the short time I've had it the battery has started running down in a day.  Sometimes it doesn't charge.  The heat is terrible, I can feel the heat really hot in my hand, and I have to let it cool down before I can use it or recharge.  I'm so disappointed because I paid for something that doesn't deliver.  I'm probably going to be forced to buy a replacement, but it won't be this kind. Not sure how it can last long with the heat. I'm like so many people who can't afford to keep spending money on an inferior product."
"So I had a Google Pixel 4 and now just got the 8....well I don't see any improvements!! I had issues with it being slow and I thought audio and video was mediocre. Now I have an 8 and still feel the camera, speakers etc are not better. I had to take upgrade only because some of my apps stopped working.  Not impressed for the money spent and upgrade from 4 to 8."
"I had a 4 year old Moto G7.  It worked great, up until about a year ago.When I needed updates, the phone would act unpredictably.  For example, it gave a 6 mile route recommendation on Google maps for a 1-mile straight line route with no traffic, construction, or other obstacles.Then about 6 months ago, even when fully updated, it would bog down or respond oddly all the time.Google maps would almost always send me on long routes, like it had lost all ability to calculate route distance for determining fastest route.  Other apps were malfunctioning too.I use very few apps.  Virus checks came up with nothing.It seemed to be more obsolete and unusable with every update.So, I replaced it, with this one.The Pixel works fine.  When you are in range of good cell signal.If you're the least bit off the grid, this phone is almost worthless.  Where I used to be able to call text, and occasionally get internet with my old phone.  Now, when I'm out of town, I can go all day without being able to make a call or get a text with this phone.  And, forget about internet.I do like the biometric fingerprint sensor on the front.Yeah, otherwise, it's just another phone."
"Actual customer/user here. Google phones' hardwear was always junk. I used pixel 1, pixel 5 for years and had google replace them several times for power issues several times, as i recall. recently, i bought pixel 8 from google store and pixel * pro from amazon. Both have the same problem, they are impossible to  use as phones, at least on t-mobile service. the sound will drop off on your end or for the other end of the call. whats up voice calls work fine. google replaced pixel 8 once already, went over with google and T-mobile customer service, tried eSIM, new physical SIM. No use."
"Replaced my dead Pixel 6 with this incredibly disappointing overpriced ""upgrade"" that is actually a downgrade.Basically they removed basic features that Pixel Users relly on such as the headphone jack and the power button....well there is a power button, but instead of default turning on and off the phone it activates Google's handy dandy privacy violating wiretap device, Google Assistant.Also switching between apps is incredibly frustrating, as well as returning to a previous page because the swiping doesn't register half the time.After hours of searching the web and messing around with menues (mostly hidden or buried) I was able to get the power button back as well as the proper menu to navigate apps. Phones this expensive should be convenient, not waiting hours of my time so I can get it to function properly and turn off their privacy invading features (you want my data, you gotta buy it from me, not charge me to steal it away).And no headphones or mic jack? The standard that made folks even consider buying a Pixel over an iPhone.I mean I hate apple too, but why would I spend more money on a phone that has the same crappy stuff everyone who avoids iPhones hates.And yeah, I know you can get a headphones to work with an adapter, making the phone no longer fit in your pocket and an easily breakable add on that you have to pay separately (even though they increased the price of the phone).The second you start requiring add on adaptors for a smartphone your business model has instantly become stupid and worthless. It's no longer a smartphone if you have to carry a case of accessories just to use it the same as the phone you had a year before without all that add on crap that is just more to break, get lost and pretty much stops the mobile phone from being mobileA mix of greed and stupidity really caused Google to screw the pooch on this one. Don't they ever do user testings or consider user experience?Planning on returning this garbage as soon as I can and get a real phone."
"It pains me to criticize what is probably a very good phone, but I've pretty much reached my limit with products that are sold with absolutely no regard for the consumer.This cell phone is boxed with no charging cable (only a data transfer cable) and no Instruction or User manual.  To shell out $1,000 for a phone that you cannot charge or find out how to use without purchasing additional items or going on YouTube to watch a video is near criminal, in my opinion.  There is not even a diagram that shows where the power on/off button is located, where to insert the SIM card, where the volume control button is, etc.  I'm sure the phone has a lot of wonderful features, but good luck guessing as to what they are, or how to take advantage of them, without any type of insert or manual to read.I've gone through this problem before, and it seems that the more expensive the item is, such as a computer or television, the less assistance is provided at the time of purchase in terms of its usage and functionality.  Enough is enough!  To not even include a wall adapter to charge the phone is the height of ridiculousness and absolute cheapness on Google's part.  You just spend $1,000 and their response is to thumb your nose at you, with the gall and assumption that you can just figure everything out on your own.  Google touts all these wonderful features such as a Telephoto Lens and a Super Actual Display (whatever the heck that means), in addition to Artificial Intelligence and then leaves you high and dry as to how to use those features.  Granted, most people can probably figure a lot of it out on their own, but this smartphone is considered by critics to be among the Top 3 phones of the year, which means it has stats and capabilities that far exceed the typical throwaway burner phone.So, help us out a little, will you?  I just spent $1,000.  Why did I spend this much money, to just throw a product at me and then ask me to just figure everything out on my own, or do the work that you should have done for me?  Shame on you, Google!"
"Bad fingerprint reader (a widly known issue). Clunky UX, all around. My base level anxiety is up all the time because of how badly executed this device is, where even the most simple interactions are fumbled. It's constantly irritating, just like having a rock in your shoe, or a hangnail. The only reason I'm sticking with this is because I hate iPhones even more, and LG stopped making their flagship G series phones so long ago that they're too outdated. This model is so half-baked it's not even funny. Do more research and find something else, and then give that other one a shot."
It's an upgrade over the old phone I had. More tech and bells and whistles which is good in a way but in others not so much. Thought I'd give google a try. Don't like that it transcribes everything that's said and is very annoying when your texting and your text also includes what's being said around you.  Don't have a person to provide answers on how to stop this.No customer service.  Found out on my own to turn the microphone off whenever I need to text. Then in the middle of  texting I get a phone call and have to turn the microphone back on. Hate to know Big Brother is listening.  I'll definitely go back to Samsung in the future.
"The camera is ok, but the screen is terrible. I changed it twice because a black dots appear after a few time. The pure android really uncomfortable for use. To charge the phone for 100% takes 24 hours, I don't know why. The Google support is terrible."
I don't know if I'm just used to Samsung or what but this phone sucks. The battery life is 6 hours tops. (NOT great for traveling!) It's practically impossible to intentionally see all open tabs at once. I just have to keep trying until I accidentally perform whatever magical operation makes it work. I will say the facial recognition unlock is stupid fast and easy. The fingerprint reader does not work in the dark though.I came from a Z Fold 4 that may or may not be repaired. I was told the camera on this phone was exceptional but I have not experienced that yet.  I think I'm going to return this and go back to my old Note 9 until I can afford a Samsung again.
"Global Connectivity Hurdles: A Formal Review of Google Pixel 8's 5G LimitationsAs an IT engineer, my profession not only demands but relies on the bleeding edge of technology, particularly in terms of connectivity and mobile computing. Recently, I embarked on a business trip across Asia, with scheduled meetings in Japan, Hong Kong, and Thailand, carrying what I believed was one of the most sophisticated tools in mobile technology‚Äîthe Google Pixel 8. However, my experience highlighted a critical and disappointing oversight by Google: a software lock on 5G connectivity, an unexpected flaw for a company at the helm of Android development.Upon arrival in Japan, a country known for its cutting-edge mobile networks, I was surprised to find my device restricted to 4G services. Assuming a temporary issue, I proceeded with my tasks, only to encounter the same limitation in Hong Kong and subsequently in Thailand. Each location, despite having robust 5G infrastructure, was a reminder of my device's unexpected shortcoming.Determined to find a solution, I reached out to Google support, only to learn that this was not a malfunction but a deliberate design decision‚Äîa software lock preventing access to 5G networks in certain regions, regardless of local network capabilities or user needs. This restriction is particularly perplexing and frustrating given Google‚Äôs role as a leading developer of the Android platform, which is supposed to champion accessibility and user-centric features.This limitation not only hampered my ability to work efficiently‚Äîrelying on slower data speeds in bustling metropolitan areas‚Äîbut also reflected poorly on Google‚Äôs commitment to serving its customers, particularly professionals who depend on seamless global connectivity. As a first-party developer, Google has the responsibility to ensure that its devices are not just competitive in terms of hardware but are also free of unnecessary software restrictions that can cripple functionality.In this instance, the Google Pixel 8, although impressive in many aspects, falls short in a fundamental area that directly impacts professionals in IT and software engineering. The inability to access 5G networks due to a software lock is not a trivial matter but a significant oversight that undermines the utility of a device marketed as a tool for developers and engineers. This experience serves as a stark reminder that even the most reputable technology companies can make decisions that profoundly affect user experience and not always for the better.Go buy an IPhone, don't be stupid."
"I bought this thinking this would be a great purchase for the next years. I was super happy with my previous smart phone (OnePlus 5) and don't feel this Pixel will come as close to the performance i had with the previous one.Cons- Battery lasts day and a half, so that will only decrease. Dont think it will be able to live the 7 year service promised by google.- You can't customise the default launcher- Chunkier than expected. The phone does not have a weigh balance, camara side is way heavier and that makes holding the phone (i.e. video watching) a pain, since your index fingers will hold more weight than your palm/thumb.- Back button does not work properly at times, specially when the phone is lying horizontally- You cant mirror a picture with the default apps.Pros:- Good camara- 7 Year service/update promiseOverall, i would not buy this phone again nor recommend for the price."
"The Google Pixel 8 is a solid very very well built and very good looking device. My issue came with the tuning of the software. I lost track of how many times I'd go to open my YouTube app and it would freeze stop stutter just not open. Now this is a device where Google designed the phone designed the SOC designed the software and made the YouTube app and their own app wouldn't function properly on the phone. Other apps suffered similarly. My point? At this stage 8th in the series no less, the jittery stumbling hiccuping software is just too much for me to put up with I mean it's great that they are doing a better job with bug fixes and updates but for a brand new phone it's performance out of the box was just not at an acceptable level. I'm sorry, but that's lame and they need to do better. How can you control every aspect of a phone's production and still produce a product whose software isn't fully baked and tuned to perfection?"
The older version was easier to use.  Dislike having to tell it to turn off instead of just pressing the button to turn off.
"Phone functions well, camera is terrific and the updates are nice. However, the screen flickers quite often while watching videos and playing games. The battery life is awful, there is no fast charging and I am usually down to less than 10% before the end of the day."
"I like the case a lot, but the screen protector interferes with the touch screen sometimes. I'll have to tap multiple times or press really hard just to get the signal through to the phone."
I haven't tried the face recognition so can't rate it but the fingerprint reader works poorly.  Previous phones came with user manuals but this one has no instructions at all.  Very poor decision there as different phones work differently.  Phone's camera seems to work well from what little I've used it and the battery life is excellent.
"It's ok. Took absolutely forever to transfer everything from my pixel 7 to this 8 pro. Literal hours. That's the biggest annoyance with h android ( life long iPhone user before this) updates take forever and so does transfers even pixel to pixel. And the settings say 60-120hz. Not 1-120hz like advertised. Also I went to use the photo editor features this photo was advertised with and it says ""some editing tools need to o be installed. Connect to WiFi to start installing"" so I had to wait hours before even being able to use the few features of the 8 series.Overall just a very second class experience coming from an iPhone in my opinion. Google just gives half effort again and again. Finger print reader is also hit or miss as well.-STILL GETS REALLY HOT-FINGERPRINT READER IS HIT OR MISS-FACE UNLOCK DOSNT WORK IN ANY LOW LIGHT SITUATIONNOT WORTH THE FULL MSRP NOT EVEN CLOSEWAIT FOR THIS  TO GO ON SALE BEFORE BUYING. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS PHONE."
This handset feels very good in the hand and is easy to use single handed most of the time.  The features could put the phone a leg up on all of the phones but for some reason they decided to be self limiting.... For instance the Tap Back feature is cool but Apple just gave you my iPhone 13 this feature w a 2 tap and 3 tap option.... Voice response to Hey Google or Ok Google is inconsistent. And it just feels like it isn't ready to go to work for me right out of the box.  Downloads inside the camera app to get that cool advertised features.  Charging... Why??!!  Why be so self limiting to make this the slowest charging phone I've ever had in the past 2 years.  It's a brand new model and slow As... Terrible.  Please Pixel please get up off the couch and get these tweaks fixed... Boom you'd blow out all others
"Viaje a Estados Unidos en octubre, aprovechando el viaje, quer√≠a comprar un Pixel 7 Pro. Me encontr√© con la oferta de lanzamiento del Pixel 8 Pro y el Pixel watch 2, al volver a mi Pa√≠s, note que mi tel√©fono no conectaba a la Red 5G, consulte con el operador y este me dijo que  el Pixel 8 Pro es compatible con los servicios 5G de la red. Al consultar en la p√°gina de Google, confirme que, efectivamente, el tel√©fono es compatible, pero es Google, quien decide inhabilitar esta tecnolog√≠a (Por la cual pague), en pa√≠ses donde el tel√©fono no tiene venta oficial. Lo que es peor, vienen con esta pr√°ctica desde el Pixel 4 5G. Un mal chiste. Hubiese devuelto el tel√©fono de inmediato de haber contado con la informaci√≥n. Amazon deber√≠a activamente advertir a los compradores viajeros para minimizar las malas experiencias.En cuanto al Pixel Watch 2 y sus funciones de salud no son nada versus a las de samsung y su Galaxy Watch, Google te cobra por todo, incluso limita el uso de las funciones del reloj en otros pa√≠ses.Traducido con bardI traveled to the United States in October, and I wanted to take advantage of the trip to buy a Pixel 7 Pro. I found the launch offer for the Pixel 8 Pro and the Pixel Watch 2. When I returned to my country, I noticed that my phone could not connect to the 5G network. I consulted with my carrier, and they told me that the Pixel 8 Pro is compatible with the carrier's 5G services. When I consulted Google's website, I confirmed that the phone is indeed compatible, but Google decides to disable this technology (for which I paid) in countries where the phone is not officially sold. What's worse, they have been doing this since the Pixel 4 5G. It's a bad joke. I would have returned the phone immediately if I had had the information. Amazon should actively warn traveling buyers to minimize bad experiences.As for the Pixel Watch 2 and its health features, they are nothing compared to Samsung's Galaxy Watch. Google charges you for everything, even limiting the use of the watch's features in other countries."
"The camera is great on this phone, but otherwise it feels like having an iPhone. If you want android, you probably want the versatility it offers as opposed to the iPhone. The Pixel has great photos, but not the versatility that Android should have."
I've owned about 12 different cell phones over the years ranging from cheap $50 phones to the more expensive latest iphones and this pixel 8. This phone is by far the most delicate of any phone I've ever owned. As I was setting it down on the table it fell out of my hands and dropped a distance of no more than 2 feet. This was enough for the back of the phone to crack. The screen cracked the next day even though nothing else happened to the phone. Google's warranty does not cover any damage to the back or the screen. It will cost a couple hundred dollars to replace the screen. I have decided it isn't worth spending another $200 to fix the screen on a phone that is so delicate it will likely just break again. And I don't want to have to keep it in some kind of protective case all the time so I'm just going to get a different phone. I've dropped iphones and cheap $50 samsung phones many times from much higher distances without the screens cracking.
"Some decent features, the camera is generally good but lacks some really basic features like being able to take a picture while videoing. Also the camera tech overexposed backgrounds sometimes. The Bluetooth doesn't connect to my car. I'd go for the s24 which my wife has and it just seems better all round."
"Battery life:The Pixel 8 Pro's battery life is the most inconsistent variable in the phone. I got 5 hours of SOT that landed me on 68 percent, but the next day it was 2 hours of SOT with 47 percent by the end of the day. The phone while being used has great battery life, but the idle consumption with 5G on kills the phone super fast. Yes this is the reason why its only three stars.fingerprint reader:The fingerprint reader is great on this phone, and it has a night-and-day difference after coming from the Pixel 6, but the screen protector that I got made it very inconsistent. (not the phone's fault)Value for money:The Pixel 8 pro features are gimmicks that don't justify the price difference from the normal Pixel 8 so go for the normal 8 and save some money."
"This phone will not pair with any of my devices, including my car. The microphone does not work at all. I'm returning it for these reasons. I sure wish the phone would have worked correctly, I liked the phone because it's big and the speaker has the best volume of any phone I've ever owned. Too bad it has some problems with pairing and the microphone"
"This phone is a beauty, great build quality, great screen, great sound quality. Super duper easy setup from my old phone. I did not use the camera much although that is why I bought it.I expected to have an adjustment period with the phone, getting used to this one after using Samsung and Sony phones, but this one was so, so annoying and the OS is very invasive. I expected this as Google exists to suction all of your personal information. But I believed the assurances that I could stop the vacuuming and adjust the permissions. I adjusted the permissions but felt harassed by the constant request for permissions anyway. Every Google app wanted location, access to all photos, all files, and the entire contact list. No.I returned the phone. Thank you, Amazon! I am going to get the Samsung S24."
"The default software on this phone is like malware, or maybe more aptly described as digital cockroaches (my apologies to actual insects). The folks at google want you to do the stuff that they want you to do, the way they they want you to do it. For example, the power button to turn off the phone defaults after update to activating google voice assistant, even if you have gone through two or three submenus to disable it. That is because you have to deselect that as an option in the another sub menu that assigns gestures to buttons, and defaults to using Google Voice. Multiple unintuitive menus predominate user 'experience'. Essentially the OS seems to be spyware designed to get your habits and data onto their servers. You'd think that updates might improve it, but they are not interested in giving you control over this device, and each update changes the menu. Beyond frustrating. Never again. There are reasons why Google phones are cheaper than Apple or Samsung, and none of those reasons are good ones for users."
Screen always black even when I I reset the phone
"While it has a lot of value for the price, it doesn't mirror to the TV without wifi. It is actually impossible to mirror to the TV in a hotel room. This is something that my Samsung phone does with ease with Smartview. There are rumors of a HDMI cable but that was short-lived in a beta firmware release. This is a huge disappointment for me as I otherwise like the phone. I ended up returning it."
"I ended up returning this phone because it kept constantly restarting everyday five to eight times per day without me prompting it to do so. Also, the OS was glitchy when flipping between multiple pages on a browser and would occasionally just freeze up for 20 to 30 seconds as it processed. I really thought the larger RAM and new tech would be worth the purchase but I found myself wishing I bought the pixel 7 or 6 instead. Best way it redeems itself is in the extended update guarantee of 7 years. We'll see if Google updates in the future fix any of these problems."
"Ships with Android 14, not Android 13.  Android 14 will not install old apps but will run them.  So migration of old apps fails.  Android 13 would migrate old apps, then if install Android 14 after migrating old phone to new phone, old apps will be installed and working."
"Things I like:-$800 good price-7 years of support-fantastic camera system-great battery life-speakers sound goodThings I dont like-no sd card slot-audio source switcher nonexistant-cant customize navigation buttons-changing the brightness is a hassle-gallery app is mega garbage; cant sort or group photos, cant nest folders, cant change cover photo of album, cant change size of thumbnails, cant sort by media type-phone is making random calls without input and playing audio in the bg with no apps openI've come from using Samsungs for nearly the past decade and decided to switch it up since Im not really fond of what Samsung is doing with their latest phones. The stock Android experience is just awful, and feels like an iPhone with how pittle customization and control you have. Now I can hear you through the screen saying ,""just root your phone and do what you want."" No, I should not have to go through hoops to have features that I have become accustomed to. It feels like Google put way too much time and effort into the AI features that I am not reaply going to ever use and forgot all about the things that make a phone pleasant to use. We as a society have severely reduced our expectations and accepted that ""things just are"", but I promise you that they aren't, and we can vote with our wallets to make a substantial difference."
"I really wanted to love this phone, but I cannot recommend it based on my poor experience. I don't know if I received a defective example or if there is a bigger quality issue. When I received my phone I proceeded with the usual setup and data transfer from my old Samsung. All the apps moved over without a hitch, but the transfer failed on moving over my pictures. There was nothing that worked, not even a hard reset would make it happen. I did not want to download apps to do it so the option was to download my pictures to Google drive and then to the phone. The issue is, Google only gives you so much space for free before you have to pay and mine was filling up fast, to the point that now Google was asking me to pay for more storage. Not good, and I am wondering if this is a ploy to make more money... Other problems continued to happen as well. The screen rotate function would not work even though the functions were turned on. The screen lock wake up to touch would not work even when the function was turned on. The camera app would be slow to engage to take a photo, literally 3-5 second delay before you could take a photo. Sometimes the camera app would open, but then close for no apparent reason. Google maps would stop responding when a route selected, literally no response to touch whatsoever. A hard reset would fix one or the other issue, but not all. Another hard reset would again fix one issue, but not the other. I contacted Google support, but all they could offer is another hard reset or a replacement under warranty, but they could not guarantee if the phone would be brand new or refurbished. I decided to return my Pro 8 and have no choice but try my luck with another device. Wanted to love my Pro 8, but it left me disappointed."
"I have had ongoing connectivity issues,not resolved yet with updates. I hope it will eventually be resolved. I would not have bought this phone if I knew of its issues.The battery does not last long either, unfortunately. I find myself charging it at least once per day."
The screen has a curve around the edges that makes it hard to keep a screen protector on without bubbles.  There are times when it does not respond when I'm trying to reply to a message or when opening an email.  I have to restart the phone in order to correct this issue.  I like that there will be 7 years of updates on this phone.  I just hope it lasts that long.
"Phone has a bright screen, great camera and is very responsive. But it has artificial intelligence and they should capitalize the word artificial because the phone's constantly trying to get ahead of you. And you have a lot of pop-up ads and stuff happening that you really don't need. For instance, the microphone doesn't turn off when you quit talking so anything in the background gets recorded. It just really actually takes some getting used to. This is not your your Grandad's Android. This is an Android on steroids. I'm going to give it some time."
I've been trying to reach someone but my phone service keeps telling me my phone is not unlocked and not compatible to use it
"Not sure if I got a defective phone or notMy phone has been over heating since day one and now it's starting to freeze continuously.I've upgraded from a Flip 5G and it's like night and day.The battery life is amazing, I can get a solid 18 hrs with constant use ( total upgrade from the 7 hours I would get from my Flip5G)The camera is amazing, comparable to the new iPhone 15 pro or Samsung.I've seen other say you get free GoogleOne for 6 months but I did not receive that offer.Finger print does well, if your screen is wet or your finger is damn then it won't read itMy only concern is the fact that it's over heating and freezing"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            My experience with the Pixel 8 has been a complete nightmare. Despite the Pixel series' reputation, this phone turned out to be one to avoid at all costs.The first issue was a factory defect in the screen: an annoying purple line that completely ruined the visual experience. This problem, which wasn't caused by any impact, surfaced just two months after purchase, rendering the phone practically useless.Battery life is another sore point. Despite expecting a device of this caliber to keep up with daily needs, the reality was disappointing. The battery drained quickly, even with moderate use, requiring constant recharging throughout the day.The only redeeming quality of the Pixel 8 is its camera, but honestly, what's the point of having an excellent camera if the rest of the phone is a disaster? The camera's quality doesn't outweigh the fundamental issues with this model.To make matters worse, the post-sales customer service from both Amazon and Google has been abysmal. It's as if you need a manual on how to navigate Google's website to find the exact section that connects you with the warranty department. This frustrating process only adds to the overall disappointment.In summary, my experience with the Pixel 8 has been a real letdown. I cannot recommend this phone to anyone, as factory issues, poor battery life, slow performance, and terrible customer service make it a misguided investment. Not even Google's reputation or purchasing through Amazon can salvage this disastrous device. Avoid the Pixel 8 at all costs."
"I loved my Pixel 7 Pro. Aside from the missing headphone jack and non-replaceable battery, it was everything I could want in a cellphone. That is until it overheated and shut down while wirelessly charging in my car. Then I noticed the volume switch was missing.I returned the 7 Pro and a couple months later replaced it with the 8 Pro. It had to be better than the 7 Pro, right?  Well, I don't know about overheating because the weather is much cooler in December, but at least the volume switch didn't fall offUnfortunately the 8 Pro wouldn't wirelessly charge while I was listening to the headphones, which I do every night. I never had this problem on the 7 Pro, or on my two other previous Google phones. Google Customer Support was absolutely no help. They just wanted me to sell me their brand of charger. Best Buy, who I didn't even purchase the phone from, was kind enough to confirm I had a hardware issue, so now the 8 Pro has also been returned.Before the models 7 and 8, my previous two Google phones performed flawlessly. Though I have zero desire for another brand of phone, I am purchasing my first iPhone, the 15 Pro Max, which falls far short of the Pixel 8 Pro in many ways that are important to me. I just don't see that I have another choice. I can't keep buying and returning Pixel phones and waiting one-to-two months until I receive my Amazon refund. And I don't care all that much for Samsung phones.I only wish Amazon would provide a replacement instead of a refund. I would gladly give Pixel all the chances they need to get me one that works. Unfortunately I was never given this options so reluctantly on to Apple I go."
Gets overshadowed by the 15 pro max or s24 ultra little weaker on performance.
"I have had a Pixel ever since the first one, also brought them for our IT users. I love how my entire digital life is tied together. I also loved every time an Apple user was complaining that they had to delete photos to back up their phone.  This was not an issue with Pixel because Pixel had free photo storage until now.  So I upgraded to a Pixel pro and lost my free photo backups, which really sucks.  I will probably start using OneDrive since 1terabite is included in most office packages."
Phone works great but battery life is short. Heats up often.
"Replaced my four-year-old PXL 4 that I paid $220 for.Pros: Camera, screen brightness, processor.Cons: PXL 8 Pro is a little larger than it had to be. When set to show display by touching screen or picking it up, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The touch screen has nowhere near the accuracy and sensitivity of my PXL 4, this is even more important with the additional screen real estate and even less understandable considering the price difference. Moving the fingerprint sensor to the front was a bonehead idea in my opinion. Less user friendly and more difficult to use with a screen protector and easier to drop. The first phone I received wouldn't even recognize my print through a screen protector, even after setting the phone for higher sensitivity and the phone had accepted the print. The replacement phone worked.Insufficient upgrades over a four-year-old model to be classified as a ""flagship,"" and cons that should have been eliminated in R&D before the phone was released is inexcusable. Especially for a phone costing at least three times as much as a model from four years ago when you factor in inflation."
"All the time it either frizzs or does not recognize the SIM card. I need to restart it several times a day. Some programs crash when I open them. This phone cannot be the original pixel 8, it is refurbished I guess but when I was buying it nowhere was written about it."
"Purchased in January 2024. Was great until a couple of months ago. It dials a number even when no one is  touching it, converts speech to text and scrolls across the top of the phone also entered it into my text messages making it almost impossible to text. That's an example. I contacted the company and was told to reset to factory defaults which I did but it still isn't working right.They want me to take it to a repair center even though the nearest one is an hour away and I can't."
"I have always assumed pixel phones had the best cameras. This one was not noticeably better than my s22, but it still very good.Build quality seems good and the shade of blue was pleasing.However, I had to factory reset this thing three times in four weeks. I also routinely lost functionality requiring reboot. I'm going to assume it'll get better, but didn't want to bet that purchase price on it.AI features were excellent, loved the texting options."
"I used the Galaxy S20FE before using the Pixel 8pro.I wouldn't have bought it if they hadn't given me the Pixel watch 2.The Pixel has finally taken shape as a phone.There are many things that need to be fixed in the future, such as software bugs, support for folders on the app item screen instead of the front screen, and the back of the phone burning when charging wirelessly.However, looking into the future, it appears that a normal mobile phone will be released in about 5 years and will take a large share of Galaxy's market share.Work harder, Pixel managers!from a korean person"
"Overall the phone is okay.  I regret ""upgrading"" from my Pixel 6 pro.  I followed all google's instructions for backup and restore of information and got less than half of my stuff. What is frustrating is the failure of the Kindle app.  I use it nearly as much as I use the phone/texting frequency and far more in the total time of useage.  This is the Pixel 8 with Android v14 on it. The Kindle app will no longer open books that were not purchased from Amazon.On my other phones and tablets, none of which are Google Pixels or Android v14, the Kindle app still works with Non-Amazon books.I am trying to pin down whether it is the Google Pixel 8 or Android v.14.Has anyone else experienced this?If so, do you have a solution?I reached out to Amazon and Google and got no help.I read on my phone all the time and it is annoying to carry an old S8 just to read my books."
"The only reason I bought this phone is for pure Android and the direct Google updates. Otherwise, I would have purchased something else. The quality is just not there and it can be glitchy. My Pixel 3A worked better. If I could have updated my 3A I would have never purchased this phone. It seems every new Pixel Google puts out gets cheaper and cheaper."
Certainly a nice phone. I bought this to replace my 3 year old Pixel 4a. Obviously a good bit more expensive than the 4a was.I'm not sure what i was expecting but maybe other than the camera i could not tell the difference in the performance of the two phones. They really seem exactly the same.
"I've been buying Pixels 5, 6, 7. The 8 is much smaller than the prior models. Pay attention to size. Most likely a marketing ploy to get you to buy the larger phone. Regretful purchase, I should have gotten the Pro."
"The Pixel 8 seems like a great phone but the one I received randomly shuts down and won't turn back on for a few minutes. It completely locks up and then turns off. Isn't clear what causes it but looking online this is not an uncommon problem and none of the possible fixes worked.The real issue is that Google support requires that I take the phone to their designated IT shop and will not give a timeline for how long they have to keep it. They will not replace it even though this is a known issue. They also said to talk to Amazon but Amazon will only let me return it and buy a new one. Luckily the price hasn't gone up since black Friday so I'm only out the money for a few weeks until the refund processes. Google says talk to Amazon, Amazon says it's a Google problem. Typical lack of ownership of a faulty product and bad quality control. I'm hoping the new phone actually works but it doesn't give me a lot of hope switching to Google phones. Might just go back to Samsung."
"This may be different from the Pro model, but the overall - software and hardware - experience left much to be desired. In this case, the software is not properly tuned for the hardware prowess. There are slight lags, jerks, vanishing navigation arrows, etc., creating a jarring experience.The battery life could be better in the smaller Pixel 8, and you'd be hard-pressed to get it through the day especially if you have the 120 Hz motion set to on.I can NOT recommend Pixel 8 in its current software-optimized state."
"No matter how hard I try, I'm getting no notifications from twitter no matter what. I easily received notifications from all my other phones except this one. First time getting google pixel. Camera quality is good, and no lag while gaming, but this one defect really upset me :("
"Had this phone since January, switching from a Samsung Galaxy S20. It was a painful transition process, but I had hoped it will work better as it doesn't have all the Samsung customized apps and features added. It did work as expected at first, although the camera isn't as good as advertised when comparing with my spouse's S23. I can live with it. But now after more than 2 months owning the phone, out of a sudden, my phone stays warm all the time even when not in use. I thought it was the Google Assistant feature I finally set up a week ago. Turning it off didn't help. I searched online and tried all the tips I can find. Nothing worked. I finally contacted Google. The rep just blamed me for not using a Google charger. But the phone didn't come with a charger! And this battery issue just appears to be a known problem on Pixel phones and it doesn't happen right away. It only happens several months after activation. In my case, almost 3 months after I started using the phone. I can't return it now and Google support is useless. I will now try to recover my costs through purchase warranty on my credit card. In any case, I so regret getting this phone at such a premium price. Disappointment doesn't say enough of my experience. Now I have to back up everything again then buy and switch back to Samsung Galaxy!"
"The pixel 8 pro seems like a nice phone but with this new phone, there were bubbles in the main screen and the rear camera throws reflection of any light present at night.. It looks weird. The photo looks noisy though that's not noise, rather, the grains are copies of the source of light.Other things are good, but camera's performance at night is disturbing and not nice."
Cannot individualize text notifications. Other features are a lot more difficult to find or navigate. Not what I expected from a fairly expensive phone. My old Samsung was much much easier. The only reason I gave a 3 star rating was because of the camera and software.
"This is my first time trying a Pixel phone and I have been using it for 4 months now. It was going great and I loved everything about it. Pictures are great, and battery life is great. Since about a month ago, I noticed that the screen occasionally gets green and looks like static of all the pixels in the screen; however, the phone is still usable while this is happening. Well everything works except the finger print reading when this is happening. This keeps happening for some reason and the only remedy is when I press down hard on the left side of the screen. So this appears to be a hardware issue. I need to return this device before it gets worse because I spent a lot of money to get it and it has not yet been 5 months. I am very disappointed."
"While the screen was on for 1 hour, I lost 40% battery. I was not watching videos, downloading apps, or installing updates. This was after all the phone's setup was complete, and I was simply arranging apps onto the home screen and logging into various apps. 40% in an hour.As it turns out, 3 people I know all have the same phone, and could confirm that this was very much not normal. Their batteries last them a full day, sometimes two, at the very least. I can readily confirm that I received a unit with a horrendously defective battery. With the screen off, it will lose 5% battery every hour while not receiving any notifications at all. This is with 5G disabled, too, which many say is the cause of the battery draining.More over, the bluetooth was broken straight out of the box. Music stutters constantly and randomly mutes songs. I tried the ""fix"" people have for it, but it didn't help at all. My unit just came broken.The real issue is that I can't just send it back since I setup an Esim, and have no other phone that is Esim compatible. If you don't know, setting up an Esim bricks your physical sim card, making it useless. I would have to first buy yet another Google Pixel 8 before sending back the current one. This is stressful and a hassle since my phone is vital at work. Really don't recommend risking buying one through Amazon after this."
I like it. Couple of mishaps. The finger print sign in when I have a screen protector on regardless of pressing that function that allows fingerprint sign in to be better with protection screen. Doesn't really do anything. Also. No way to go back and forward on the Internet. That's annoying. Apple beats you there. As for camera. Sure amazing. But I don't care about cameras.
"I upgraded my pixel4a to this phone... don't notice much of a difference at all. Actually the 4 is better in a lot of ways. The 4 is lighter and it has a real finger print reader.The camera on the 8 is slightly better (not by much) but its clogged with so much AI that none of the photos you take with it even feel genuine. The camera ""features"" are just photoshop like taking out sky and replacing it with a completely different background... you can even replace your entire face. I don't like any of the photos cuz of how unauthentic they are.Wish I returned this and kept the 4a as I actually liked it better. If I had to do it again, I'd save the money and skip the 8 for sure."
The Phone would Freeze Up and The Touch Screen  would Not work From Time to time...  I wanted An Exchange for another one.... But They said I Couldnt.... and said I have to  it return it back...
Battery does not last long . Not happy with this smartphone.
"The phone is fine, works ok. But whatever bug was hitting it with weak wifi is still present on most recent software.  Unless you are on a really strong wifi signal the battery lasts, maybe 2 hours."
"My primary driver for buying this phone was Google's software update policy.  After having lived with it for over a month (and past the return window), I am having regrets.128GB storage is proving to be ridiculously small. The android OS uses a huge chunk of the storage.  Google charges an insanely big premium for adding storage that only costs them a few bucks.Wireless charging barely works, while the same wireless charger works fine on my other phones.Signal strength is lower than on my Samsung for the same tower and the same service."
"I was really looking forward to purchasing this phone due to all the hype and the free smart watch but it's been a nightmare. There are too many software glitches that render it un-usable: for example the Zoom on the camera stops working, the flashlight won't turn on, the screen won't wake up even when I smack it, fingerprint rarely works and the video camera auto darkens in the night, etc. These glitches are not only annoying but embarrassing since Google makes the software! Other glaring problems are battery life is terrible and recharging takes several hours whereas other flagship phones can recharge fully in as little as 10 mins!The only positive was the price: $799 for 256GB because the free smartwatch was un-deliverable and issued credit."
"I am so bummed with this phone. It is very glitchy. I'm hopefully it's something that can be fixed over time via software upgrades. But, right now, I really miss my Pixel 4. :("
"LIKED THE WAY THE PHONE WAS LAYED OUT AND ANDROID 14, BUT COULD NOT PUT UP WITH THE PHONE GETTING REALLY WARM, ESPECIALLY DURING CHARGING,ALSO VERY POOR SIGNAL .PHONE FROZE SEVERAL TIMES ,THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW!!! FOR THE ISSUES THIS PHONE HAD IT.."
Don buy this phone if you don have backup camera. Operating System is good. But phone camera back and front is not good. I had Samsung S20.  If Samsung is 10/10 Google camera is 1/10
"There is something wrong with the phone, it works something and something it freezes and I need to wait 2 minutes to use it again. I tried to do a return and the seller does not allow it and trying to go to google to find a solution for this, never found any help. In other words I have to live with it and that‚Äôs not cool"
"To start with, I'm annoyed that Google provides a charging cord and adapter which requires an additional adapter for the phone to be charged which the phone did not come with so I'm having to use my old phone cord (which needs replacing) until I can make this additional purchase. I'm upset that for the price I paid, the manufacturer can't even provide the correct charging piece.Next, I'm very unhappy with the functionality. I would like to get rid of or move the calendar that's stuck in the top left of the home screen and move the Google search bar from it's location at the bottom of the screen to the top  but so far nothing I have done has allowed for these changes which is annoying.Ease of use, the screen seems dimmer even when on bright than I'm use to and the swipe function to unlock the device is a bit finicky so I almost always end up having to swipe multiple times. I HATE that to open or close pages/apps you need to hold and swipe up.. I end up swiping over and over not getting the phone to do the function I need or want. If I could do it over again I absolutely wouldn't go with this device. This phone reminds me most of the I phone functionality which I also hate.Can't wait to switch back to a Samsung!"
Software and camera is top-notch but the battery life is abysmal. It has to be charged multiple times throughout the day.
"The finger printing works 50% of the time. The battery is underwhelming and the same if not worse than my old phone. Camera is underwhelming. Random loss of cellular connection which is very annoying. Doesn't feel worth what I paid for it as my old phone which was half the price functioned just as good.Update: every day I have this terrible phone, every day I hate it more. The settings don't function as they state. The signal is always sporadic and causes me problems in work and personal life. For example, I can't log in to my work computer if I can't get calls. This phone has so many problems I regret with every fiber of my being that I gave pixels a second chance. There is no redeeming fact about this phone, just frustration and hate. I cannot get a new phone because I just got this in December. If you hate yourself this is a great phone for youI hate this phone so muchEdit: 7/24 i hate this phone ever more than last time. I regret giving pixel a second chanceEdit: 12/11/24 still hate this phone. Now I'm having screen issues. Never in my life have I had this many problems with a phone. I've treated my older phone even worse and they've held up much better. Can't wait to get a new phone"
"I have tried 2 different Pixel 8, neither will activate on tracfone. They can't find a valid IMEI #. I don't know what to do. I like Pixel & Tracfone, but now the two won't dance together. I am really disappointed in this bad situation. It has been time consuming to load data and then find out about no phone service, because it won't work. All my previous Pixels have worked on Tracfone without a problem. This really sucks. I guess the blame rests with Google, so I will have to fine another phone."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This phone is not brand new and nowhere on the ad does it say it's ""a used phone"" besides it cost the same as a brand new one on Google store anyways. Also it came in a garbage packaging with no protection but one layer of bubble wrap in a loose box. The phone probably works but its messed up that I paid $1000+ when I could have the same phone for brand new. I would recommend you don't buy here. I added a video of the rattle noise not sure if there is audio on reviews."
"As a end user, I tend not to write low scoring reviews. Google to me has a name recognition to safely say they deserve a low review if their product does not meet a level of expectation.The Pixel 8 is not a finished product. Mainly because simple commands are difficult to resolve.A good example is, if you are doing a search on the internet and you receive a phone call, you may be challenge to find the screen to be able to take the call.The list of things wrong with the phone is lot longer, I just summarize by saying, do not recommend this phone to a friend."
"I purchased my cell phone through this particular dealer in september, 2023. I use my cell phone for just about everything in my daily life including going to my bank account. Whenever I would go to my bank account I would get a prompt saying that my cell phone was ""rooted"". With rooting I cannot get in to my banking apps easily as I have with other past phones. I admit that I am unsophisticated with cell phones due to my advanced age and lack of technical skills but I just recently did a Google search to see what that meant and apparently it leaves my phone open to malware and security breaches.  Norton security states ""even done properly, if your phone doesn‚Äôt have proper antivirus protection for Android, rooting leaves your device open to all sorts of malware.""  I have installed bitdefender security software but I don't know if that's sufficient. I also don't know if my phone is open to others to see my transactions and to get my private information on my phone. I don't think I would ever buy another phone from this particular seller. And I would recommend that others avoid the seller also. I'm concerned that the seller may have access to my personal and Financial information on my cell phone and I really don't know what to do with my newer cell phone. Should I destroy it and get another? It seems like a tremendous waste of money do that.  I have included a screenshot of the prompt that I get from my bank regarding my cell phone."
I guess you have to pay more $ to get a phone that is 'smarter'.  II like to speed type by passing my finger to the appropriate letters. The word suggestions are often way off.
I've never been a big fan of  iPhones.  The proprietary nature of there phones can be less user friendly for me.  However I purchased the a34 5g and have been pleased with the phone .  However if you are wanting a phone that doesn't continuously need to update . I suggest considering a non android.  The updates are far too frequent not to mention very intrusive. I have spent far too much time trying to keep up with my ever changing phone .
"Most frustrating phone I've had:- WiFi will stay locked on a weak channel and fail even though stronger channels are available;- Cellular connection can stop for no apparent reason, requires reboot to fix;- Facial recognition for unlocking the phone seldom works;- Gesture controls are inadequate (no shake for flaslight, twist for camera, nor face down for mute);- Unremovable apps;On the positive side:- fast enough performance;- fairly smooth transfer from previous phone;- SD card supported;- good software update policy."
"I'm not crazy about it, however, it does the job.  Oh well!!"
No charging chord
I had a TMobile Technician unbox the product. The cable that came with it was for data transfer from phone to phone. No wall charger in the box which was so small it couldn't possibly have had one.  It is not charging. Status light is not even on. No buzz when I tried to charge it with newish turbo charger and cables bought from Amazon. I may have to return it. What a heap of trouble. Then I have to return to our local TMobile outlet and bother the techs again to transfer the data from this phone to another new phone which I have to order cash on the line because I can't get a refund on this before I get that done.
Has to be rebooted because applications will not load
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            In the product description it indicates unlocked for all operators, however the product arrives with a ""recommendation"" that we only use it with T-Mobile.üò™"
I have purchased Samsung Galaxy A34 phone on September 2023. In three months it stopped detecting any SIM card. It is rubbish and fake product. Request people not to buy this phone.
My phone has been working for 3 months and now it gives a error code which says its a stolen phone DONT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE FROM THIS SELLER THEY ARE UNRESPONSIVE
I was excited to receive my phone. Disappointing that it cannot work on MetroPCS.  I called customer service many times but no answer. Unfortunately I have to return it
The phone looks good but I was unable to charge the phone without the charging cord.
Not worth it.  If it falls it will have internal damage
Returned it. Phone was locked.
It was not unlocked and therefore was unusable.
Back camera cover fell off before using it ‚Ä¶don‚Äôt buy this trash poor quality product
"This phone was purchased as a present for my mother, and it never worked. Tried to return the phone but it was unsuccessful. It was later discovered that the phone is locked to T-Mobile network. Buyer beware."
However the assistant button to the left let alone center screen and or anytime to many times when performing basic task  on your phone. The assistant pops up way way way to much . Also this unlock phone doesn't do countless pay. As in no gwallet tap and pay .. and the screen protector is hella dope to been pre applied. That phone case super basic you'd think being it's size of phone a kickstand or knob would been appropriate. Other then that . Hey it is what it is
Won't o as a main phone I am taking sim out and go back to a wal mart Motorola 3 yrs old slow can't get to awnser half your calls
From the minute I turned it on this phone sucks I wouldn't buy it if I were you
It takes about 15 seconds for an app to open. When it unfreezes after another 30 seconds it will tell you the app is not responding and foce you to close it. Any music apps in the background will shut off randomly at any moment. The cover of the camera lenses also fell off after about a month.
"Not useable. Sent it overseas, unfortunately the phone is locked. Waste of money."
"This produit is not good to sale for people, it‚Äôs very slow."
"I bought this tablet because I have the first gen Lenovo M10 Plus and I wanted an upgrade. As you can tell in the picture it wouldn't complete the system update. It was trying to update for 40 minutes. I figured to turn off the tablet and turn it back on. I turned it off and now it won't turn back on. So I figured to do a soft/hard reset. It wouldn't do that either. I even had the tablet on charge and the battery was 80% so you can't tell me the battery was dead. It won't power on, and now won't finish charging. The screen is just dark and doesn't show the battery charging. Another thing to mention is I set up the homescreen the way I want it and it goes back to the way it was. I get rid of the entertainment space and that shows back up even when I went to home screen settings and turn it off. This was before the screen wouldn't turn back on. I'm sending it back for a replacement and if that tablet does the same thing I'm going to send it back and ask for a refund. I'll update when I get a replacement. ****UPDATE June 18th 2023****It's been a couple months and I never got a replacement because I didn't want to get the same tablet and expect to go through the same hassle setting it up and freezing. My M10 Plus still works fine but it is laggy due to its 2GB ram and small storage. The reason I wanted a tablet with more ram and storage. I'll just get me a different brand tablet because I'm done with Lenovo."
"Yes, the battery life is good.  The performance and responsiveness is poor for 3gb of memory.  I primarily use it for reading news and checking emails.  If often freezes on both, of the app will crash.My luck with Lenovo has not been good."
"I wish I'd bought something else.....You'd think it was good, and often it is.But every few days it stops reading my SD card and demands that I format it...with no other option. It takes days to copy things back onto the tablet, because I can't use a card reader in my laptop to copy things onto the card because the tablet will just demand the card be formatted again. It's not even the end of February, and I've had to format the card at least four times, if not more than five times this year.Also, and perhaps even more annoying, the screen likes to click when I'm trying to scroll, or double and triple clicks when I'm trying to type. I ended up with several items in my Amazon Cart before I realized the tablet had been reading ""Add to Cart"" when I was trying to scroll. Since I wasn't planning to buy anything at that moment, it didn't matter, but if I was actually shopping, I might not have noticed the extra items being put into my cart. That might have actually happened to me in December on Temu, ended up with a few things I didn't expect... YouTube constantly clicks videos that I'm trying to scroll past, which is extremely frustrating given how YouTube Mobile functions with the ""Back"" button (and then I have to go into my History, and remove the video that I didn't intend to click). There's no way to adjust the click sensitivity...I have posted about these issues in the Lenovo support forums, and they've basically told me ""That's the way it is,"" with no solution or recommendation for fixing the problems. ""It's not possible."" I can't fathom these kind of problems being allowed off the development floor.But then again, they've also pushed spamware as part of a required update, and decided that the quick launch navigation bar at the bottom will ALWAYS be visible with no ability to hide it in a setting. Several apps which utilize the entire screen, have buttons covered by the quick launch bar, making the apps unusable, at least in part.Battery life is terrible, even being plugged in, the wall can barely provide enough power to keep it from going down. I can get it charged up to 100%, and then start watching YouTube, and after a few videos, find myself at 97%, with it still plugged in. Screen at less than half brightness.The volume controls are bad, too. The lowest volume above mute is still quite loud. Use of a Bluetooth SPEAKER limits the output volume to less than what the tablet speakers produce. I have a Tribit BTS31, which is capable of very high volumes paired with my phone, but the tablet has an ear protection mode that can't be turned off....it assumes headphones rather than a speaker, and limits the volume. The tablet speakers end up being vastly better than the BT speaker, making the speaker pointless.I probably could go on with a few more problems, but you get the idea....This tablet has had problems that have killed productivity, and been the source of a lot of frustration.I really wish I'd gone for the Samsung."
"When I bought my son a Lenovo laptop about 8 years ago, Lenovo was considered a quality brand. His laptop lasted for YEARS. This tablet has good reviews when I bought it. I've had it for 2 1/2 years, and it was great until about 6 months ago when it started freezing up frequently, and I have not been able to get any help from customer support. Computers don't last forever, but when I can't get support for a malfunctioning product, I will not buy that brand again."
"Just got this and was quite pleased until I realized I had a total of 5GB of free space once I set it up.  I have bought a Samsung MicroSD card for it but it won't arrive for several days; so I used a SanDisk 64GB MicroSD card from my old tablet.Come to find out that even after multiple efforts of resetting and reformatting and restarting the tablet the very best it will do is allow me to use the chip as portable storage and won't allow it to be used for active storage, meaning I have the built in  64GB but no ability to extend it. I found numerous reports on websites about this being a problem and many work arounds that don't seem to apply.Fortunately I had a Samsung 64GB uSD available and have been able to use it to move music files to. But if I can't effectively extend the memory as advertised once the larger chip gets here this thing will have to be returned. It's useless if it's limited to 64GB, that's not enough for minimal use and I'd never be able to add more apps and the like.Update: I was able to free up about 30GB on the tablet itself and installed a new Samsung 256GB uSD which it did immediately recognize; I still don't know if it will put apps on it and use it as live memory but I will update the review when I know for sure."
"So back in November I bout 2 of these devices, the 32 Gb 3Gb ram as a replacement for my daughter's Fire 8HD and 64GB 4GB ram for myself. By February the 64GB 4GB variant had stop working but Lenovo replaced it hassle free as I was told by the service center this was very uncommon. As for the 32GB 3GB model it was ideal to watch Netflix and YouTube with that beautiful display and amazing sound quality but where it begins to fall down is whilst playing more RAM demanding games such as fortnight and call of duty. Be sure to assess all your needs in a tablet before purchasing this one. All in all I am pleased and impressed for the most part with this tablet"
"For a tablet under $200, it's not a bad deal but don't expect the clearest picture when streaming live TV, especially live sports. Streaming platforms look good, live TV, very AVG."
I haven‚Äôt had it long enough  to rate it.
Tablet would consistently lose connection with its touchscreen. Researching the Lenovo forms revealed this as a common problem with no established solution. I returned it and bought another brand.
"Neither of my TV sets that I've used for other tablets were even recognized. Researching this I found lots of supporting evidence for this problem in the Lenovo help site. And several sites showed a specification for an accelerometer and magnetic field (compass) detection, neither of which were found on my unit. The one good thing is when set up you can kill a lot of the bloatware. In all other respects this was a pretty good tablet......but cannot explain why a box stock android system that has casting built in would fail like that.08/22/23 Update.....I may have been wrong and I'll explain why. Every other tablet I've had casting just worked. No real setup required. Well, after returning this and getting another brand with Android 12 the same issue arose with one of the sets, a Samsung, but the Visio was picked up right away. If you go to settings for cast in the upper right are three vertical dots that brings up a check box Enable Wireless Display. Well, I'll be damned. Check the box and both TVs now appear. If they're greyed out just means they're not powered on. The Samsung is a smart TV but not too smart and doesn't have an inbuilt Chromecast as the Visio does. The Samsung must also be either WIFI or Ethernet connected to your home internet in order to cast without resorting to a Chromecast adapter on the TV. I suspect what you're really doing is using WIFI Direct without being explicitly told you are.I can't find a good reason why Android 12 is designed this way, security perhaps, but I'll wager a lot of others have been frustrated by this one change. Upping rating to 5 as this was the only thing I found objectionable about this unit and it was just my stupidity that earned it a lower rating."
"I love tablets, am 75 and have had many in my lifetime.  This is by far the worst ever.  Constant getting messages, interruptions saying not responding, wait or cancel, hard for me to go from page to page as my other devices.  Will never buy this brand again and since the only way one can get a complete retund, it has to be defective, broken or not used - what kind of deal is that?  Will have to watch from whom I buy anything.  Not happy with this purchase from this seller.  Not happy at all.  What happened to if it doesn't meet your needs, return.  Even many stores provide that.  Satisfaction definitely is not a guarantee.  Just stating my opinion, nothing more."
"I like this tablet, unfortunately its very very slow, if you are buying this for games forget it, even for easy & light games... this is a great value, it looks great, at only $130, you cant expect much but this is very good looking unit, its  modern, it has good speakers, sounds good & loud but its one of those devices where you got to have patience, you got to let it think, if you click the screen too many times while its processing something, it will freeze on you everytime"
"Based on reviews I thought this would be a great little tablet for travel and occasional home use. I'm so disappointed. It's so slow, even after I removed unnecessary apps it came with. Unfortunately it's too late to return it, that window has closed üòî"
"This tablet comes pre-installed with the ""Lenovo User Experience"" which is spyware that is used by the Lenovo corporation to track and log how you use your tablet. They sell your usage data to other companies so that those companies can attempt to sell you products and services you ""may"" be interested in. The Lenovo User Experience app cannot be uninstalled or disabled. If you do not wish to participate in being a targeted consumer, you must decline the Lenovo User Experience EVERY TIME your device starts or restarts.In addition, Lenovo sneaks in user approval for this ""service"" by adding an optional checkbox to the tablet setup. The optional checkbox (which is pre-checkmarked) is BETWEEN the required checkboxes for acceptance of the License Agreement and the Privacy Statement. This is done so that the user presumes all the checkboxes are required. There is even ANOTHER checkbox on the bottom of that setup screen that reads ""I have read and agreed to the service agreements above"" and that checkbox (also pre-checkmarked) will checkmark all three checkboxes above it, leading the user once again to accidentally opt-in to the Lenovo spyware program.Lastly, the first update for this device loads 18 new bloatware apps onto the device without any user permission. These apps include wood puzzle, water puzzle, snake game, fish solitaire, and other junk like that. Most of these can be uninstalled but a few can only be disabled.While it is possible (with technical know-how) to disable the spyware, it is not feasible for the everyday user; it requires rooting the device and removing the spyware with console commands.Given the above, I do not recommend this tablet (or any new Lenovo android device, to be honest)."
"A little background. Prior to this experience, I have set up five different Android tablets and countless Android phones without any major issues. Lately, most of my phones have been Moto G series and Lenovo seemed like a logical choice for me because of the brand umbrella and I like Motorola products.I purchased and set up the first Lenovo M10 tablet, and all went smoothly, I was excited and pleased with the tablet, but sadly the Bluetooth kept dropping the multiple brands of different earbuds every few minutes, so I arranged an Amazon exchange for another M10. These things happen.ü§îSecond Lenovo M10, problems immediately after selecting English and connecting to WiFi. I could not get past the ""finish setup"" window, screen would show a working circle and then go to a white screen everytime after clicking ""start"".  Eventually, I back arrowed and bypassed the Lenovo ""get your tablet ready"" screen and chose ""setup without internet"".  I was able to manually connect to WiFi and setup the tablet up with my Google account, but the tablet relentlessly kept reminding me to ""finish setup"" even after I created a Lenovo account hoping that would help.  After numerous failed attempts and getting the same white screen and days of frustration, I decided to reset to factory settings. After factory resetting, I had the same issues as before, I called Lenovo tech support and they had no solutions and recommend returning it as defective.üòû3rd M10, same issues immediately, returned.üò†4th and last M10, same issues immediately, returned. Very disappointed! ü§¨Replaced the Lenovo M10 with a Doogee T20 tablet. Happy so far and would give the Doogee T20 (5 stars).üôÇUnfortunately, when I purchased the first Lenovo M10, I also purchased a ZtopCases M10 leather case that is no longer returnable. Love the case (5 stars), but it doesn't fit the Doogee T20, out $20.ü§ï"
Constantly crashing and freezing. There are better options in the market.
"The tablet froze on me a couple of times in the first two days I had it. Had difficulty turning it off and restarting it also. Was glad to be able to return it, still unsure what I'm going to get to replace it."
"I was extremely let down by this tablet. It had bold claims and I have trouble believing it. Extremely slow, glitchy, poor battery life etc. it‚Äôs like using a 10 year old tablet. I left it on standby and it died within 48 hours. Crashed constantly. Only good for kids."
"Definitely do not recommend for anything but streaming. This model/current software has a really annoying, PERMANENT, task bar below. It also kind of lags/has low FPS when maneuvering, even just pulling down the notification bar or opening an app feels really....bad quality. I will say, the screen looks really clear and when watching things there is no lag or FPS issues. The sound from the speakers is also pretty alright. ***Again, ONLY RECOMMEND THIS TABLET FOR STREMING ONLY--NOTHING ELSE.***"
"If all you need it for is streaming the tablet is fine. But because of the limited storage, it cannot do much other than that. If you buy an SD card, great but it won't let you transfer app files to it only docs and pictures/video. Since the tablet (at least the one I purchased) only has 32gig of storage, 12 of that is taken up by the UI and another 8-10 by apps that come pre downloaded, most of which you cannot take off.. so in actuality you have about 10gig left over after that. Download your streaming apps now you have 5-8gigs available. See what I am getting at? Apps are too large now days for such a small base storage.The battery life is great, 10+ hours easily.Now, my biggest issue is that everytime I wake up the tablet, the UI crashes. It takes about 2-5 minutes for it to crash but then it will function normally.Would I buy again? No. I would get a more modern tablet."
"I bought this tablet about a year ago. The WiFi often fails to connect, even though all of my other devices connect easily and consistently. Sometimes I have to restart it a dozen times to get it to connect. And it tends to be slow even though I have a very fast internet connection which works very well on other devices. I don't know if more expensive Lenovo tablets have better WiFi, but if I ever buy another Lenovo I'll immediately check how good the WiFi is. If I have the same problem, I'll return it to Amazon and get another brand. I don't recommend this tablet because most people need good WiFi when they use a tablet."
"Disappointing. The tablet is underpowered, frequently freezes, and has apps crash. After the first android upgrade, there is no upgrade roadmap. Battery life isn't good unless you constantly keep in battery saver mode. Support isn't the greatest and reported problems / requests languish for years. Wouldn't purchase Lenovo again."
"Fine little tablet.  Great screen quality and decent speed.  But 40 days after purchase it stopped charging entirely.  No longer turns on.  I'll update this review after the Lenovo warranty process.  I'm not going to be happy if they want me to pay to fix this.[Update:  They don't say that they're doing this, but after getting the RMA authorized they sent me some nice packaging to ship the tablet to them, and turnaround time on the fix was very fast.  Outlook: cautiously optimistic?]"
"I bought this as a gift, and upon delivery opened the package just to have it not work. Reached out to amazon for a return and was refunded (after sending it back I believe); however, my account was closed due to returning it. After multiple calls to support, and YEARS worth of using amazon I have not been able to regain my account, all because of this defective product. DO NOT BUY, OR RETURN!"
"the dolby atmos quad speakers are terrific. the screen resolution is terrific. the tablets streaming capabilities are terrific. browsing is pretty snappy as well. if u stay within that bracket, this is an excellent budget tablet. but if you are someone looking for a little more, you might wanna look elsewhere. for starters, don't be fooled by the pictures. the color display is not as vibrant as the pics suggest. nor does it fully support hdr. it's a hit or miss. therefore, your video playbck will tend to look 2010-ish. if you're ok with that, it's a pretty good budget tablet. also, this doesn't have a silky smooth UI interface. but the cpu moves things along steady & snappy enough not to ruin the experience. occasional stutters here & there where the cpu struggles to keep up, if you're trying to operate at a quick pace. no video game review, sorry! just don't expect no nintendo switch experience. the cpu keeps the tablet honest about it's limits."
The screen Freezes quite often. I have done a factory reset and it still happens. I looked online and see that others are having this issue too. Might want to think about something else instead of the chance that you'll have the same frustration as me.
I was trying to get off the IPad ecosystem but this tablet made me want to go back because it was lagging
"I ordered this tablet on the first Prime Day which was yesterday. It came today. That was the only positive thing I can say.I started to set it up and at the point where I says it has added my accounts, I press the next button and it buffers a couple of seconds and goes back to the same page, over and over.So I called Amazon support. I told the woman the problem I was having and she asked question after question leading me to believe that she had no idea what setting up a device entailed. She called Lenovo because she had no idea what to do and transferred me to them.After about 10 to 15 minutes of going through the same thing with him he finally figured out that I was talking about something that wasn't hardware. Hardware  is all they do. No software.Once again I called Amazon. Once again I talked to a person who had no clue. Finally he said he could not find anything pertaining to my problem and he would send the information via email on how to return the tablet.I should mention at this point that this is the second Lenovo tablet I've purchased from Amazon. I also had to return the first one. As I mentioned above, I really didn't need a tablet anyway. Right?"
nice if I was to see my e-mails full screen
"The screen is quality, speakers are great, batter to life is amazing, it's a nice tablet. However, it runs like complete crap. Freezes constantly, every few minutes apps will hang and it will go to the home screen. Full of bloatware and adds. SD Drive cannot act as the main hard drive they can't be merged, you can't default the SD as the main HD AND you cannot default download path to the SD hard drive. Lenovo support is horrible their forms I swear is a bot answering questions. I wouldn't waste my money on this you will end up more frustrated and upset you bought it just like myself."
I've tested cheaper our friend tablets at the same size and specifications that's so better and work better than this it's not a good bang for your buck
"What don't I like? Let me count the ways. After all updates, system and apps. The UI stops responding, the system launcher stops responding, it locks up has to be restarted, you can't close running apps intuitively, it's difficult to use, there's no window controls on the bottom of the screen, the hard drive shows 23 GB and 20 of it is used I haven't even put any apps on it! One night with this tablet, that I bought for my wife to play games on and watch YouTube videos that's frustrated me to the point that I'm going to return it!"
"I bought this tablet to replace my aging LG tablet. Little did I know that the same issue that I had with my Moto Z3 would rear its ugly head again. After 6 months of normal use, the tablet began telling me that it couldn‚Äôt read the sd card, that it had been corrupted. Keep in mind that I had not moved or interfered with any file transfers of any kind while using the tablet. Now I can‚Äôt even format the card in windows, nor can I permanently delete files from the card. If you have a large media library, STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!"
"Horrible tablet! 50% of the available memory is pre-loaded with Google apps and Lenovo bloatware. After installing a FEW of my favorite non-Google, nonlenova apps, the tablet starting acting quirky. After numerous restarts, app-offloading, the tablet settled temporarily. However, upon downloading PDFs for review, it resorted to its usual funkiness. I have yet to figure how to get this waste-of-money app to stabilize, other than a total reset. I am a retired technician. DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIFIC PIECE OF JUNK!"
"... but now, not so much. I loved this tablet for the first few months. Best performance I've seen in an affordable Android tablet (I have owned Fire, Samsung and generic tablets). Then came the Android 13 update. Now my tablet locks up several times a day, requi. Thousands of people are on the Lenovo support to forums complaining and the best answer they can give us is ""do a factory reset"". Did that, doesn't work.Stay away from this Lenovo tablet."
"Very,very unhappy with both tablet and android.Very intrusive injects its sites into my searches,cannot auto to Duck,duck go.Constant updates prevents fast opening.Impossible to get rid of Google and their searches on opening. Much prefer the ease of Fire tablets even with their glitches and preloads. Get one and pay a little extr AA to cut down on ads,not stop them but reduce the number. Google has become an uncontrolled monster."
Worked for almost two month and now it has trouble connecting to internet and more. Trash it is ‚Ä¶ sad to waist your money and disappointment.
not as good as my old one . to hard for set up
Purchased based on good reviews. I cannot leave such a review.  Been using for several months now. This thing is slow and freezes up all the time. Will probably throw away and buy something else.
"I don't know what to think about this tablet.  It works. But quality of UX and software integration seem poorly integrated.  There is a cleaner app and a weather app that are on auto start after you turn of the tablet. If you are in a different app, those two will pop open.  It gets annoying.  I uninstalled both but now I can't scroll down to view my notifications.  Its like the questionable disk clean app and weather app are required for the tablet to function.  I'm half tempted to see if I can root this tablet and install a better experience"
For whatever reason Lenovo decides to not allow external memory cards to be used/formatted as internal memory.
"I purchased the Lenovo Tab M10 Plus 3rd Gen Tablet around six months ago for light use, such as reading books, PDFs, and occasionally watching videos on YouTube. However, my experience with this tablet has been extremely unsatisfactory.From the start, the tablet was unbearably slow. Despite reformatting and reconfiguring it, the performance did not improve. The tablet remains frustratingly slow, making even simple tasks a hassle.Furthermore, the keyboard functionality is unreliable, often not working at all. On top of that, apps frequently crash, likely due to memory issues, significantly disrupting the user experience and rendering the tablet unreliable for any purpose.Overall, I am thoroughly disappointed with this purchase."
"Tablet constantly locks up with black screen. So far multiple sessions of pressing restart buttons have awakened it. But now dead again. Bought it for a trip, so total use less than ten hours."
"Absolutely terrible. The tablet initially runs fine. Until updates and typical game downloads, the tablet is very very very sluggish. Also you cant change the language on this tablet.. What kind of tablet doesn't let you change the language..????? Some might fine this okay.. but for those that plan to buy this for an elderly that doesnt read English.. this is a hard NO"
"Locks up, freezes, 3 factory resets & still the same thing!!  Smashed it over my knee 2 days before I had it 1 yearIn My Opinion - AVOID THIS JUNK"
Nice tablet but it continues to lock up and has to be restarted. It has hardly anything on it. After looking up the issue online I find it is a very common problem that the company has been made aware of and has yet to come out with a fix. It's unlikely I will buy another Lenovo product. $150 wasted.
Seemed good at first but the processing power is sub par feels like I‚Äôm using an off brand android tablet from 2015
Decent performance for one app a time.
"It's a good tablet, but it only has 64 Gb of storage. You can install up to 128 Gb in an SD card, but the device iitself is only 64 Gb. It's been a common form of false advertisement here on Amazon lately."
Easily the slowest tablet I've ever purchased.
"About less than a month and it's all ready lagging and glitching, it also keeps freezing while using it, bought it for my son's for. Read trip and worked for like 2 weeks. Also you need to use Hotspot to make it work so it's sucks done waste your money!!"
The quality of this tablet is good. However the operating system isn't.I tried to learn it but it was completely different then my android phone. I ended up sending it back and got an iPad.
"The tablet worked great up until the android 13 update, after the update total garbage. It freezes, crashes and acts like it can't run a single app properly. The update auto installs and once it does you can't regress to the previous working software. If you contact customer support they tell you to just give the update time and it ""should"" work. I have factory reset and everything trying to get the tablet to work properly again but it's not so if you buy this be warned that this company will ruin your device and leave you flapping in the wind. If you rely on your device for work or other important things then stay well and far from any Lenovo products."
"vendor specifies this is a 10.6"" tablet but its actually a 10.3"", i bought a $35 case for the 10.6"" i was suposed to get and now is useless"
After about an hour of loading things and customizing it to my needs I noticed it only had 64gb storage instead of the advertised 128gb.  Ripped off!
"Aesthetically, it's great. Definition is wonderful. But it simply doesn't have enough storage space nor does it have a strong enough processor. It is easily overencumbered with simple processes like notifications and will easily fill up should you decide to use spotify or any streaming service. Save up and buy a hi performance tablet. Not what I expected from Lenovo."
"I gave it one star because I like Lenovo, and this tablet looks nice, but the performance is just terrible. I wanted to upgrade from my little Fire HD but overall the Fire was 100 times better. This thing is soooo slow, and I only downloaded ONE game on it! It's only a match 3 game so why is this thing so slow? Also, if I leave the game running and then come back in 5 minutes, it freezes up so bad that the game has to restart and I lose all my progress! The Fire didn't have any of those problems. If I could I would return this thing. I'm not happy with this tablet at all, and I definitely would not recommend it to anyone."
This is 2022 isn't it?  Last time I looked it was.  The latest version of Android is 12 isn't it (8/28/2022)?  I know this is a budget tablet but for $200 you'd at least expect it to run the latest games like Diablo Immortal but when I tried to install it it said DEVICE INCOMPATIBLE!  I tried loading an app called Sky Map that shows the locations of planets and stars when holding it up to the sky but this devise lacks the sensors ( the app reported this to me) and it will not work.  I've had this for about two hours and it's already factory reset and in the box to return. I can't take the chance that I may want to load an app in the future and it will not work.This is 2022 and there is NO EXCUSE that a brand new tablet can't run an app (Sky Map) that has ran on every other Android device I've owned.
"This, unfortunately, is NOT it. When you go cheap, you get what you pay for. LENOVO is about as cheap as it gets, and it shows!I've had this tablet less than a year and it's already degrading. The screen isn't as responsive and the updates are absurdly horrible. There is limited space and no way to uninstall the crappy preinstalled apps that you'll never use - leaving you with less space for what you love. There is some semblance of Android but the LENOVO skin leaves you with no kind of personalization options.I'm really bummed because I returned an Amazon fire tablet to take a chance with this one. I recommend ANYTHING else than the LENOVO brand. Absolutely ridiculous."
Bought this to use for music and running basic fitness apps for a home gym. The Bluetooth regularly just quits entirely. For seemingly no reason it disconnects from the speaker. It can be pretty frustrating during a workout. You have to go back and reconnect manually. (This issue is not seen on any other device that I've used). I would not recommend this for a home gym application and going forward I will go for a more reputable company's product.
The tablet is advertised as 128gb but it's only 64gb. Be careful.
"This tablet is a great tablet. There's nothing functionally wrong with it as far as I have found. Plays video, surfs web, responds quickly, battery is as you'd expect. It's light weight. The cover I bought is a tight secure fit.BUT THE MEMORY IS ONLY 64 GB. THE PRODUCT IS LISTED AS HAVING 128 GB MEMORY. THIS IS WRONG. LENOVO DOES NOT OFFER THIS TABLET IN A 128 GB CONFIGURATION. I CONFIRMED THIS WITH LENOVO.The tablet is compatible with microSD cards up to 1 TB, claims Lenovo Help. I have not yet added a card to this because I was hoping it would have 128 gb storage and I would not need to futz with multiple storage locations.Buyer beware. The tablet is great but this listing is wrong."
"Out of the box, this tablet lagged while swiping, opening apps, etc. I purchased for note-taking, which was terrible at handwriting-to-text conversion as all my words came back with no spaces (e.g. howisyourdaygoing). I didn‚Äôt try watching videos but I imagine it would have also been incredibly laggy. I have high speed WiFi and it‚Äôs possible that it was being slower, and the tablet was significantly affected. Either way I am returning this and trying out a Kindle Scribe for note-taking"
"It's slow, apps crash, the pen feature isn't worth it. It's been garbage since day one and I've pre-ordered it. So I've been using it since launch. Gamble on something else."
"I bought this tablet as a replacement for a very old Samsung tab S2.  I thought that the memory would not be an issue since I am not a heavy app user and use online Google storage, however, after setting up the apps that I do use, the Lenovo immediately slowed down and gave out of memory warnings.  I found it to be very slow.  I also found the OS system settings to be a little clunky and less organized than my old Samsung.  I returned this and am going with another Samsung."
"Lenovo in their infinite wisdom decided to ""UPGRADE"" our software without telling us and added a permanent task bar at the bottom of the screen like it's MAC OS or Windows.It can't be turned off.It's buggy, so it overlaps the native Android Back / Home buttons. Literally (see pic).Tap to wake is broken now.Keyboard doesn't work because their taskbar takes up the bottom 10% of the screen.Lenovo won't respond on their forums. Support is a joke.Run, don't walk, far away from this awful piece of junk."
"The product is so slow, if you open 3 apps the tablet crash."
"This is probably the worst tablet i have ever used. Seems extreme but i literally bought this to read downloaded PDF's of obscure literature and it can't even do that. For some reason this tablet is constantly lagging and on the verge of melting itself down no matter what im doing. Its constantly updating, or downloading, or spamming me with BS. Even the base level UI is constantly lagging. The gentures are impossible to use and i still can't figure half of them out.. Skip this thing and get anything else."
"After doing a bunch of research on lower tier tablets, this one got great reviews. Upon purchase, it froze straight out of the box. Thought that the update would fix it. It did not. It freezes constantly and sometimes I have to leave it alone for an hour before it will allow me to restart it. Buy a better tablet."
"Lenovo thinks I need an always-present bar at the bottom containing Google services. FYI I never use any Google Services besides the playstore. I can't remove the bar, can't edit it, can't hide it. An ever present annoyance. Should have just bought a Samsung tablet. What a crappy company Lenovo is turning out to be! Stay away!!!"
This tablet is terrible!  I bought it to just use for Amazon shopping. Etc.  It is so slow!  I've already forgot what I was doing by the time the page comes up. This is a hunk of junk that I sit on my desk. Wish I could return it.
Programs and system continually crash. No viruses. Bought as cheaper alternative to Samsung! Just ordered new Samsung but stuck with this sine return date passed.
"Tablet never turned on and they did not want to reimburse me for its cost, I do not recommend it."
"Nothing works without an internet connection.  So it's worthless on long flights which is why I got it.  I can't even watch my downloaded shows that I paid for.Now it is a very expensive paperweight, very frustrating."
First problem: Tablet's MAC address can not be seen until after it connects to wifi network so I was unable to connect it to my network because I have to enter the WiFi Mac address into my router for connection to be allowed by my network.2nd and final nail in coffin: tablet sold as having 128gb storage in fact has only 64gb. See photo of screen stating storage. Box is also incorrectly marked as it states tablet has 128gb when it does not.Returned this amateur hour product as maker lacks quality control at the very least! AVOID.
"I have never used such slow tablets. On fresh install, the interface lag was 10+ seconds for most actions. Even after being patient and waiting 2 hours for Android to update, and uninstalling or disabling 30+ Lenovo and Google apps, the speed was not improved. Today I watched it spend 3 minutes on the boot logo screen then another two minutes on a separate boot screen. Returned. Totally unusable."
Great build quality. Nice screen. Thats about it. Starts to hesitate with simple mobile games. Seems like anything with more than a few graphics and it falls flat on its face. Visible hesitation when swiping between screens. Kick rocks. Returned.
The swipe action required to close apps is hit or miss.  Sometimes 4 or 5 apps will be open without knowing it. Then there is the constant adds showing up to extend the warranty.
There is alot to get use to when coming from a samsung tablet. It is slow and laggy when playing Movies/videos using the MX player. Its bulky and heavy.
"First off, the biggest issue, it randomly says there is an issue with your sd card. Even if you format it. It said that, then randomly started working, then says that again.Also they keep spamming you with notification to join their customer improvement problem.Trash. Buy a Samsung."
Tablet will not charge. Nicely packaged looks new no scratches nothing but will not turn on. Been charging two hrs and not even a blip. I need u guys to reach out to me. I don't see how to message you only Amazon and I am returning it.
Not impressed as in packing the pen was missing.  A prime object for the tablet.  Won't reorder
You'll want to throw it in the trash.
After a week of use this tablet started to freeze. Kids added about 20 game and cause the tablet to become slow and unresponsive. Only way to get the tablet back up and running is to do a hard reboot on the device.
"Gotta be better ones even for the money. This junk is so slow and cumbersome I barely even use it for any more that youtube and some tv. I was hoping for a write-on tablet and replacing a laptop, but this thing is practically useless."
Had to return because the OS/UI kept crashing. I need to know what is happening with my refund.
"First of all, don't get this tablet for anything other than media consumption. It's too slow and too janky for any productivity uses, including simple tasks we take for granted on a decent phone.Secondly, and more importantly, this is falsely advertised as having 128GB of storage. It actually comes with 64GB. I've brought this to Amazon's attention, but they seemed disinclined to fix the product page. 64GB is a paltry amount of storage at the time of writing (almost 2023), even for a low-range tablet only suitable for media consumption... and the lack of a correction by Amazon is extremely concerning."
"Big Lenovo fan here, but this tablet ain't it. Quite slow and clunky moving between apps.Plays YouTube and Netflix well, but what device doesn't in 2023?Spend the extra money and get something a bit more powerful.Edit: Was 3 stars, but this thing has only gotten worse. Very slow, battery is dying quickly. Pass on this one."
"I love my Lenovo Laptop so, I thought I'd try the tablet and take it with me.  I totally HATE it.  It crashes all the time and turns off constantly eventhough I have it set to stay on all the time.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
"purchased a 128 gb - received a 64 gb.  no user manual (looked on website no user manual -- just an illustration of tablet openings etc.  garbage  about adding card (no info on what type of card etc.) most of google apps will not run on a card -- wanted l18 gb for dowing loading videos, music, books, etc.  google video apps will not use card."
Very slow and clunky.
touchscreen response randomly double-taps for desired single-tap. Renders it useless!
"Worked great for 5 months, then would not power up.  Have sent back to Lenovo for repair.  I've had 3 Samsung tablets and all have worked without problems for years (over 10 years).  Have also used Lenovo desktop and laptop PCs for decades without any issues.  Disapointed this tablet is poor quality."
"The performance on this tablet is horrible. Navigating the pages and switching between apps is slow. It frequently becomes unresponsive. The only thing this is good for is browsing the web, but even that can be sluggish."
paid for 128 gb but got 64gbno video on netflix out of the box/ you must update the system all the way(like 4 or so updates) which took 3 hours.lenovo saved money by adding a 10w charger but you can use a pd charger with 20w so it will charge half the time :-)then it worked.
The color went gray and pink and never could get it back.
"I am no noob when it comes to setting up e-devices.  I have been buying and setting up computers of all descriptions since the early 80's and have been addicted to cell phones since the early '90's.  I have no idea how many of these I have set up for myself and others.  Probably in the hundreds.  I bought the tablet to run the Nook software, as my Nook Color died and B&N is no longer making it.  As my collection of over 1200 books includes a lot of books for which color is imperative (non-fiction books, especially cookbooks, instructional books, and travel books) I needed to use a tablet as the android apps are the only ones that currently can access book photos in color.  The tablet does run that app, and it does it fairly well.  Any nits I have to pick with the performance would be with the software, not the tablet.My problems with the tablet are many.  I bought the package which contained the tablet, the cover, and the screen protector.  The cover does not function well when the tablet is in use, though it does provide good protection when the tablet is not in use.  For me, it is hinged on the wrong side.  When I use the tablet in landscape mode, I would prefer to be able to open the cover from the bottom and flip it back over the top.  You can sort of do that, but many apps are then upside down because the tablet does not actually show all apps in every direction.  Tucking the front cover under the tablet is really awkward, as it does not stay tucked very well--no latch of any kind keeps it in place, it just sort of flaps.  In theory,  the cover is supposed to fold into a prop to support the screen, but it does not stay in position.  It keeps falling away.  I suppose it might work on a desk--but I didn't buy a tablet to use on a desk.  I have a computer with a real screen on my desk.  The tablet is to be used when I am sitting on the sofa or lying in bed.  I may also use it in a moving car or train.  The screen protector is a bust.  I carefully followed the instructions (not my first screen protector, by far).  Nevertheless, it did not adhere correctly and there is a bubble on one corner where the screen protector will not stick to the screen.  The tablet is also pretty heavy for a handheld device.  About twice the weight of the Noook I replaced.  After an hour of reading my wrist feels the weight.  I would gladly trade an inch or so of screen size for a lighter device.  So much for the physical aspects.I bought a micro SD card which should work with the tablet.  (Samsung does not actually specify which cards will or will not work, but the SanDisk 512 seems to meet all the requirements.)  The instructions for installation were hard to get to.  You don't actually get a user manual either in pdf or paper, you must use an online version.  The location of the slot is not actually identified in the instructions, you have to look around the perimeter of the tablet looking for something that has a hole for the pin.  Then the pin doesn't work the first 20 times I tried to insert it perfectly perpendicular to the tablet.  The hole is too large and it is hard to find whatever it is I am supposed to make contact with.  Then, when it finally pops out a bit, it is really hard to pull out.  This concerns me because computers are delicate and using force is just about always not a good idea.  The micro SD card will only fit in the carrier one way, so that is not much of a problem, even using tweezers to avoid touching the card with fingers.  I carefully inserted the card with the carrier in the same position as it was when it came out.  Problem is, the tablet is not seeing the card.  No help in the manual for troubleshooting this.  In settings>battery and device care>storage the sd card simply does not appear.  No troubleshooting tips.  Without the SD card I can only download a few books at a time, so my ""library"" is largely a sunk cost that is not easily accessed.  So the primary reason for purchasing the tablet is really only half a success.The pluses:  the browsers work well, I can easily switch between apps via the task bar.  It was relatively easy to install the client for my Reolink security cameras.  That, too, is easily reached from the task bar.  The screen is adequate for my uses.  I do some reading of news, etc. and that works well.  One can view movies, but I would not use a tablet to watch a movie.  I do those on higher def, larger screens.I am not a fan of touch screens, but this one is as good as any other I have used.  The print is clear in various sizes, photos display quite well for the size, internet sites are good.  Obviously, I do not want a keyboard and mouse for reading books or the other quick things I do on the tablet.  The point is that it is very mobile within the house and easy to access and use compared to a laptop or desktop.  The problem with any touch screen is that they are constantly in need of cleaning.  The screen protector makes that pretty simple, the actual screen is not touched and the protector is easily wiped clean, though the corner that does not adhere must be carefully wiped.  It is possible to go into the settings and turn on or off different swiping motions that can be accidentally triggered by motions within certain apps.  I do like that option because reading in bed or in a chaise lounge can easily produce various swipe-like movements if I fall asleep or if the dog decides to join me.Recharging is easy and quick enough for my purposes.  I use the tablet for only a few hours each evening, so it currently can go 5 or 6 nights without recharging, though I tend to recharge it far more often.It may be convenient to look into syncing the calendar with the one on my phone.  As my current phone is also a Samsung Galaxy I imagine that would be really easy to do, though I haven't tried it yet, the sync feature is in the menu.  I would want to look into privacy issues before starting that, but this could be a nice feature and I am glad that it is there.I think that perfection, for me, might have been a smaller screen, that would have been lighter and a pre-installed micro SD card.  I might eventually ditch the cover and go with a 3rd party substitute that would protect the device when it is not in use, but be out of the way when I am using the tablet.  I would also love a USB port.  Unfortunately, many of the options I would like are only available on the larger tablets and bigger is definitely not the direction I want.  I would gladly pay more for a better quality smaller screen with more muscle in the box.  The larger screens start moving into laptop computer area.  I already have several of those for various purposes and do not need another.  The point of the tablet is to have something that is much bigger than a cell phone but also much smaller and compact than a laptop.So I give the tablet 3 stars.  It is not what I want or what I had hoped for, but it can be made to do at least some of what I need it for.  Others will undoubtedly have other priorities."
"The Samsung A8 is near bottom of the Samsung line up of tablets.  It comes in two memory sizes, 3gb and 4gb versions starting at 64gb of storage.  Let me start by saying, there is no reason whatsoever to buy the 32gb variant as it comes with only 3gb of physical ram.  That extra gig of ram is what makes this tablet worth the money.  I only recommend the 4gb variant, and find the 64gb storage model is really the sweet spot with this tablet.  So let's get into the review.The first thing I noticed is the weight.  It is a heavy tablet.  This is not a deterrent to me as I do most of my gaming using an Xbox controller (bluetooth) so I am not holding onto the tablet for long periods of time.  This is good because the weight of it becomes cumbersome very quickly.  The 10.5"" screen is good, not great, but good.  The tablet resolution, while not fantastic does allow HD playback on netflix.  This is a nice touch.  There is however, a one inch bezel round the screen.  This makes the tablet look dated, as the era of large bezels is well beyond us.  The only good thing about such large bezels is it gives the user a place to put their fingers when holding onto the tablet.  The screen is quite bright, although the glossy surface does make use in bright environments difficult.  My biggest issue with the screen is that it does not brighten or darken well when there is a change of lighting environment.  This is a feature we have become used to, so it feels like a real miss in terms of ease of use.There are four speakers on this tablet on top and bottom (portrait mode) and they get quite loud.  Don't expect audiophile quality here, but they do the trick, and were able to create a wide soundstage when watching a movie.  I would recommend the use of a quality earphone solution.  I use QE2 monitor headphones and the sound was much better.  There is no EQ baked into the OS, which is a letdown.There are few buttons on the side, a volume rocker, power switch and an earphone jack as well as USB C charging.  It does support Bluetooth, which is good.  I was able to have music playing on the tablet, and wash dishes in the kitchen while the tablet remained in the living room without any loss in signal.  I also used it at the laundromat, with the tablet in a backpack, and was able to stay connected.  One thing that is missing with the Bluetooth is hearing aid compatibility.  While I can download the hearing aid app, connecting my aids to the tablet is another thing.  Most hearing aid connections are established through the accessibility options in settings, however, Samsung chose not to include any hearing aid connections in their accessibility options.  This is a huge miss.  Those of us who are reliant upon hearing aids will find their experience reduced as a result.  Considering this connection is just a software fix, not having it is a huge middle finger to the deaf community.  Shame on you Samsung.  The battery life is okay, but when connected to a 30 watt charger, it did recharge quite quickly.  Unfortunately it comes with a very low wattage wall wart, so I recommend buying a higher wattage charger.This comes with Android 11.  I installed a few apps such as the Kindle app which surprisingly works much better as an app then the native program on the Kindle HD 10.  I also installed a few games, Asphalt 9, Castle Wreck, Bubble shooter and Klondike Forever and lastly the You Version Bible app. None of those apps besides  the kindle were available in the Kindle app store.  All the apps worked well enough, although Castle Wreck did cause the tablet to slow down due to the amount of rendering involved in that game, and the low amount of physical ram.So why should you buy this tablet?  If you don't want to pay for a pad from another fruity company, but want more than can be had from the Kindle HD 10 this is for you.  That is really the best comparison to The Samsung A8.  Provided you purchase a 4gb model, it functions much better than the HD 10, the biggest advantage is native access to the Google Play Store, and a full fat version of Android 11.  Don't expect a feature rich tablet like the S line of Samsung, but if you are interested in light web browsing, casual gaming and reading, as well as streaming media playback, this tablet will work well.So in the end, this tablet is a good enough introduction to the tablet market.  With the affordable price, it is a good tablet for children, classrooms with a good screen protector and case, or for that family member who could use a tablet, but would not have the use of a more expensive unit.  I started this review by recommending only the 4gb models, (64/128 storage).  Believe me, you will notice a difference.  4gb of ram is quite low by today's standards, and you will notice that in the performance.  Web pages refresh a little to quickly, and after a day of use, the tablet will become noticeably slower, requiring a reboot.  This can be mitigated a bit by fully shutting off programs, (swiping up, and swiping away open programs) as well as limiting notifications.  As of now, there is no indication that Samsung intends to update this tablet to Android 12, but perhaps there will be a work around.  Be careful, as the A8 is very low in specifications, and forcing a newer OS unintended for the product might cause it to age quicker then designed.Overall the A8 does meet my needs, and while not wonderful in any way, it gets the job done under $400, which is a plus."
"Updated 6/26/23Other than maybe another year of quarterly security updates there will not be any further Android updates beyond Android 13.  The latest security update is June 1, 2023.I am waiting on the Tab A9.  So far, no definite word on whether there will be one.  It  will be a shame if there isn't one because the Tab A8 once updated is a nice little tablet and meets my tablet needs.  Not much power but I only use it for reading.  I have a half a dozen or so reading apps besides the Kindle app and all are updated regularly.I would be disappointed if there is no Tab 9 because I dislike using Android tablets are not getting Android version updates or security updates.  Going to the Tab S series just to get the latest updates given the Tab S series prices would not be my preference.The Tab A8 has served my needs nicely, but I don't like using Android devices with old versions of Android especially when also are no longer getting security updates.Updated 9/21/22Beware the model they send you.  There is more than one model of the TabA8.  Unfortunately I received model SM-X200.  The Samsung updates to this model are horrendous and as a result pose a security risk to the user.  it is still on Android 11, One UI 3.1 and Android May 2022 security patch.I read somewhere, not confirmed that Samsung is not updating this model of the TabA8 to Android 12 and may update it to Android 13 at some point in time after Android 13 becomes available.I also have a TabA7 released one year before the TabA8  and Samsung updated my TabA7 to Android 12 months ago.  Also, Samsung keeps the TabA7 up to date on Android Security patchesThe TabA8 works fine that is why I am not giving it a one star rating  It is also very slow to charge.  A lot slower than the TabA7.I can not recommend the SM-X200 model of the TabA8 at all.  Maybe if you are in a different location this model of the TabA8 will update.Updated 3/22/22 See bottom of reviewNot reviewed for typos.I ordered a 4 x 64 version.  The box said 4 x 64.  The actual device as a 3 x 32.  I contacted Amazon about the problem and they sent the correct replaement immediately and I received the replacement on the same date that i was scheduled to receive the originalNow about the Tab A8.  I had previously purchased a Tab A7 3 x 64 from Amazon.  You should be able to find my review of it on Amazon.  This review is bascially a comparison of the A8 with the A7.First off.  I recommend against buying the A8, 3 x 32  It wasn't unitl I had used Switch to copy over my apps and data from the A7 to the original A8 that I received that I discovered they had sent me a 3 x 32 intead of a 4 x 64.  If you order the 64GB version of the A8 it automatically comes with 4GB RAM.In any case the transfer of the apps and data from the A7 3 x 64 to the A8 3 x 32 took close to two hours using Samsung Switch.  Transferring the data from the A7 to the A8, 4 x 64 took less than 15 minutes.  There is no doubt that the extra 1GB  RAM and 32GB of memory makes a big difference.  The Tab A7 with 64GB is a very nice tablet but compared to the Tab A8 with 64GB the Tab 8A is signficantly faster.  I opened multiple apps and switched between them without any lag.As I have posted before I am no gamer so I can't comment of the gaming capabilities of either tablet but when it comes to everything else including downloading and installing updates the Tab A8 64GB is noticeably faster than the Tab A7 64GBThe display comparison is bit more complicated.  The sharpness of the display is better on the A7 but the Tab A8 display at 10.5"" vs 10.4"" of the Tab A7 is more boxy and looks more like a desktop display than a tablet display.  I put up a video on the Tab A8 and a 23"" Samsung desktop display monitor.  While some of the picture is lost on the Tab A8 it isn't a lot compared to the Tab A7 which crops off a good deal of the top and bottom.For some reason, the Tab A7 has a better; i.e., signficantly louder audio than the Tab A8 both running on Android 11 with Samsung UI 3.1.  The Tab A8 audio is good for watching videos etc but the Tab A7 can give you room type audio when you are listening to music.  I can't judge the distortion but in any case while the Tab 8A audio is fine the Tab A7 audio is better.While neither the Tab A7 or A8 batteries will charge very fast I haven't noticed much diffenece between the two with the Tab A8 charging a bit faster using the Samsung charging block and cable that came with the Tab A8.  No comment on battery draing speed as that will always vary based upon usage.  I ams satisfied with the battery drain speed on both the Tab A7 and Tab A8,  Then again I don't play games.Final comment.  The Tab A8 is year newer so it came with Android 11 vs Android 10 for Tab A7.  So it should get one more Android update and Samsung related UI update down the road.  Both are nice tablets but the extra GB of RAM along with a different CPU makes the Tab A8 a lot more enjoyable to use.Update 3/22/22Heptics -  The heptics on the Tab A8 are super sensitive which makes for very light touches.  On the Tab A7 the heptics are not nearly as sensitive.Startup -  With the Tab A8 there is very little impact on usage immediately upon startup after logging in.  Upon login you should be able to alsmost immediately begin doing whatever.  On the Tab A7 you have to wait for software like anti-malware to do their thing after login before you can do much of anything.  The wait time will vary depending on your software.For that reason I don't turn off the Tab A7 except when I know I won't be using it for an extended period, like a day or more.  I think the extra GB of RAM in the Tab A8 makes the difference since both my Tab A8 and Tab A7 are loaded with identical software including Android 11 and Samsung 3.1 UI.Battery - Samsung UI 3.1 does a good job of saving battery after it learns which takes a few days.  Therefore, leaving the Tab A8 or Tab A7 on does not drain much battery once the devices are optimized by the Samsung software as long as you turn off the display when the devices are not in use.  I also recommend turning off the display for playing music, streaming or otherwise if you want to save on battery drain.In order to assure continuous playing of music when the display is off you have go to the music playing app and turn on allow in battery saving mode."
"I bought the 32 GB internal storage and 3 GB RAM version, which is the cheapest model due to it being on sale. If this will be your go-to, main tablet then I would suggest upgrading to a version with more RAM and internal storage. Others say the 64 GB internal storage doesn't experience any studder performance with the device.  This 32 GB internal storage (3 GB RAM) studders through swipes and many other operations. I am still going to keep it though, because I only have a few purpose for this device.  Sufficient to use for reading books, but just make sure it's not under the bright sun. It allows me to watch YouTube TV, YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max, just fine, but I tell you I come from owning an old IPAD Air that does not even qualify for the latest IOS update today.  That IPAD is just as smooth if not smoother than this tablet, however due to the IOS (12.x) being outdated, it cannot run many applications. This Samsung SM-x200 A8 tablet can run all the applications that I want to use today. Here are the PROs and CONs from my perspective:PRO:- Newer device that runs most application today that I use.- External MicroSD card feature.- Cheap price, waaaaay cheaper than Apple Ipads.CON:- Studders with 32 GB internal storage and 3 GB RAM.- Screen brightness not that bright, but useable. Glossy screen reflects under the sun so probably not that great outdoors.Summary - Battery life is OK, I think it isn't that impressive but up to 8 hours+ of usage is not terrible. Upgrade to the higher internal storage/memory model versions to avoid studdering I guess, other reviewers say the tablet is better with more internal storage.  I believe with higher amount of internal storage, Samsung also increases the RAM to 4 GB RAM, but I'd double check before you buy on that information. The software applications installs on the internal storage, and I have not been able to figure out if they can be installed on the external MicroSD card.  On the other hand, you CAN move the data many or most of the ""data"" that the installed applications use to the external MicroSD card. Speakers are loud and clear, really like it. The WIFI connection is okay, but I bet overall tablet performance would be WAY better if there was slightly more RAM internally (3 GB vs 4 GB). This tablet supposedly is compatible with up to 1 TB of external MicroSD storage, and I have one on order that's arriving soon.  If is not compatible with the 1 TB MicroSD card, I will update my review and mention it, but I do not anticipate any problems.I do not use this tablet as my main source of electronic device though (I prefer my higher performance laptop), so this is why I will keep it even though I think the performance for this lower-tier performance device is a bit lacking. It works very well for watching streaming services, reading books and minor browsing. If you are okay with the studdering performance here and there, then this is an inexpensive product to have on a budget. It connects to my home network NAS just fine, I can plug in the USB-C power cord and let it stream news all day, no issues (for now). I'm sure after a few years this tablet will be obsolete just like my Ipad Air has become, but it will have served its purpose."
"You get what you pay for, I guess.  My tablet is one month from being a year old and I'm having issues with it.  It won't always charge.  I've tried different charges and of course outlets but sometimes it just won't charge. Then a day or so later I decides it will.  I have a feeling it isn't going to last much longer which is sad.  This device is also VERY slow.  I'm so used to the quick response I get on my phone that using the tablet can be frustrating.I can deal with the slowness for the price but I shouldn't be experiencing charging issues at less than a year old. I guess tablets are just like our phones, made to last a year, two if you're lucky.It's a throw away society. (and we wonder why our landfills are so full.)Overall if you are looking for cheap this is your best pick."
"I had high hopes for this tablet, thinking that it would be great for my need, which is nothing much, just a wall mounted tablet that displays a browser displaying my home automation controls. However, early on I quickly realize that this might not be as good as I thought it would be. Tablet was laggy and sometimes non-responsive but after several updates, it felt like it ran much better and smoother. It was sort of disappointing because it was not that much better than my nearly 10 year old Lenovo tablet, that until now is still functioning, just really outdated. Even my Pixel 3XL phone from 2018 runs circles around this tablet.FYI, a word of advice: If you're planning on using this for your HA wall mounted dashboard, be adviced that your security camera stream might not be playable on this device. My Wyze cam 2K WebRTC stream could not be decoded by the tablet and would not stream. And it's not a missing feature, it's just not strong enough. It is able to decode and stream the substream version from the camera, but it looks like hot garbage.Anyways, back to why I wrote this review. Yesterday, out of nowhere, the tablet just completely stopped working. No matter what I do, it won't boot back up. Nothing on display, no charging animation, nothing. Less than 5 months after I purchased it, it just died. The tablet showed no signs of abnormality, nor are there physical signs of defect, such as battery swells etc. I left it charged overnight and still does not boot up.And so I reached out to Samsung support chat and explained to the guy my situation. After providing him with all the info he requested, he proceeded to tell me that my tablet is out of warranty and almost immediately, without any signs of empathy for my situation, began to spew all these repair options that I have to pay in order to get my tablet working. I was so furious with his style of support I completely lost any respect for him and became really blunt. I bluntly asked him how many months of warranty does my tablet come with and why in the world do I have to pay for repair for something that I just purchased? After I confronted him did he asked me for my proof of purchase, and after I sent it to him, he finally said that my tablet is actually still under warranty and they will take care of the repair.Let this be a reminder to everyone who owns this tablet. If you ever need support from Samsung, do not solely rely on your serial number! In Samsung's database, there doesn't seem to be a way for them to correlate your serial number with your purchase date, and as such, they will most likely tell you that your tablet it out of warranty. If you know your tablet is purchased less than a year, make sure you tell them that and immediately provide them with your proof of purchase.I know Samsung service has always been dodgy at best, but instantly telling people their device is out of warranty is a nefarious way to do business. Can you imagine all the folks who are not aware of their rights to warranty and when they reached out to Samsung for support, the support person instantly tells them their device is out of warranty and you have to shell out hundreds of dollars to repair it! While Samsung finally covered my repairs, I still want people to be aware of how Samsung operates. Hopefully they will learn from this and change their warranty process. Also FYI, it's almost 24 hours since they approved my warranty claim, and yet they still have not sent me a return label that they promised. I just lost a whole day from the whole process, which they said can take up to a whole week."
"I bought one of the Samsung Tab A8 tablets, as pictured, in Jan of 2023. Seemed like a nice little tablet with plenty of whatever I would need, especially internet access.Screen is a little odd, when it comes to anything with detail. I've been fine with that little glitch and frankly, never notice it anymore.The major problem for me is that it loses the internet connection on a very regular basis. Let's say I watch a quick video (5 min)  and I decide to watch another.If I click on anything else, task wise, video ir just a olain Google search, it just sits with a spiral line that will go for as long as 20 minutes. Sometimes it says ""no internet"" all the while my TV is fine and so is everything else online at the time.I don't know that I would recommend this particular unit to anyone, because I've researched this model heavily and it's a common problem with the Tab A model but not the S models, with a different processor.To be fair, I never tried ro send it back to Amazon, but I just didn't want the lengthy process of trying  to return it past the ""return"" deadline.Anyway,  I wish I could have read a review like the one I have submitted,  because I wouldn't have waisted time turning off the wifi, then turning it back on to regain internet access. Because that happens several times, each time I use it for any length of time.It was a good deal at $175 at the tine, but was it?Just a fair review after almostntwo years if owning this unit.Good luck."
"The Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 10.5‚Äù 64GB Android Tablet is a pretty sweet deal, but there's one quirky hiccup ‚Äì the screen loves playing peekaboo. Loaded with a crisp LCD screen, built-in kids content, and Smart Switch for smooth data transfers, this tablet is a winner...mostly.Here's the catch: hold it the wrong way and poof, the screen goes dark. It‚Äôs like the tablet has its own secret nap time. I‚Äôve poked around in the settings, whispered sweet nothings to it, and even tried holding it upside down (because, why not?), but nothing fixes it. It's a head-scratcher and super annoying, so I‚Äôm only giving it three stars.If Samsung could just send this glitch on a permanent vacation, the Galaxy Tab A8 would be fantastic. Right now, though, it's a great device with a touch of mischief that might make you question your sanity.Bottom line: The Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 is a great tablet that occasionally plays peekaboo with its screen. If you don't mind the occasional game of hide-and-seek with your display, it's worth the buy. Otherwise, you might want to wait for Samsung to send this glitch packing!"
"I've had a Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 for almost three years and have been generally very happy with it, except for the storage. So when I saw a really good price on this new A8 (pennies under $200) with 128 GB instead of 32 I thought with it being a newer version but not so brand new (2022 version, so almost two years) that they haven't worked out the bugs yet it'd be perfect for the price.The A8 took longer to charge and held a charge less time than the A7, but it's not awful. I'm just surprised that hasn't improved since the older version but instead declined.The BIG issue (not just mine, I've read comments on Amazon, threads on Reddit and more, even customers on Samsung) is ***WiFi connectivity*** - it disconnects from WiFi frequently!! It usually reconnects within 20-30 seconds, but not always.Once it even disabled WiFi. Like there was no Internet and I went to settings to check WiFi and it showed it was turned on and connected to my network but the whole WiFi option was dimmed and when I clicked on it nothing happened. I had working WiFi on my phone, A7, and TV -- in fact, I was watching live TV on Hulu -- so there was no problem with my Internet. I finally restarted the tablet and a few minutes later it was up and normal without any further action from me.I read a thread on Reddit with a fix that has worked for some and I did it. It's something you'd never ever figure out without techy help. I was really excited to see if it would work for me! The fix was extremely temporary. It didn't take long to start disconnecting again, and with total usage of maybe two hours one day it disconnected WiFi about a dozen times -- well, a few of those were consecutive (like okay I'll just twiddle my thumbs while you disconnect, reconnect, DC, RC...).This was a deal breaker after reading how WiFi connectivity has been an issue since they released this version and other users say it gets even worse as time goes on. And those who have contacted Samsung about it just get the usual stock responses then they say if it still happens it must be a defective device so either return it if it's new or send it to us for repair, then when they do send it Samsung claims there's nothing wrong with it. Samsung should well know by now that it's a common problem.The day I decided to factory reset and return I picked up the A8 and this time WiFi was still toggled on but I wasn't connected to any network, even though both my 5G (default) and regular passwords were saved and set to auto reconnect. When I tried to select any network, even those of my neighbors, nothing happened. Again I had to restart the device. This time I had to add my networks and passwords all over again. And again no problems with TV, A7, or phone. Just the brand new A8!I need a tablet that I can use every day, not an expensive paperweight, so I returned it while still new enough to get a refund. If they would fix this one thing I would love to have this tablet, but if it disconnects several times the first day I can only imagine how bad it would be in a few months... Or years! And what if it decided to not work after a restart?I realize that not every single A8 has this problem, but it is common enough for me to not be willing to pay for another one or recommend it to anyone else."
"I bought this a year or so ago mainly to be a screen that worked with my Nordic Track treadmill and IFit app.It does work as I wanted but there are a few issues with how long it takes to start up and that it is not reliable to connect to wifi unless I restart it every time I want to use it.  I don't mind the restarting, but it takes several minutes to go through that process. I have learned to live with it but less than ideal when other tablets I have used load in two minutes or less.I also do not like the user interface and there does not seem to be a way around that. Every time I turn it off I have to put in my pin and then put it again once it starts.  Seems like there should be an option to not have to fiddle so much with it.So it is okay- three stars, but I would have looked for something with quicker response and more reliable connection to wifi if I had to do it over again."
"I bought this device for my Neice to use to occupy her child when she has things to do. This device did not survive a toddlers use very long because, of touch screen design flaws.I prefer using a mouse and a keyboard with my PC and a basic standard mobile phone with a push button keypad and scroll buttons for the LED settings menu (if I could find one) rather than using touch screen devices because, when the touch screen is deactivated by constant swiping and or the decoupling of screen protectors, the devices touch feature cannot be readily repaired. When using a mouse or keyboard that wear out, you can replace them however when touch screen stops working, your only alternatives are to take it to a technician to repair it or you are forced to replace the entire device. Push button mobile phones are more reliable and not as easily damaged as these overly delicate so-called smart devices are. The push-button age should not be abandoned in favor of a touch screen age.  Tech companies need to abandon this touch screen technology altogether because it is not senior and toddler friendly. When vision and manual dexterity issues develop, touch screen devices are too difficult for a visually impaired 70-year-old stroke victim like me to use.  I would not recommend this overly delicate device for seniors, heavy-handed persons, or children under the age of three. Update: letting the battery power run down to 0% and then recharging the battery restored the tablet to full function. It seems that the device had locked out all touchscreen functions arbitrarily due to repetitive pin number entry requests that my niece's child had access to during regular use. The touchscreen restart and power off icons were locked out along with all other functions. Power off and restart should not be touchscreen activated only. There should be two small push buttons on the side of the device to facilitate a manual restart and power off in all new versions of this device so that users don't have to wait for the battery to die to restart the tablet. Touchscreen technology is too unreliable to use because of excessive security protocols and without access to these push button restoration features. Samsung and Apple designers should incorporate these features so that when touchscreen fails to work, you can rely on these push button restart and power off functions to reset it."
"First off, it's a good tablet and I can recommend it. With some caveats.It's suitable for watching videos if you can find a streaming source with good quality sound. It's good for reading, clear and the right size screen. With wifi you should be able to skype or zoom just fine, but be aware of the camera set up. The screen size is great without becoming unmanageable. Much larger would be too much, but 10.1"" is what I had before and that worked for me as well.The camera for the front (facing the same way the screen is) has been set on the lengthwise edge. So if you'r going to set this up for video chats, you will need to keep the long side up.The usb port is USB Type C, which is a different plug than what you may be used to if you've been using a Type Micro-B (very common on cell phones and desk tops now.) Be careful you are getting the cabling you anticipate. Also the cable for charging is very short. Don't expect to both charge and use the tablet at the same time much.Important to note, if you're expecting to add a micro-SD card to increase storage, you will find there is no slot for that. Should that be your intent, look at another tablet. As it happens, 128G is more than adequate for my needs, I suspect 64G would be pushing my luck. I've been using a tablet with 16G internal storage and a micro-SD flash drive but found there are a lot of things Android will not let you store off to the flash drive. The large internal storage will alleviate that issue for me, but consider if this is what YOU want.I struggled doing the transfer between my old tablet and the new one, but this turned out to be because the new one needed to update the data moving tool a few times to match what I downloaded to my old tablet. Go figure. Once connected it went smoothly."
"I purchased the Galaxy Tab A8 for mapping offroad trails due to its onboard compass integrated with a GPS navigation and tracking program, specifically GAIA GPS.  I currently use a Galaxy Tab S6 for this purpose, but the S6 does not have a built-in compass.  I expected the Tab A8's compass to improve the navigation in the track-up display.  Without a compass, the vehicle direction arrow will wander whenever the vehicle stops, making direction interpretation difficult.  After using the Tab A8, I was very disappointed.  Read off for our impressions:The Good:  --  VERIFIED TAB A8 HAS COMPASS:  The Samsung manual or help search does not mention anything regarding the Tab A8 built-in compass, nor does it have any installed app or calibration process documentation.  However, I verified that Tab A8 did have a compass by installing a compass app and seeing the App point to magnetic north.  --  BRIGHT SCREEN:  The screen is bright when the brightness is turned to 100% and adequate to view when inside a vehicle during the day.  --  OK COLOR AND RESOLUTION:  The display is not as crisp as the Tab S7 but still provides a nice display.The Bad:--  COMPASS DOESN'T WORK WITH GAIAGPS: When using the Tab A8 with Gaia GPS, the vehicle direction arrow again would wander when I stopped the vehicle or precisely the issue I hoped to correct with the onboard Tab A8's built-in compass.--  SLOW UPDATE:  Comparing the  Tab S6 to the Tab A8, the A8 has a visibly slower update when tracking vehicle movement, providing a jerky update.--  GAIA GPS LOCKS UP:  After a few minutes of running, GAIAGPS will lock up, requiring an App restart.  The same issue exists with the smaller Tab A7, making both Tablets unusable with GAIAGPS.  But the Tab S6 does not have this issue.Conclusion:  The Galaxy Tab A8 is not compatible with GAIAGPS, so I will continue to use the Galaxy Tab S6"
"I like the size of the A8. I like the brightness, I usually hardly ever have to turn up the brightness beyond about 15% of maximum!I don‚Äôt like the slow processor it it. There are lots of slow app loadings, stutters.  The colors are muted and just ‚Äòoff‚Äù.  The boot times are abysmal. Takes forever and a day.  Also, upgrading apps takes a huge amount of time, crazy long compared to an iPhone 7 Plus (2016) or Samsung A53 (2022). The Unisoc chip is a joke, especially with what Samsung is charging for this device.  I will not be buying another Samsung tablet.They, and it is Samsung, keep you from off loading your apps onto a microSD card. Android lets you, it‚Äôs Samsung that neuters this functionality. The reason they give is that it would degrade performance. This might have been true in 2005, but not in 2022. MicroSD card read write speeds are hugely improved. And with A1 or A2 certified cards, random read/write speeds are extremely fast. And the Unisoc chip is the bottleneck, not the storage here. So, if you want one of these, get one on a deep discount, if at all.  And if you get one thinking that you can put apps on your card, think again!  Oh, 32GB models?  Really Samsung?  After the OS and a few additional programs there isn‚Äôt much left for storage.  NO ONE in the year 2022 should be putting any computing device out there with anything less than 128GB of onboard storage.  Oh, and why are we still waiting for Android 12 in September of 2022?!  Really?  Android 12 was already out when this device was released!Next time, I will save my money and buy an iPad.  It‚Äôs updated faster, has more, better apps, that are better vetted.  Or I‚Äôll save a lot of money and buy a cheap Lenovo or something. They at least will let me offload apps to microSD.  Oh, and they have the FM receiver enabled, which Samsung disables (no FM for the A8 or any other Samsung device)."
Difficult to use
"This tablet does tablet things and is quite average in its features. Somehow, it is substantially slower than my 5 year old Kindle and experiences some crashes. I am firmly convinced that Samsung is not capable of making a good product.  The notion that is the best overall choice in its price bracket has not been reflected in my experience of owning this product for around a year."
"I bought this to replace a tablet that died.  I have previous experience with Samsung and am usually pleased with their products. NOT THIS ONE.  I turn my tablet off when not in use and this one boots sooo slooooowly. I takes it 3 to 4 minutes to give me a login prompt.  On top of it is glitchy when running apps downloaded from the Google store. My DoorDash app keeps shutting down in the middle of an order.  Had issues with other apps too.  I keep the software updated but that is apparently of no help. This is just a bad product. It is too late to return it and I really do not want to spend money on a more expensive version.  My advice is to stay away.  Sorry Samsung, you lost a repeat customer here."
"I'm s true blue Samsung Galaxy girl but I'm quite disappointed with this tablet. I've had this for 1 years almost on the dot . It looks good, works well, I love it. Except that just last week, all of a sudden it would not hold a charge. Tried everything and it stopped .  I'm really upset about this. I'm going to get another Samsung to replace this but if it breaks in such a short time I'll be forced to change brands. I don't want to do that bc then I'd have to learn everything all over."
"Loud speakers, but it‚Äôs a very slow tablet for multiple tasking, 4GB in todays apps doesn‚Äôt deliver the performance needed."
Lack of RAM and sometime unresponsive
"If you're looking for something fast, this isn't the one. Once it boots up (which takes forever) it does job, but slowly."
"I bought it Dec 2022 and now I can't get it to charge. I've tried different cables and blocks and outlet. Anyone know it this tablet can be repaired?Other than the charging issue, I like it"
"Pros: easy to set up since I have a Samsung Galaxy S21 plus phone. Comes loaded with Playstore, among other apps. (I purchased this tablet because I don't have access to Bally Sports app on my Kindle. I can access the Bally app on our Amazon firesticks with my cable TV code--go figure. I just prefer to watch hockey on a tablet and a lot of my fav NHL team's games will be on Bally exclusively this year). Processor adequate so there isn't blur when watching fast hockey game.  I dont know if that would carry over to playing video games or not.The A $15 Fintie cover fits perfectly and is easy to put on/take off the tablet.CONS: The green cast to the face of light-skinned people. It looks like the zombie apocalypse.  The only adustment available on the tablet that affects the green is the brightness. I found a spot on the brightness scale that is not too awful for purpose of watching sports but I'd never choose to watch movie/TV on the A8. Not only is the green an issue but overall color saturation and warmth is very inferior to my Kindle HD 10. The Kindle's picture is very comparable to the picture on my S21 plus in terms of color, warmth, and ""3-D-ness"" of the picture. The Samsung picture is overall flat and cheap-looking. Colors are muted. I don't want to pay for a more expensive tablet that would presumably have a better picture.  Apparently this isn't an issue that can be fixed because there's plenty of info online about the intractibility of the Samsung green screen problem."
"I like this tablet, when it's on and working.  It has all that one might expect from a Samsung product, and the Android operating system works fine.  Unfortunately, there are two huge problems with it, which, although only in the way intermittently, are extremely frustrating.  First, when it comes time to charge it, I can use only one charger in my house.  I have several scattered around, which every chargeable item I own can plug into and get charged by without a problem.  This one only works on one particular charger.  This appears to be a consistent problem with Samsung's tablets because I've had the same issue with previous ones, and the reason I bought this one was that my old one had completely stopped taking a charge.  I've had this one for only several months, and it worked with the charger in my office until a few days ago, so it isn't looking good.  The other problem is that it takes forever to boot up when you restart it.  Every time I turn it on, I'm worried it's broken because it boots up so slowly.  I've used their phones and tablets for years because of a much better price point, but it looks like the phones have become as expensive as another brand I won't name, and their tablets are going downhill."
"This is my fourth Samsung tablet. I like them. I understand how to use them. I like the controls.  I bought this one because i wanted something a little bigger than my 8 inch Galaxy.  And it is. And i like the rose-pink color.  But every so often (once a day, maybe every other day) it goes a bit wonkers.  It will start opening apps, or asking if i want to delete pictures from my gallery (no, i don't). If i'm streaming a video, it will flash in and out of pause mode.  None of my other Samsungs have ever had an issue.  Mostly i do a ""restart"" and it will calm down and be obedient for a while.  But what the heck??? Much too much trouble to get a replacement but i'd sure like a permanent solution to this irritation."
"My experience with the Samsung Tab A8 has been underwhelming, to put it mildly. Right out of the gate, the tablet has shown its flawed craftsmanship by refusing to charge beyond 84%. This isn't a one-time hiccup; it's a persistent issue that has been stealing an hour of my time with every charge since day one. It‚Äôs like buying a dozen eggs and consistently finding one missing - frustrating and inexplicably shortchanged.Moving on to performance, the chipset in the Tab A8 is a recycled shadow of its predecessor, the Samsung Tab A7. It's baffling that Samsung expects consumers to be content with last year‚Äôs hardware at today‚Äôs prices. The chipset, which should be the heart of the device, pumping out speed and efficiency, is more akin to a hamster on a wheel - it‚Äôs working hard, but not going anywhere fast.The A7, in retrospect, was a better investment. It was a balanced blend of cost and functionality. However, the A8 feels like a lazy upgrade, akin to slapping a new coat of paint on an old car and calling it ""new."" The A7 delivered value, while the A8 seems to bank on the assumption that users won't notice or care about the stagnant tech under the hood.The lack of innovation in the Tab A8 is a disservice to the legacy of improvements one expects from new iterations of tech products. It's as if the A8 is the result of a corporate echo chamber where the phrase ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" has been misapplied to justify complacency.In conclusion, if you‚Äôre considering the Samsung Tab A8, prepare to be mired in mediocrity. You're essentially buying last year's model with a new number attached to it and a battery that seems to be on a permanent lunch break. My advice? Look elsewhere or stick with the A7 if you're after value for money. Samsung, with the Tab A8, you have mastered the art of disappointment."
"I am never going to rate a pad 5, since I hate touch screens, so please take that into consideration. This one is pretty good. It's only other issue is that it's surprisingly slow in booting up."
"This tablet works alright when on and fully powered. A bit of lag and delay when handling basic tasks like switching apps, but not a huge issue. The biggest issue for me is that it drains it's battery when not in use VERY fast. If I plan to use it for reading or notes once a week then I need to remember to throw it on the charger the night before. I wish it had a better ability to hold a charge over a span of time. Wouldn't buy again."
"Buy this only if you are a patient person, with lots of time to kill. In my opinion, it is unusably slow right out of the box, and has only gotten slower as time goes on and Samsung has pushed out updates. I've had to use aftermarket tools to disable all of the Samsung non-sense (the Samsung version of every app that comes with Android... why?) just to make it tolerable, but I am looking to replace it already.Other than the performance issues, it is a fine tablet for the money."
"32GB model comes out of the box with 43% of the internal storage used.  I stopped the auto updates before they could download anything more, so it could be even more of the 32GB used.  Luckily expandable memory is an option, but it's still annoying that SAMSUNG insists on including so much bloatware.  It's a slow tablet even when no other apps are seemingly running.  Typing feels imprecise and often laggy, look elsewhere if you intend to use this for any real work or gaming.  The power chord that comes with the tab is annoyingly short.  Otherwise it works perfectly for reading comics, books, watching videos, or listening to music/pods.  It's perfectly weighted and is comfortable holding with one hand or two.  At less than $200 this is a great value, if you must have this tablet go for the 64GB or 128GB models.  They both come with 4GB RAM over the 3GB RAM in the 32GB model.  Any extra speed is needed."
"I bought this tablet for gaming and other entertainment purposes, as a highly portable piece of tech for travel, as well as an oversized remote for my android TVs. It will run any game on the Google Play Store but expect some choppiness before the machine has it fully loaded and ""handling"" the software it's been asked to execute. But it CAN run it. I expected this from my $150 investment and this is why:Samsung Tablet Hardware VASTLY outlives Samsung's willingness to provide Google OS updates which eventually renders the tablet an unusable time capsule.I have owned Samsung tablets for a long time, pretty much since they made ones with styli (pens). The biggest problem with Samsung is they will only support the next year or two of Google's OS updates. Once they stop providing updates, the tablet is basically frozen in time. Apps will continue to get better and more complex, requiring new OS updates.But I still really like Samsung tablets. So I buy only when they are really cheap with the longest, promised by Samsung, years of OS updates. This makes them very disposable, which in turn makes Samsung a not very responsible manufacturer.I really hope that more people do like I do to force companies like Samsung to support their hardware for as long as the hardware can well run current applications. This is so we don't keep dumping electronics in landfills for unnecessary reasons, including phones, tablets, laptops etc."
"First off the battery takes a long time to charge. At times it won't charge at all. I watched it run down from 88% to 21% in 45 minutes. Dont know why.I got this for more memory. 128G was plenty to run my Ultimate Golf game without fear of using up all the storage. Although it did update to Android 13 the over sensitive touch screen causes the game shot meter to move excessively causing off target shots no matter how still I hold my finger. The lag going from scene to scene is excessive and makes the game unplayable. Not so on the Tab A7. No way to adjust it either. This processor is also noticeably slower than the A7. Different manufacturers. The A7 is a Qualcomm, the A8 is not.Secondly this A8 has slower upload speed than the A7.The hypersensitive screen is really annoying especially when gaming.The camera is poor. Low quality and somewhat foggy images along with poor video recording makes this A8 not desired for imaging.Watching a Netflix movie is good, clear and very HD but that's why I have a TV.For the money I expected more."
"OMG I was so happy to get this and I was so happy to get rid of this.On paper it seems like a really good idea.The screen was laggy (or was it the processor)?At least the onboard storage was upgradable by an SD card.But then you discover that battery life is really not good so you're always having to charge it.And then you discover that being a Samsung device they load their version of almost every app that comes with it as part of Android.Why do we need a Samsung media player and a Google media player?Why do we need a Samsung notes app and a Google notes app?Why do we need any Samsung app that also comes with stock Android?You can't delete most of the Samsung apps so now you have 2x the apps you would need, just so Samsung can assert its vanity and say ""Look, here's our name on everything!  Don't forget about us!""And now you also have the Google app store (good) and the Samsung app store (lame).  WHY?!  Why do we need two app stores on a stock device?  Because Samsung said so.Do yourself a favor and look or an Android tablet that is as close to vanilla Android as possible, because this isn't it and any Samsung device will never be it.  Or get an iPad."
"I made sure to read up and watch as many reviews for this tablet before I made the purchase decision, many stating how it was a great performing tablet for a budget price. The first couple days of using it myself had proven to be about on par as to what those reviews said. Then quickly the issues began piling on.Constant app crashing, frame drops on the home screen after waking it up after a whole night, input delays and lots of setting features I couldn't find that are accessible on most other android devices.One of the biggest gripes I had that I just could not find a fix to was it's nature to just randomly kill off any bluetooth devices connected to it. It would refuse to reconnect anything until I either waited an indefinite amount of time or restarted the entire tablet. But it would just kill the bluetooth again when it felt like throwing a tantrum, and Samsung forums were not very helpful, especially when most of the solutions involved going into settings menus that don't exist on this tablet.It has a bit of a chug starting up most games but would handle decently during gameplay for the most part. Though a lot of 3D games ended up putting a struggle on the frames even on low settings.The cameras are fine and work well for video calling and any spur of the moment photo taking you may have and from what I've been told by people I called, the mic isn't half bad.Battery life is surprisingly good and lasts me at least a few days.However, I my plans to use this tablet for internet scrolling, light gaming and messaging just cannot be done on a consistent level with the unpredictable bluetooth disconnections, constant lag and overall performance issues. I can't personally recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a budget tablet."
"Updated 8/22/22 - over the past couple of months things went from okay to bad to worse. it couldn't handle running more than one vid streaming app with anything else without freezing up. tap on an app to open it and just wait and wait for it to respond. bluetooth use finally got so bad it was unusable with anything. the type c port had a short in it. sometimes it would charge and other times it wouldn't.this was to be primarily a tablet for streaming media with but it has so many shortcomings and flaws it couldn't even do that 'low horsepower' work. needless to say i no longer use it and went ahead and purchased the Tab S8+ which is lightyears better in every respect.i would not recommend this tablet whatsoever at this point.the exterior of this tablet is solid and well made. it looks good and i had high expectations for it based on our previous samsung purchases. unfortunately that didn't turn out to be the case this time around.don't get me wrong it is a solid entry level tablet but that's as far as it goes. the guts of the tablet are low end. apps are slow to respond and at times it can get glitchy. the bluetooth constantly cuts out and i have to manually reconnect it. that happens at least once every 15=20 minutes. fyi this happens whether or not i'm using bose buds or amazon's buds. the battery is only okay. if you have the brightness turned all the way down you are able to get a good six hours of video watching. if however you have it turned up to half or higher you can cut that time down to around 3-4 hours.also while the samsung tablet settings mostly mirror those found in other samsung devices some settings have been stripped out? all in all this tablet to me is a tale of how to cut corners and lean heavily on brand recognition for sales.if you just need a basic tablet i think this a good start but just be forewarned you are getting a 'basic' tablet not as good by a long shot as the better samsung devices due to lower end internal hardware. if you want to game or multi-task i wouldn't go this route but to each their own.for my needs this tablet works fine and i'm mostly happy with it but that said if i needed another tablet i'd skip this model and move up to the ""S"" line."
"For two years, the tablet did its job. Relatively slow, but enough to browse and watch videos. Don't expect to get any sort of productivity done on this tablet. However after 2 years, this tablet is completely dead. Had a full charge two days ago before I went to bed, and yesterday would not turn on, and would not charge. I have tried every trick in the book and combination of holding down buttons that I found online. Nothing works. And since this tablet is out of warranty, Samsung wants to charge me the cost of the tablet to repair it. I guess that's what you get with a sub $200 tablet."
"This is an ok product--the screen is big and very clear, which is nice, but the battery doesn't last very long. (my main use is using it with a songbook type of app for practicing music) I dont run games, or stream anything on it, and the battery only lasted about 4.5 hours. SEE EDIT BELOW AFTER HAVING IT FOR A FEW MONTHSSpeaking of the battery--it also takes a whale's age for it to charge up again. Like HOURS long to charge it. I'm sure there are ""quick chargers"" out there and I may have to make the sacrifice because its kind of insane how long it takes to get a full battery again. I actually had time to translate War and Peace from Russian into English, and I don't read or write in Russian at all.  When I was finished, the tablet was only still at 87%.Other than the battery being subpar, this is an ok device for the money--there is also some really pesky terms of service things you have to agree to, in order to even use this thing-- super invasive, IMO, but likely if you are trying to buy a tablet, you don't care at all about privacy, or if every corporation on Earth sells you out to the highest bidder-- But that's a review for a completely separate occasion.It's cheaper than an ipad, but at what ultimate cost? Use discernment.****EDIT: after a few months of having this piece of garbage --word to the wise DO NOT BUY THIS THING--DO NOT. It is the biggest piece of worthless crap I've ever wasted money on. It constantly turns itself off, or restarts ALL the time. I always set my screen to go black after 30 minutes, and this thing changes itself to 1 minute ALL the time without my even touching it. It seems to be on a constant loop of restarting itself at the most inopportune times as well--this thing absolutely SUCKS. My 11 year old iPad runs circles around it and it can't even update.  What a POS. Seriously, I completely stopped what I was in the middle of to log on and deliberately leave this review because I'm so sick of this thing and how bad it sucks.  Two thumbs down--if I could give it fewer than 1 star I definitely would."
"UPDATE (April 2024): It's been less than two months and already the battery can't hold a charge over night! If I charge it to 100% and leave it unplugged overnight, it's completely dead by morning. Not a huge, huge deal since mostly I only use it at home, but that is ridiculous! üò°This has been an absolutely great tablet. Love the interface, runs great, and I didn't have to give up my first born child to pay for it. It's so nice to finally be rid of Apple."
"This is a great and super functional little tablet, especially for the price, but I did not receive a US version.  The charger I received is not compatible with US plugs, and I was not even able to select the US from the list of countries on set up.  I ended up just going with South Africa and it works fine for what I am using it for, as all my accounts are US based, but I can see this being a huge problem for someone who is using it for more than I am and who doesn't already have a charger that can work with the usb, especially since the listing specifically states that it is the US version."
"Over the last few years I've owned the newest version of the 10"" Fire tablet and loved them.  However, there are a lot of apps that I would like that are not available on the Amazon App Store, so I bought this tablet to try out. It does have all the apps I wanted available through the Samsung and Goggle app stores. However, compared to the Fire tablets this tablet is slow to start, slow to load apps, and has a shorter battery life. I'm keeping it, mainly because of the available apps, but I don't like the tablet because of its sluggishness. I also find the Bluetooth has a greater range with my 10"" Fire tablet."
There's no way to change the contrast on the display. The screen is washed out and in some circumstances you can't really even see what you're doing. The accessibility features provide no help. During research to find a solution there's a suggested app from Samsung to help with the problem. It doesn't do anything either. If I had to do it over again I would not buy the Samsung A8 tablet.
"My experience with the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5"" 32GB Android Tablet has been deeply disappointing. From the slow charging and inadequate battery life to the frustrating lag and unresponsiveness, this tablet has failed to meet even the most basic expectations. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this device based on my personal experience.One of the major drawbacks I encountered with this tablet is the painfully slow charging time coupled with a disappointingly short battery life. It becomes an inconvenience to have to wait extended periods for the tablet to charge, only to have it drain quickly during usage. This aspect significantly hampers the tablet's usability and overall practicality.Furthermore, the tablet's performance is severely hindered by excessive lag and unresponsiveness. The delayed response time between tapping the screen and the tablet's reaction is frustratingly noticeable, making even simple tasks a laborious process. The sluggish performance greatly impacts the overall user experience, detracting from the tablet's potential functionality.Additionally, the tablet's performance continues to disappoint even during media consumption. In my case, after downloading a movie from Netflix to watch online, the tablet struggled to play the content smoothly. It frequently experienced lag and would pause every 30 seconds for approximately 5 seconds, significantly disrupting the viewing experience. Such performance issues undermine the tablet's ability to deliver enjoyable and uninterrupted media playback.Considering my experience, it is difficult to ascertain whether I received a faulty unit or if this is a widespread performance issue with this particular tablet model. Regardless, I cannot recommend the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5"" 32GB Android Tablet to anyone based on my personal experience.Pros:None mentionedCons:Slow charging time and inadequate battery lifeFrustratingly laggy and unresponsive performanceSignificant delay between screen taps and tablet responsePoor performance during media playback, with frequent lag and pausesIn conclusion, my experience with the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5"" 32GB Android Tablet has been deeply unsatisfactory. The slow charging, short battery life, severe lag, and unresponsiveness make it an unusable and frustrating device. I would strongly advise considering alternative tablet options that offer better performance and reliability.Wishing you better luck in finding a tablet that meets your needs and expectations."
"seems like every time i turn this tablet on, it has lost the wi-fi connection. i check the wi-fi settings and it always says ""invalid password"". so... i reconnect with the saved password... yes that's right, i dont have to re-enter the wi-fi password because the tablet already has the password, and then it connects successfully ...until the next time it gets it wrong. i bought 2 ipads before this and im going back to Apple!"
"I bought this to replace my last Samsung tablet because the battery always seemed to run down fast on it Well. I wish I had just held on to it now because the battery life on this one is no better. I spend less than an hour a day on this but if I leave it unplugged, I may get 3 days before it dies. I won't upgrade again unless this one dies or they come out with a wireless charging version."
"This was a nice little upgrade I bought myself to replace a much older tablet, and decide the massive amount of standard Samsung bloatware I generally enjoyed it. Flash forward about six months and something is definitely wrong with this thing. It freezes up regularly, CONSTANTLY loses wifi connection, and in general has just become unreliable. This is my leisure tablet, I almost exclusively use it to read books at night, so it isn't even getting heavy use. I am very disappointed."
"Did not come with the correct power plug. It was also the wrong country. Only middle eastern countries. had to return. We ended up buying it at best buy, and it was still just a bad product. The screen was not very bright and apps kept crashing. Had to return that one as well. It does not function like a top notch galaxy device. If you are okay with slower speeds and quality, this might work for you."
"this tablet was a replacement for an older Galaxy tablet.  When I first stated using it, the colors all seemed washed out and not as vibrant as my last Galaxy tablet.  Then after 11 months, the display basically stopped working.  At first it was just once in a while.  Then it stopped working completely unless I pressed down on the screen in just the right place.  Eventually that didn't even help.  So unless I can get this fixed or find out that this is still under warranty (no one makes this easy to find, not Amazon or Galaxy), this tablet was a huge waste of money.  I will try to update this info when I take this tablet to the repair shop tomorrow morning.EDIT:  Repair was unable to help with this display so I had to purchase a new tablet.  Do not recommend."
"At first, this tablet was wonderful, but after a few days, it started glitching out on me, and keeps going to ‚Äúsleep‚Äù. I have to keep tapping the power button to have the screen come back on. It‚Äôs honestly very frustrating. And for the money I paid for this, you would think this would not happen! Honestly, I am completely bummed, and hoped that it would stop, but it is just getting worse, and worse."
"I bought this tablet to stream Prime, Peacock and YouTube.  EVERYTIME I have to pause a show and the tablet goes to sleep, the app I was streaming on will say Fatal Error and crash, causing me to start over. If it is a series and I am day in season 5, it will erase all the watched statuses and start me back at 1! This is very irritating because I stream for background noise while I am working. I have also noticed that on this device only, no matter what I am watching on YouTube, there are an excessive amount of commercials, like every 3 minutes there is a commercial! This usually forces me to pull out my laptop to just listen to YouTube as my background noise.I have my screen timeout set to 30 minutes, but I am telling you I pause my show for just a few seconds and it times out. What is the point of having a setting choice if the tablet doesn't use it.I have only had this tablet 2 weeks and it has already done 5 updates! These updates take FOREVER!I have owned a lot of Samsung devices in the past and I am so disappointed with this one. I really wish I could return this tablet, but I have already invested money in a case, screen protector and chargers. This tablet is not worth the money!!"
"Tablet looks pretty good and functions. However, it is woefully underpowered and almost locks up after system updates. It takes a very long time to become responsive again after connecting to WiFi.For email and streaming it's a functional affordable tablet but if you need a device for school or work, I'd consider something else. For me, this is a movie player for airplanes and it's decent."
I have owned several Samsung devices over the years. Both in phone and tablet format. My biggest complaint on this tablet is the battery takes forever to charge at least 6-8hrs and then is dead again within a day to day and half depending on what I use it for. If I do nothing at all it‚Äôs a day and a half. But I just used it for a six hour trip to watch movies that I downloaded and I went from 100% to 24% in that six hour span and it was only on 4 of those 6 hours and it was in battery saving mode. I have in the past had tablets I used all day long and could get at least 2-3 days between charges. I have been quite disappointed with it and wished I had returned in the window but it was a Christmas present that I didn‚Äôt use right away. I gave it 2 stars because all other functions appear to be great.
"The Tab A8 gave me a strong first impression. Its exterior, thickness and weight, along with the very slim bezels, made it feel like a premium device. The size of the screen is great for watching movies, and its Dolby Atmos support got me excited. Buttons felt solid, too, with the right amount of click.Upon booting and setting it up, the UI felt smooth... most of the time. There was occasional slowdown when flipping through screens. The pixels making up the app icons were very noticeable, and sometimes text in YouTube and Disney+ looked pixelated.I did not intend the Tab A8 to be a gaming or working device. I just wanted to buy and download movies to watch offline. Seemingly a simple thing for a 2022 device to do without issues. For some reason, Disney+ would crash often, and struggle to play any shows. Downloading movies was a chore (yes, I set them to download to the SD card) and after all was done, they wouldn't play. Oh well, I could still get movies on YouTube NOPE. Movies would download, but would not load when going offline.All of this, on top of performance gradually becoming slower. Even after uninstalling most apps and leaving only the streaming ones, apps would often crash. Rebooting only mitigated the issue for a bit.Why do manufacturers think that 2-3GB of RAM are good enough for modern devices? The OS alone, freshly booted with no apps opened, ate up 2.1 of the 2.6GB of available memory. I just wanted to watch movies. Yes, I know there's a version of the A8 with 4GB of RAM. My point being, the 3GB version should not exist.It really was a heartbreaking experience. I wasn't asking for too much and the Tab A8 still managed to underdeliver."
Bought this to us as a music/map tablet for my car.Unfortunately the bluetooth signal drops constantlyso I can't use it for the car with a bluetooth speaker at home.Went out and bought a cheapo no name tablet and it works fine in this capacity.It's a bummer because otherwise it's an excellent tablet.
"Maybe I've been spoiled by the non-stock Android devices I've been using for the past decade but this flagship tablet really falls short of what I've come to expect. My biggest issue is how slow it is. The boot time takes forever and then registering on the network and being ""ready"" is just as bad. Pressing an App takes a few seconds to engage. The apps work fine - no issues with the actual performance but everything seems sluggish for what is supposed to be a powerful device. Also, you are unable to customize the look and feel of the tablet. There is no ""themes"" selection in the settings. You can't change the icons and even the colors are limited to what comes installed. The only way you can change those things is by installing a 3rd party launcher. I would think that a flagship product from Samsung would come with those basic Android activities. This is just isn't what I would expect from a name-brand device.I don't hate it enough to return it but I'm very disappointed. It's just what I've come to expect from an Android device."
"I purchased this Galaxy A8 on sale because the price fantastic and my iPad Air2 was having storage space issues and an iPad replacement would have cost a lot more than this tab. The A8 is okay for the sale price I paid but entry level iPads are in the same price arena and the quality of the screen on an iPad is SO much better that it made adjusting to this Galaxy difficult. The screen is lack luster and actually really dull, there are no vibrant colors, even with the display lighting on high. Another beef is that you can feel the lag on this device. It still operates well, but for the same price arena there are much smoother feeling tablets."
"UPDATE: I have had my tablet for 14 months now.  Thank goodness that I bought the Asurion 4 year warranty.  This is the 2nd time I am sending it in for the same issue.  It appears that the charging port becomes loose.  It won't take a charge or if it get in just the right position it will finally charge. Charge block and cable were checked with my cell phone and it worked just fine. This frustrates the heck out of me.  I don't even charge it daily, 2 maybe 3 times a week since it is used less than 20 hours. Lets see what happens this time. Just frustrated. I bought this as a replacement since AMAZON Kindle app was no longer supported for my Galaxy Tab S2. Sad thing is there is not a darn thing wrong with that tablet.  Still worked like a charm.  Alas, I need my reading app on something larger than my phone.  The screen images are quite nice (much better than the Tab A 7 which I tried and sent back) but the vibrancy is better on the S2.  I may have to play with it to emulate those but I have not tried yet.  So far, I'm quite happy."
"I'm very disappointed in this tablet. I bought it to replace the same one, which had started acting really funky, and just not working right. This one is not as good as the first one had been. I jave to keep going to settings to reconnect to the internet. I thought it might be my internet (the router is old). But I took it with me on vacation, and it did the same thing anyway. And YouTube just keeps buffering. I watch a lot of instructional videos, and often I just have to wait, and wait... Wish I could return it and get something else."
"I bought this Samsung about 6 months ago and I was very satisfied with it. But then something peculiar started happening. I started getting Wi-Fi connected but no internet. This happens quite often and if you go online and do any kind of search on Samsung A8 you'll see this is a very common problem. It starts out as slow Wi-Fi. Then you see you are connected but there's no internet data.  I went through all the tricks on the Samsung and other blogger sites to try to clean this up. No success. Maybe there is a mechanical issue and I should slap it around.  I think this happened right after a Samsung update in October 2023. All my old Samsungs work great, its just this one. I'm being kind with three stars...Oops it just cut out again."
What's not to dislike?  Almost everything.  Very disappointed - won't purchase this brand again.  I really like their TVs though!
"I bought an iPad 9th gen and this tablet. iPad for my 10 yr old and Samsung for my 5 year old. Wow, was I disappointed. I'm a loyal Samsung buyer. I have 2 chromebooks, tvs, and cell phones. Mostly no issues.But this tablet - I can't keep it charged. It will run down the battery almost as fast as the Kindle with kids mode.I made the decision to replace this with an iPad and keep this for occasional use."
Tablet has worked good until problems.2 years after purchase and noticed front camera distorted. Found screen pushed out. Tried to push back in but kept popping out. Got worse enough to look inside. Could see battery bulging. Buy with extended warranty.
"I ordered my 1st tablet from amazon in Jan of 2023...it didn't work upon delivery. I couldn't get it to go through the set-up, it kept getting stuck, then ""ghost"" typed on its own for awhile. I ended up returning it. I then ordered a replacement tablet that was ""delivered"" but in actuality wasn't. After going round and round with customer service, I finally got a replacement sent to me. This one works, it's perfect...mostly. I ordered the tablet with expandable memory (sd card drive). My tablet DOES have the slot, but it will not open and there doesn't appear to even be a release/pressure button to pop the drive open with the included slide release pin. It may be too late for me to return it (I should have checked this when it arrived), so just be wary and check what they send you BEFORE it's too late...If not for the DOA, delivery issues and (apparently) the incorrect model being sent to me, I would have given this a 5star rating.  =("
"Entry level and laggy, with not a lot of space left over after the OS...I am not sure why I expected it to be better. I use a galaxy s21 ultra for my phone which blows the doors off this tablet...its also $800 more.  I just think samsung could have cut a few less corners and not created something ""new"" that performs like it was made 10 yrs ago and ready to be recycled.The A8s system is slow and laggy and hiccups along...it has USB C but with none of the benefits. ""Its ""fast"" charging is not fast. No IR blaster, so not usable as a media remote. The differences between the A8 and my phone is so vast...theres no reason for me to use the tablet. i wrongly assumed that samsungs lower tier would at least be able to execute the current android OS without a hitch. It left me not wanting to use it and frankly I should have returned this but I've waited too long. and yes I probably should have spent more money on a better model. Oh well. My 2022 samsung A8 currently resides on a shelf collecting dust functioning as clutter and nothing more."
Worked great I got it put a screen protector on it had a new case for it so I put that on set it all up downloaded my game to play worked great for a couple weeks I loved it one day I lay it down to take my puppy outside when I came back it was dead so I plugged it in but it never came on again idk why so I did return it sadly
"I have had several Samsung Galaxy Tab tablets.  I bought this one because my last one was only 16 gb and constantly ran out of space even with no pictures on it.This tablet, for some reason, takes a long time to boot up.  My other Galaxy tablets never took this long.  In addition, periodically,  it will drop the wifi and will not reconnect unless I reboot.  Never had this problem with my 16gb Tab A either."
Very troublesome tablet to operate.  System locks up frequently.  Support service is terrible.
"Its been several months with this unit.  Its not as responsive as I hoped.  Have had only iPads but didn't feel like paying the price.  The screen image is good. but it is slow to respond with commands.  Right now it turns on and then turns off.  It takes about 2 or so minutes to boot.  Then after it boots, the screen turns black and I have to push the power button.  Also, when using the kindle reader the page goes into full screen but no where have I been able to find how to proceed to the next page.  I'm probably going to break down and return to the Ipad when I get some extra change.  It just an OK tablet.  Nothing to get excited about it.  It does teach you patience, though."
"I used to have Samsung phones and I liked them, so I thought I'd pop back into the ecosystem with this tablet. After a week, it's just too annoying to use because of screen issues that are much better on my iPad:1. Touch to wake - on the iPad, all I have to do is touch the screen and it pops to life. On the Galaxy, I have to find and press the (crappy) button.2. Average face ID - more often than not, the number pad pops up, which leads me to...3. Hitting enter - when you put in your code, it doesn't register until you hit enter. On the iPad, the last digit triggers the unlock.4. Less responsive icons - it's just harder for a touch of an icon to register than on an iPad.I agree with the others that the screen is nice and it streams video well, but it's simply too annoying a tablet to be practical for me in the long run."
"I had a 2019 Tab 6 before which needed replacing. This had most all the same features, but seems slower and choppier,  and the color temperature seems off. Also the factory installed software takes up over 1/2 of the available storage, and most most can't be deleted, you really need the 64gb or larger version if you plan on installing more apps. Images and such can be stored on a sim card."
"I received my USED but ""LIKE NEW"" Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 tablet yesterday.  The good news:  Great price, well re-packaged, clean, unmarred, and delivery was three days ahead of schedule.The bad news:  The ""LIKE NEW"" tablet was set up with the previous owner‚Äôs Google account.  The tablet was subsequently FACTORY reset and returned to AMAZON.  Unfortunately, I, the new owner, cannot setup and use the used tablet without having the prior owner's Google logon ID and password.  I get this error message:  """"This device was reset.  To continue, sign in with a Google Account that was previously synced on this device.""  Since I do not have and cannot get the previous Google Account information, I cannot use the tablet.  I have ""chatted"" with the tech folks on the Amazon's chat line; they were absolutely useless.  They suggested I contact Samsung.  I did that.  Samsung suggested I send the tablet in to them for service.  Although I have not checked, I can imagine this will be costly with shipping and $$ for the service, not to mention the weeks of turn-around from Samsung.  Also, I have spent hours on the Internet and YouTube looking for a way to crack the previous Google Account with no luck.  It looks as though I will have to return this nice, clean used tablet back to Amazon.  And here, I thought I found a bargain.  Oh well!  It would have been nice If Amazon had thought to send the tablet to an IT shop for a ‚ÄúGoogle reset‚Äù prior to customer purchase.  Perhaps if they read this review, they will do that in the future for used tablets."
"For the price this unit performa well. It has good graphics and sound woith reasonable response. The down side is charging time. I can't recommend this unit based on the time it takes to fully charge. With 2% charge left, I placed it on charge overnight and 13 hours later I am at 75%. I don't know if this is normal or if I have a unit with a deffective battery."
"The whole reason for purchasing this tablet was to play the games I normally play on my phone so I could take all of them off my phone. However, that didn't happen. The games are different, not only visually but also in gameplay even though all the apps are by MobilityWare. Sluggish response as well and no, it's not an internet issue. Not sure if I'll be keeping it."
"Ah, i got this for my child. I figured he's going to need a tablet, might as well get a bigger screen and price isn't bad compared to iPad. Anyway,The good: Good battery, good price, pretty ok screen quality.The bad: Android runs slow, sometimes it forget to think, 1 face recognition only (this is one of the worst, having to always put the code), these two are the main things, runs slow. I don't have any major applications, whatever came installed on the tab (i tried removing unneeded Samsung apps, installed 4,5 kids apps) but it is frustrating to work this thing.Summary: if you are on a budget and want at 10"" tab, and you can workaround Android being slow on this tab, and are ok with 1 face being recognized, this may be ok. However, i bought an iPad for my nephew back in 2015, and that thing still works 10x better than this 2022 Samsung. Not the review i wanted to write, but it is the truth, from my view..."
"Upon opening the tablet and turning it on, I was stumbled by not having the option in selecting USA as my country. Another thing is the adapter, this tablet came with a travel adapter and not the original one. As of now, my daughter has enjoy it but we need to figure out how o go about getting her the right adapter to charge."
I have used this tablet less than a dozen times and it just quit charging. I have no children. Noone but myself has touched it! It looks brand new but won't charge. Please replace it!
"This was a replacement for my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 which I loved, but it would no longer charge.They don't make 'em like they used to. The least annoying problem is in the settings. I can no longer set the screen to stay on while plugged in. I listen to long podcasts, and if I have to pause, I often have to take the time to log back in to do it.The really annoying problems are with the wifi and bluetooth. Both just turn off at random intervals. It's not spotty signals, either. The wifi and bluetooth just turn off, and I have to manually turn them back on and reconnect. This was never a problem with the old tablet.If this lasts as long as the old one, I'll have a few years before I need to get a new one, but I don't know if I'll get a Samsung again."
"I bought this tablet to replace a Samsung Tab A. I used it everyday and really liked pretty much everything about it.  One day about a month after purchase, the speakers were repeating a sound like a record skipping.  I attempted to turn off the device multiple times before it finally shut down.  After that I could not turn on the device.  Tried self help guides found on YouTube to turn it on but failed.  I just put it away and ordered another.A few months later I tried to turn on the device and it came on!  I was surprised and began using it but not for anything I might lose in case it failed again.Now, almost 2 years later, the battery gets really hot and the glass is separating from the frame.  I‚Äôm beginning to think the glass lifting up is a problem Samsung needs to address. I am Replacing the older Tab A for the same glass lifting problem."
"I don't like the tablet.  I'm not very tech savvy and it's not user friendly.  it won't keep settings like I need.  the camera is awful.  I shouldn't have to edit all the pictures and even after downloading an app to help with the quality, which it didn't."
"the tablet is decent, it‚Äôs a little slow but it‚Äôs cheap, what‚Äôd you expect?my only gripe is that it seems that the wifi on these A series tablets has been notoriously awful, as in, it stopped working within 3 weeks of purchase, i‚Äôd stay away from this line of tablets."
"I bought this less than a year ago and it has already quite. It was working fine one day, then the next day it won't come on. Tried changing charging cords still won't come on. With the price of this now days they shouldn't quite in less than a year."
This is the second galaxy tab a that I've had that the charging port went out on. Everything else is perfectly fine but now it won't charge. Its just frustrating. Its an expensive enough item that I'd hope I didn't have to replace it every year.
"Bought it because the price was right, and didn't expect to be using it very much.  Found that I liked it, but that it was under-powered and I wanted ""more"".  Returned it and bought a Tab S9 FE which I really like!"
"First of all, I would consider this tablet to be ""okay"" at best, it would usually run really hot after just a short time of playing a game that wasn't very demanding graphics-wise, especially since I played it on the medium graphics settings to help with lag, which is another issue I found with this tablet. The system itself seems to have lag issues when doing just about anything sometimes, whether it's opening or closing an app, using the camera (which is also pretty mediocre), or while playing a game. Not to the point of it being too much of a hassle, but it's definitely noticable.Then today, 4 months after purchase, it does this weird thing that I've never seen another device do. It locked up in the middle of a game and was completely unresponsive while making a loud buzzing sound for about a minute or two until it shut itself off, and now won't turn back on or even charge. So it's essentially dead, apparently. And it's past the return date, but I definitely don't feel like I got my money's worth from the 4 months I've had this thing, and i got it on sale for about $175, luckily, I guess.I would strong suggest paying for the device protection if you decide to purchase one of these. Although for $75, you'd probably be better off just buying a slightly more expensive, better quality tablet."
I've had this tablet less than a year and the battery is already going on it. I don't use it a lot so I'm very confused as to why the battery is going bad with it being under a years time.
"I got it last year, in fact at the time of writting this review is exactly one year since I ordered it.It has been good for the most part, except the camera which is not good when the environment is not super bright, so a little shadow and the image is really bad. But everything else was good.Until last night... Exaclety one year after it was purchased so I am not sure if this was done in purpose...The battery was fully charged, I only used for a little while, and left it at 86%, left it in Stand by during he night  as always, and by the morning it had no battery, 0%. I started charging it 4 hours ago and it is just at 18% now, it is off I am not using it, just charging it and it is really slow."
"Overall it's pretty nice. But I bought it with the intention of having the aod or Screensaver show the time while its plugged it, kinda use it like a clock when not in use. Unfortunately it does not support samsung dashboard or feature an always on display. The screen saver option doesn't even allow you to have the clock show, which my 8 yr old rca tablet does. Probably poor research on my part so I just assumed a newer tablet would have these options by default.3 stars because its a good product but didn't come with what I assumed was a basic feature. No clock screen saver? Lame."
I don't even use it much and every time I get ready to use it it's dead. I'd like to trade it in and go back to the fire. I can't get the voice command to work either.
This is my 3rd Galaxy tablet and I really don't like it compared to the other 2 that i had. It is very slow to come on. It also shut down on it's own.
"The main issue is starting up.  When, I try to turn it on it takes several attempts.  Would have tried another product.  I like Samsung for years not keen on this."
"I have had an iPad for years. I really like them but they are just so expensive and the battery runs down fast. I decided to get an android when my current iPad started having charging issues.It is not as responsive as my old iPad. I miss being able to use cell phone data on it. The picture quality is no where near as good as the iPad.The price was right, so far it does what I need it to, it looks nice except for the chip around the glass edge.It‚Äôs difficult getting used to a different iso but I think it‚Äôs durable."
"I have had a Lenovo tablet for quite a few years. It was time for a new tablet so I thought I would go for the Samsung Galaxy. The screen quality was GREAT. The tablet is sleek and lovely. I didn't like the on/off button being on the side, my Lenovo had it on the top which was much more accessible. The battery seemed to go quite quickly. I had to recharge half way thru the day. My Lenovo stayed charged much much longer than this Samsung Galaxy. I had to return this one because the keyboard must have been corrupt. Every time I used it, it would freeze up. It was really a pain. I tried several things to fix it, googled and tried a bunch of things. Nothing worked, so I returned it and ordered a different Samsung tablet, hoping it will be better."
"Got the 32 gig with added 1TB memory card.So after unboxing and getting everything set up. Updates took place. I literally have 2 gigs of space of physical memory due to the bloatware of crap I'll never use. After uninstalling everything I could I gained back 4 gigs.  As to performance it is slow to boot up after a restart. Pretty good delay going from lock screen to opening up.  Also, pretty good delay in opening any app or looking at notifications. Once you're in an app it works ok.  I wouldn't want to do anything that would need instant reaction time on this though.I like that it's a droid and that I can do everything I need it to. Just a few little games, reading and paying of the occasional bill.Do not expect performance and you'll be ok with the 32gig."
"I bought a Samsung tablet because I wanted something with more reliable performance than the cheap tablet I already had. The joke is on me.I plug it in to charge and the charge goes down instead of up. The OS says it's charging, and the charge goes down? The problem went away when I rebooted it, but came back consistently. I put in a ticket with Samsung support and they had me send it in for repairs. It was sent back to me with no changes because they couldn't reproduce the problem. I plugged it in, the charge went down. Time to reboot.Silly me, I keep trying to use it. I set it down the other night -- with a 90% charge -- and picked it up an hour later, and it had turned itself off and refused to turn back on. I charged it for an hour, still wouldn't turn on. I give up, unplug it and decide to take it to a local repair shop the next day in the hope that THEY can fix it. The next day, it boots up fine. Welp, no taking it to the repair shop 'cause they'll just say they can't do anything.The dumb thing can't even fail consistently, so even though it's under warranty, I can't get Samsung to do anything about it. It fails just often enough to be supremely frustrating.Other than that, I like it. Nice and speedy, great screen. But as it is, I hate to even try to use it."
"Biggest complaint is it is so slippery that you can't hold it & no good silicone covers on the market yet.Works good, nice screen, but USB connection is on the bottom edge so that is a pain if you use it a lot with USB connected.My second biggest complaint is no rear camera flash. Seems pretty lame to remove the rear flash on a TABLET  as those are used mostly indoors so with no flash available the rear camera usage is pretty limited. There is a flash for the front (selfie side).The other minor complaint is if you turn off ""location"" there is no setting to get a sorta location for apps by just turning on ""use WiFi for location"" (there is no available  ""only use WiFi for location""  setting once the GPS is turned off).  I like to turn off the location service to extend battery life but still have a somewhat close WiFi location for map apps  weather apps."
"This is a good tablet except for a big (and apparently common) problem - it is unchargable in cold temperatures, or even just slightly cool temperatures like 55 or 60 F. It displays a battery temperature icon then and refuses to charge. This is a major issue because we use this tablet outdoors and need to charge it, and 55-60 F is actually pretty warm for where we live.Samsung should've included a charging heater with the battery. Also there software threshold for what is considered ""cold"" is way too high. Either that or it is defective. Difficult to get warranty coverage on this. You get what you pay for - a $200 tablet is not a premium tablet."
"First of all, like other reviews suggest you absolutely must get the 64GB or higher models so you get that extra GB of ram. The 32GB model, in addition to having unacceptably low storage capacity, also only has 3GB of RAM. I figured the low storage capacity wouldn't be a huge deal because of the expandable memory, but lots of things (ie, apps and the OS) need to go on the onboard storage. This tablet is very, very slow with even basic multi-tasking.The display quality is acceptable but it could be better. The size is large for my taste but the aspect ratio will be great if you use it for watching movies. I was very happy with the software implementation other than the speed.I ultimately returned my device due to a defect in which the device struggled to connect to WiFi networks. Afterwards I decided not to cheap out and got an iPad mini instead.I would definitely recommend upgrading if you are able."
My 3rd Samsung tab product and by far the worst battery life of any.
"I'm a big fan of Samsung Android products and have a Galaxy 22 phone. This tablet seems to have severe buffering and wireless issues. Many apps are choppy, constantly stopping for long periods. The wireless strength in my home is fine and there's no issues will cell phones, laptops, etc. Except this tablet. If I can't resolve in this day or two, I'll need to send it back. Pretty disappointed."
"I purchased this device as a fitness tracker.Although it worked very well initially, the device stopped functioning after only 3 months of normal use.Message on device display was ‚Äòscan QR code‚Äô to download Veryfit app.The app was already downloaded so I tried to bind the device again, unsuccessfully.I received the message ‚Äòdevice not found‚Äô on iPhone Bluetooth search.I deleted the Veryfit app, reinstalled it on my iPhone, and tried to bind the device again.This time only the ‚Äòscan QR code‚Äô message appeared on the display.Deleted and reloaded Veryfit app, tried to bind again and received message that Bluetooth on watch needed to be enabled, but display screen was frozen on ‚Äòscan Qr code‚Äô message.Very frustrating, would not recommend purchase of this wearable device.Also could not bind to iPad, repeating same steps above."
"The watch itself is great. Works great & good battery life after initial charge. Problem is that when you plug it in to charge it, it just dings nonstop. I don't know why. Plus while doing this, it takes forever to charge."
"For the price, it's not bad if you're willing to live with a few shortcomings.The calorie consumption is wildly inaccurate.  It has reported over 700 calories for an hour of yoga.  I wouldn't burn 700 calories in an hour if I were running.  One day it reported that I had only consumed about 900 calories for the whole day, even though I had been moderately active.Calorie consumption is separated between ""Activity Calories"" and ""Whole-day Calories.""  Whole-day can only be viewed in the app (not on the watch), and they are on a secondary page, not visible without navigation.The app, VeryFit, is weak.  It doesn't allow for manually logging an activity, so if I forget to start the activity, I can't track it.  (FitBit app allows manual logging, then takes heart rate readings to fill in the details.)Sleep tracking seems fairly accurate, but does not capture all of my awake minutes throughout the night.Step tracking seems to be accurate.I think for the price, this might be as good as it gets.  I'm looking into spending more to get a better product."
"It does answer my phone, but the heart rate and other body functions are off. It said I got 8 hours of sleep last night, but I was up at least 3 out of those 8 hours watching tv due to back pain and I wasn't sitting still either. I've tried several things but it just doesn't give correct info. It is adorable, but I guess it is the saying that you get what you pay for?"
"I bought the watch 2 months ago. The wrist activation stopped working. I tried to fix it according to YouTube videos but nothing works. Frustrating because I have to use my other hand to push in the button to see time, date, steps etc."
"The watch is pretty, the battery lasts long, but the step accuracy is way off."
The stem came out and was lost after wearing 3 days
It does everything it's supposed to but the charger already quite charging and I think the charger was bad.
Does not allow reading text messages.
It‚Äôs a nice watch except it only has one watch face that is really nice and useable-and the blood pressure readings are way off and does not read properly. It‚Äôs way off from my blood pressure cuff and this is one reason I bought the watch.  I think I‚Äôm going to keep it because it‚Äôs mostly working ok except the blood pressure readings.  I haven‚Äôt figured out how to use some of the settings.
My daughter had it for less than a month and looked like it was a two-year-old watch with the amount of scratches on it with normal wear and tear.
Item is to thick.
Kept disconnecting phone from wifi. Cute design
It changed the time and date and cannot figure out how to reset and it doesn‚Äôt tell the correct calorie for fitness
I just received I have to find something  to charge with no cord to plug into.
Cheap watch band. Had to buy more to charge the watch to see if it worked
"Dislike could not use, would not charge!!!!"
This demonstrates the adage ‚Äúyou get what you pay for.
Stopped working properly within weeks.
I liked this watch until it quit charging altogether and is now useless to me.
I purchased this to replace an iwatch that finally died. Unfortunately the size of the face was so much bigger than I was used to I couldn‚Äôt get used to. It wasn‚Äôt a bad watch but just way different than I was used to so I returned it.
"I really do like and enjoy this smart watch. My major complaint is after only one day of use the connection between the watch and my phone refuses to corporate. It connects enough that it tracks my stats, receives text messages/phone calls, however I can't answer the phone calls anymore. When I'm in the Bluetooth portion of my phone, it refuses to connect when I select the ""connect"" button. The watch shows connection when I'm in the app, however it shows me it's not connected for phone calls. I have restarted both devices, uninstalled/reinstalled the watch/app, I've done everything the app suggests. It refuses to *fully* connect now. It's frustrating but at least it's operational in the other advertised aspects. It does hold a charge well. The color of the band is perfect, I got Dark Green. There is a large variety of free faces, and ways to purchase more. And even obtain coins for future purchases."
"Nice little watch until 30 day warranty was up & then it stopped being accurate to kcals & distance on outdoor walk exercise mode..The watch no longer connects easily to Bluetooth‚Ä¶ I have deleted and downloaded app/reset watch numerous times, spoke w Amazon, tried to contact storefront .. to me it just wasn‚Äôt worth the hassle I went through.. so what re battery life, size and appearance when other functions fail‚Ä¶ chalk up to failure, go w another brand.. 30 day warranty, that‚Äôs all the time you get w this watch‚Ä¶. Any more days over that is at your own risk"
"You Cannot navigate  or look at steps, activity, weather without hitting every button. You cannot navigate correctly.  Overly sensitive to your gentle touch. Vale is excellent.  Watch not a good buy for me."
Automatically changed time zone when traveling but would not change back to correct time zone.
Watch stopped working  before it was 2 months old.
"Phone and text notifications quit working. Tried all the resolutions provided and nothing worked. Unable to return because it‚Äôs been 35 days since I purchased it. Basically, I‚Äôm screwed."
I love it for less than a week before it stopped working and won't turn on.  A complete dud
"Worked for 3 months, then it sopped charging"
"The round disc on the back of my watch will not stay in place.  I'm so afraid that i'm going to lose it.And ruin the watch function.  Does anyone have suggestions on how to fix this?  Also, the glory fit app that goes with the watch is useless.  It keeps crashing and I can't submit feedback through the app."
The sleep function did not work 3/4 of the time. It did however keep track of heart rate and 02 levels. Stopped working and would not charge after 1 month. Waste of money
"I reviewed a ton of smart watches before purchasing this one and thought for sure I had gotten the best watch to replace my Gloryfit smartwatch that stopped charging after only 5 months... WRONG!Yes, it tracks everything I need but you MUST have Alexa in order to sync everything AND keep track after 24 hours of your exercise and vitals. USELESS!The band is plastic so it's fairly uncomfortable and if you have a tiny wrist then chances are it will be too big (I'm small but I don't have the smallest wrist and I have it on the very first notch!)Great features but you can't track them! My Gloryfit synced with almost every fitness app I have and definitely with my Googlefit app! This watch just won't sync!Getting the settings right is another issue if you don't have Alexa. My messages, calls, music control ALL are confusing to set-up.So far the only thing I can say that's positive is that it tracks my steps and actual activity time.DO YOURSELF A FAVOR...SAVE FOR AN APPLE WATCH OR A SAMSUNG! BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY! AT LEAST IT WAS ON SALE!"
The watch randomly stopped working after 6 weeks. It won‚Äôt charge. It doesn‚Äôt turn on for more than 10 seconds.
"I love this watch, the design, the look, the options it offers; however, I am having trouble with certain data transferring from watch to the app.  I got the watch on August 17, sat it up no problem, everything worked.  It recorded my steps and heart rate and transferred to the app.  Come August 18, certain data would not transfer from watch to app.  August 19, I redid everything, deleted my account sat up new account, reset watch.  Perfect, everything worked again, today, back to square one, the same data is not transferring from watch to phone üò≠  The whole point of the watch is the fitness tracking for me.  If that doesn't work and I cannot go and look at past fitness training I've done, it is pointless for me.  I've googled, read reviews, my sister has a similar watch that uses the same app, no problems with hers.  If someone from the manufacturer could contact me and help that would be great and I'd gladly change my review."
"Gutted. Got this nice little smart watch as a birthday present from my kids. I have seizures so thought it would be handy as it can track my spo2 levels, heart rate etc. I also don‚Äôt sleep as long as I should so was looking forward to being able to track them. All was fine until I went to do a scan on 23rd day but as soon as it gets to 5% I get this error message. Watch is in exactly the position it was in when worked fine but nonetheless I have tried so many different ways but still at 5% it gives me the error message so haven‚Äôt been able to track anything I bought it for. :-(Shane as I loved the watch until then. I‚Äôve read the manuals and nothing for trouble shooting this issue."
Bought in August now in December can.t change it up. Just black screen nothing happening with it.  Waste of money after 3 months can.t use it.
I really want to like this smart wh as it looks and feels great but‚Ä¶I‚Äôve not yet had it a month and it keeps disconnecting from the app. Now it won‚Äôt connect at all.Plus it doesn‚Äôt actually count sleep correctly or even calories.Having to send it back ‚Ä¶..
"This is a basic watch with very limited functions. It was purchased for my daughter for Christmas as it looked similar to an iwatch.The watch itself doesn't have WiFi mode and doesn't give an option to stop email notifications. With my young daughter not being old enough for a mobile phone, we have to connect the watch to ours, this means she receives the notifications meant for us. As it is primarily a kids watch (I would t expect many tech-savvy adults to opt for such a basic smartwatch), I'd also expect the watch strap to replicate this. Because it isn't designed for kids (aged 9) with little wrists, we had to create a new hole for the strap, this immediately invalidated the warranty/return option"
"I like the watch and the app, it does everything it says and more. Programmes to help you get back into running, supports diet monitoring ...I've seen a fair few people have skin reactions to the strap - I havent, but I woke up one morning with a red patch that looked like sunburn, from directly under the watch face where the sensors are.Only happened once, but was a worry."
"The watch its self is brilliant, great value for money and water proof, I swim with it. Only issue I am having after only having this watch for a couple of weeks is that the app that tracks all your data has completely crashed and now I can‚Äôt track any of my swims or workouts, which I purposely bought it for. Hoping this issue will be fixed other wise will be sending it back."
"I actually bought this mainly for the phone function which is great, however the other reason for purchasing was for oxygen sats.  This function is totally inaccurate apparently my sats are perfect 97-99% with this watch unfortunately anyone suffering with emphysema/ COPD will know you are lucky to have sat levels over 93% I have used a NHS monitor to show correct levels and the watch is out by at least 7%. The step function etc is excellent so if you don't need the oxygen sats then I recommend this watch"
"I read reviews they made the watch sound good, only issue iv got is I keep getting notifications saying my watch is disconnected"
"I received the watch very quickly on the 1st August. I have a small wrist, it fits but looks very big & feels a bit clunky as I‚Äôm used to wearing a small feminine watch. I thought the watch was working well but this morning my watch stated I only slept for 4hrs 20mins but the data sent to my phone was correct, 7hrs 38mins? (I took a screenshot of this data but I can‚Äôt upload it my my phone?) ***Update*** I had to remove the watch due to getting a sore rash after wearing it continually from the day I received it, only removing it for taking a shower."
Only lasted 5 month then died
I love everything about this watch. Well I will when I've worked out how to stop it vibrating with every Facebook notification etc. I would have given it 5* BUT the watch face is too big on my wrist and only suitable for wearing at home. Do Gymon make them with a smaller face??
"Cheap strap but works , a lot smaller that the photo shows and is plastic ,functions seem to work  but won‚Äôt collect to Alexa ,it rings my phone but can‚Äôt talk"
"It really is a decent watch for the price. I did find I was out of bluetooth range and it got disconnected frequently which led to missing notifications. The voice answering works well. It is rather durable but in saying that, I purchased this watch Frb 13 2023 and it no longer works (bluetooth connectivity issues). It's sad that the watch is fully functional in all other regards but now off to the landfill üëé"
This watch isn't too bad but two things I've been having problems with.  The display won't light up when I turn my wrist or even if I tap the screen.  I have to press the side button for it to light up and that isn't always possible if my hands are busy.  Also I always have trouble getting notifications on my watch.  Ove synced it so many times and yes I have connected to both like I'm supposed to.. its very frustrating when you want notifications to be sent to your watch and it doesn't.  I also wish there was a different wrist band that you could get for it as I have a very small wrist and the band is way too big for me.
I tried to contact the seller because the watch stopped working and the seller is not responding despite the 1 year warranty they advertise.  Really disappointed.
"Fully charged it when I received it wich was around 3pm Dec 10th it is now 5am Dec 11th and in that amount of time the watch has already over heated on me once, and when I woke up this AM around 5 it only had 30% battery life left. It ate 20% battery life just while sleeping! Based off that pattern this watch will need charged every 12-24 hours for optimal use. Also takes about 2 hours to fully charge the watch from 0% After doing some research i have discovered this is a common problem with these watches that i wish I would have known before purchasing:( Also the selection of watch faces are TERRIBLE unless you want to buy them from the store. And it doesn't track your sleep properly. It's basicly just an expensive watch with a crap battery life at this point. It also doesn't track my sleep properly I was awake last night around 2 am, actually physical walking around my house and it didn't track that, it said I was still asleep, I also went to bed one night and full 4 hours before it even started tracking my sleep one night! Waste of money at this point t"
It's a great watch and will connect to phone if you move too far away from phone it will lose connection. I thought i could add it to my phone plan but it's basically a tracker and fit bit.
"For years I had the Samsung Galaxy Fitness Tracker 2 and loved it but it kept freezing as it got older so I got this one.  I could wear my old one in the shower but this one will shut off.  It keeps turning off or changing my settings, the battery doesn't last quite as long and it's nearly impossible to turn off the alarm. Hopefully it will start keeping my settings.  That's the biggest complaint."
"I am really disappointed with this Samsung product.  I buy a lot of Samsung products and I have most always been satisfied with my purchases.  This watch has awesome features and is comfortable to wear.  Tracking data seems to be accurate at lease compared to my previous wearable health tracker.  Unfortunately, the battery life makes the watch worthless. In order to keep it working it has to be charged for at least 2 hours every day and that time takes away from the overall monitoring reliability.  Surely Samsung knows that this is not acceptable because they put better batteries in some of the other more expensive watches.  For $200 I would expect the battery to last for at least 48 to 72 hours, not for one lousy day.  I really wanted to make this device work for me but after giving it a lot of thought on how I could make it work for me, I cannot, and I am sending it back.  I Really want a reliable Health tracker with all the features of the Galaxy watch, but I WILL NOT pay the prices that they are asking for Trackers with a longer lasting battery, since that really seems to be the only functional difference between this watch and the higher priced Samsung Wearables.  The Samsung Health Apps don't thrill me much either. This device is not recommended."
"This is one of the cheaper Wear OS options, and given it's a recent release, it's sure to be supported by Samsung for a while. I understand that there are going to be concessions on performance at this price point, and I'm impressed by what this watch is capable of doing regardless. Battery life should not ever be a thing that is sacrificed on a fitness tracker, however, and the battery life on this watch is easily the worst I've seen from any smartwatch I've ever owned. Maybe I'm spoiled by the e-ink displays from the Pebble or the bangle.js, but only being able to reliably go a single day on a charge compared to a week or more from competitors is not a good look, and it makes this watch really hard to recommend to others."
"I got this to replace my Galaxy 2 Watch which finally broke.  I read the reviews which stated the battery only lasts a day, and they aren't wrong! This has a horrible battery life. Yes, I have updated the software and turned off the always on display. It has all the same settings that my Galaxy 2 had set and that lasted 3 days! This FE needs charged every night.  Not pleased with that but otherwise the watch works the same as my old one."
"I am not a fan of this watch. I was desperately wanting a  watch to go with my Samsung ap. But, sadly, I was really disappointed with it.The ap is not an ap at all for the watch. Very hard to find. But once found it was easy to work. The watch on the other hand was not.Sliding the bevel didn't keep the watch face on and trying to tap anything, it just disappeared.I just found it wasn't for me.As for the battery life, it was not great at all! I had to charge it 3 times in a day and a half!! And I just had only the basic watch part on.The customization of the watch was rather fun.  I got to choose my own watch face and set up the choices I wanted. It was just very hard to find them and get the phone to work properly."
Paid a hefty price for a watch that only holds a charge for a day. :(
"I've been looking for a replacement watch for my Fitbit Versa 2 for quite some time.I looked into the iwatch but I prefer android versatility.I love my Samsung phone, past and current models have fit my lifestyle for years now.So, I took a chance with this watch hoping it'd be just right, it wasn't.I reached out via chat to customer service with a few questions but they were of no helpand actually gave the wrong answers to some of my questions.Especially those relating to different replacement bands for this particular model watch.If I were to follow the advice from their agent, I'd have to wait for Samsung to ""make more watchbands"" as they didn't expect to sell out so fast.I'm supposedly on a ""wait list"" to be the first to purchase the new replacement bands when they are available.New flash: this watch is being returned, don't waste my time nor yours.You can purchase a brand new Galaxy watch 6 for the same price and the battery life is great!If you're ok with a watch that only holds a charge for 12 hours or less than by all means enjoy this one.Maybe I got a dud? I don't know and since customer service couldn't help with a watch band I'm not wasting my time with tech support.I didn't bother with the Galaxy Watch 7 since you can't charge it with your phone.A feature several have complained about and maybe Samsung will fix but until then I'm very happy with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 model.I purchased this watch with my own money and this is not a paid review so do with that what I do for others who tell it like it is..."
Part if watch band missing
Bought it for my daughter works great just has to be charged everyday
"Sleep monitoring is great, however it requires daily charging. Other apps on watch need to be turned off in order to get a couple days without charging and then, requires additional charging."
"Works decently, but one charge barely lasts 30 hours."
"I upgraded from the fitbit versa and I love the galaxy watch. Only issue I have is the battery life. It doesn't last a day, even in power save mode and it take hours to charge. Super frustrating!"
"I thought this would be compatible with any android, it is not. Many of the features won't link and don't work. I can't use the heart rhythm app with this, which is the reason I bought it in the first place! App only works with Samsung."
"I wanted QUALITY so I followed the reviews for a whole year and spoke to owners so here is my own outtake:Wach was brought reconditioned,  1) it was still connected for someone else account and it had not been cleared during""Recondition"". Took 1hr of going to setup to clear and then it would not connect to the phone.2) after connecting I had to charge the watch again.3) no matter how many times t held home button  itwould no go to settings only to ""off ""4) this watch was NEVER recondition no matter what Amazon says.The watch band is made of cheap rubber and ever6one has told me it is weird and unconftable,  the watch came in a 2hite box with np instructions, warranty card just it and the charger.I've ordered a second one to see if it works otherwise both will be returned at the same time.Amazon has happily taken the crap road on products."
"The features are fantastic, batter lasts about 24 hours."
"Just got this watch, don't have much feed back on features yet, but I will say I already don't like it. Went to bed at 100% & woke up to it at 54% no way will this last all day if it can't even last 6 hours not doing anything."
It's a very nice watch. But I have to charge it everyday. When I get up everyday it's at 20 percent.
I purchased this in July. Everything was great up till a couple days ago. Now the battery life is less than 8 hrs. I have been having to charge overnight and then again midway through the day. It had been going for over 24 hrs before it needed charging. I have tried playing with the settings to see if thay helps and so far it has not.
"The watch itself is nice. I like the look and the features. However, the battery life is horrible!  My fitbit battery life last over a week. The Galaxy watch needs to be charged every other day.  I don't like it and it's being returned."
the batery  is no good
Id say overall it is good. However the battery life is absolutely terrible.  It doesn't even last a full day of use. So either loose two hours during day to charge or charge over night and not use the sleep features.
Don't like the theme that I can't listen music in my watch üò§
Wife loves watch but hates battery life. Integrates great with Samsung S24+ but has to be charged every other day.
"I read the reviews before purchasing however, I was hoping they were wrong about the battery life or that it wouldn't necessarily matter, but, I was wrong.  The battery won't even last a full day and night without needing a re-charge.  Of course, I can't return it to get a different product because it has been opened and used.  So, don't get fooled by the ""FREE RETURN"", lol. I had to contact Samsung and have had to troubleshoot it and now they want me to send it in to get it looked at.  That phone call took 1 hour to complete.  I just want my money back unfortunately to go to a different watch model but I'm not sure that will ever be the case.  If you want to utilize all the features on this watch, prepare to be without it at least once a day for it to charge."
"The first time I wore this watch I ran 6 plus miles.  While running, the watch starting counting my steps backwards.  This happened all day that day.  When I am in the shower, the watch states I am having heart issues and to seek medical attention.  It is weird that the water tapping my watch works better than me touching the screen. Today I was running, my watch said I was cycling and did not count any steps.  I can barely hear the notifications on my watch.  The volume is at it's maximum level.  This  watch is defective.  Extremely disappointed and disenchanted with purchase."
It fits great. But the battery goes so fast. Only wore it one day and I know it will not make it till the day without charging it. Going to return it for that reason only.
"This was my third galaxy smartwatch. The first one still works but is too big for every day use. My second was an active 2 wich  serve me well for three years until its battery didn,t last workinghours. I bought this knowing its battery was not good enough but this good looking watch worked very well the first days, then battery begin to drain in 6 to 8 hours, later in two hours after fully charged was out of juice. For first time in my life I opted for return the good, printed the labels and the courier charged for returning fee (from Colombia) $100 bucks. So I prefer to keep it in a drawer. So sad."
I didn't need a computer on my wrist. I have an amazefit but wanted an upgrade. I don't like the way you have to interact from the app to the phone. I'm going back to amazefit for the simplicity of the app. I don't need more distractions. I did a factory reset twice because I did something and couldn't figure out how to fix it.  The battery won't even last 24 hours. All day wear and sleep needs longer battery life.
"Fitbit is way better.Too late for me to return this. Waste of $200.How can u track steps, sleep etc if you always have to charge it!"
The watch was not user friendly. Did not work without a certain app. The refund for my purchase will take a month.It did not take a month for payment
It‚Äôs cheaper than apple and I previously had the Samsung active 2 which was amazing until it went out‚Ä¶ I did not realize it wasn‚Äôt capable of working with the iPhone 14 and now thr  return process for this is taking over a month which is wild to me since they‚Äôve received it I‚Äôve had phones take like 1 week to process still haven‚Äôt made my refund process
"I am very disappointed by the battery of this watch. I'll give it 1-star only because it feels light and looks good. Other than that, the battery sucks."
From I this watch the battery wouldn't last long. Now it doesn't even last 8 hours.
The band is horrible it hurts your wrist. The apps half the time don't work. The battery doesn't even last for 24 hours. So you have to take it off and let it charge for 2 hours. So steps aren't accurate. Not worth the money.
This watch did not even work for 6 months and broke. DO NOT BUY!!!
The battery don't last more than a 1 and half day.
The battery don't last more than a day. Looks beautiful and works great but the duration of the battery is horrible.
"Galaxy watch FE would not connect to my current Pixel 8 cellphone. It tried to access my discarded Galaxy S10 cellphone, which was not feasible."
Battery doesn't even last a day
"For background, I‚Äôve been a Fitbit Versa 2 user for 4 years, but my phones have been Samsungs for more than a decade.Setup is a bit more complicated.  Fully managing the device with all its features requires several separate apps.  However, the features of what it can monitor is impressive.  How accurate is it?  No idea, but the results seem to be different than what I was getting with my Versa 2.  The functionality is amazing.  It even allows me to manage my medications, including drug interactions.However, the battery life is abysmal.  When it arrived, the battery level was only at 10%‚Ä¶.almost every rechargeable device I‚Äôve ever owned arrived well above 2/3 full, if not close to 100%.  At first, it didn‚Äôt register as a problem to me.  Fortunately, it charges rather quickly.  But after only 2 days of use, the battery is completely dead.  My Versa lasts around 5 days‚Ä¶.even at 4 years old.  Charging every other day doesn‚Äôt work well when trying to reach my daily activity goals, manage my stress, and track my sleeping.  My best guess is the extra features drain the battery.Samsung needs to go back to the drawing board and figure out the battery life."
I order this watch for my husband to replace his old smartwatch/fitness tracker. Unfortunately he has an IPhone and this particular Samsung smart watch is not compatible with IPhone. I know Samsung makes modes that are compatible with IPhone this happens to be one of the ones that doesn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt give it a fair review on how it works but what I can say it looks great and has a nice sized watch face.  iPhone user please be more aware than I was before getting it.
"Just switched to a Samsung watch from a fitbit as I was looking for the convenience of a ""smarter"" fitness watch. It is not particularly user friendly for tracking calories burned during workouts or overall in a day. I changed the settings to read heartrate continuously (which absolutely trashes the battery life btw) and it will still read my heart rate at 80-something while I'm at the peak of a HIIT workout. I've tried tightening and loosening the band to improve accuracy to no avail.For reference, I did a bodybuilding with HIIT circuit workout today. I was in the gym actively moving from exercise to exercise with timed breaks not exceeding 30 seconds for a bit over an hour plus a 20 minute run after and the watch is reading 42 minutes of exercise with 210 ""activity calories"" burned. Anyone with exercise/calorie knowledge knows there's no way.Unfortunately I'm past my return window. I'm just going to sell it and go back to my fitbit."
It worked for a while then the texting stopped working. Kieron from support gave me some direction that got it working.  It hasn't worked for over a month now and he is ignoring my numerous emails now.  Doesn't make much sense to keep it if basic functionality doesn't work.  Guess I'll get an Apple or Samsung watch.
"The good: This watch is very lightweight. It has a great look, with a decent amount of power time.  There is a bunch of features on this phone and the functions are easy enough to find on the watch.The not so good: This will not work with an iPhone, was hoping to find something that would.  This limits its ability to pair, as the app is not even in the app store.  The stand alone features become limited due to this. This came with the one wrist band, which does run small as I had to use the last hole to fit on mine.As long as you have a Samsung phone, this will work great for you."
"I work 10 to 12 long hours a night and I'm a construction supervisor. I depend on my watch when my phone can't connect and this particular watches battery life runs out quickly, even if it's on power saving mode. I don't recommend this watch."
"The hardware seems pretty good but the software to look at the results are impossible to use. You cannot see what your oxygen level is during the sleep, there is no scale on the side it's just abysmal"
"I have always used AirPod pro, so that might be swaying my opinion.  I got the beats for several, to listen to my podcasts, talk on phone, and also to be able to use it on my teams calls on my windows laptop.  I knew it might not work, an apple product on a windows laptop, and I know there are much better over ear head sets out there for windows laptop.  But I have a Macbook, and all apple products and the windows laptop is for work. Sound quality I think is fine for an over ear headset.  I can hear clearly.  The noise cancelling isn't the best.  Again, this is my bias since I've always used AirPod pros.  That's not to say it's bad, it works fine for what I paid for it.  Honestly, my daughter's Bose gaming headset is a much better headset for sound quality, but a touch out of my price range.  I'm not returning this, because as I said, it does do the job well compared to other over ear head set.  But would I buy another beats, probably not unless there are ones with far superior quality.Mic quality.  It worked the first time I connected it to my windows laptop, then the mic just stopped working.  On my iPhone, I used it to make a call, and the person I was talking to said, it sounded like I was talking into a tunnel.  I switched to the airpod pros and she said it sounded clearer.My complaint is the top of the headset that sits on your head, it's not as comfortable as I'd like it to be.  The cushion, maybe if it was shaped differently would be more comfortable.Overall, it's a decent headset, does what it is was meant to do, but this particular series I don't think really lives up to the apple brand."
"Long story short:Not what I was expecting, and returning.Long Story long:So Last year my Fiance gifted me Beats Solo3 for my B-Day. I'm someone who loves to listen to music, and had been looking for some new headphones that would accompany a pair of Monster - Inspirations I've had for the past 10 years that are still going strong. Monster, you might remember, was the first company to produce Beats before they were bought by Apple. The Solo3's were PERFECT. I know they're not the most ""Audiophile"" pair of cans on the planet, but even Sennheiser's HD 800's need some sort of DAC to make them less...Flat sounding. And hey, if you like Flat and consider yourself a true audiophile...well first, I don't know why you'd be reading a review for Beats Studio Pro, and second, I mean good for you, listening to music like it was a 1920's Phonograph.Me, I personally favor boosted everything. Bass, Mids, Highs. And the Solo 3's were, hell, still are, amazing. No full DAC required. Everytime I plug in the 3.5mm cable and listen to Lossless audio on my home server, Gosh, I mean...they sound good streaming 320kbps AAC/MP3's over bluetooth, which is what MOST OF YOU will use them for, but LOSSLESS!? It makes me wet. I'm sorry.So enter the Studio Pro's. Got these for $169 on Prime Day. Busted these babies out, put them in AAANNND...boy, they are not like the Solo3's at all. I mean, connected via Bluetooth is fine. It's fine. They're fine. Any $75 dollar headset will perform well enough over bluetooth and give you comparable noise cancelling if you're looking for that.  But these, at retail NOT ON SALE, are like $350...I expect MORE from that. The other reviews gushing about these led me to believe I'd be getting MORE from that. And, again, they're fine. It's fine. But not GREAT. And for $350 I expect them to be great. For $170 I expected them to be BETTER, and they just weren't. And that's just bluetooth...when I plugged them in via the USB-C cable AND the 3.5mm jack for lossless audio...boy the performance was not there. They were so much quieter than the Solo's, and nothing was as Punchy. In fact, they sounded kind of flat. But if I wanted flat, I'd get the Sennheiser's and like a $600 DAC or other sound mix board to plug directly into. And you know, I have a DAC. It's the $65 dollar Fiio BTR3K, which is actually a very nice portable device I've used with my Solo3's and in my car to get lossless audio in my car. It performs well for what it is. So I plugged the Studio Pro's into it and they instantly sounded superior. And, y'know, I probably wouldn't mind that at all if I was listening to music 8 hours a day through the DAC and with the headphones firmly on. But I'm not, at least not enough to justify even the heavily discounted price I paid. And even with the Dac and settings, they still weren't as punchy. The Solo3's...I don't know, everytime I listen to lossless, it feels like I'm in the studio with the band, but with the Studio Pros, it feels like I'm listening to an MP3 on an iPod from 2008. That you downloaded. From Limewire. I mean, again, it's FINE, they're FINE. But shouldn't we be expecting more than FINE? Maybe it's time to bite the bullet and just invest in a Pair of the Sony XM5's or, yes, the Sennheiser HD600's or 700's or 800's with a beefy Desktop DAC if I want to increase my experience.But these...these ain't it. (Side note: They're VERY comfortable, and if Comfort is what you're after, and only comfort, you'll love these.)"
"I bought the Beats Studio Pro when they were 50% off but ended up returning them after a week of trying them out. I'm not an audiophile, nor am I super picky with headphones, but these just weren't it. For starters, I like the look of them as they appear a lot slimmer on your head compared to other over the ear headphones that are bulky and stick out, however, it's probably that slimness that caused the headphones to give me a major headache. I have an average sized head, but the headphones felt very compressive, and I couldn't wear them for more than 30-45 mins before having to give up and take them off. I wore them everyday for a week to try and break them in, and while I was able to push a little bit longer each day, I didn't think it was worth it to keep them in the hopes that they might someday wear more comfortably.I was also pretty unimpressed with the sound quality on the headphones. By no means is it bad, but it's also not what I was expecting, especially for the price. I had to turn my volume up way louder compared to other headphones, and even then, it's not like the sound quality seemed that much better.I honestly probably would've kept them if I was only having to deal with one of these factors, but since I had more negatives than positives, I ended up returning them."
"Summary of impressions coming from a user with 2 years of Apple AirPods Pro (earbuds) experience. These are my personal, average geek consumer opinions only, no scientific testing was conducted nor am I a professional in any way.Sound quality (out of box): 2/5 (bass is severely under driven and music is very flat in general)Sound quality (with equalizer adjustments): 3.5/5 (equalizer is also very inconvenient to use, so you will have to manually shut off your adjustments when switching to Apple CarPlay or other headphones)Comfort (with glasses): 2/5Comfort (no glasses): 4/5 (very lightweight, no pressure on head, my ears get a bit warm though)ANC (with glasses): 2/5 (noise gets through around my glasses frames)ANC (no glasses): 3.5/5 (no sinus pressure, popping, weird artifacts detected. Just not as good as AirPods Pro 2 which I am used to.)Connectivity: 3/5 (occasional manual connection setup required, occasional intermittent skips when using Apple Music; never experienced either of these issues with my AirPods Pro 2)Value for money at $159 purchase price: 3/5 (certainly not a low-end but even $159, it feels a bit too expensive for what I got.)Value for money at MSRP $349: 0/5 (These do not feel premium in any way shape or form to me at least, I'd feel burned if I paid full price for these.)."
"Let me be straightforward:Sound Quality: If AirPods Max is a perfect 10, I would rate the AirPods Pro 2nd Gen an 8, and Beats a 7. The overall sound is decent, but clarity and separation are still average. Lossless Audio does make a difference, but it only pushes the score to an 8.Noise Cancellation: Again, if AirPods Max is a 10, I'd give AirPods Pro a 9, while Beats gets a 7. The ear cups don‚Äôt fully enclose your ears, which naturally affects the noise cancellation. Additionally, Beats has higher background noise.Comfort: 6 out of 10. The ear cups still press against the ears, making long-term comfort less comparable to flagship models from other brands. Since the ear cups don't fully enclose the ears, the sound experience varies for different users, which is another drawback.Appearance: 9 out of 10. Beats definitely look cool.Conclusion: Are they worth $170? Or not? If you're spending $170, why not choose AirPods Pro 2nd Gen? They offer better sound quality, more portability, more comfortable, superior noise cancellation, better Transparency Mode, and the H2 chip. So, unless you're specifically looking for over-ear headphones instead of earbuds, there's little reason to choose Beats (except for Android users)."
"I joined the beats family back in around 2013 and was a proud owner of my studio headphones and beats pill xl the sheer audio quality and power we received from these products were outmatched to the point where Apple bought the company to take out the competition. Over 10 years later based on my experience with previous beats products I decided to grab a new set of studio pros and boy am I disappointed.  the sound is crystal clear however these headphones are not loud enough, and The bass does not kick as hard as it used to in previous versions almost as of this was purposely done to further sell apples flagship headphones. The headphones do not seamlessly connect between my Apple devices and I find my self manually switching to my headphones especially when I receive a call. The over ear cups are not deep enough and I feel the tips of my ears rubbing against the inside of the headphones. my ears also get itchy and irritated do to the lack Of ventilation and ear cups resting against my ear tips. There is no user detection with these headphone I.e headphones pausing or turning on, off when the headphones are worn and I find myselfManually having to stop any playback instead ofLifting the headphones off myEars. Build quality is out the window cheap plastics buttons are tacky and loud. Sound cancelation is very subpar I hear cars driving past and people conversations. Battery life is as advertised which isn't too shocking considereing how much these headphones under perform. Things get a little better using usb-c but not by much definitely more noticeable and useable"
"This is my first pair of beats over the ear headphones. Previously, I've owned Bose headphones and really loved them.First of all they're very comfortable. No pain and adjustable so that's great. The cushioning is good and it covers my entire ear. But for a man with larger ears, it might be a challenge.The buttons are easy to navigate. And it synced with my iPhone perfectly.I don't use it answering the phone so I can't comment on that. I rarely talk to anyone on the phone.The challenges I have with this are noise cancellation that doesn't work as well as other headphones. It muted the background slightly but I can still hear other things going on. So, at the gym and on an airplane, it doesn't cancel it just mute out the background.The other challenge I have is in my massage chair and in an airplane chair, it pushes the headphones forward and off my ears. Super uncomfortable when that happens.Basically, it's not delivering what they said it would. I think that people that really love these have not tried the higher end non-beats earphones."
"Let me preface this by saying that I love Beats power beats headphones. I have had them for a few years and love using them. I did miss having headphones that cover my ears, so I splurged on a pair of these.Fit: mostly comfortable, just a touch tight after a while. 8/10Sound quality: amazing 10/10. Like other Beats, these do not disappoint in this department.Noise canceling: not awesome. 5/10. Even with the noise canceling option on, they just don‚Äôt cancel enough for my taste.Design: 3/10 stylish BUT every time I wear them, my hair gets caught between the earpiece and headband. I end up ripping out quite a few pieces of hair and it is so painful. If I tie my hair back, I don‚Äôt have this issue. I just feel that Beats surely had someone with long hair try these. How did they not catch this? I cannot be the only person with this problem.Overall, I am disappointed with this purchase because they didn‚Äôt live up to the high expectations I have for Beats."
"I tried both AirPods Max and Beats Studio Pro at the Apple store, and the Beats Studio Pro offers much better noise cancellation. When I tried that at home, I could not hear the background noise such as the one from furnace.For the microphone, it works great with iOS and macOS devices, but it is virtually unusable on Windows platform. I did this by recording a message using Skype and Teams and playing back afterward. Initially I thought it was the volume issue. I kept the same volume and I tried with two different headsets (Microsoft and Logi) and they were fine. So I guess this is either driver issue or Apple didn't expect this product to be used on Windows platform.Overall, if you use it for purely music / listening, go for it. It works great (including iOS, macOS and Windows). If you use it for video call on Windows, skip it and get a different one."
The headphones are gorgeous and stand by their name.  But as far as sound it's not what I wanted or expected.  I kept trying to like it but I will be sending it back and restarting my search. I thought the quality would be more immersive but it sounds the same as my cheap $20 earbuds I'm trying to replace.  I keep trying to turn up the volume and I'm already at max.  I typically use this outdoors on my walks.  The noise cancellation is there and the sound does t really leak.  But there's no echoing the bass and mids are missing. Just that feeling of being lost in the music is what I want and it's not what I'm getting.  If I'm going to spend I want what I want.  If you're just using indoors it's okay.
"I‚Äôve had these for a year now with daily use. It‚Äôs great for commute, travel, and the office. Mic quality is good as well. Charging is fairly fast and battery life is solid. The ear pads are comfortable after long time of use. They look good with a variety of outfits too. Despite all the positives, the headphones aren‚Äôt very durable. The noise canceling had stopped working after a year of use. Now when I turn on the noise canceling, I just hear a static noise with occasional popping sound. So now they‚Äôre just regular Bluetooth headphones with no noise canceling."
"Good quality, good sound, decent noise cancelling. Super easy to pair. I opened them immediately, I was really looking forward to having these. Bought them at a great price. Unfortunately after about 3 minutes it felt like they were squeezing my head. I had to take them off and I put them back in the box and I'm probably going to return them. They gave me a headache and they were very uncomfortable. I can't say how everything works except they were easy to pair and the noise cancellation was decent although not the best. Unfortunately I cannot recommend these."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I owned these headphones way back in the day when they were still owed by Dre. They were SURPERD!!! I could barely raise the volume because they were so LOUD!!! These do fit comfortable like the first pair I had But if you wear glasses like I do, they do get a little to tight. The clicking of the button is an annoying because even while listening to your music, you still can hear the clicking if you are turning up or down the volume, pausing or skipping your music. which takes me to the Noah‚Äôs cancellation. To me it‚Äôs Horrible. The Beats by Dre was excellent with the noise cancellation. My AirPod pro are 100 times better with the noise cancellation than with Studio Pro. Also the Loudiness is HORRIBLE. You can have the volume all the way up on your phone and on the headphones and it‚Äôs still not loud enough. Still a great present tho but Apple could had done way better for the price they are charging, luckily I got them on Black Friday deal so I can‚Äôt complain."
"I didn‚Äôt care for these headphones. Wasn‚Äôt that much difference between these and the Beats Solo 4. I was looking for noise cancellation in both. There is none in the Beats Solo 4 and I could still hear outside sounds with these Beats x Kim. The Beats Solo 4 actually fit better than Beats x Kim, which kinda ached after just a little more than an hour‚Äôs wear.I‚Äôm returning both. Not even worth the sale price."
These headphones are great sound wise and noise cancellation wise. I will say they are quit heavy when worn for a longer time. My main issue was every time I would take them off the headphones would snag my hair and pull it. Literally the main reason I‚Äôm returning is because no matter how I style my hair the headphones yank it everytime. I have not had this issue with any other brand of over head headphones.
"Let me start off by saying, I‚Äôve owned in my opinion the best in sound quality and noise cancellation‚Ä¶the Sony XM4‚Äôs. With that being said this is my first set of beats headphones ever and I‚Äôm glad I introduced myself to the brand. I value high quality sound on a plane trip along with superior noise cancelation. Let me be clear, I don‚Äôt wanna hear anything whether I‚Äôm cutting grass or flying in a plane, and with these beats;  it‚Äôs underwhelming to say the least. I‚Äôm 35 and appreciate great sound quality in todays age and as of this review I‚Äôve passed down these headphones within a week to my 10 year old son who thinks there the best headphones made by man. I got these during the prime October sales and at 169 they are worth it somewhat‚Ä¶.maybe . Please Do Not pay $350 for these ever!!!"
"I love these headphones, except that they rip out chunks of hair every time I remove them! It‚Äôs a horrible, horrible design for people with hair long enough to get caught in it. I‚Äôve only worn them for a few days but it has absolutely shredded my hair/I‚Äôve had to cut my hair out on multiple occasions. If the company reads this, please reach out with a solution that doesn‚Äôt involve partial baldness."
"I thought these would be a step up from my AirPod Pro 2‚Äôs for listening to high-fidelity music for extended periods of time, so I grabbed them during the Black Friday sale. I ended up returning.Beats might be a good option for you if you have a non-Apple phone, like their aesthetic, prefer over-ear vs in-ear with active noise cancellation, and enjoy very ‚Äúboomy‚Äù bass.In my experience, AirPods > Beats in almost every regard. They‚Äôre much more convenient, ultra-streamlined with Apple products, sound much clearer & have a much more balanced sound profile, and can be used for a long time without hearing fatigue.Long story short, the Beats Studio Pros will work for some, but for others they may sound ‚Äúmuddy‚Äù and potentially painful.If you‚Äôre like me and prefer a more in-depth review, read on :)_____Context: I‚Äôm in my 20‚Äôs and while I don‚Äôt claim to be an audiophile, I do have pretty sensitive hearing ‚Äî no damage (as far as I know).Let‚Äôs start with the positives:- comfy for small head & ears- cute- wired connectivity* & Bluetooth connectivity- effectively cancels outside noise- convenient & portable = great for commuting- long battery life- closed-back & PU-padded ear cups seal around your ears in a way that allow for ‚Äúpassive‚Äù noise cancellation (without the ANC turned on, outside noises are still quite muffled)- will be totally fine for the average consumerNow for the cons:- high-res music sounded really mushy/muddy, aka, my favorite songs sounded like a one-dimensional mishmash of ‚Äúnoise‚Äù at only 30% volume (the higher, the worse).- wired/USB-C connection between my iPhone or laptop turns on noise cancellation with no option to switch it off or to transparency mode- without wired connection, the sound quality naturally declines. This is normal for anything using Bluetooth (currently, anyway), since a wired connection makes for much better digital to analog sound conversion. Aka, lossless will sound better wired.- music balanced in a way that makes certain sounds too quiet and others much too loud (even after messing with Spotify‚Äôs EQ)***ANC can cause illness*** (more on that below). Active Noise Cancellation uses an inaudible frequency to cancel out noise around us, basically shutting our ears into a small space with the sound. This can be great for some, but not others, depending on brand, individual preference/use case, and the frequencies your ears are sensitive to.In general, ANC generally gives me a claustrophobic, ‚Äúunderwater‚Äù feeling, so I keep my AirPods on transparency mode. I decided to give these a chance, despite transparency mode being unusable while wired.In about an hour of listening at only 30% volume, I felt increasingly weird, starting with dizziness, ear-popping, and tinnitus, and eventually full-on vertigo, disorientation, and nausea. I was writing at the time, and literally had to stop because my hand kept drifting to the left. Those symptoms continued for a full 48hrs after taking them off.That really freaked me out (as you can probably imagine), so I did some research and found that ‚ÄúANC sickness‚Äù is a real thing. In fact, it‚Äôs actually pretty common, and something headphone companies need to be cautious about. Not only can certain people be sensitive to the noise-canceling frequency, but the extreme air pressure of the sound waves some headphones produce & pulse directly into the ear (especially with strong bass, sudden or prolonged exposure to loud noises) can cause barotrauma.So if you‚Äôre prone to having ear popping, ringing, aching, overstimulation, or other audio sensitivity, I do NOT recommend Beats.However, these (admittedly-awful) shortcomings lead me to discover open-back, headphones, which are over-ear like these, but with holes/vents in the backs of the ear cups, allowing sound to expand into a larger space vs directly into your ears. I love my Senny HD599‚Äôs to death for the incredible sound quality & comfort for long listening sessions.However, those aren‚Äôt really meant for commuting as they are wired and some sound gets in & out, so like I said, it depends on your use case."
"I own the XM4, & they‚Äôre really great. I wanted to buy a pair of headphones I can use at the gym, so I bought these. I liked the color & thought of getting them for quite some time. They‚Äôre noisy to open & close, & the touch control is also noisy. They sound flat & you can‚Äôt enjoy all the different sounds in a track like I can with the XM4.When the volume is low, the bass sounds trembly. In order for the music to sound decent, the volume needs to be at 75% volume. That‚Äôs unacceptable to me.I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre worth keeping for what I need them for. I might return these even though I got them at a sale price.They‚Äôre a little tight on the head so I imagine prolonged use will hurt."
This is my 2nd pair of Beats and honestly I on the fence to return them. My original beats seem much louder. I almost want to get those back and save the extra money.  I love the color of these just not any better than the original.  Not worth the exact money.
"These were overhyped üòó.. I was looking for headphones that had a great ear-tingling bass and more dynamic sound range, but these don‚Äôt do that at all. I would‚Äôve been better off buying another pair of Skullcandy Crushers lol üíÄüôèüèΩ. If you‚Äôre looking for just general neutral sounding headphones, then these are great for you."
When I use this with my Apple TVit seems I have to manually connect it to Bluetooth fairly often. Many times I have to remove it from my head to tell if it is on orOff. Sound is very good and it moves whenI turn my head. Pretty cool effect.
All the photos show a chrome color. The real color is poop brown. Built shorter than the original so the fit is weird. Hurts the top of my head. You could say the adjust it but the next available position puts them far enough from my head that is weighs on my ears.
"I tried these out for a week, and while it's good that they play nice with the Apple ecosystem, there are a few features I wish these had, namely 1) auto-pause upon taking them off 2) a case that folds open all the way - it's hard to retrieve and remove the headphones from them and feels like doing so will damage the case, headphones, or both over time.  Most importantly, and the reason I'm returning them - the headband is not comfortable and ends up causing mild pain after about 30 minutes of use.  They might work for others, but don't work well for me."
"Got it during Black Friday sale. Overall nothing special for a bluetooth headphone. It feels solid in the hand. It is actually not comfortable if you put it on in a long period of time (I use it at most 2 hours and my ears hurt after that). Nice long battery tho. Nothing special about sound quality compared to airpod pro 2 I have, but I am no sound expert.Fingerprints can leave easy on the material.In conclusion, I won't buy it if it is not on sale. For a headphone I think comfort is one of the most important feature and this doesn't match my expectation at all."
"Audio quality is great, and for that id give this a 4 star. But the frame is so fragile that it broke completely within 3 months of normal use.As you can see in the photo i tried patching it up my self but a week later the other side broke too, so at that point it wouldn‚Äôt stay on my head at allTo clarify, by break i mean the plastic holding the ear piece slipped out of place due to what looked like a lack of adhesive.Still i liked the headphones so i looked into getting them repaired assuming this type of problem would be covered by the 2 year warranty that came with my purchase.Well it wasn‚Äôt. I called apple support and after about 15 minutes chatting ( apple support was great no problems there) i was told i would have to go to my nearest apple store and pay upwards of $50 to get this minor issue repairedEven with apple support the repair wouldn‚Äôt be free  (i was told $25)I wont be getting my money or time back but i hope i can save yours"
"I generally like these headphones and wear them during every poker session. It would be a waste not to after spending a few hundred bucks on them. The sound quality is very good but there are major design flaws! These headphones were clearly designed by a bald man for bald men because they constantly slip off my head and pull out chunks of hair every single time I wear them. It's pretty discouraging and embarrassing. People stare at me as I try to pull the headphones off slowly so as not to rip more chunks of hair out of my scalp.These are the heaviest headphones I've ever tried on or owned. The heavy weight screws up the balance. They don't stay securely on my head and they fall on the floor with a loud, heavy thud, drawing the attention of everyone in the vicinity.I like that the headphones fold up but I don't like that they don't flatten/turn inwards around my neck. When I try to rest my chin on my arms I'm unable to because they're uncomfortable and get in the way. These headphones don't really fit my head properly.The battery life is excellent! After a full charge they play music for over 24 hours straight. I've never owned headphones or any type of electronic device that lasted even half of that! It's really convenient for someone like me who plays marathon poker sessions.I am forced to purchase new headphones because although I like these, I'm gonna end up bald within a few years if I keep using them regularly.üòÖ The design must be changed!"
"Thought the fit wasn‚Äôt great - the ear cups don‚Äôt have enough padding, so the speaker pushed up against my ears. They also feel very plastic-y, and the buttons have an unpleasant click to them. Nice color and case though!"
"Built felt like it had quality to it.A little tight on the head, likely to cause a headache.Don't buy if you intend to use on a PC.  The mic is terrible at best."
"Sound and bass is good, but it was difficult for me to wear it for long as it crushed my head. If you‚Äôre used to Beats, you‚Äôre fine as they all crush my head."
"Bought these on a Prime Day deal. I see people at the gym wearing these all the time, I figured they must be decent. They are not.Pros:- Comfortable- Low profile- Look good on your head (for what they are)- Decent noise cancelingCons:- Sound is a bit muddy and requires a lot of tweaking with an equalizer app to make it passable, but never gets great or even good- Beats app does not have a built in equalizer so if your phone doesn't have one you have to download a 3rd party equalizer app- The bass SUCKS and nothing you do in the equalizer can make it good, these headphones will always be weak on bass- Passive noise isolated of the ear cups is not great- I did not like the button functionality for volume, next track, etc.I had these for a few weeks and a friend convinced me to try Bose QuietComfort. I got the Bose with a coupon and the price difference was only $63 between the Beats on sale and the Bose after coupon. But man-oh-man they are easily worth every additional penny! The Bose are better in virtually every regard:- Clean sound- Resounding bass- Better passive noise isolation from the ear cups- Better active noise cancelation- Buttons and functionality is better- Better carrying case and size for travelThe only thing I like better about the Beats is the low profile and ""looks"" but that's marginal and NOT something I care too much about.Get the Bose QC on sale, they truly are worth it!"
"For the price paid, it think it is not worth more than Chinese knock out products. Not happy. :(I bought this on black friday. so I only out $160."
These Beats headphones were very uncomfortable. They fit way too tight on my ears and felt like it was squeezing my head. Also felt very heavy when wearing. I'm comparing to Bose Quietcomfort headphones which are much more comfortable and have better padding. The sound was good but not as good as I was expecting. I have a normal sized head and never had any fit issues with previous headphones. I think people just buy these because of the marketing. There are much better/ more comfortable headphones on the market for comparable cost
I am very surprised on how the sound quality is not the greatest at all.  I have some old beats headphones and they sound way better than these
"Been comparing back and forth these and my old studio pros from years ago. These are definitely not as good as the originals. So disappointed, I‚Äôm going to return or give away."
"yes great color, good design and famous name of really one of the significant figures of rap industry dr.Dre. However the first thing that caught my attention is that bass is very weak. well really. i bought two headphones at once for myself and for a friend. i tested them both and sound bass was really very weak. (thinking to switch to skullcandy crusher evo) when i listened to one track i remembered my old experience of using marshall MAJOR IV headphones. and in my opinion even they sounded better. i don't want you to think that i hate beats brand, on the contrary i am a big fan of dr.dre and all culture of rap of west coast. however experience of sound of these headphones makes me a little sad. maybe they can reveal their potential through amplifier, i can't say for sure if it is so because i don't have amplifier. in my opinion the best headphones in beats series were model Monster Beats By Dr Dre Pro Over Ear. it was a really good build quality with very good materials and comfortable ear pads and pretty good sound. but apple just killed this model because they need to promote their apple airpods max. it's pretty sad that marketing kills past good ideas and their execution. glad if this review will be useful for at least someone.oh and yes, if you think that this brand new model of headphones will have a function to stop the music when you take the headphones off your head, then this is a mistake, the music will just continue playing. there is no tracking sensor here."
So I‚Äôve had these for about 2 months now and honestly the sound is great but I would prefer more bass. Definitely rethinking about purchasing the Apple pro max headphones now.
No strap on bag. Lost while traveling. Too big for my laptop bag‚Ä¶. If it had a strap I would have attached to by laptop.
"I just purchased these headphones. They sound great and the noise-canceling feature is solid and effective. However, considering the $350 price tag, I'm disappointed that these Beats don't come with an iPhone app with equalizer and the possibility of saving custom settings.This is something I've come to expect from good headphones. Beats does offer different pre-built 'sound experiences', but the only way to access these is by connecting the headphones to your phone using a USBC cable.Crazy cumbersome, and frankly unacceptable. Disappointed with the brand and with apple connectivity."
"Came across the brand - exaggerated quality at an inflated price, nothing in common with real high quality performance. Returned"
"The sound was great and they were. Comfortable,  the port broke and they won't charge and it's almost not worth even fixing."
"I was looking for an affordable option, and by the time I was purchasing this, it was 50% off, so can't complain about the VFM, however... My priority was noise-cancelling, as I am sensitive to all types of unwanted sounds, like someone talking on the phone at the office, or construction noises in the building, etc. I have had Sony, and I had no problem with noise cancellation. It was super cool, I could just turn off my nerves and work, live, move, do sports, etc. Beats has waaaay worse noise-cancellation, in the background in all modes I still hear what is going on around.The only things that is better comparing to Sony, is the stronger construction, for gym it is a plus.All other options Beats is worse. Sony is a winner.It is also a discomfort while switching between connected devices, take several some time till the headphone understands that it has to play on another device.Anyway, if I had to buy this at its original price, I would not do that. Not worth it.If I was an iPhone user, I would take AirPods Max, if no compatibility issue, I would still take it.So, if ANC is important for you, here is the list of winners:1. Apple AirPods Max2. Sony / Bose3. Beats (but not with the full original price)"
"I bought this pair of beats on sale for 169 during some deal weekend thing. I can tell you it's quality all the way around and they feel pretty comfy on my head and ears. Alot lighter them the studio 3's. It's not as loud as previous models for for how thing some of the metal is on the shell it seems it might be prone to breakage if you use it regularly, overall not a bad product."
"I had a hard time getting these up and running due to the instructions being almost impossible to gather and understand. An old school instruction booklet would have been great. As mentioned in many other reviews, the Beats app is super wonky. I couldn't even register my Studio Pros on that app.Having to actually physically plug the headphones into my smartphone to change the sound profile is just ridiculous!I bought an 18 dollar pair of ""Picun8"" headphones on Amazon prior to buying these that have a sound profile button right on the actual headset. No fumbling for a cord and looking for my phone to watch something on my smart t.v.! What a concept!My super cheap Picun8s are also much more comfortable due to memory foam padding and also have deeper bass and louder volume than these overpriced underwhelming ""riding on their past reputation"" headphones.The Beats sound clarity is slightly better than my Picun 8s. But not by much. I am glad that I had some super cheap headphones to compare these to. I will test drive the Beats a little longer to decide if I will just send them back or regift them prior to 30 days.So far?....Unimpressive even at the sale price of half off. I would look at other cheaper well reviewed brands that actually have some bass, that you can actually adjust sound profiles on without an app, and that come with an easy to understand instruction book. Meh."
"The noise cancelling isn‚Äôt great. After using AirPod pros for years and then trying Bose headphones from friends. These do not compare. I bought them for half off so I can‚Äôt be too upset. But even then, a skull candy pair for the same price would probably be better. However, they are comfortable and no issues even when going on runs. Sound quality is just not great"
"A few things about these beats, the color is absolutely beautiful but the noise cancellation isn‚Äôt great, it‚Äôs 6/10 and the worse part they pull my hair so much, is extremely annoying, another thing would be sweaty ears but they fit good over all, and it‚Äôs a nightmare to try to reconnect them, the battery seems to last and they charge pretty fast.I unfortunately will be returning them because it just isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm looking for overall"
These ‚Äúnew‚Äù beats had scratches on it.Fit was more loose than before.Nice color.
It tweaks out like after playing 3 or 4 songs....it is also so uncomfortable
I have 10 acres and I do a lot of work outside. I've been using some skull candy crusher headphones for around 4 years now. Recently they started acting up so it was time to shop for a new pair. I've always heard good things about beats so I decided to gove em a go. After reading lots of reviews I decided the studio pro was probably going to be more my fit. I got them and let's just say I wasn't wowed. The clarity is good sound is good but I'm spoiled to the base the crushers have. I've read that you can customize the sound more if you have apple. I'm Samsung all the way. Anyways I went ahead and ordered the skullcandy and 2 I just got those today and they in my opinion are far superior and will run you over 100.00 less. So if you want headphones with bass go with skull candy. Beats just don't have the bass.
"Needless to say, these headphones don‚Äôt.I‚Äôve had these for quite some time now, and I have regretted buying them from day 1. I should have returned them, but these things must have gaslighted me, bc I thought I was the problem.About 50% of the time that I turn them on, they won‚Äôt connect to my phone. They just sit there blinking like an idiot. If I try to manually connect with my phone, it will say ‚Äúdevice unavailable‚Äù. Bruh, for the price tag, these things should talk to my iPhone and not just sit there like the village idiot.The ear muffs are also not breathable whatsoever and they make my head SWEAT like a summer day in Phoenix. Even if I‚Äôm just walking and not lifting weights, if I‚Äôm wearing these, my ears are sweating more than any other body part. Quite a feat. I get tired of washing my hair, only for the hair around my ears to be drenched in sweat hours later because of headphones üôÑThe only reason I didn‚Äôt leave a 1 star review is because they do sound nice and the battery life last a long time. But I do genuinely hate these things. I wish I‚Äôd seen a review about these issues before I bought them. Oh well‚Ä¶"
"When the noise reduction mode is on, it adds some small background noise, which irritates me. I have 7-year old Bose headphones which have this base level much lower. The other problem is that Bluetooth connection occasionally breaks, which is a big problem when you watch a movie at night and suddenly the device speakers start playing instead of the headphones. Not comfortable on the head- after 30 minutes I want removing them to have some rest. The spec says that they can connect to many devices. Kind of true, but not what I expect. My old Bose headphones switch connections automatically. With this headphones I need to go to the device settings and manually select ‚Äúconnect‚Äù in the Bluetooth menu.Definitely not worth full price of $350. I for it at a 50% discount and this is max that I would pay for them. I was thinking to return, but finally decide to keep. They are not great, but OK, especially because I got them for half price (and now I understand why they are discounted).The best thing about them is that I got 6 month Apple Music for free ($60 value)."
Basic nothing different from any of the other beats
"The headphones came in perfect condition, just as pictured and expected. I‚Äôve never owned Beats before, with the sale going on I decided to finally try some. The bass in these is awful, which surprised me a lot. The sound is itself is decent. I wouldn‚Äôt buy these again, but they get the job done I guess‚Ä¶"
"If you have an Apple phone, there‚Äôs no app or much of a way to adjust anything. The microphone is so low that voice memos and phone calls are impossible with Bluetooth. I read forums discussing this very issue. If you‚Äôre an Android user, this may be great. Not for Apple!"
"I was really excited for these. They are probably the nicest (or at least most expensive) pair of headphone I have bought.For the first month or so I was absolutely in love but then Active Noise Cancelling and transparency stopped working and would pipe weird noise into one ear and the microphone for phone calls started having issues.Recently I started having issues where the volume is super quiet on all devices regardless of connection method USB-C, analog, or Bluetooth then sometimes after I turn them off for a while it will work again.Despite the negatives, I really like them‚Ä¶ I use them every day for most of the day. Sometimes I even forget to turn music on but they are comfortable and block out noise.I really like them; just not at their price point or based on their marketing of it being a premium product. I got it on sale for Prime and if I had paid full price I would be furious."
Sound and base was very mid quality.
Everything about it is amazing. The sound and noise cancellation is good. But within 30 mins or even less of it being on it starts to hurt my ears. I even thought it was because I had the volume too high but it wasn't that.
"Man, I‚Äôm real disappointed in these beats. I bought the new white ones they just came out with thinking I‚Äôd have a cool looking pair of headphones that came with premium sound, especially because of the price and brand. However, once wearing them and trying them I‚Äôve found that they really, really lack in bass, and also don‚Äôt even have adjustable EQ unless you plug em in with usb c. And no auto pause when you take em off your head either. I‚Äôm so disappointed and I‚Äôm returning them‚Ä¶probably will just buy another pair of my JBL 660NC‚Äôs, cuz those were fire. I guess I didn‚Äôt know what I had already was pretty good. These suck tho."
Not enough bass and quiet.
Just tried these out for the 1st time on a 14 hour flight. The sound was good and battery lasted but they didn't block out all the noise on the plane. I could still hear people talking around me and a baby crying. So only 3 stars bc they don't actually seem to the noise canceling
I had a pair before but i amNot loving these. The sound is lower and it‚Äôs been a struggle for others to hear me. I feel like now i might bite the bullet and get me some apple max headphones. Will be returning them
"The headphone design is an A+ but there are certain features they can improve on. I compared the Beats Studio Pro headphones to my $40 Amazon made-in-China headphones and surprisingly my $40 headphones have so far outperformed the Beats and that's saying something.While my $40 headphones pair well and can switch back and forth between devices without disconnecting, the Beats was unable to do that. It would disconnect from one device to connect to the other preventing me from multi-tasking. Battery life is huge for me and my $40 headphones would last me a couple of days without charging after 8 hours of use, beats battery doesn't last long and you have to charge daily which is sometimes not convenient.Noise cancellation with my $40 headphones is superior compared to the Beats. Regarding cushion comfort, the cushions on my $40 bucks headphones are more comfortable, and can wear them all day. Overall, for $350 I don't think the Beats are worth the price for what you get.There are far superior headphones that cost a fraction of the price that are worth checking out. I'm curious to see what improvements they make in the future but as of right now, the headphones are mediocre...I can't recommend them.For these reasons, I give them a 3/5 rating."
"Me: 100% Apple ecosystem. I quite like the AirPods 2 in a quiet environment. AirPods Pro are ok (good for noisy environment like pool). I tried the AirPods Max in store and they sound eh ... ok. Can't justify that price, and I don't want to buy anything with Lightning at this point. Upcoming trip, wanted to get a pair of over-ear headphones for long plane rides. I have a long narrow man face - so not a big wide head or face.Beats Studio Pro: Extremely high clamping force. Seems like it's designed for children size heads. Very tight on my head and resultantly uncomfortable. Not enough room for ears - kinda squeezes them in. Also not enough padding on the headband - pain on top of head.  I love the look of them, white/stone color is excellent. Button click is loud and irritating in your ears. No EQ - sound is ok. Too bassy for me, but I could live with it. I like that you can say ""Hey Siri.""Sony XM4. You put them on and they are SO much more comfortable than Beats Studio Pro. The comfort difference is night and day. Sound was too bassy, but then I went into EQ and adjusted it just the way I like it (lower bass, higher treble), and now they sound very good. Transparency mode is terrible - you will not want to have a conversation with these on your head. Beats Studio Pro have much better Transparency mode.Due to comfort and EQ, this was an extremely easy choice. I returned the Beats Studio Pro and kept the Sony XM4. (I did not consider the XM5 due to stupid case and much higher price.) Sonys are a pleasure to wear and listen to. Beats are uncomfortable and you find yourself looking for an excuse to remove them from your head."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            First of all, I hardly ever take to writing a review unless I‚Äôm impressed by the value OR just completely surprised for the LACK of value. One, I bought these because my AirPods work well but they hurt my ears when I need to wear them all day for work. I wanted some good quality brand name over-the-ear headphones for noise cancelling quality, microphone usage (for work, or messaging), and for comfort.These headphones are terrible for ALL of that. 1. Noise cancelling. I thought my wireless beats (from 7 years ago) had pretty good noise cancelling so surely these over the ear headphones will work. Nope. I find myself switching to ‚Äútransparent‚Äù mode accidentally bc SURELY this isn‚Äôt considered the noise cancelling mode?? Very terrible for $180 (on sale) LET ALONE $300???2. Microphone usage is important since I take calls on these. When I try to record voice notes, it sounds like I‚Äôm in a tunnel AND 30 ft away. Outrageous for a brand OWNED by Apple. I have to disconnect my Bluetooth so I can use my iPhone mic.3. Comfort. Not a hard thing to get right. Right? These are pretty lightweight. Don‚Äôt bother me to be on for a long while. BUT!! They YANK my hair out CONSTANTLY. Just trying to take these off with my hair down, they get tangled every time. I‚Äôve had them for 2 months and I‚Äôm so mad I spent $180 on these.Please save your money and spring for Sony or Bose. I‚Äôm urging you to buy $30 ones because I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be better.Additionally! Sound quality is terrible!They sound like every day regular headphones you can buy for literally $20. I still use them because I thought I‚Äôd give them a shot and a fair chance but it doesn‚Äôt get better.Battery life is great. That‚Äôs the only plus. Last longer than my 2 year old AirPods but I would never ever recommend these beats.Bad sound quality, bad comfort, bad microphone input, bad purchase."
Although I like the color. Sometimes one side goes out. When I‚Äôm on a call they can barely hear me or it sounds like I‚Äôm far away. Other than that when it actually works it‚Äôs good.
Everything that was offered within these Beats headset was ok. Except there was no wirelessly connection to a couple of piece of my studio equipment. So I will return them and go back to the ole school way with plugNplay types of headphonesor headsets.
The sound quality is subpar for this amount of money. It would also be more accurate to say noise muffling instead of canceling. Returned they will be.
"I was really excited to find these Beats Studio Pros on sale ($160) for a Christmas gift to myself, but after testing them, I‚Äôm unfortunately returning them. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown:PROS:- Aesthetics: These are some of the best-looking over-ear headphones I‚Äôve seen. The sandstone color is a gorgeous, cool-toned neutral & looks even better in person.- Apple Integration: They pair seamlessly with Apple devices, just like AirPods. I loved being able to toggle noise-canceling and transparency modes right from the volume panel on my phone.CONS:- Fit: These are TIGHT. I‚Äôd say I have an average-to-large head, and the ‚Äúcranial compression‚Äù is too much for comfort. The ear cups squeeze hard enough to give me a headache after an hour.- Weight: They felt noticeably heavy during use.- Sound: My biggest disappointment. The sound is flat, with almost no bass. I‚Äôm no audiophile, but I honestly preferred listening through my phone‚Äôs speaker over these.OVERALL:I wanted to love these, but the tight fit and disappointing sound quality were dealbreakers. I‚Äôll be looking for a better pair for everyday use!"
"Here is my personal experience with these headphones.I have never owned a pair of Beats before but I had always heard good things, so I was excited and looking forward to good quality.I had some issues connecting and the noise cancelling is not as good as Apple's Airpods if you know what I mean. I am on the train and can hear so much while noise cancellation is on. And for some reason they have never been able to connect well with my MacBook. The audio is terrible and sounds like a broken record. The design/shape of the headphones pick up the sound of wind very easily. I walk through the city and the fall breeze will echo while wearing these headphones.I am kind of bummed and was looking forward to these. I think the final thing that is pushing me towards returnhing them is that my hair keeps getting pulled out by the flexible over ear pads. Everytime- no matter how my hair is done it seems to get caught in the creases.That is my personal experience."
They aren't working but it says that the Bluetooth is connected üòë I don't know what's going on with them.
"I have older Bose headphones and they just have a better feel than these ones. I use these in the office and the Bose are just more comfortable and the Beats felt very hard on my ears and head. The return process through amazon was terrible. This item was not eligible for store drop off so you have to bring it to a UPS store. It took several days to arrive at its destination. I waited and waited for the credit to appear. Nothing. The expected refund date suddenly moved back over a week for no reason, even though amazon had received the item for 5 days already. I had to pester them harshly on chat twice (taking over an hour) for them to issue me the refund. The first person said it would be credited within 24 hours but that was a lie, and I had to chat again and demand it be refunded immediately (it had now been 2 weeks since I shipped back the order). I finally got the refund but do not trust amazon easy returns anymore."
"They're alright. The sound is decent, it's comfortable, and looks good. But the noise canceling is horrible imo."
"Right earbud sounds fantastic. Left earbud has a weird buzzing/vibrating sound. It's not super bad, so I don't care enough to go through the trouble of returning it and getting a replacement, but the sound quality is definitely not as good as I would have hoped for earbuds at this price range. Otherwise, they are comfy to wear and the sound cancellation works great!"
"I've had to return my first pair because of static noise while using ANC or Transparency mode, which apparently is a common issue with no at-home fix. The replacement has been doing alright although transparency mode sometimes makes weird noises.The fit is tight but it can make a sensitive scalp hurt. Earmuffs are not the most comfortable around but easily wearable for a couple of hours.Lastly, if you're not using a case to carry them, the headbands paint starts to peel rather easily, which completely ruins the appearance of the headphones; could blame it on not taking care of them, but then again there are other similarly priced headphones with better quality coatings/plastics."
"I‚Äôve had 3 pairs of Beats headsets in my life and loved them. I was super excited for this new version. I ended up disappointed. The sound was just ok. The headset was heavy. The color was beautiful. But, sadly, I returned them after 1 day. The weight, just ok sound, and the big Price just didn‚Äôt make sense."
"So, I had beats years ago and remember the volume and sound quality being great so I thought to loop back around to try them again but I'm thoroughly disappointed.I love some deep bass and I also love loud volume, but my headphones delivered neither. I will say, the noise canceling capabilities are pretty amazing. I had a vacuum running beside me and couldn't hear it. However, the fit wasn't true over the ear in my opinion. They arrived 46% charged and lasted hours so that's nice and they look as pictured, if not a big smaller in the ear cuff than I expected. The connection was quick and easy and the controls are simple, no issues there. Just not what I was looking for, I'll be returning."
Sound isn‚Äôt terrible but I expected better especially after trying some of the competition in the same price range. Beats aren‚Äôt as good as they used to be. Build quality isn‚Äôt as good as the old ones by Dre. Feel pretty cheap for what they cost.  Battery life and Bluetooth range is excellent though
"For an item that retails at $350, I expected good quality & crisp sound. The amount of disappointment is at an all time high. The airpod pro 2 i own sound so much better than these. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone waste time buying these. Just get a $20 pair bc that‚Äôs what these sound like."
"I was excited to get my first pair of Beats, but in the end, I returned these headphones. They are just... underwhelming. The comfort and functionality are fine, but the sound quality (which is the point of buying over-ear phones) is absolutely mid. Remarkably unremarkable. Definitely not worth the $300 price tag."
Noise cancelling = 4.5/5 blocks out enough noise to be super useful on a plane full of childrenSound quality = 5/5Connectivity = 5/5 connects to my iPhone or iPad quickly.Comfort on ears = 2/5 It‚Äôs comfortable but definitely creates a seal around your ear making it really hot even when on a cold airplane.
"Love these headphones but they definitely weren‚Äôt made with long haired people in mind. If my hair is not completely tied back when using these it is impossible to get them off without pulling hair out of my head or hair breaking as I am removing them. Even if I am removing them very slowly and intentionally, it‚Äôs such a problem that I avoid using them now. Also, they sag down and press on my jaw even though they are on their smallest setting because I am a petite woman with a smaller head. This begins to hurt after an hour or two use of them. Again, great sound quality but not ideal for smaller heads and long hair."
It has no bass at all
Not as loud as I thought.
"Sounds great, low quality plastics"
"I don‚Äôt know if these are broken or what. They sound okay, no one can hear me over the phone. Listening to music is fine.My sonys sound much better and have more settings. I just wanted to try these bc they‚Äôre Apple."
Buy this when a deal comes and don‚Äôt buy the expedited shipping
There's long reviews out there but let's cut to the chase if you're on the same lookout for noise cancelling headphones like me. Do not get these to focus on readings/ assignments. The noise cancellation for that purpose will not suffice.
"I purchased these in hopes they would outperform my jam transit headphones. Boy was I wrong! These things are not loud enough for use with my iPhone, I listen to Metallica and I love to hear the drums thunder in and the rhythm guitar you should hear the chords clean and crisp with vocals standing out from the rest. These beats did none of that! My jam transit headphones for $60 put these beats headphones to shame. The beats headphones just sounded like I was listening to music on Walkman headphones from 1991. I messed with all kinds of settings and EQs but it just made the problem worse. I am deeply disappointed in these headphones. I could not justify that amount of money for subpar performance, I thought I would be listening to metallica in theater sound with thundering bass and crisp guitars and vocals; not even close. Sent them back"
"I‚Äôm honestly disappointed because I was really excited for these headphones but there‚Äôs no noise cancellation and tbh they aren‚Äôt the most comfortable around the ears and head, kind of stiff. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre worth $350."
"These sound great, but they're super tight (and I'm pretty petite), and constantly pull my hair out if it's down so I only use them with a bun or ponytail. But if you're bald, godspeed!"
"Bought these at 50% off, which is what they should cost. They're comparable to other studio headphones at the same price point as them at half off. Buying at full price is just paying for the brand name. They're comfy, they sound good, and, for the sale, they were a good buy"
"Beats Studio Pro! I purchased these headphones for Christmas last year and was extremely happy with the sound quality of my new headphones. Since my purchase of the headphones, they have been working quite well, and the build has held up well for the past few months, but suddenly, when I was taking my headphones off, I noticed that a piece of the headphone began to crack. I just went on minding my business, and a few days later, the piece fully fell off as I was putting my headphones on. For headphones this pricy, I didn't expect the build quality to allow for the plastic to break off so easily. I'm not going to wholeheartedly blame the company, but it does disappoint me that these broke regardless. It's much too late for me to get a refund now, so just be wary when using the headphones."
"Great for audiobooks and other listening activities. However, the Bluetooth keeps dropping connection while on phone calls or online remote calls like zoom. There‚Äôs no chime/tone indicator letting you know it drops connection until you realize no one is responding and the call is back to your phone or laptop. Missed my return window. What a struggle for the price."
"Battery drains quickly, even when not in use. It should have a better automatic power-saving mode. It‚Äôs uncomfortable after a while, even when adjusted to your size. The sound quality is nothing special‚ÄîI‚Äôve experienced better."
"I‚Äôve used Bose for a long time now, with my last pair holding out for nearly a decade, but I noticed recently that the noise cancelling wasn‚Äôt what it used to be. I liked the color options and had heard good things about the Beats, so when Amazon had them on sale, I thought I‚Äôd give them a try. These honestly weren‚Äôt worth even the 50% off price. They were pretty, but the case doesn‚Äôt open fully, the headphones themselves were overly heavy and stiff, and the sound quality was overly heavy on the bass. The worst was the noise cancellation- even with it turned on and my music playing, I could hear every word of a family member‚Äôs nearby telephone conversation who was sitting in another room- and they were simply talking at a normal volume. I‚Äôm going back to Bose."
"I'm sure there have to be reviews that point this out, but I guess I didn't dig deep enough: these headphones aren't compatible with desktops or laptops that run on Windows. The microphone simply doesn't work. You can Google and find many, many users having the same issue. I bought these to record training videos for work, but since the microphone doesn't work, they are useless for my needs. I'm so disappointed to now know this is a known issue but yet nothing in the product description mentions it."
"On PC, while playing games the audio sounds cloudy, but otherwise works. Not as bassy as hoping, good noise cancellation. Hair gets stuck on it alot though."
"Well, I gave into ordering these as many of the videos I've seen about these vs the AirPods Max have said that these sound similar and close to the AirPods Max, this sounds great if you aren't in the Apple ecosystem knowing that the Airpods max were designed for apple device users, and knowing how apple products fall apart when not in their ecosystem I held back from ordering those. Then Apple made these, it seemed like Apple had made an airpods Max for the android users. However that could be far from true, Apple did what they did best, create a product that is slightly worse in order to not kill off their main product such as the AirPods max, considering how there is a big price difference I guess it makes sense corporation wise but not good for the consumer, it just shows how apple is more focused on making money and holding back features for other things. Compared to the actual airpods max these sound... Quiet, isolation is meh, and transparency mode is subpar and highly sensitive to wind noise. Meaning if you want to use transparency mode in a windy area then, have fun I guess. Now moving on to the USB C lossless mode, Amazing! But I ordered wireless headphones, not wired. If I wanted great audio with being wired to my laptop then I would have done so. The three EQs available go in this ranking, Entertainment mode, Conversation mode, and Beats signature sound mode. Now the reason why the entertainment EQ is way better is because it makes the headphone 2x louder, fuller, and more rich than Bluetooth listening, Not even 100% volume in Bluetooth comes close to 60% volume in usb-c mode. But as I said, I bought wireless headphones, not wired. Now for the ""signature beats sound"" A flippin' joke! They get so quiet, dull, and almost even a huge joke that they advertise them as signature beats sound. I have used the beats solo 3's before and saying that their tuning in that mode is ""signature"" what a joke. Returning these for how sub-par Apple has designed these. For their price point apple could have done WAY better. If you are in the Apple ecosystem, save the extra money for the AirPods Max, they may drop in price when they release the 2nd generation. For now, I would say these are worth 200$ MAX. If you are not in the Apple ecosystem, save your money, and order the Sonys or Bose headphones, that's what I plan on doing. Thanks apple, this is why I left your ecosystem in the first place.Update: I lowered the stars review because I ordered the newest Sony wh5000 Or something like that and wow, those blow these out the water. How disappointing it is that apple designed this product the way it is and still charges you an insane amount for them. Noice cancellation on the Sony headphones are way better, the sound is more immersive and the transparency is great. Has way more features than the flaming hot garbage apple made with this. Maybe next time apple, or never as seeing they love milking the population with subpar product for maximum profit :/."
"Bought these on a Prime Day deal. Thought I was buying new and when they arrived, the packaging looked new. But when I paired them, they had someone else‚Äôs name! (‚ÄúSuzanne‚Äôs Beats Studio Pro‚Äù) So, was I sold a used pair as a Prime Day deal?  The sound is amazing and the fit was good so I have no complaints with the product on that basis but I‚Äôm only giving 3 stars because I can‚Äôt reconcile how someone else‚Äôs name would be on MY headphones when Ipaired them."
"Update after a month of useI like this unit more than I did initially.While it‚Äôs not as powerful as some of its competitors, it does shine in several categories.This unit really excels in smaller spaces. It really does well when it‚Äôs placed in a corner. It‚Äôs 360 degree sound profile uses the walls to bounce and project sound, using the corner walls as a pseudo speaker cabinet. Sound is much richer used this way.Portability is also a key ingredient. Size and form factor plat a big part. The ‚Äòkiller feature‚Äô is the handle. I know that sounds dumb, but it is really, really useful.The lithium ion battery is also a monster. Took this to the beach, boating and back to a bbq, and only used 25% of the battery life after a full day of activity.The Bose Connect app is what everyone else should aspire to. No gimmicky features. Start it up, connect to your paired device and then stream whatever audio you want from any app.The unit supports multiple people connecting to it simultaneously via Bose Connect so no more ‚Äòwait while I un-pair‚Äô so a friend can play the next song.I‚Äôve also found this is a great audio pairing option for laptop and desktop audio. Much better sound quality than stock speakers, wireless Bluetooth  freedom. Our old 27‚Äô‚Äô iMac is in the guest bedroom and we paired this to create a simple audio video system that works quite well for when guests visit.I also use the device occasionally when we golf.When I tested it out at the beach, sound quality was average to good and loudness was enough that we found ourselves constantly turning it down so as to not offend people nearby.Previous review points (below) still apply. Probably would boost it a star if it were cheaper. $300+tax is a big bite for a device of this size. I will keep the unit. I did decide to keep the unit, but mostly just because I can afford to do so.Purchased this unit based upon a ton of positive reviews. Bose clearly took a page out of the Apple design playbook. Very well designed. The handle is a simple, yet awesome feature. The unit is a lot smaller than the pictures depicts.Top quality packaging, and simple setup make using this a breeze. Requires the Bose Connect app from the App Store. The device is primarily intended to be paired to a mobile device or tablet. Skip the Bose opt in (as if we need yet another account and more emails, kthx)Here‚Äôs the rub:While this is an interesting Bluetooth device, it‚Äôs a VERY expensive device. By comparison I paid about $50 more for a HEOS 5 that blows this out of the water in terms of sound quality. While the HEOS isn‚Äôt portable, the bar is pretty high.Overall sound quality is ok, not amazing. Lots of mid range and treble. Bass is present but it‚Äôs not very pronounced. ‚ÄòAcceptable‚Äô but not great.Overall volume output is good, but it‚Äôs not sensational. You‚Äôre not going to throw any keggers or raves. I suspect a small to medium sized group of people wouldn‚Äôt enjoy this very much if they were super talkative of having a lot of fun. I think for lounging on the deck it would be fine. I question whether this unit would be very good for outdoor use. It just doesn‚Äôt have the oomf power to produce enough volume, and I suspect sound quality would be a lot less also.It‚Äôs definitely not a home stereo replacement.Overall 3 stars. Good, not great. If it was $150 it would get another star.For the money involved, you should be able to get some kick $&@ equipment. This unit is decent, but severely overpriced. You‚Äôre paying for the Bose name and a big lithium battery. My daughter‚Äôs Bose Soundlink color puts out almost as much wattage and better Bass at 1/3 the cost.I don‚Äôt think that I can justify keeping this unit for what it cost.ProsGreat form factorHandle!Easy setupSuper long batteryGood soundApp connectConsPriceSound quality could be a lot betterVolume limited - easy to cap outNo sound shaping controls"
It connected to my iPhone very easily but can not get it to connect to my Alexa and my internet. Very frustrating!
I was expecting a way better product from Bose. Paid way too much money for a speaker that doesn't get that loud. I usually love their products. Totally bummed with this one
"I purchased this Bose bluetooth speaker because it is a top name brand. Although the sound quality is good, the website description stating that the battery life is 17 hours is a complete falsehood! I played the speaker for 4 hours ( not at a high volume ) and I received the message that the battery was low and needed charging. It has the same battery life as my much less expensive bluetooth speakers."
I bought a boss black speaker a week  ago and I like it but the price go up from 205 to 299 I now for white color I think is not fair as a customer!!!
"Bought 2 of these after reading you could pair them for party mode and/or stereo. I had no interest in a single speaker, I already had an altec lansing for that(though the sound is inferior to these). Unfortuntely, the first thing I tried to do was use the Bose Connect App I down loaded before i even got the speakers. Followed the ""intuitive"" instructions and had no problem pairing with each speaker seperately, but to pair two speakers, either for party mode or stereo(you have to be in party mode to intiate stereo) you HAVE to use the Bose Connect App to go into party mode/stereo. It's been 2 weeks and used at least  different devices, and I have only managed to get into party mode twice, SO THATS A HUGE FAIL considering the price I paid to be able to pair two speakers!!!!! It's also a HUGE FAIL on the lack of fast charging in 2023/24!!! The sound on these are good for the size, but if they are lacking the most, it's bass, so a seperate subwoofer option would be a nice addition, IF YOU COULD BUILD EQUIPMENT THAT COULD ACTUALLY PAIR WITH OTHER UNITS WITHOUT FAULTY SOFTWARE TO CONTROL IT FIRST!!!!!! Disappointed in Bose. I have owned a lot of Bose products over the years and through out most of them, Bose stood head and shoulders over most competitors with well built, well crafted, industry standard products, but it's always disappointing when a well trusted brand sells you an inferior product, whether it's material, workmanship, design, or software or all of the above. It sucks when you have 2 of the exact same speakers, but you can only listen to one at a time and the only option you have is to struggle to get the manufacturers app to actually do what it's supposed to be created for. DON'T BUY THIS SPEAKER OR ANY OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS IN THIS SERIES THAT RELY ON THE BOSE CONNECT APP IF YOU WANT TO PAIR SPEAKERS!!!!! IT'S NOT WORTH IT. THESE WERE NOT A CHEAP MISTAKE."
Good speaker until the charger plug stops working. We enjoyed it for three years. Plan for no more than that life. But disappointing.
"Its not a good speaker at full volume and you need a decent space for acoustics to get the best sound out of it. I think maybe i was expecting more for the price. If you want something small and compact that has a decent sound to it this is for you. Right out of the box it sounds great at low to mid volume but after that it kind of gets distorted. You can turn the bass down on your phone and it wont do that but kind of defeated the purpose of why i wanted a bose speaker in the first place. if thats what i gotta do then should've just went with JBL or some other brand. Honestly for the price i think there are better options depending on your sound preferences. I like loud with bass and clarity, a hard combination to get right yes i know but thats my preference. The bose color speaker i had didn't have that problem so i had expected more."
"Good, with minor scratch at the near bottom. Bought as new though. But sound is amazing."
"I bought the smaller Resolve II for a $130. It‚Äôs nice. It‚Äôs petite (about the size of a beer bottle). It only supports a single connection to a bluetooth source. I THOUGHT (incorrectly) that it‚Äôs larger sibling Resolve II + might act as a master to allow multi pod simultaneous play. It does not. ‚Ä¶and yet it‚Äôs MORE THAN $200 EXTRA.What do you get for that +$200?1) a slightly larger speaker (1.5 beer bottles);2) a slightly larger battery;3) a string handle;4) a 5v wall wart.A $15 value!!!Now, what will you pay?+$200? Shame on you Bose!Buy the cheaper sibling OR buy an Apple or similar equivalent (which DO support grouping / simultaneous / synchronous play).The Bose units are battery powered (a useful feature). But a charging stand is $20 extra (not included).Update: I stand corrected. You CAN combine multiple units into ‚ÄúParty Mode‚Äù. The documentation that came in the box didn‚Äôt describe this feature. It also has nothing to do with the type (size/cost) of Revolve."
"I have many Bose products, but was disappointed with this speaker. The Bose SoundLink Flex has more power and better sound...for half the price. I loved the appearance and size, but sent back."
"seems like Bose products were better before as far as the sound quality (the first identical item i purchased broke when it fell and so i purchased this replacement, but it does not sound as crisp as the previous one)."
"I loved this when I bought it in December.  I had other bluetooth speakers outside on the porch about 10 feet away from my hot tub that worked for a long time but didn't sound good.  I bought this because it sounded great and Bose says ""Durable, water-resistant design. You‚Äôre not afraid of a little water. Your speaker shouldn‚Äôt be either. SoundLink Revolve+ II‚Äôs water-resistant design means you can use it more places without worrying about an accidental showering of water, like by the pool or by the kitchen sink.""Then 3 months later it would no longer charge.  I tried everything Bose recommended to get it working and nothing worked.  I then sent it back for repair.  I got an email saying ""We regret to inform you that the product you have sent us for repair is not‚ÄØserviceable due to water damage.‚ÄØ We would like to offer you the option of a comparable replacement product at a 30% discount. Please call our customer service team to discuss‚ÄØthis option."" I presumed this meant their website is false advertising.  I am sure some rain fell on the speaker, but it is not supposed to kill the product.  When I called I got someone who was frankly incoherent and very frustrating.  They were telling me when the return was received it was in a plastic bag full of dirty water.  Obviously I did not ship it that way.  They told me you should not submerge the speaker.  I never submerged the speaker!  Therefore, I assume UPS dropped in it water on the way there.  They said I had to contact UPS and have them send Bose an email.  This takes 3 weeks.At this point I don't want to waste money on buying another Bose product that may fail if I use it outside. I don't ever want to have to deal with their incoherent support.  I will be looking for a replacement, but it probably won't be Bose"
"Why are you still using the old USB CHARGER! Great product, great sound, but Bose is using old USB technology! Frustrating! Perhaps to make us buy the wireless charger?"
"The sound is good. Maxed out, it did not distort at all. Snares sound nice but bass a bit muffled. Mids were there but were not overly impressive. According to the manufacture date, this speaker was built a month ago. How in the world is there no USB C - an almost universally used plug in the US. And the app - completely useless for sound frequency control. If my earbud app can have an equalizer, why not my Bose speaker. Seems cheap by a supposed preeminant high fidelity speaker producer. I'm speculating that they are probably saving money using outdated components and useless in-house app programmers.I ended up going with a Sony SRS XG300. Mostly because it has what the Bose didn't - a useful app that has an equalizer and a USB C power cord.Who cares if you can link the speakers if the sound is mediocre."
"The sound is good enough although likely too expensive for the sound.  It's small and light weight and has reasonable bass for such a small thing.Bose Music app is not working with it.  The bose sound touch app doesn't work.  Only the Bose connect app works.  Why does Bose need three apps or likely more (talking smart phone).  Just have one app that works with everything.  It's confusing otherwise.  It doesn't appear to have wifi so it doesn't work with Alexa in terms of turning it on and off.  Yes it can connect to anything blue tooth or with a direct 3.5 mm jack. (echo devices have these things).I spent an hour trying to connect to Alexa via the few Bose skills in Alexa but they didn't work.  Likely because there is no-wifi?Below is from the description misleading because Alexa can't control the device.---Or connect the speaker to an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, like the Echo Dot, for even more hands-free control of your music."
"I received a brand new speaker that initially charged just fine. Now, after the return window is closed, I plug it in and nothing. I‚Äôve tried different outlets, different charging cables, different charging blocks, even different rooms. This happened once early on. I was able to factory reset it to get it to charge, and I assumed (wrongfully) that the issue would not happen again. Now it won‚Äôt even power on. I know Bose usually stands by their products, so I‚Äôm hoping I can exchange it for a working unit."
"I bought two of these to use in stereo mode, so I'd have nice separation in my music/home theater situation. When they're set up and connected properly, they sound awesome. But the process of setting up stereo mode is a pain in that it involves grabbing both speakers, hitting buttons EVERY TIME you want to use them in that mode. Why don't they stay in the last mode chosen? It's ridiculous that I have to physically link them every time I want to use them! Seems like a simple software upgrade. I can't imagine why they haven't done it. Returned."
I compared them side by side and my original Revolve sounds so much richer. also the battery doesn't last as long. what happened???? isnt it supposed to be an improvement. i'm sending it back
"I bought 2 of these speakers to take advantage of a stereo experience. Fortunately, the sound experience, especially mid-range and bass are superb, as I would expect from a Bose product.HOWEVER, the software experience/app is abysmally bad. The app has no recall of prior settings: in order to listen, the app requires fresh, new pairing of both speakers, with random assignment of Left and Right channels (no option to exchange channels on app!) Then, the pairing drops after no input for several minutes. The process then has to be repeated. One would expect better software from such a prominent company. I have a pair of 10 year old Libratone speakers that function in stereo seamlessly. Bose should its act together!"
"I had previously had a Bose Soundscan that worked well so I upgraded to this model.  It worked for nearly two years and then the bluetooth connection stopped working.  I tried all the recommended fixes, and engaged in far too much troubleshooting for any reasonable person, and nothing has worked.  For it to fail less than two years after purchasing is unacceptable.  It seems most reviews are positive but that hasn't been my experience at all so take it for what it's worth.  I do not recommend this product."
"Here is the BAD first:- The documentation is fuzzy and/or conflicting. We had read that it's possible to link 2 OR MORE speakers together. It was important to us because we wanted both indoor and outdoor music.- You can only link 2 speakers, that's all. We bought this one as our third, so a waste of money to us.- Linking and connecting is often difficult and has to be done frequently, so it can be frustrating.- If 2 or more mobile phones are in proximity when connecting, other devices need to have the bluetooth OFF for phone to connect easily.The Good:- Unparalled sound quality that only Bose can do. (This is our 3rd Bose product and the quality keeps improving.)- Great battery life.- Great design."
I like that the battery stays charged for quite a while but that's basically it. I was expecting much better volume from a Bose product. Another thing I am experiencing is the blue tooth connectivity. It's spotty at best. I cannot recommend this product with a clear conscience. Very disappointing for me.
"I had the prior model to this unit; within a year, it would no longer charge, whether with the cord, or the saucer. When I contacted the company, I was told to send it in. It was gone for a few weeks; I was told that the issue was with the port within the speaker itself. They had been having issues with this particular unit. They gave me back a ‚Äúfixed‚Äù one, which worked for a couple of more months, then the same problem returned. I saw they had a new model (this one), so I bought it, thinking they had fixed the common problem they said they knew about. Well, it seems they haven‚Äôt. It‚Äôs been less than a year, and the charging port in the speaker will not connect with any charger to charge the unit. It flashes as if connected and charging, but it doesn‚Äôt make any sound when it connects to the charger, and says it‚Äôs not charged even after charging for hours. I‚Äôve tried other cords and the same issue occurs, so I know it‚Äôs the same problem with the unit as with the prior model. I use it daily for work, so I don‚Äôt have weeks to wait for Bose to send me a ‚Äúfixed‚Äù one. The sound quality is absolutely great when the unit actually works, but please don‚Äôt spend this much money for something that you won‚Äôt be able to use for longer than a year. It‚Äôs not worth it."
The sound quality and battery life are very good. But if you want to link speakers it‚Äôs a cumbersome process that usually takes multiple attempts and often turns off the streaming audio. If you connect to a tv there is an audio delay which makes it not worth it. Considering the cost I was expecting better from Bose.
Ok sound quality. Love the 360 speaker setup. Bluetooth had trouble connecting on several occasions. Should probably be less expensive for what you get.
"Maybe mine is broken I will test more tomorrow but... Very quiet when compared to the Megablast, Bose old version. Also the battery died after maybe 4 hours of not even consistent use. Most likely will return.Update: Even at only half volume it will only last about 6 hours. On full it's about 4. The device literally loses power when on full volume and plugged in, The only reason I can think that they didn't put a USBC plug on this thing is so they could sell you another charger, USBC would fix the charging issues. I can only assume the advertised battery life is for very very low volume.I've been a big fan of Bose ever since I was given a pair of those white and black twisty corded earbuds back about 10-12 years ago. And I was a huge fan of the megablast, but this is a massive letdown. And due to the hassle of the return, I probably won't return it. I will just stop being a Bose customer."
"For such an expensive speaker, you would think the app would have a basic functionality like an EQ.This speaker is incredibly bass heavy, which i'm sure some people like. However, such a characteristic speaker should have the ability to adjust EQ levels by frequency. The mids and highs are very muffled and the bass is too boomy for my taste. $300 and bose can't include an eq in their app? that's laughable. Horrible product"
Battery life isn't what they say
Sound quality just OK for the price point (not a stereo speaker) and doesn‚Äôt connect to the Bose Music app. Requires the old Bose Connect app. I ended up returning it.
"The sound is pretty goo but, I expected a bit more from Bose. I have two of them and they tend to unlink randomly while I'm in the shower so thats no fun. The worst part is the battery life. Its absolutely atrocious. Supposedly they last up to 12 or 15hrs but no. They die after maybe 6 or 6hrs. It gives u a notice of 30% battery left and that only lasts for like 20mins. My sony speakers will give you a solid hour of battery from 30% and they are half the price so im not impressed at all."
"When I first started using the product everything was fine and then just as one month ended, it will not remain connected to any phone.  The connection keeps on dropping.  I even tried the Bose connect app and the response is 'error, try again'.  I just missed the 30-day window to return it. I am so disappponted."
The speaker looks nice and build quality seems great.However we were surprised at the poor quality of the sound. Also even at max volume it‚Äôs not loud.
"Within two months of my original purchase, this unit was sent back to Bose for repair as it would not take a charge.  The repair was completed quickly and returned without issue.  Now, within the warranty period, the same issue has recurred, and Bose has had my unit with them for nearly two months without any resolution besides 'we are waiting on parts'.  I asked for a replacement unit, which they declined to offer to me.While historically, the Bose products which I've purchased have been  of high quality, I must express my disappointment in both quality and customer service for this purchase"
"Have now used 3 days in a row, Battery life has been @5.5 hours, vs the advertised up to 17 hours, material difference.Key Facts:  Battery at 100% down to turning off, requiring charging...Temp: 55-65FLocation: Table Under umbrella on sunny dayBlue Tooth: within 15' of my I-PhoneVolume: 75-85% Max volume3 days in a row of working outside, the battery has died completely under 6 hours every time.I want to love this thing, it is great... But advertised Battery Life up to 17 hours, and reality is under 6 hours....Bose, did I receive a battery Dud or is this more the norm...?"
"I purchased this to use at work. While I would be equally annoyed with this at home, I definitely can‚Äôt use it at work.There is a bug when using the speaker to stream music from my iPhone over Bluetooth.  At random intervals, ever 5 to 10 times I unlock my iPhone, the speaker will raise itself to absolute max volume for about a second while the phone is unlocking before going back to normal.Max volume is loud, very loud!  Loud enough to stop the entire store in its tracks and get the boss running from a different part of our large store to have a word with me.We tried this on a coworker‚Äôs iPhone as well. While not as frequent, he still had the same problem"
Only one connector at a time is allowed.
"I had this speaker for a month and the battery already doesn't hold a charge. I thought buying a more expensive brand meant I was going to get a better product and that is not the case. Of course, when I try to return it, I was 2 days over the return by date. Will not buy this brand again or recommend to anyone! I am so disappointed!"
"I have this one only more than a month, the bluetooth went down. Could not connect to any bluetooth enabled device. I am scientist and engineer, have PhD of Physics degree. I know everything about electric products. Never see anything cost this much money and broken so fast. Don't but it!!!!"
"I took pics but since I DID NOT CHOOSE TO allow access to my PRIVATE PERSONAL PHOTOGRAPHS on my Ph‚Äô Camera‚Ä¶!!!  The add photo does nit allow me to re-access in a Different Manner!!!  Anyhow, There was a Film of Dust as if my Bose Soeaker was being used before I received it‚Ä¶!  Also, Due too, No Charge which Is Unusual as my Friends was Completely Charged‚Ä¶???!  There Was Dust Particles On Speaker, that Plastic Sticky Film that Covers NEW PRODUCTs, that Was On The Top where Control Buttons are Located HAD DUST also ON STICKY SIDE‚Ä¶?!!!  Inside Bose Box and Box‚Äô Outside Had Dents As Well As The Amazon Box‚Ä¶!!!  Where Is QUALITY CONTROL‚Ä¶!!!  Well looking forward to hearing fr somebody re this matter."
"I purchased this Soundlink II, over two years ago.  The first one stopped charging 6 months in.  I sent it in for repairs, they sent back.  Lasted 1 week and it totally failed.  Was sent a (new) replacement, it lasted 8 months and started doing the same thing.  They sat on my nightstand and were used to play background noise for sleep.  Bose has known that these were defective and continue to sell this junk to consumers.  Now I am trying to get a refund and it is like pulling teeth.  I have a $50 Fugoo speaker that is 8 years old, battery lasts for days and it even sounds better.  BOSE is a overrated and overpriced paperweight.  Also to add insult to injury, when you call customer service which I have spent hours on the phone and spoken with no less than 50 people.  Only one could speak clear english.  TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE,  I will NEVER purchase another Bose product again.  I wouldn't even take a free one."
The speaker is great I herd it play at a relatives house.  That is the reason I ordered it.  This was for my husband has hundreds of songs in USB memory and was looking for a nice speaker that he could use when we are camping and away from wifi and reception.  We miss read the description or features and thought it had a port for that.  It didn't therefore I immediately returned it .  I sent back on April 13th.  it shows they received on 4/16.  They keep rescheduling my refund.  this more than $300.00 dollars.  I need it back
"A little bit muddy. I have Bose bookshelf speakers, and love them. Great mid range and upper clarity. Small speakers are often tinny , but this one is kind of boomy and lacks crispness in Voice and Guitar range. Makes a big difference where are you position it, which shouldn‚Äôt be a concern on the $300 item! I‚Äôll keep it, but I‚Äôm not blown away."
I‚Äôve had many Bose  products and I‚Äôve loved them all but this one is extremely disappointing. The sound quality is very poor. My $90 JBL flip 5 sounds better than this $300 speaker.
"The product is good but when I compared with soundlink mini II, it just faired well or just as good as soundlink mini II."
"I bought this to pair with my nebula projector and it wouldn‚Äôt pair. In all fairness it could be a problem with the projector and not with the speaker. It also did not come with an input/output wire to test it wired (I get that it‚Äôs not for that purpose either, but it does have the port). When I played music on it the sounds quality just wasn‚Äôt what I wanted. It sounded scratchy and dull. Will be returning it."
"The sound quality is very disappointing for a Bose speaker. There's definitely better speaker for less out there. We have an UE in the house first gen at that and it has better bass and is louder than this Bose. No base, it's quite loud but definitely not worth the $300 price tag on it. Will be returning and trying out either a 3rd gen UE or the JBL flip 5."
"The connection on the charging station end of the USB cable is faulty and will not stay in the connection.  The cable keeps working its way out due to a poorly connecting socket and unnatural bend they have in the unit where cable goes in (see photo).  I had to duct tape it there to keep it in, otherwise the unit does not charge and speaker is dead when I go to use it somewhere.  I would have expected better engineering from Bose on this."
"Great performance when I first receive it.  Then I started to experience connectivity problems with my different devices (iPhone, iPad & MacBook Pro) despite multiple software updates.Later the sound level dropped drastically.  Still under warranty but Bose didn't follow up as agreed after interacting with their customer service.Highly disappointed and one star is a generous review when considering the price I paid for this item."
"I had to return this item. The Sound was great.The description advertised up to 17 hours battery life. I was getting about 3 on medium volume.The Bluetooth connectivity was ok. It requires an app which is silly. The item also likes to yell at you when you disconnect for many minutes. ""Note 10 disconnected. Ready to connect. Ready to connect. Ready to connect,"" etc. Quite annoying.I purchased a highly rated $38 speaker instead and am pleased."
"I was very disappointed, the sound quality was not your typical rich deep and cristal clear that you usually get with Bose. If you cranked the volume up too high sound would get distorted. I know most speakers do this, but that‚Äôs why I buy Bose because they never had in the past. Also, the speaker still uses micro USB instead of USB C. That being said, The battery life is pretty darn good and the 360 feature works perfectly too."
"Poor customer service. The product came without a charging cable. The purchase was made in November for a Christmas present, Bose said that was too long ago for a claim. When I said it was just opened 2 weeks ago they said go on their website and send them proof. I screen shot my Amazon purchase and went to their website but could not find anyway to send them the info. I was now an hour in, for a $9 cord and gave up. I have 5 other Bose products but this will be my last."
I was expecting more out this speaker as it's BOSE. Not impressed at all. Kinda upset that I paid what I paid for a name instead of performance.
"The BOSE REVOLVE+II STOPPED CONNECTING. Voice says:  BATTERY 100%, CONNECTED TO ""my wifi link name""  ~ Iphone says: CONNECTED to Bose Revolve+II  ~~~ But it DOESN'T CONNECT ~~~ Can't return because it is past the return date after having it for only 78 days.OKAY WAIT!!!  I thought I'd try it again and IT WORKED !!  I don't know why, but it works now. I'll keep you posted if it goes out again. the only thing I think is that the reboot on my iphone that i did awhile earlier kicked in after a 2 hour rest."
"The sound is great. It's very portable. After charging for about 10 hours, sometimes more, it only holds a charge for about an hour. And for a ~$250 product, I expect better than that."
Bose has lost their honor and quality.No more Bose for me.
"Static white noise coming from speakers. Very noticeable (and super annoying) at low volume. Per Bose‚Äôs website, you‚Äôre supposed to check if there is a software update to fix this. I probably spent an hour trying get my phone and computer to connect. Eventually I was able to successfully sync using the app but alas there was no software update. I read that Bluetooth speakers (not specific to this make or model) can sometimes receive static interference from other devices/sources. So I decided to turnoff Bluetooth and connect to my computer using aux but it still had the same static which leads me to believe it is in fact the speaker itself (not necessarily interference). Very disappointed. Needless to say, this is going back in the box."
"This was a bad purchase, and goes to show that a high price does not always equal quality. I got it to pair with my desktop Dell- Windows computer so I could have a wire-free speaker. Well, it fails as that. It‚Äôs glitchy and constantly refuses to pair, especially when using iTunes (Apple is partly to blame). Then it has a mind of its own and says it‚Äôs ‚ÄúReady to connect‚Äù at random times when I‚Äôm not even using it, acting like it‚Äôs possessed. The battery drains so quickly that I end up having to leave it connected to the computer by wire ‚Äî so much for ‚Äúwireless.‚ÄùAnd, the sound is nothing special, when I expected Bose to excel at sound quality. This was a very bad purchase I regret and should have returned, but I wanted to give it a chance."
They don't make an app to run 2 of these in stereo on a PC. The app is quite time consuming to pair 2 speakers on Android.
"Wow. Got these yesterday. Charged them overnight and both said 100% this morning at 9am when I paired them with the Bose Connect app. Had them in stereo mode, not full volume, and they both died at 5pm. 8 hours?  Really???  They did sound great in stereo mode but 8 hours when rated at 17 hours?  No thanks. Returning them."
Other Bose products give more. Wasn‚Äôt very loud and bass was weak. Sound quality itself is crisp. Loved the idea of surround speaker and handle which is what caught my eye.
It runs out of power too soon. After about 2 hours it dies out. I‚Äôm very disappointed!
"When it works it sounds great.After 2 months the battery broke, in that it wouldn't charge.  Support was helpful and took the item back to repair.  2 months later exact same problem.  Bose again took it back and repaired it again.  Same issue a 3rd time.  I would expect better from a Bose product.  The warranty will expire soon at which time there is NO WAY i'd pay for an extended warranty to send it back for repairs every 2 months.  It has become a speaker with a subscription plan"
Just not bass enough bass and loudness kind of disappointed at Bose for this product
"I have a lot of bose speakers and this one disappoints in the power of sound , I have Vizio small speaker I brought from Costco half the price of the bose and it blows bose speaker away with power and sound ,"
"Voice quality of songs is too forward, tinny.  Mids are missing and consequently music content of instruments.  Sending back."
"The speakers sound great but don‚Äôt buy a second one expecting to pair.  That works about half the time. You‚Äôll frequently get an error message saying a speaker can‚Äôt be found, even when you‚Äôre right next to it. Very disappointing!"
I expected better sound. Average person may find them fine.
"I've purchased two of these Bose SoundLink Revolve (Series II) speakers and both of them ended up failing a little after a year. The battery just stops charging and no matter we do, the speaker won't hold a charge. We've tried multiple different cubes, cords, etc. and it makes no difference. Because it's out of the one-year warranty, you have to pay Bose $80 to get the speaker repaired.For as much as these speakers cost, I'd expect a much better product and/or at least a decent warranty program if something goes wrong.Read other reviews and you'll find that others are having similar issues... for some reason the charging just fails rendering the speaker useless."
"I am so tired of power issue for Bose products. I used this speaker daily as the speaker of my laptop. I charged it whenever the battery is about 40%. And, yesterday, it wouldn't charge anymore. I tried all the troubleshooting steps repeatedly, and still didn't work. Then, after several trys, it finally died. :|It would not turn on anymore. Good thing is, it's within 3 months, and still under warranty.Btw, I had a Bose wireless headphone, and it was probably 2 years old. One day, the power just stopped working properly. It turned on by itself, and even if I turned it off, it will turned on again (switch at ""off"" position). Bose products really suck. I will never buy Bose products."
Buy the Minirig 4 it‚Äôs better.
I was completely pleased with this purchase and it lived up to the quality you'd expect from Bose...then yesterday my speaker refused to charge. This also happened with my last Bose speaker after many years of use but I bought this speaker in November 2021! Extremely disappointed with this dud.
The product received didn't have the expected quality...I tested in a store with the same device and show good quality. The one shipped to me doesn't have the same sound quality.
"1 star because the sound is great. Otherwise I was disappointed because I was looking for a speaker that delivers and that you can speak too like a google assistant. You need your phone to ask things for Alexa and google, and the set up is very difficult."
"I have tried all of the tricks, but for some reason this speaker continues to cut in and out.  Very disappointed, especially for the price."
I'd really hope it use usbc and integrate with Alexa
"For Bose, I was really expecting more. The sound seemed just about as good as any Bluetooth speaker that sells for less than $100"
"Bose has been in business for a long time making wireless Bluetooth speakers and in all this time Bose couldn't come up to make an app for an equalizer to adjust and tweak the sound balance. The base kills midrange and treble sounds.If I knew this, no equalizer, I would never buy it. Shame on me - Shame on you Bose!"
Still connects. No sound. Didn't even make it a year. I guess Bose isn't what it use to be
"Terrible terrible sound, jesus christ my divoom tivoo speakers sound better than this crap. For over 200 bux these sound liek 50 dollar speakers. The bass drowns out everything.... Cant even adjust with their app because guess what... THERE APP DOESN'T HAVE AN EQ SETTING! How the heck is that possible for their best portable bluetooth product???"
"About four months in. Stopped. Hanging already. Gave them one more shot after my whole speaker also stopped working and can't seem to get any direct help on either without them wanting to charge me another $200+ to work on them. No longer worth the money, especially when both stopped working and basically spend just as much as a new one, to fix. Seems like another apple gimmick to force upgrading."
The Bose speaker looked like a return. No original packaging. The volume control on it did not work. No sound. I returned it.
Stopped working used maybe 15 times. Buy JBL
"The first 2-3 months are fine and great. But after that, I started to notice there is very annoying background noise when the volume is low. The buzz sound is really irritating and you can not ignore it  which means that if you play quite classical music before sleep is not a good idea with this speaker anymore!"
I have had nothing but trouble with connectivity with this speaker. Multiple restarts of devices. It shouldn‚Äôt constantly be this difficult. Same issue with three different Apple products. If I had to do over I would choose a different manufacturer.
For the price I paid don‚Äôt worth it.Quality of sound when outdoors NOT good.
I've used it a couple of times and I don't like it!  because the battery only lasts at most 3 hours.  I have other speakers that are not branded and they last much longer than this one!  disappointment!!!
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The sound quality did not justify the Price (even on the deal!)  Maybe I had high expectations and this product miserably failed to even come closer. The 2 BOSE sound flex speakers that I have sounded much better in paired or single modes and are value-for-the-money portable speakers. Bose needs to up the sound quality to match the price for these IMO, Also Bass is non-existent on these. Returned!"
"The speaker sounds great, although doesn't get very loud.It is listed as having an 18 hour battery life and mine played about 10 hours at first, now I get maybe 4 hours from a full charge.I do NOT recommend this product for the money!!!"
Good sound but not as immersive as I had hoped.
Sound quality is not as loud as the exact same speaker I have. I bought a second one and not happy with it.
"Used this product for 3 months and it went dead on me, just after the product return window closed.  Good sound, just no longevity.  This is the second one I've used that has failed within a few months.  Would not recomment."
"Not sure what all the rave reviews are all about.  It doesn't sound bad, just not all that better than any other omni-directional speaker.  Try listening to high resolution music through a Sony speaker with LDAC on both devices and then you'll hear the big difference!"
Low sound clarity. Mild to moderate sound muffling.
I am very disappointed in the sound quality especially considering the price. The older Bluetooth speakers by Bose sounded so amazing (ie soundlink mini II) by almost half the price.) The design is very beautiful however (love the handle) and the battery life excellent (17 hours).
Bluetooth kept dropping connection. Had the latest firmware but still didn't help. Found out other people were having the same issue on the forum. Returned it because it's frustrating listening to music that randomly stops due to flakey connection.
Couldn't control the volume. Sent it to Bose. They fixed it and sent it back. It worked for a few months and now won't work at all. Won't turn on. Such a pain and a waste of time and money.The update to this is that I sent the speaker back to Bose for a second repair and they lost it. I don't have the UPS receipt so they are offering me 50% of my next purchase from Bose. A real zero star experience.
"Soon after I purchased this for my husband and me, the display went blank. We don‚Äôt have kids and take good care of our things, so it was surprising. We had used it only a handful of times before we had to pay $70 to get it opened and repaired. The repair shop informed us that it had been refurbished prior to our purchase. I may have missed it, but I can't find anywhere in the listing that mentions it was refurbished."
The device showed up and worked perfectly other than it not being able to connect to the Tv. The company sent a new dock right away. But still not able to connect to TV.
"Took forever to receive, Everything was in Japanese, instructions were in Japanese, no idea what goes with what, had to pay $.50 to set up account with parental controls. Lot of Hassle for a simple gaming system. Nothing like what it used to be to be. Miss the simplicity of the gameboy."
I am upset about the fact that it has Japanese instructions and and it was not fully charged when it was arrived plus also had to give a code to the delivery driver The switch turned on ok everything seems to be alright but it does look used When I made sure I purchase a brand new one for my son for Christmas just a little disappointed about this product I feel i should let others know what to expect
I usually have to play around connecting and disconnecting the Internet
"The switch worked, but the instructions were all in Japanese, making it a guessing game as far as set up. Luckily they let you choose your language when you set it up, but we weren‚Äôt sure at first what we got and if it was the real deal. It seems to work fine though."
Did not come with English instructions very frustrating
"We purchased these for our sons in May. Out main reason for these were for traveling in the car. We were never able to use them in the car, they would not recognize either mine, or my husbands phones??? We are not tech savvy at all!! But my brother in law is an IT guy and couldn‚Äôt figure it out either. Thankfully I was able to return these‚Ä¶they were not cheap! These were a gift for my son‚Äôs 10th birthday. Also, one of the devices was opened when it arrived. At the time I thought nothing of it. But later figured out the charger was missing. I‚Äôm sure these will work for someone, but didn‚Äôt work out for our family. They are very cool looking devices! Just wish they‚Äôd have worked out for us!"
"The product seems to work as it should. However, I received a unit that is marketed for another country. Had to use Google translate in order to set it up.  So I will only give 2 stars for that. I purchased an American product through an American store and received a unit from another country."
"It arrived in good condition but shipping was a nightmare, it kept getting delayed and I even saw the delivery driver stop but turn around and leave before delivering, I had to go into the warehouse just to pick it up, but other than that it was good."
"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. Received it in December and it ran fine until mid-February when it just stopped displaying to the TV (the same TV we have used multiple times before, with no issue). The console also would not charge or connect to the dock, but charged on the power adaptor just fine. Tried to connect it to two other TVs to no avail. Tried using another dock and it still would not connect. I called Nintendo Customer Service and went through some troubleshooting procedures, including the apparent issue with cables needing to be plugged in, in a certain order, which blows my mind that, that could even be an issue with a modern day console. None of the troubleshooting resolved the issue so they set up a repair order and I shipped it ro their repair facility. I finally had it delivered back today and it looks to me like they replaced the power adaptor, dock and console. Same exact issues as before. The console still does not connect to the dock and the dock does not connect to any TV. I even tried a few different HDMI cables, including the one that came with the Switch, and still nothing. The TVs have no issues connecting to the Xbox, PlayStation and PC that is with each of them, so how the Switch struggles, I have no idea. It amazes me that I even have to have all this hassle with a console that hasn‚Äôt even been in our possession for THREE MONTHS.I will be seeking a refund for the console and all the purchases made on the account. With the amount of time and money I have wasted on the Switch, I could have just bought an Xbox or PlayStation that would be better all around. Only nice thing about the Switch is how mobile it is.Incredibly disappointed with the product. Which is odd to say because I used to love the old DS systems.The customer service Reps I spoke with were very kind and as helpful as they could be however.The customer service Reps also let me know that when purchasing a Switch through Amazon, the warranty tied to the serial number on the console does not get activated for some reason. So make sure you register your console if bought through Amazon."
"I got the package and it was all bubble wrapped and I understood that it was a Used but ‚ÄúLike New‚Äù was posted next to it and I expected someone to inspect it before sending it as it had greasy stains and smudge prints all over the screen, I cleaned it off so I could make it look presentable for a gift. Other than that it‚Äôs a great gift and it‚Äôs very fun to use. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend just paying the 300$ for it, test the luck in used products ü§ôüèº"
"The Nintendo Switch is really no different than the Wii U system which was no different than the previous systems other than the fact that they used a cartridge or a disc with different coding.  The Switch now uses a cartridge although much smaller.  The Switch has very few new games for the older generation with most of what is available being retro games from previous platforms or games for children.  In other words the same game on the new platform.  The bad part of the system is the small hand held screen which is the same as the Wii U, about 15 square inches.  Why would anyone play a very detailed game on such a small screen when you can view it on a typical TV screen that is 80 times larger?  The only reason I bought this new system was to play the new edition of my old favorite ‚ÄúZELDA‚Äù.  As an added insult to this system are the ‚Äútiny‚Äù joy con controllers.  I don‚Äôt know what Nintendo was thinking when they designed these but they only fit the hands of children.  I bought the Mayflash Magic-NS2 adapter to use my favorite Wii U pro controller on the Switch system.  Love it.  So if you have the older Nintendo systems with the old games, don‚Äôt throw them out because those same games are what you are going to be paying extra for to play on the Switch."
"Nintendo, aside from Disney, is the most money-hungry company on the planet. So here's some simplified things to consider.1. Expensive hobby.2. Console maintenance and customization is expensive.3. Worthwhile games are all $50+ so budget for that.5. Not easy to customize outer appearance or interface.5. Not many worthwhile games. Just a bunch of filler crap. Not much to choose from.6. Sales are a JOKE!!! $5 off a $65 game is not worthwhile.7. You have to pay additional fees and subscriptions to do ANYTHING worthwhile with the console.8. Console is ridiculously fragile. Not great to travel with and will most likely have to replace after 1-2 years of having it.Overall, I think there are better consoles. I can't get over the money-hungriness. I'm paying $300 for the console, plus ~$10/month in fees to do anything, AND all the games I want to play cost HOURS of my salary? Save your coin."
Weird smell coming from the system box and systemPlaying the system and the damn thing raped the hell outta me!!!! Not good I don‚Äôt want this thing anymore!!! Gotta do something with it really!! Put it back in the box or airThing!!!I feeel like everything is a spidery finger trapüí©üí©
This switch was all scratched up kinda disappointed it works just the screen is scratched and its missing one of the pieces it was supposed to come with
"I am so disappointed with switch. There are few redeeming qualities.The graphics on all the nes SNES era games, the main reason I bought this, are AWFUL. I mean they are WORSE than the original cartridge game graphics.The controllers are not exactly the most responsive or reliable. They're so tiny they hurt your hands to hold.It's pretty awful as a portable system too. Too heavy to hold like a Gameboy for hours, and so skinny it's really uncomfortable to play that way.Shame on you Nintendo, you are better than this."
"The USB-C stopped working on my son's Nintendo after 4 months after purchase. I sent the product in for repair. The technicians made the determination that the USB-C port was subject to physical damage, and the repair was not covered in their warranty.The Nintendo Switch was only charged with the Nintendo brand/supplied power adapter or base station. The technician repair representative told me that the repair could be ""negotiated"" for the work to be completed. When I reinforced that the product was only used within the normal parameters of intended use, the representative got frustrated and hung up on me.If you buy this product, and send it in for any repair, be prepared to shell out money every time Nintendo wants to ""negotiate."" I didn't expect this kind of unprofessionalism from such a well established company."
"The Nintendo Switch itself has worked ok. I am having issues with it not wanting to turn on today, but will come back to adjust review after I have done some troubleshooting. The problem I have with this one is the Japanese charging cord was included in it with the adapter for US. The adapter is loose and won't charge correctly. There were zero instructions on how to use this. I'm not sure that the charger even works (it keeps falling off the wall outlet because of the loose fit of the adapter). It would have been nice to have had the proper charging cable on something I paid $300 for."
Misleading! They changed the page after I complained. It stated that it contained Mario Kart 8 but it DID NOT. There are 2 products side by side that are the SAME price but one contains a download and one does not.
"The switch itself functions fine and was in new condition, however the + side Controller has issues, the A button sticks, and the Joystick on it stutters and pulls randomly, if you set the controller down with a game like Fortnite on, the camera view just goes crazy looking up in one direction then spinning around randomly, it makes it impossible to play most games with the original controllers it came with, and we had to go out and buy a new set immediately for our son to be able to play it.It came on time, mostly as described. The problem was just the right side controller that didn't work, but obviously that was a big problem."
Instruction manual and all other materials are all in Chinese writing
I ordered the US version. I was really excited until I opened the box. Everything was written in japanese. The Everything on the outside of the box. All the instructions were in japanese.  Useless and a total waste of time and money. ..UPDATE.. DROPPED PACKAGE OFF AT UPS TODAY.  AMAZON WILL NOT ISSYE REFUND FOR 30 DAYS  AUGUST 5th. I chose to have refund issued back to my Amazon account as to avoid a lengthy wait for my money.  Nowhere on the item purchase page does iit state that refund may take this long.  I guess thst makes sense because it does not state this is a JAPANESE VERSION of the console.  Absolutely a rip off. Do nor believe the positive reviews. The poor reviews are stating the true situation. Seller is not honest with what they are selling.
Takes 70+ hours for it to download anything. Wife‚Äôs switch doesn‚Äôt though. Just the one I ordered from here.
"I ordered my boyfriend for his birthday a Nintendo Switch, only to get the wrong charger. We can‚Äôt use this charger and there wasn‚Äôt a charger included that works for the US. Other than the issue with the charger, the system works well."
This is my first ever switch its a awesome system love it my only problem is that the battery only lasts a few hours so its always on the charger which makes it kinda lame as a handheld on the move not sure if its all or just the one i got has a bad battery but it be nice if it lasted atleast 8 + hours either way i recommend it.  it is one of the best game systems ever developed pretty ingenious
This is the second one I had to order. The first one came defective and the charging dock was not working. Had some dust as if it was used before. It wouldn‚Äôt connect to my tv. It was my kids Xmas gift so they were sad when they couldn‚Äôt use it. I returned it waited about a week before getting a refund to re order. Once I received the second one I connected it and right away it transmitted signal to the tv.
Had to return but they lost return so didn‚Äôt get to play it
"I bought this at the end of August,Took extremly good care of it, only used to charger that was provided and the battery completely stopped charging!So disappointedBox is also in Chinese and warranty not honored BEWARE!!!!"
We got this for Christmas a couple weeks ago and we consistently have had issues with the controllers. They would just go out randomly and we would have to reconnect. Not a huge deal just annoying. Today one of the controllers is just not being detected at all. For a brand new $300+$50/game console this is a problem. Poorly made cheap plastic.
"i like the features of the product .i like that it can be used on my Tv as well as a portable game . The games selection is great , however , it did nto come with any games laoded . i  had to spend an assitonal $60 just for one game . i woudl at least expect a gamign console to come with at leat one game considerignt hat this costs $299"
"I was certain that I had bought a new one but the one that came was refurbished. It could've been a fluke or a complete accident, but it is a very expensive product that you really don't want to mess around with. Always review what it says you purchased, it may say something different."
I never really do reviews since I've never had issues with used products on Amazon but thought I would leave this here to save someone else from buying. I bought a switched used in very good condition I anticipated it to have some scruffs but still work efficiently. When I got the switch it would crash all the time during gameplay but I thought maybe it was something related to my wifi. I only have one game on the switch and the game's saved data got corrupted twice so I had to start the game over completely. When messaging the seller they suggested to contact Nintendo and Nintendo told me I would need to send it in to be repaired and would cost $$$. When asking for a refund I was denied by the seller as it was past the 30 day window. I felt frustration as I did not anticipate to spend $250+ on something that would last me only a little over a month. MORAL OF THE STORY: Buy devices straight from the distributor and get a warranty.
Nintendo box was put in an oversized box with no air packets. Product itself doesn‚Äôt have any visible damage. I hope it works without issues.
The system  works well. You have to figure  it out yourself.  The instructions  and box is all written  in Chinese
The same day I got the Nintendo Switch I tried to install until the error code 2107-0445 popped up.  It took me hours to search for help.  I created Nintendo account and asked to repair this but no advices were provided.  The repair request would take 10-16 days.  I had to return this product and went to Best Buy to get the same item.  It took me 5 minutes to set up everything and enjoy.Now the return will have to take one whole month. Still waiting.Never buy such product online.  The retail store has the same price.
"I just bought this Nintendo switch for $300 two weeks ago.  Then spent another $180 for 3 games  and the damn switch stopped taking charge after 2 weeks!!!!!  Amazon wants you to call Nintendo and Nintendo wants you to call Amazon.  Nintendo's offer was to send it in for repairs lmao.  If the piece of crap product can't last 2 weeks then no,  I do not want you to fix it and then send me back the same piece of crap.  Replace it with a new one or send me my damn money back...."
"My console is all in Japanese and not English. Plus the box it came in was all banged up since it was a box in another box. I want a refund immediately or replacement that's correct, meaning English not Japanese"
The console is nice. Easy to set up. The remotes however are not good. One of them (the pink one) keep looseling the connection with the main console. Very Annoying.
"I received the Nintendo Switch in an unopened box. Everything looked great until I tried to connect it to the TV dock to play on my TV. The Switch just won‚Äôt show up. I tried every single troubleshooting option provided by Nintendo, I changed the HDMI cable, tried a different screen, changed cable plugging order, but nothing worked. Very frustrating."
"It was very clear that all of the items in the box were brand new except the console itself.The console had a plethora of scratches on the rear (non screen side), in addition to a few scratches on the screen itself.It is obvious that this is a previously returned item that was mixed in with new parts so it could masquerade as a ""new"" console"
"The Switch is neat. It obviously does all the things you already expect from a console that has been at market for years with no short of press. I have no problem with the console itself. However, it is ridiculous that a company as large as Nintendo is unable to ship working devices.For my entire life, you buy a console and it comes with a working controller - whether that was Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft or Sega. So imagine my lack of joy when the red joycon is just completely non-functional out of the box - necessitating an immediate trip to the Gamestop to spend additional money on a completely separate new controller so I can use the device already paid for.For $300 and for a Brand with as much success as Nintendo - completely unacceptable manufacturing standards given that a quick google search will tell you these joycons have issues all the time."
Not sure how to rate the switch looks legit however it's manuels are written in Chinese or Japanese. Was told this was a USA switch. Did return because Nintendo will not repair if something goes wrong with devices that were manufactured in another country.
"When I ordered the product, I expected to get what was pictured. This seems to be a refurbished product that comes with each individual parts packaged separately. There's no manual and there are scratches already on the screen upon opening."
"after 3 months the switch would not charge anymore. in this case you need to go with Nintendo warranty as amazon cannot help. I had to pay the shipment to California , plus 110$ for repairing as they claim the type C connector is not covered by warranty. it costed me 150 dollars... keep in mind when you but it"
I set it up for my tv and it worked for the first time but then when I tried to play the next day it will not connect to my tv. I am very disappointed with this and as a Veteran with PTSD I am not happy with the way it is going right now.
"Product did not light up when it was charged for 12+ hours. Tried my sisters  switch power cord, did not work. Tried different outlets with each charger, still did not work. And of course tried to do a reset which online said to hold down for 15 seconds. Which still did not light up the switch. Returned and bought another used one from the same warehouse. Hopefully will not have any other problems moving forward."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            My daughters waited so long for it but it doesn't work, it turns on and off by itself, it doesn't play well, I paid so much more accessories to finish like this, I hope there is a good solution because I didn't want to buy something cheap to avoid going through that, this is supposed to be the best what's up"
The nintendo switch did not have the joy cons in the package at alllllll. Was super disappointed.
I bought the console brand new‚Ä¶ upon the first use there were issues with the console connection for TV use. Now it has completely stopped working. The product was faulty and there is no options on Nintendo to replace or report. The return window is now closed. Huge waste of money.
I bought it as a gift for someone who likes games only to find out it is rather awkward to use and poorly designed. The games are way overpriced and of poor quality. The graphics in many appear to have been created by a first-level programmer.  You will find much better games on your phone. We returned the item 3 weeks ago and are still waiting for a refund. I would avoid this product because it is not worth the money or the hassle if you need to return it.
"This company makes complete garbage. Everything they sell is complete junk. I got my son the Wii U years ago. RIGHT out of the box the fan didn't work. I had to send it back and it was 2 months before my son got his Christmas present, in February.3 years ago we got the Switch. The first one lasted a good year before the base went bad. Then the charging cord went bad. After that the controllers went bad. A little while later we got the blue screen. We bought a used one and that lasted about 4 months before the screen went bad.This Christmas I ordered a brand new Switch and within hours one of the controllers just stopped responding. Besides that, I have to unplug the HDMI every hour or so because it drops the connection."
It is very bad! I will never purchase online again!
Returned under Asurion as it wasn‚Äôt sensing. They sent it back less the remote. Had to send it back for that reason. They returned again saying the remote was not sent. There‚Äôs no way to know if it‚Äôs fixed bc there‚Äôs no controller. They said I didn‚Äôt send it but that‚Äôs not true. I am waiting for resolution but nothing yet! No one is helping!
Fake item is sent. This is not a. Ew Nintendo switch but a used Nintendo switch lite
"2nd attempt at getting delivered and called to locate delivery and told was broken on delivery and sent back, but no notification of delay so ended up cancelling order. Frustrating!"
"I received this item today and all of the instructions was in chinese.  I could not register it, had to go to Amazon support.  The warranty is even in Chinese no feedback from seller yet"
Has to be restarted regularly due to freezing up. Requires you to set up multiple accounts through Nintendo and Ubisoft. You spend a lot of time waiting for it to load up and in between action. Very money hungry pushing hard for subscriptions and credit card purchases. Wanted me to pay 50 cents to request a kid under 13. And many other money grabbing greedy tricks.
First it wasn‚Äôt packaged as a new one should be my daughter bought one new it was packaged way better and had 3 months free online games also the charger was for another country not the US it came with a very cheap adapter the plug will not stay in it. I had to order one made for the US. This was supposed to be a new unopened Switch it was in excellent condition but I paid the price of a new one for it so I expected a NEW Switch.
"We ordered what we expected to be the standard USA market switch (description didn't say otherwise). Instead we received the European market switch that has the wrong power adapter for US plugs. Inside the switch box was this really cheap plug converter. This thing is cheap beyond belief and as soon as it was plugged in you could hear sparks. MASSIVE SAFETY HAZARD! I don't entirely blame Amazon, I also blame Nintendo for putting this cheap, dangerous adapter inside the box of a switch meant for the European market and sending it to US customers!"
"The dock is horribly scratched on the front, not to mention the back is completely missing the protective panel that goes over the wires. The switch itself is clearly aged, not ‚Äúlike new‚Äù as was listed, with the wireless connections of the Joycons being wildly inconsistent with no diagnosable issue. On top of that, the attachment that allows one to use the joycons like a controller was no where to be found. Don‚Äôt list ‚Äúlike new‚Äù if it simply is not like new."
"First of all, I did not select ‚Äúused‚Äù  and the switch, did not work right out of the box. I kept getting an error code! I sent it back immediately!! My daughter was disappointed. The only remarkable thing was the UPS pick-up from my house! I didn't have to travel to return it."
"This is my second time, and possibly my last, ordering this system via Amazon. This seller was very dishonest with the quality, as it is not brand new, it‚Äôs clearly used, no charger & worn packaging. Amazon needs to do a quality check before shipping items that cost hundreds of dollars."
Everything is fine but the power supply was defective and don't work but I already have another one so we just share mine
This didn't came with a manual so I know not how to set it up for my babies
"Do not buy from this distributer.  I have owned the console and dock for approximately 3 months, and the dock has stopped working.  Contacting Nintendo customer support, I found that I have a console with a Japanese region serial number.  As a result, they are not going to repair the switch, and will most likely replace it.  I'm upset to find this out now because it is making the warranty issues more difficult."
"This item was sold as brand new, but it was not brand new.  The box was in bad shape, and all of the items inside had clearly been removed and used and then put back.  The controllers had scrapes and dark marks on them.  The actual screen had splashes of something?? (food or drink or god knows what) on the front and back of it.  This item should have been discounted and described as an open box product."
"Game looks like it has been used,packagedback up and mailed out.  The box was badly damaged"
Came without the joycons
It‚Äôs been 5 months since I bought it for my son and the volume already doesn‚Äôt work! The left joy con hasn‚Äôt even worked well in months. Very disappointed.
We bought this in July and now we are in mid September and it‚Äôs no longer charging m. Horrible
Barely had this for a year before the battery stopped charging!
"Did not last a month after first use. Dropped while 9yo was playing it. Done. This product either needs to be a lot studier, or it needs to be stationary only. Kids are always picking it up, which means the likelihood of drop increases due to portability. Build quality is too low to be that portable for kids under 10, imho. Even with a carrying case, which we had."
"Opened my box and there was no switch in it, no controls either‚Ä¶. Just the charging and hdmi cords was a birthday gift I‚Äôm very disappointed"
Why the product is nice and my son did enjoy it for his birthday. I in fact did not enjoy being charged twice for the same product that I only order once. 600 plus dollars out of my account for me buying this. No one has tried to rectify the situation therefore I'm stuck fighting with the bank.
The remotes are not working correctly! It‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs not compatible with the Nintendo! I‚Äôm so upset with that. I believe I have bought a new  Nintendo but instead I got one that looks USED as if someone painted on it !!!
Bought this Nintendo for my son for Christmas last year. He had it for a year and now it won‚Äôt turn on again.. not sure why. He hasn‚Äôt drop it or really play with it. Kinda sad about it that‚Äôs only been a year and this already happening
This system is trash.... They sent me a system in a different language. Returned!!
Bought the Nintendo Switch for my children from a small business named gold star tech store‚Ä¶everything about it seems to be working fine into you dock the switch to the docking station‚Ä¶.i do not recommend buying anything from gold star tech store
Just received my Nintendo switch. Can't give review on product performance. It looks as if I was sent a used one. Box was torn and inside looked like something was missing. I'm returning it immediately.
My left joystick didn‚Äôt connect to the system at all. Couldn‚Äôt even set up the console because of it.
"Amazon sends you the Switch with a European power cord. You can‚Äôt use the TV dock without an official Nintendo charging cord, so this is frustrating."
"I always liked Nintendo, but I gotta say this is crap! This is stupid joy con broke two times while playing. Sure I can fix it but I don‚Äôt feel like fixing that easily breaks and so fragile. If I were you don‚Äôt pay 299 for it  But the ps5 instead"
Imagine buying everything for this not to work as it should.Also imagine finding out that an item I bought December 28th 2023 that the warranty for item has expired since September 2023 and I will have to foot the repair bill
Dislike. I bought this in May 2024 and it is July 2024 and it will not turn on.
I ordered a new switch for a Christmas gift and it was already used. Returned it immediately and have been waiting 2 months for my refund. It has been one hassle after the next and I am still waiting
This is a European product and not for use in the U S. It comes with a European cord and not a free upload of Mario Kart. Game was $60.00 and cord was $30 at Walmart.Only info in box was Chinese or Japanese. So dissapointing
"The box arrived full of some type of oil and in poor condition, the Nintendo equally dirty with the same oil and with the screen protector in a mess."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I thought I was buying a new Switch and when it arrived it was a used one with scratches on it. But the price charged was the same as a new one. Super shady. Not happy at all.
The Nintendo switch broke in 2 weeks and I was very carefully with it I didn't drop it once save your money and buy Xbox series s or ps5 don't buy a Nintendo switch they break to fast if Nintendo just made a wired game console like the Xbox series s I'm sure it would of lasted longer
I had to go on youtube to learn how to setup the switch system.
As stated above
Very bad
The right joy stick will not pair to the console.
"Box was all beat up, Nintendo it‚Äôs was not new , box was not even sealed, screen has finger prints on it, very disappointed"
Missing a lot of main games!!!Also the menu is in English but the actual games are in Japanese writing!!!Do not buy!!
Product is terrible. Freezes and hard to navigate menu.
Love the idea‚Ä¶ the things is easy to set up and has a decently easy to use menu. The issue is the game titles are‚Ä¶ bad translations.. to make it worse some games are actually the Japanese versions so you can‚Äôt play them unless you know how to read Japanese‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd rather a game still with 1k or even 100 good ones.
